Our Daily Method # 19 : Time # method_missing
Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
Our stock of cool tricks is depleted , but inspiration still strikes once in a while .
Are you using strftime a lot ?
Do you like writing strfime ?
Have you ever spelled it as strtime ?
strf_time ?
Thought it was frmtstr ?
And if you spell it right , you still have to type those stupid %- signs .
All in all , room for improvement .
class Time def method_missing ( name , *args ) if name. to_s =~ /f_/ c = args [ 0 ] || ' ' x = name.to_s [ 2..-1].split(//). map {|f| f =~ /[ a-z ] / i ? " % " +f : c}. join strftime ( x ) else super end end end So , how does it work ?
It handles every method starting with f_ .
What follows are the characters used within strftime : Y for 4 - digit year , d for day of month , etc .
Underscores are converted to spaces , or to the first argument , if you provide one .
Examples : # standard lib Time.now.strftime ( " %Y %j " ) # => " 2008065 " Time.now.strftime ( "s " ) #=> " 1204725800 " Time.now.strftime ( " %d %m %Y " ) # => " 05 03 2008 " Time.now.strftime ( " %d-%m-%Y " ) #=> " 05-03-2008 " Time.now.strftime ( " %d %b %Y " ) # => " 05 Mar 2008 " # new and improved Time.now.f_Yj # => " 2008065 " Time.now.f_s #=> " 1204725800 " Time.now.f_d_m_Y #=> " 05 03 2008 " Time.now.f_d_m_Y ('-') #=> " 05-03-2008 " Time.now.f_d_b_Y #=> " 05 Mar 2008 " Cool ?
Stupid ?
Why do n’t you play with it ?
Our Daily Method # 18 : NilClass #method_missing
Geplaatst door Remco van 't Veer Warning : only apply the following under parental guidance !
We know the whiny nil , as applied in Rails , but what about an obedient nil : class NilClass def method_missing ( * args ) nil end end No more monkeying like : person && person.
name && person.name.upcase
Not DRY at all !
Let ’s use the obedient nil instead : person.name.upcase
This concludes our last daily method .
Ode to Michiel for providing a vast amount of nice tricks !
Our Daily Method # 17 : Enumerable # make_index Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
Do you know what I like so much about relational databases ?
And what I really miss in object - models ?
That databases make it so effortless to index data .
Imagine , you ’ve got a huge pile of data , unordered , continually changing , but because your database keeps a few indexes , you can access any item you wish within a few milliseconds .
Would n’t it be fun if you could do that in Ruby ?
Especially the effortless part ?
It happens regularly that I ’ve got an array with hundreds of items in which I have to search .
That quicky gets slow , so I create a few hashes that I use as indexes .
But what a difference with a real database !
Let make a first step in the right direction , and implement the make_index method .
module Enumerable def make_index ( * names ) Struct.new(*names ).new(*names.map{|n| group_by ( &n ) } ) end end index = User.find(:all ) .make_index(:login , :id , : nickname ) index.login[ ' mdemare ' ] => [ <# User ...>] index.nickname [ ' Michiel ' ] => [ <# User ... >]
I admit , not a huge improvement yet .
But we ’re getting there .
For another time , indexes on more than one attribute , unique indexes and indexing attributes with a natural order .
( index.created_at > Time.now.at_midnight )
Our Daily Method # 16 : Array #bsearch Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare Searching in arrays is pretty slow .
Better use a hash .
But if the array is already sorted , you can use a binary search , which works by dividing the array in two and searching in the left orthe right part , until there ’s only one element left .
class Array def bsearch ( k ) x , y = - 1 , size while y != x + 1 do m = ( x + y ) / 2 if self [ m ] <= k x = m else y = m end end x >= 0 && self [ x ] == k && x end end
Our Daily Method # 15 : Kernel # levenshtein Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
Not in any way invented by us , but still extremely useful and not a part of the standard library : the Levenshtein Distance
What does it calculate ?
The number of characters to add , delete or switch to turn the first string into the second .
Ideal for detecting typos .
# example : levenshtein ( ' levenstine ' , ' levenshtein ' ) # => 3
Or how about instead of a LIKE - clause ?
Not quite as fast ( cough ) but much more accurate .
#
In the old days : User.find ( : all , : conditions => [ ' name like ? ' , params [ : name ] + ' % ' ] ] )
# Now : User.find ( : all ) . sort_by { |u| levenshtein ( params [ : name ] , u.name ) }. first def levenshtein ( s1 , s2 ) d = {} ( 0..s1.size ) .
each { |row| d[ [row , 0 ] ] = row } ( 0..s2.size ) .each { | col| d [ [ 0 , col ] ] = col } ( 1..s1.size ) .each do |i| ( 1..s2.size ) .each do |j| i1 , j1 = i - 1 , j - 1 cost = s 1 [ i1 ] != s2 [ j1 ] ? 1 : 0 d [ [ i , j ] ] = [ d [ [ i1 , j1 ] ] + cost , d [ [ i1 , j ] ] + 1 , d [ [ i , j1 ] ] + 1 ] .min if i1 * j1 > 0 and s 1 [ i1 ] == s 2 [ j - 2 ] and s 1 [ i - 2 ] == s2 [ j1 ] d[ [ i , j ] ] = [ d [ [ i , j ] ] , d [ [ i - 2 , j - 2 ] ] + cost ] .min end end end d [ [ s1.size , s2.size ] ] end Or how about instead of a - clause ?
Not quite as fast ( cough ) but much more accurate .
Our Daily Method # 14 : Time #warp Geplaatst door Remco van 't Veer
Time travel can be very convenient but unfortunately it is n’t very easy .
Reality wo n’t allow it but we can bend the Time class !
class
Time def self .
now_with_warping @warptime || now_without_warping end class << self alias_method :now_without_warping , :now alias_method :now , :now_with_warping end def warp self.class.instance_variable_set(' @warptime ' , self ) yield ensure self.class.instance_variable_set ( ' @warptime ' , nil ) end end Now we can travel back to “ Unix Epoch ” : Time .at(0 ) . warp do puts
" The current time is : # {Time.now} " end Or just before the end of time as we know it : Time .
at( 2 ** 31 - 1 ) .warp do Time.now + 1 end Now we can travel back to “ Unix Epoch ” :
Or just before the end of time as we know it :
What ’s the use ?
It makes testing time dependent code very easy !
Our Daily Method # 13 : Object #mymethods
Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare I always have an irb or rails console session open , and I love methods to see what an object is capable of , but it certainly returns an exceptional amount of unsorted crap , especially in Rails .
Therefore , mymethods : class
Object def mymethods ( methods - Object.instance_methods ) .sort end end ( 1..2 ) .methods.size # => 150 ( 1..2 ) .mymethods.size # => 46
Our Daily Method # 12 : Comparable #at_least Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare
It took me a while before I discovered the accepted Ruby idiom to find the bigger of two values .
I expected a method in Kernel or perhaps in Comparable .
Instead , the Ruby Way is to create an array and ask the maximum value in the array : [ x , y ] .max Well , it ’s certainly short , but I do n’t like it , for three reasons :
You create an array to compare two integers ?
That has to be inefficient , right ?
Of course , worrying about efficiency is not The Ruby Way .
I do n’t like the name .
When I say max it feels as if I ’m declaring an upper bound , a maximum , when in fact , I ’m declaring a lower bound , a minimum .
it feels as if I ’m declaring an upper bound , a maximum , when in fact , I ’m declaring a lower bound , a minimum .
By listing both values in the array , you ’re placing them on equal footing , when often that ’s not really the case .
Often it ’s more an afterthought : you ’re saying : I want value foo ( and by the way , it must be at least 7.25 ) .
Hence , at_most and at_least : total_time / total_tries.at_least(1)
Well , it ’s certainly short , but I do n’t like it , for three reasons :
Hence , and Implementation too trivial to list .
Our Daily Method # 11 : Hash # inv_multi
Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare Hash has an invert - method , but it often happens that you ’re dealing with a hash with arrays as values .
Naturally , you do n’t want arrays as keys – you want every element in the array to turn into a key , with an array of all original keys with that element as the value .
Simple example { 1 => [ 3,4]}.inv_multi # => { 3 = >[ 1 ] , 4 = > [ 1 ] } Complex example { 1 => [ 3,4,5,6 ] , 2 => [ 3,4 ] , 4 => 11}.inv_multi # => { 5 = >[ 1 ] , 11 = >[ 4 ] , 6 = >[ 1 ] , 3 = >[ 1 , 2 ] , 4 = > [ 1 , 2 ] }
The method itself : class Hash def inv_multi # there 's inject !
again . daily method # 5 inject !( {} ) do |h , ( k , v ) | #
Is this obvious ?
If not , say so !
# this lambda binds h and k. l = lambda { |x| ( h [ x ] ||= [ ] ) << k} if Array === v v.each ( &l ) else # value does n't have to be an array l[v ] end end end end The method itself :
Our Daily Method # 10 : Object#r[rs ] [ ds ] s Geplaatst door Michiel de Mare Ruby 1.9 has Object#tap .
Danny introduced Object #with a long time ago .
Then there ’s Object # instance_eval .
Do these methods have anything in common , except for the inscrutability of their names ?
It turns out that they do .
These methods fall in the family of methods that :
Are defined for any Object Take a block and always execute it once Do n’t do anything else
It turns out that they do .
These methods fall in the family of methods that :
So it may seem amazing that there are as much as three methods in this category .
Actually , there ’s even a fourth !
You see , even within these strict specs there are two decisions that we have to take .
What do we return ?
The object itself ?
Or the result of the block ?
Within the block , what is self ?
Is it the object ?
Or is it unchanged ( so we need to pass on the object as an argument ) ?
How do the methods we referred to earlier stack up ?
tap : returns result , same self in block
: returns result , same self in block with : return self , same self in block
: return self , same self in block instance_eval : returns result , different self in block .
And the Missing Method : switch : returns self , different self in block .
You see , even within these strict specs there are two decisions that we have to take .
How do the methods we referred to earlier stack up ?
And the Missing Method : Let ’s see these methods in action !

A fetish is generally an attraction to non-living objects to enhance sexual experiences .
Fetishism can become a crippling aspect to a person ’s life , and often requires psychological treatment .
This is a list of the 10 most bizarre ( and revolting ) fetishes .
1. Furry Fandom
Furry Fandom is the classification given to people who like to dress up as anthropomorphic animals , or watch others do so .
Members of this fandom watch pornography of people dressed in animal suits , and engage in the sexual acts themselves .
Sometimes this can merely involve non-sexual touch and rubbing whilst in costume .
2. Teratophilia
Teratophilia is the sexual attraction to deformed or monstrous people .
One version of Teratophilia is acrotomophilia , sexual attraction to amputees .
Considerable commercial and amateur erotica is published apparently targeting people with such a sexual attraction .
Persons attracted to amputees in particular are said to be engaging in amputee fetishism .
3. Urolagnia
Urolagnia is when a person derives sexual pleasure from urinating or watching others urinate .
In some cases this can lead to urophagia , the consumption of urine .
A great deal of pornography has been created for this fetish .
Urolagnia is also known as “ watersports ” or “ golden showers ” .
4. Emetophilia
This fetish involves vomiting or watching others vomit .
This fetish is also known as a Roman Shower when the participants actively vomit on each other .
A website dedicated to this fetish says : “ vomiting was probably something either arousing or frightening to emetophiles at some point … it aroused powerful emotions , and the emetophier called upon these emotions for the purpose of sexual gratification . ”
5. Blood Fetish
This fetish is when a person derives satisfaction from watching someone bleed , or simply seeing blood on partly or entirely naked skin .
There is a large community around this fetish , however due to its controversial nature , it tends to remain underground .
Blood fetishism is often accompanied by some licking or drinking blood through bloodletting .
This is sometimes done by biting ( referred to as “ love - bites ” though they are technically not ) however this is not the norm due to the potential for damage from bruising or infection .
Most often a razor blade is used .
6. Coprophilia
Coprophilia is the sexual pleasure derived from feces .
The fetish can involve defecating on a partner which is called “ human toilet ” .
This frequently includes defecating in the mouth of the other person .
Coprophilia can also include coprophagia , which is the consumption of fecal matter .
This can lead to serious health risks .
7. Crush Fetish
A crush fetish is a desire to see small insects or animals crushed to death .
Inanimate objects , such as cigarettes , fruit or toy cars , can also be crush fetish stimuli .
The legality of crush erotica and the actual practice of crushing varies by region .
There are currently no known laws forbidding the crushing of objects and insects , however the production or trade of crush erotica involving live vertebrates is condemned by animal rights activists and is illegal in many countries including the United States and Great Britain .
8. Klismaphilia
Klismaphilia is the fetish in which pleasure is derived from enemas .
It is sometimes regarded as a form of anal masturbation .
There are many movies , magazines and websites devoted specifically to this fetish .
Most klismaphiles are heterosexuals , with the female being the one receiving the enema , and the male administering it to her .
9. Necrophilia
Necrophilia is a sexual attraction to human corpses .
This fetish can lead to grave - robbing and sexual activity with the dead body .
In the United States , no federal law exists to outlaw this act , but several states regard it as a misdemeanor or felony .
10 . Omorashi
Omorashi is a fetish subculture in Japan .
It is arousal from the feeling of having a full bladder .
For such fetishists , climax usually coincides with the moment of relief and embarrassment experienced when the desperate individual loses bladder control .
Though there is a small community devoted to such fetishism outside of Japan , it is usually overshadowed by the more hardcore fetishes , urolagnia and urophagia .
Most omorashi videos are among the most softcore of erotica , featuring innocent young women , fully clothed , who have gotten themselves into an embarrassing bathroom situation .
Commonly featured are schoolgirls , female working professionals , and other women attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the urge to childishly wet themselves .

Most of these traditions are now a part of history ( and in most cases that is a good thing ) and most are considered barbaric or evil .
Yet some of them have only stopped recently .
This is the list of the top 10 bizarre traditions that are now mostly lost to mankind .
Warning : Contains adult material .

10 Geisha
The full traditions of the Geisha have now been replaced with a modern system .
Once Geisha were plentiful in number .
In 1900s , there were over 25,000 geisha .
In the early 1930s , there were 80,000 geisha .
Most geisha were in Kyoto , the old capital city of Japan .
Nowadays , there are less than 10,000 geisha left .
In Tokyo , there are only 100 geisha left .
However , true geisha are much more rare .
Modern geisha are not bought from poor families and brought into the geisha house as children .
Becoming a geisha is now entirely voluntary , and women who are not the children of geisha can now become geisha .
However the training remains as rigourous as before .
Young girls have to be very committed to learn the art of traditional Japanese dancing , singing , music , and much more .
Traditional Geisha did not offer the services of prostitution , though some modern ones are rumored to .
9 Dueling
Advertisement
As practised from the 15th to 20th centuries in Western societies , a duel was a consensual fight between two people , with matched deadly weapons , in accordance with rules explicitly or implicitly agreed upon , over a point of honor , usually accompanied by a trusted representative ( who might themselves fight ) , and in contravention of the law .
The duel usually developed out of the desire of one party ( the challenger ) to redress a perceived insult to his honor .
The goal of the duel was not so much to kill the opponent as to gain “ satisfaction , ” i.e. , to restore one ’s honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one ’s life for it .
Duels could be fought with some sort of sword or , from the 18th Century on , with pistols .
For this end special sets of duelling pistols were crafted for the wealthiest of noblemen .
After the offence , whether real or imagined , the offended party would demand “ satisfaction ” from the offender , signalling this demand with an inescapably insulting gesture , such as throwing the glove before him , hence the phrase “ throwing down the gauntlet ” .
8 Eunuchs
First off , in case you are confused , the photograph above is of a male Eunich .
A eunuch is a castrated man ; the term usually refers to those castrated in order to perform a specific social function , as was common in many societies of the past .
In ancient China castration was both a traditional punishment ( until the Sui Dynasty ) and a means of gaining employment in the Imperial service .
At the end of the Ming Dynasty there were 70,000 eunuchs in the Imperial palace .
The value of such employment — certain eunuchs gained immense power that may have superseded that of the prime ministers — was such that self - castration had to be made illegal .
The number of eunuchs in Imperial employ had fallen to 470 in 1912 , when their employment ceased
Eunuchs castrated before puberty were also valued and trained in several cultures for their exceptional voices , which retained a childlike and other - worldly flexibility and treble pitch .
Such eunuchs were known as castrati .
Unfortunately the choice had to be made at an age when the boy would not yet be able to consciously choose whether to sacrifice his sexual potency , and there was no guarantee that the voice would remain of musical excellence after the operation .
Play a video of a true castrato – taken from Top 10 Incredible Recordings .
7 Concubinage
The photograph here shows a group of concubines standing behind their protectors ( usually Eunuchs ) .
Concubinage is the state of a woman or youth in an ongoing , quasi- matrimonial relationship with a man of higher social status .
Typically , the man has an official wife in addition to one or more concubines .
Concubines have limited rights of support from the man , and their offspring are publicly acknowledged as the man ’s children , albeit of lower status than children born by the official wife or wives .
Historically , concubinage was frequently voluntary ( by the girl and / or her family ’s arrangement ) , as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman involved .
Involuntary , or servile , concubinage sometimes involves sexual slavery of one member of the relationship , typically the woman .
6 Seppuku
Seppuku ( Hara - Kiri ) was a key part of bushido , the code of the samurai warriors ; it was used by warriors to avoid falling into enemy hands , and to attenuate shame .
Samurai could also be ordered by their daimyo ( feudal lords ) to commit seppuku .
Later , disgraced warriors were sometimes allowed to commit seppuku rather than be executed in the normal manner .
Since the main point of the act was to restore or protect one ’s honor as a warrior , those who did not belong to the samurai caste were never ordered or expected to commit seppuku .
Samurai women could only commit the act with permission .
A Samurai was bathed , dressed in white robes , fed his favorite meal , and when he was finished , his instrument was placed on his plate .
Dressed ceremonially , with his sword placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special cloths , the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem .
With his selected attendant ( kaishakunin , his second ) standing by , he would open his kimono ( clothing ) , take up his tant ?
( knife ) and plunge it into his abdomen , making a left - to - right cut .
The kaishakunin would then perform daki-kubi , a cut in which the warrior was all but decapitated ( a slight band of flesh is left attaching the head to the body ) .

5 Human Sacrifice
Human sacrifice is the act of killing a human being for the purposes of making an offering to a deity or other , normally supernatural , power .
It was practiced in many ancient cultures .
The practice has varied between different cultures , with some like the Mayans and Aztecs being notorious for their ritual killings , while others have looked down on the practice as primitive .
Victims were ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods or spirits .
Victims ranged from prisoners to infants to Vestal Virgins , who suffered such fates as burning , beheading and being buried alive .
Over time human sacrifice has become less common around the world , and sacrifices are now very rare .
Most religions condemn the practice and present - day laws generally treat it as a criminal matter .
Nonetheless it is still occasionally seen today , especially in the least developed areas of the world where traditional beliefs persist .
4 Foot Binding
Footbinding was a custom practised on young females for approximately one thousand years in China , beginning in the 10th century and ending in the early 20th century .
In Chinese foot binding , young girls ’ feet , usually at age 6 but often earlier , were wrapped in tight bandages so that they could not grow and develop normally ; they would , instead , break and become highly deformed , not growing past 4 - 6 inches ( 10 - 15 cm ) .
Today , it is a prominent cause of disability among some elderly Chinese women .
First , each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood .
This concoction caused any necrotised flesh to fall off .
Then her toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent ingrowth and subsequent infections .
To prepare her for what was to come next the girl ’s feet were delicately massaged .
Silk or cotton bandages , ten feet long and two inches wide , were prepared by soaking in the same blood and herb mix as before .
Each of the toes were then broken and wrapped in the wet bandages , which would constrict when drying , and pulled tightly downwards toward the heel .
There may have been deep cuts made in the sole to facilitate this .
3 Sati
Sati was a Hindu funeral custom , now very rare and a serious criminal act in India , in which the dead man ’s widow would throw herself on her husband ’s funeral pyre in order to commit suicide .
The act of sati was supposed to take place voluntarily , and from the existing accounts , most of them were indeed voluntary .
The act may have been expected of widows in some communities .
The extent to which any social pressures or expectations should be considered as compulsion has been the matter of much debate in modern times .
It is frequently stated that a widow could expect little of life after her husband ’s death , especially if she was childless .
However , there were also instances where the wish of the widow to commit sati was not welcomed by others , and where efforts were made to prevent the death .
2 Self - Mummification
Sokushinbutsu were Buddhist monks or priests who allegedly caused their own deaths in a way that resulted in their being mummified .
This practice reportedly took place almost exclusively in northern Japan around the Yamagata Prefecture .
Between 16 and 24 such mummifications have been discovered .
For three years the priests would eat a special diet consisting only of nuts and seeds , while taking part in a regimen of rigorous physical activity that stripped them of their body fat .
They then ate only bark and roots for another three years and began drinking a poisonous tea made from the sap of the Urushi tree , normally used to lacquer bowls .
This caused vomiting and a rapid loss of bodily fluids , and most importantly , it killed off any maggots that might cause the body to decay after death .
Finally , a self - mummifying monk would lock himself in a stone tomb barely larger than his body , where he would not move from the lotus position .
His only connection to the outside world was an air tube and a bell .
Each day he rang a bell to let those outside know that he was still alive .
When the bell stopped ringing , the tube was removed and the tomb sealed .
1 Tibetan Sky Burial
Sky burial or ritual dissection was once a common practice in Tibet .
A human corpse is cut into small pieces and placed on a mountaintop , exposing it to the elements and animals – especially to birds of prey .
In one account , the leading mok cut off the limbs and hacked the body to pieces , handing each part to his assistants , who used rocks to pound the flesh and bones together to a pulp , which they mixed with tsampa ( barley flour with tea and yak butter or milk ) before the vultures were summoned to eat .
In several accounts , the flesh was stripped from the bones and given to vultures without further preparation ; the bones then were broken up with sledgehammers , and usually mixed with tsampa before being given to the vultures .
In another account , vultures were given the whole body .
When only the bones remained , they were broken up with mallets , ground with tsampa , and given to crows and hawks that had waited until the vultures had departed .
The Communist government of China outlawed it in the 1960s so it was nearly a lost tradition , but they legalised it again in the 1980s .

9/11 widows call for new investigation after revelations of White House , commission ties Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday February 5 , 2008

Print This Email This
The widows whose political activism was largely responsible for the establishment of a commission to investigate the September 11 attacks say a new book revealing the backstory of the 9/11 Commission proves that their initial concerns about its executive director were correct and demonstrate the need for another investigation .
Philip Shenon , who covered the proceedings for the New York Times , has written a new book , The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation , which was released Tuesday .
The book reveals the close ties between commission executive director Philip Zelikow and White House advisers Karl Rove and Condoleezza Rice .
The Commission also reveals that aside from one staff member , no one on the 9/11 investigative panel reviewed what was perhaps the most robust treasure trove of pre-9/11 intelligence on al Qaeda -- records from the National Security Agency , which conducts electronic surveillance and codebreaking for the US Intelligence Community .
" General Michael Hayden , who headed the NSA at the time , was eager to cooperate and share what his organization had with the 9/11 Commission , but Executive Director Zelikow was not interested , " 9/11 widows Patty Casazza , Monica Gabriellle , Mindy Kleinberg and Lorie Van Auken said in a statement reacting to the book .
" Why didnt Phil Zelikow make reviewing these vital NSA documents a Commission priority ? " they ask .
" It seems clear that not every fact and lead was followed in this investigation compromising the validity of the Commission 's final report and its findings . "
The 9/11 widows called for Zelikow to resign or be fired from the Commission back in 2004 , when his ties with Rice and Rove were first revealed .
Shenon 's book , they say , proves their concerns were right all along .
" It is abundantly clear that Philip Zelikow should have immediately been replaced when the first rumblings of his impropriety and conflicts of interest surfaced , " they said .
" When all of this information became clear , the Commissioners and the press should have called for Zelikows resignation .
We did .
Shamefully , most were silent . "
As washingtonpost.com columnist Dan Froomkin notes , " This is n't the first time it 's turned out that the 9/11 Commission was n't getting the full picture .
It 's not even the second . "
Bob Woodward revealed in his book State of Denial , that 9/11 Commission members were not told of a July 10 , 2001 , meeting in which then - CIA Director George Tenet tried to warn Rice and Bush about the need to focus on al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden , while the president and his confidant were distracted by their pursuit of a missile defense system .
In another Bush administration exposé , investigative reporter Ron Suskind revealed the president 's brush - off of the ominous memo warning " Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. " : " All right , " Bush told the panicked CIA briefer who interrupted the president 's vacation to deliver the warning in person .
" You 've covered your ass , now . "
The 9/11 widows also fault the Commission for relying too much on information gained from " second and third hand knowledge of interrogations of tortured individuals , detainees that were being held in secret locations . "
They say Shenon 's book reveals information that " only scratches the surface " of what happened within the government before the 9/11 attacks .
" The bottom line is that the most deadly attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor remains dangerously unexamined , " they write .
" This can only be remedied with an investigation guided by the facts and conducted outside the reach of those with a vested interest in suppressing the truth . "
The Internet is in its infancy .
Electronic information still travels along copper wires left over from the industrial revolution , but the information age is about to hit puberty .
Fiber optic cables are sprouting in unexpected places .
The piracy and chaos we are collectively experiencing is growing pains .
For a few awkward years , the situation is only going to get worse .
But soon enough the labels , studios and every other paranoid media owner will have to stop acting like petulant teenagers .
The time has come to address piracy with some real , sustainable solutions that consumers will support .
The time has come for the entertainment industry to grow up .
ACT I : THE SET-UP
Current system is shot to hell .
Heads buried firmly in sand .
A few months ago , the writer and NYU professor Clay Shirky told me he thought DRM was a “ nostalgic ” idea .
Nostalgic is the best adjective I ’ve heard to describe how most large entertainment companies think about controlling their content in a digital era .
Big media continue to view the situation through rose - tinted spectacles while consumers see red .
When being a pirate is the easiest way for people to access the content they want in the format they want it in , then something has gone very , very wrong .
There is n’t a moral defense for stealing in most cases .
But there is n’t a moral defense for invading people ’s privacy and imposing draconian laws to protect outdated , crumbling business models either .
Music and movie piracy is rampant because over the last ten years , the market has utterly failed to provide a wide range of preferable legitimate solutions .
If this continues as bandwidth increases and download speeds accelerate , the entertainment industry will be left in ruins .
Many think that needs to happen for new business models to form .
I think those currently in power simply need to grow a set and confront the reality of the situation .
So far the search for new revenue streams by the big labels and studios has only turned up one that they seem to be comfortable with : the legal department .
It ’s impossibly difficult and expensive for the average consumer to use music legally in podcasts , on websites , in remixes , or in public speeches for example .
But if you do decide to use music illegally , it ’s entirely possible that a huge team of lawyers will come at you like a troop of rabid spider - monkeys .
Instead of looking at real solutions , all the labels seem to be doing is exacerbating their problems .
Pretending the current laws or legitimate options for consuming movies and music online are in some way going to stop piracy from turning the entire entertainment business into a giant anarchic swap - meet is like pretending recycling plastic water bottles will single - handedly end global warming .
The problem is the entertainment business does n’t recognize the giant anarchic swap - meet for what it really is ; a great way for them to make a ton of money .
ACT II : CONFRONTATION
Licenses replace sales .
Labels accept reality , or die .
CD sales are in freefall , ( the arrival of the Mac Book Air this week was perhaps the final death knell for the format ) and the legal department is clearly not a viable long - term revenue stream .
A more efficient way to monetize how we consume music online ( and other goods with zero marginal production costs ) is not to think about monetizing them in terms of sales , but instead in terms of licenses .
This is already beginning to happen .
Deals like the “ Comes With Music ” partnership struck between Universal and Nokia last month may feel like “ one step forward , two steps back “ , but at least we ’re finally heading in the right direction .
And the fact that all the majors are starting to work with legitimate file - sharing models like iMeem is encouraging .
The solution we are slowly moving towards is a voluntary collective license for music , which consumers could choose to pay , or not .
It needs to work all over the world .
National boundaries do n’t apply to this kind of information anymore .
To pretend they do is as nostalgic a notion as DRM .
Organizations such as ASCAP or the BMI could fulfill this role .
This system would n’t be a tax ; there would be no cap on the amount of money an artist or label could earn , innovation would not be stifled .
Bennet Lincoff wrote a paper this time last year which I believe could be the answer .
The EFF is also supportive of a similar solution , which they outlined in a 2004 paper :
“ The concept is simple : the music industry forms a collecting society , which then offers file - sharing music fans the opportunity to “ get legit ” in exchange for a reasonable regular payment , say $ 5 per month .
So long as they pay , the fans are free to keep doing what they are going to do anywayâ € ” share the music they love using whatever software they like on whatever computer platform they preferâ € ” without fear of lawsuits .
The money collected gets divided among rights - holders based on the popularity of their music .
“ In exchange , file - sharing music fans will be free to download whatever they like , using whatever software works best for them .
The more people share , the more money goes to rights - holders .
The more competition in applications , the more rapid the innovation and improvement .
The more freedom to fans to publish what they care about , the deeper the catalog . ”
Under this system , the internet would work exactly as broadcast radio does .
As the EFF proposal points out , “ songwriters originally viewed radio exactly the way the music industry today views KaZaA usersâ€ ” as pirates .
After trying to sue radio out of existence , the songwriters ultimately got together to form ASCAP ( and later BMI and SESAC ) .
Radio stations interested in broadcasting music stepped up , paid a fee , and in return got to play whatever music they liked , using whatever equipment worked best . ”
We have a system where infringement by many pirates affects the ability of rights holders to license music legally to the few media companies that can afford it .
What we need is a model where infringement by a few pirates will not affect the ability for rights holders to license music to the many law abiding broadcasters who want to use it .
Sure , there is good money in making it very difficult to license music , and charging a few people a lot for the privilege .
But it ’s likely there is a lot more money in making it very easy to license music to a lot of people for very little .
This would n’t just allow individual users to share songs legally – it would create new opportunities for a lot of sites to start selling music , which is a good thing .
The entertainment industry has made it very clear it would prefer not to be beholden to a small handful of stores like iTunes , an anti-competitive situation which is n’t great for consumers either .
It ’s a monumental task , but it would create jobs and wealth and probably a lot of opportunities we can’t even see yet .
ACT III : RESOLUTION
A viable entertainment industry unfolds .
New revenue streams spring forth .
The truth is we still need middlemen in the entertainment business .
It ’s just they stopped doing their jobs properly , so we decided to stop paying them .
But if the industry embraces the way millions of people have been consuming their products for the last decade , there will be no longer be a reason for consumers to defend piracy .
There will be more money for artists .
There will be more commercial opportunities to distribute wider varieties of content .
Publishing will grow .
There will be a larger entertainment industry with more revenue streams , making more money than it does now .
Once the benefits of sharing content in a more liberal fashion are widely understood , our definition of fair use will likely change as well , meaning a wealth of new non-profit driven content and culture will be created at the same time .
I think that definition will look something like Tim Wu’s : “ It is time to recognize a simpler principle for fair use : work that adds to the value of the original , as opposed to substituting for the original , is fair use .
In my view that ’s a principle already behind the traditional lines . ”
Confronting the reality of where the traditional lines really are , and where the new ones have been drawn by the consumers ( the people who really make the rules ) is the only long - term solution to the pirate ’s dilemma the entertainment industry faces .
It is , in this instance , the only way the industry will ever stop piracy .
It is the right thing to do , and it will force the rest of us to start doing the right thing too .
When the entertainment industry decides to grow up about file sharing , the rest of us will have no choice but to do the same .
For those who are interested , my book : “ The Pirate ’s Dilemma : How Youth Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism ” is out now through Free Press , and probably soon on a BitTorrent tracker near you ; ) .

Charley Harper Illustrator & Genius 1922-2007
passed away in June of 2007 .
The Cincinnati based modernist artist left a legacy that will live on through his wonderful art work .
He was perhaps best known for his highly stylized wildlife prints , posters and book illustrations .
Harper was born in West Virginia and lived on a farm with his family prior to studying art at the Art Academy of Cincinnati .
He credited his early life on the farm for helping to shape his art career .
He won the first Stephen H. Wilder Traveling Scholarship .
He met another artist , Edie Mckee , while attending the academy and married her shortly after they graduated in 1947 .
Harper returned to the Art Academy as a teacher and also worked for a commercial firm before becoming his own boss .
He and his wife worked out of their home , later teaming up with their only child , Brett Harper , to form Harper Studios .
During his long career , Charley illustrated numerous books , including The Golden Book of Biology and magazines such as Ford Times .
His subjects were predominantly birds .
He created works for many nature based organizations , including the National Park Service ; Cincinnati Zoo ; Cincinnati Nature Center ; Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania and created interpretive displays for Everglades National Park .
Charley Harper captured the essence of his subjects with the fewest visual elements .
Charley described his own work in this way : " When I look at a wildlife or nature subject , I do n't see the feathers in the wings , I just count the wings .
I see exciting shapes , color combinations , patterns , textures , fascinating behavior and endless possibilities for making interesting pictures . "
We 've included some of Charley Harper 's color illustrations .
Those enterprising folks at Game Cube Linux ( GC Linux ) claim to have developed a proof of concept version of Linux running natively on the best - selling Nintendo Wii games console .
The software exploits the Twilight Hack , a quirk in some versions of the Zelda game that lets external software to be loaded without performing hardware modifications .
The hack fools the system into loading code from an SD memory card .
Nintendo has always been cagey about giving third parties access to the core of its machines and has made life difficult for homebrew developers .
But increased homebrew activity around the Wii might herald a change .
A software development kit ( SDK ) for Wii's Opera browser surfaced last year and Nintendo itself has hinted at plans to allow third party content later in 2008 .
This will bring Nintendo more in line with its rivals .
Both Sony with PS3 using Yellow Dog Linux and Microsoft with its Xbox allow third party developers to build software add ons , albeit with restrictions . ®

Earth ( TGW ) – The Environmental Performance Index ( EPI ) ranking released today by experts at Yale and Columbia universities lists Switzerland as the greenest country in the world , followed by the Scandinavian bloc ( Sweden , Norway , Finland ) and then Costa Rica .
How countries were ranked ( simplified )
The United States came in at number 39 ( it came in # 28 in 2006 ) out of the 149 countries listed , well behind the United Kingdom at 14 and Japan at 21 .
" The United States , though very high in the Environmental Health score , ranked at 107th in the Ecosystem Vitality category , below countries like Sudan and Myanmar , which have significant nonenvironmental challenges and limited resources for environmental protection , " the experts said in a report accompanying the ranking .
" Poor performance in the areas of air emissions and climate change reduced the United States ’ score significantly .
" The EPI ’s climate change metrics ranking the United States alongside India and China near the bottom of the world ’s table are a national disgrace , " Gus Speth , dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies , said in a statement .

A robot cannon began wildly and autonomously firing its huge gun in South Africa last Friday , killing 9 soldiers and wounding 14 .
The Oerlikon GDF - 005 antiaircraft gun suddenly began uncontrollably shooting as it swung back and forth , spraying hundreds of high - explosive 35 mm cannon shells all over the place .
The crazed robot's handlers are still trying to figure out what sort of software bug would cause such mayhem .
The video you see above is not the actual incident , but is a similar occurrence from a few years ago when an XM - 151 remote weapons station filled the air with lead , and then spun around toward the reviewing stand in search of even more targets .
Hey , good thing it had run out of those .50 caliber bullets , or else it would have laid waste to some pretty important suits .
These robots , they 're going to take over the world , I tell ya .

Hundreds of police in riot gear quickly sealed the area
The device was set off near the city 's police headquarters , Mexico City police chief Joel Ortega said .
No group has so far said it carried out the attack .
Investigators believe the bomb was activated remotely by a mobile phone .
The dead man's hand was blown off , the police chief said .
It is unclear whether he was responsible for the bomb or if he simply picked up the package .
The blast occurred at about 1430 ( 2030 GMT ) near the tourist area known as the Zona Rosa ( Pink Zone ) .
The scene was cordoned off by hundreds of police officers in riot gear as police helicopters hovered overhead .
Mexico 's government has been locked in a violent battle with drug gangs since last month .
Police have announced the arrest of several alleged members of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel and seized substantial amounts of weapons .

The Nanhai 1 was lifted from the seabed by a crane in two hours
Nanhai 1 lifted
The Nanhai 1 treasury ship , built during the Song dynasty which ruled China from 960 - 1279 , is believed to contain one of the biggest discoveries of Chinese artefacts from that period .
" It 's the biggest ship of its kind to be found , " said professor Liu Wensuo , and archaeologist from Sun Yat - sen University .
" It lay in about 25 m ( 82 ft ) of water and was covered in mud - perfect conditions for preservation .
Both the ship and its contents are in exceptionally good condition . "
The salvage team began building a massive steel cage around the 30 m ( 98ft ) - long vessel in May in order to raise it and the surrounding silt .
The cage was made up of 36 steel beams , each weighing around 5 tons .
Together with its contents , the cage weighed more than 3,000 tons .
The heavy lifting began a day earlier than expected at 0900 on Friday due to favourable weather conditions .
It was completed two hours later and placed on a waiting barge .
As many as 6,000 artefacts have already been retrieved from the 13th Century vessel , mostly bluish white porcelain , as well as personal items from crew members , including gold belt buckles and silver rings .
A further 70,000 artefacts are believed to be still on board , many still in their original packing cases .
Valuable cargo
Underwater archaeology is a new field in China .
In the mid-1980s a number of ships , containing enormous hoards of Chinese porcelain , gold and silver , were found by foreign treasure hunters .
This really is only the beginning , there are so many shipwrecks in this area ... sometimes they even wash ashore
Professor Liu Wensuo
Sun Yat - sen University
Their valuable cargoes were sold at auction houses in the West .
At the time , China was too poor to bid for the artefacts .
The loss of such an important part of its history spurred the government into action .
Nanhai 1 will be the first major project to be undertaken by Chinese underwater archaeologists .
Professor
Liu is confident that the salvage will be a success .
" This really is only the beginning , there are so many shipwrecks in this area , fishermen often snag artefacts in their nets , sometimes they even wash ashore , " he said .
Reclaiming history
It will also give historians much - needed information on a time when China was trading with the world .
During the Song dynasty , most of the country 's trade was with India and the Middle East .
Later that trade would shift westwards .
The ship will be stored underwater in a massive tank in a new museum
" People often think of ancient China as being a closed society , but in the Tang and Song dynasties , China traded with the world - much like today , " Professor Liu added .
The Nanhai 1 will eventually be moved to a new purpose built museum near Yangjiang in Guangdong province .
The dramatic building - still far from completion - is being built on the beach .
The ship will be stored underwater in a massive tank , in which the water temperature , pressure and other conditions will be identical to where it lay on the seabed , allowing visitors to watch as archaeologists uncover its secrets .
China has invested about $ 40 m in this project , in the hope of reclaiming a part of the country 's history , and this time ensuring it stays in Chinese hands .

They are devoted foster
parents with an
unblemished record of caring for
almost 30 vulnerable
children .
But Vincent and Pauline
Matherick will this week
have their latest foster son
taken away because they
have refused to sign new
sexual equality regulations .
To do so , they claim , would
force them to promote
homosexuality and go against their
Christian faith .
The 11 - year - old boy , who
has been in their care for two
years , will be placed in a
council hostel this week and
the Mathericks will no longer
be given children to look
after .
The devastated couple , who
have three grown up children
of their own , became foster
parents in 2001 and have since
cared for 28 children at their
home in Chard , Somerset .
Earlier this year , Somerset
County Council 's social
services department asked them
to sign a contract to
implement Labour 's new Sexual
Orientation Regulations , part of
the Equality Act 2006 , which
make discrimination on the
grounds of sexuality illegal .
Officials told the couple that
under the regulations they
would be required to discuss
same - sex relationships with
children as young as 11 and tell
them that gay partnerships
were just as acceptable as
heterosexual marriages .
They could also be required
to take teenagers to gay
association meetings .
When the Mathericks
objected , they were told they
would be taken off the register
of foster parents .
The Mathericks have decided
to resign rather than face the
humiliation of being expelled .
Mr Matherick , a 65 - year - old
retired travel agent and a
primary school governor , said : " I
simply could not agree to do it
because it is against my
central beliefs .
" We have never discriminated
against anybody but I cannot
preach the benefits of
homosexuality when I believe it is
against the word of God . "
Mrs Matherick , 61 , said they
had asked if they could continue looking after their foster
son until he is found a
permanent home , but officials
refused and he will be placed
in a council hostel on Friday .
She said : " He was very upset
to begin with .
We are all very
close , but he 's a mature young
man and he 's dealing with it . "
The couple , who have six
grandchildren and one
greatgrandchild , are both ministers
at the nonconformist South
Chard Christian Church .
When they first started
fostering they took in young
single mothers and their babies .
More recently they have been
caring for children of primary
school age .
Mr Matherick added : " It's
terrible that we 've been forced
into this corner .
It just should
not happen .
" There are not enough foster
carers around anyway without
these rules .
" They were saying
that we had to be prepared to
talk about sexuality with 11 - year - olds , which I do n't think is
appropriate anyway , but not
only that , to be prepared to
explain how gay people date .
" They said we would even have
to take a teenager to gay
association meetings .
" How can I do
that when it 's totally against
what I believe ? "
Religious campaigners say
the couple are the latest
victims of an equality drive which
puts gay rights above religious
beliefs .
Christian , Jewish and Muslim
leaders have complained that the rules force them to
overturn long - held beliefs .
The Mathericks are planning
to fight their case in the courts
with the backing of the
Lawyers ' Christian Fellowship .
The same organisation is
backing Christian magistrate
Andrew McClintock who
resigned from the family courts
in a row over gay adoption .
He says he was forced to
resign because he was not
allowed to opt out of cases
where he might have to send a
child to live with gay parents .
The Mathericks ' case comes
at a time when there is a
chronic shortage of foster
parents , who work on a voluntary
basis .
An extra 8,000 are
needed to plug the gaps in the
service .
Researchers have found that
continually moving children
from home to home can have a
devastating impact on their
education and general welfare .
But a report last year
revealed that the shortage of
carers meant that some
children in care are being forced to
move up to three times a year .
David Taylor , Somerset County
Council 's corporate director for
children and young people , said : " No decision has been made
about the deregistration of Mr
and Mrs Matherick .
" The council is committed to
promoting the interests of
children and young people and
welcomes foster carers from all
backgrounds and faiths . "

I have a dream ... that this is just a bad dream
by Jeremy Hooper
So who did Snoqualmie , Washington 's Mount Si High invite to speak at a Thursday assembly honoring Dr. King ?
Well , check out this email :
Today my daughter came home outraged that Ken Hutcherson was the guest speaker at an assembly regarding Civil Rights ( and Martin Luther King Day ) .
While Mr Hutcherson said nothing about his anti gay beliefs he is such a public figure and so outspoken in the media about his beliefs that having him in a school that ’s motto is No Place for Hate seemed wrong .
This is the 2nd time he has spoken at Mt Si .
After his first visit several teachers expressed their concern about having him speak in the school and asked that he never be asked to return .
At the conclusion of his speech today a teacher stood up and demanded to know why such a hate filled and anti gay public figure would be allowed to speak in their school .
She also demanded that Mr. Hutcherson return to the podium and answer her questions on where he stood regarding gay rights .
Mr Hutcherson refused to do so and finally the Principal asked the student facilitator to shut the teacher down .
I am bringing this to your attention as upon searching the Net for more information on this man your site came up .
Watch Mt Si and the Snoqualmie Valley for more news about this .
There was quite a stir at the school and several teachers and students are very upset .
Sincerely ,
[ Name redacted ]
Yes , that 's right -- the notoriously anti-gay Rev. Ken Hutcherson was invited to speak on civil rights .
The same Ken Hutcherson who is so against gay rights that he is actually encouraging people to buy stock in a major American corporation so that he and his friends can turn the company against gay rights .
The same Ken Hutcherson who has been involved with the frighteningly extreme anti-gay group , Watchmen on the Walls .
This is one of the men that this public high school chose to recruit to speak about this nation 's most beloved bastion of equality and freedom .
In terms of poor choices , this one was completely bankrupt !
Regardless of the fact that he did n't address his anti-gay endeavors , his queer - antipathetic work is the only reason why this man is even in the public eye these days .
He has chosen to enter into the so - called " culture war " as a voice of the anti-gay far - right , and as such , he has indelibly connected himself with those beliefs .
And those beliefs are hostile towards the non-discriminatory outlooks that our nation 's church - separate public schools should rabidly embrace .
Whether the school is unaware of the full extent of Mr. Hutcherson 's civil rights antipathy or simply chose to overlook it is unclear at this point .
Regardless of the impetus for this boneheaded booking , they owe an apology to all of the students , teachers , parents , and community members who trust them to decrease hostility and better civil freedoms , not foster regressive bias .

I can't agree with you more .
How wonderful is that teacher who had enough courage to stand up and call foul .
Truly impressive .

Posted by : Shane | Jan 18 , 2008 2:10:56 PM
I 'm a student at Mount Si .
I was sitting there in the assembly , I listened to the speech , and I heard and saw that teacher get up and interrogate our gust .
Rev. Hutcherson was asked to speak because it was an open counil organizing the meeting .
And you know what ?
His peach was amazing .
It gave so much hope to the " colored " people of our school , and made them so proud ( I have a friend who is Phillipino and was very deeply moved ) .
He may be an " anti- gay - rights " activist , but he never said a word about it , and his speech was not even meant to address ANY sort of issue of the sort .
Rev. Hutcherson said that he became a Christian because Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian .
Martin Luther King was not gay .
In fact , he was a leader of a church , and he was in favor of what the bible has to say when it comes to getting married as far as I 'm concerned .
The thing is , racial equality and giving " extra " rights to people who are homosexual are two completely different issues .
The fact is that what Kit McCormick did was out of line , disrespectful to our guest , and mostly just very rude .
On a day where we were supposed to be remembering how Martin Luther King changed America for the better , she had to stick her own selfish causes in there , like a monkey wrench in a machine .
This came to me as such a blatant insult to Martin Luther King and his memory .
It was truly uncalled for , and made every feeling of pride I had in MLK feel cheap and just … worthless .
Leave it to a Language Arts teacher to take two completely different subjects and make them look like the same thing .
This of course led to debates throughout the day and people taking sides .
And by all means , controversy is good to form your own opinions , but for a place that has been quoted in other news sources to be " largely anti-gay " there were many people who were harassed in school because they were on the side of Hutcherson .
How is that for standing up for what you believe in ?
I believe that the issue at Mount Si , which is supposedly " No Place for Hate " is the fact that you are n't able to stand up for what you believe in , unless it is entirely politically correct and eye - pleasing to everyone .

Anonymous :
You are obviously very bright and seem to be engaged in the world around you .
Bravo for that !
The issue for those who are LGBT , however , runs very deeply .
Rev. Hutcherson has been a very vocal anti-gay rights activist who has fought basic protections being extended to gay people .
While I do not doubt that he has much to contribute to a discussion on the African - American experience , it is very tough too see someone who has cause so much pain towards another community speaking up for civil rights .
Rev. Hutcherson is nationally known ONLY because of his anti-gay endeavors .
Regardless of whether or not they came up in his speech , they cannot and should not be disconnected from his public persona .
FYI Martin Luther King 's widow , Coretta Scott Kingg , was atirless gay rights activist in the years before her death .
She seemed to think that LGBT people were absolutely a part of Dr. King 's dream .

Here are the email addresses for teacher Kit McCormick and Principal Randy Taylor : Principal Taylor : [ email protected ]
Kit McCormick : [ email protected ]
Here is my email to the principalL " Dear Principal Taylor ,
As a citizen of Washington State , I write to ask that you extend my gratitude to teacher Kit McCormick for her bravery in questioning Rev. Hutcherson regarding his stand on equal rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people .
Rev.
Hutcherson is known nationally , chiefly for his work against gay rights , and I feel that he may have been an inappropriate person to represent the topic of civil rights despite his experience with such in regards to race .
As he was chosen to speak , I feel it was wholly appropriate that he be asked to answer for what seems to many to be his hypocracy in fighting against rights such as discrimination protection and marriage equality for members of the LGBT community .
Corretta Scott King advocated for many years , until the time of her death , for the rights of LGBT people and she affirmed that such equality was a part of Dr. King 's dream .
Like Dr. King , Ms. McCormick 's question may have made some feel uncomfortable ; such is true of all questions truly worth asking .
I am a true advocate for free speech in our schools , so I will not ask that you bar Rev. Hutcherson from speaking in the future .
I will however request that Ms. McCormick and others who 's opinions might differ from those of Rev. Hutcherson be allowed to speak and ask questions freely and without fear of censure so that a fair and open dialog can be achieved .
Thank you for service to our public schools and for extending my sentiments to Ms. McCormick .
Regards ,

Here is my email to the principal : Dear Principal Taylor , I am appalled at the behavior of Kit McCormick at the recent speech by Reverend Hutcherson .
Based on all accounts , Reverend Hutcherson presented his thoughts on civil rights without sharing any of his personal positions on homosexuality or gay rights .
Yet , this teacher -- someone who is supposed to be one of the shining examples for our children , someone who is supposed to be helping parents teach their children how to be people of character -- stood up and assaulted a guest of the school , someone who appeared at your request .
It is clear that Kit McCormick , clearly an unprofessional teacher and one that should find another calling , disagreed with the school 's choice for an MLK Day speaker .
However , that protest should have been made in private to you , to the superintendent , the school board , not during the presentation in an effort to embarass , belittle and degrade Reverend Hutherson , with his daughter present no less .
It is teachers like these that are driving parents in droves to private education and home schooling .
She deserves to be disciplined firmly for behaving like a petulant child .
Posted by : | Feb 5 , 2008 1:08:09 PM
People who disagree with your moral position have the same rights that you have .
They have the right to teach their children what they believe to be morally right and wrong .
Just as you have the right to teach your children that you believe that the gay and lesbian lifestyle is a morally acceptable choice , so do the people who disagree with you have the right to teach their children that it is not morally acceptable .
And , just as you have the right to fight for certain cultural and societal concessions based on your moral position , so do those who disagree with you have right to fight for the opposite .
As with any moral position , just because someone takes a position opposite yours , it does not make them a hate - monger , nor does it preclude them from being able to talk about racial equality and the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King at Mount Si High School .
Regardless of one 's position on the issue of gay rights , at this event , Kit McCormick was completely out of line , rude , unprofessional , and acted outside the spirit of Dr. King .

To the student that said King was not for gay rights .
Please check your facts .
Rev. King was for gay rights look it up .
Not only was he for gay rights one of his closet friends and allies was a gay man and that gay man helped Rev. King stage the march on Washington .
Once again , before you speak please check your facts .
Rev. King and his wife both beleived in equality for all including homosexuals .

Not a famine of food , but of love , of truth , of life . "
Since I 'm writing out of deep concern over the disrespectful treatment of Pastor Ken Hutcherson by progressive teachers at Mt Si High , something Martin Luther King , Jr. said back in 1958 is appropriate , " He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it . "
Words like diversity , pluralism and tolerance have anesthetized us to the reality of good and evil .
We 're called to love all men in the name of Jesus , not ignore their debauchery in the name of diversity .
Sin is a big deal to God .
So much so that He allowed Jesus to die on a cruel Roman cross to rescue us from its grip .
Glossing over evil - whether our own behaviour or something the entertainment media has produced - is to say in essence , " What you did is really of little value to me , God .
My view of sin is different from yours , and frankly I 'm not that disturbed by it .
Tolerance is the cultivation of an attitude of indifference to things we see happening around us .
It is a numbing of one 's conscience , a dumbing down of one 's convictions .
It is political and cultural correctness .
It is being afraid to step on toes .
It is not wanting to make waves .
It is keeping one 's head in the sand like an ostrich .
In the name of peace , we tolerate evil .
In the name of tolerance , we accept sin and call it free enterprise or freedom of sexual persuasion .
We dare not stand up for what we believe for fear of being labeled intolerant .
" Tolerance " and " love " are two very different things .
Tolerance sees your sin and embraces it .
Grace sees your sin and hands you over to Christ 's healing embrace .
Having much wisdom , William Jennings
Bryan made statements such as , " We do not ask that the teachers in the public schools , colleges and universities become exponents of orthodox Christianity … but Christians have a right to protest against teaching that weakens faith in God , undermines belief in the Bible and reduces Christ to the stature of a man . "
One does not have far to look to witness the chaos and devastation caused in our society due to our turning away as a nation from our Judeo - Christian roots .
Bruce Hausknecht , judicial analyst for Focus on the Family Action said , " " It 's a sad fact that those who complain the loudest about any mention of Christianity in public settings are also the first to hide behind the First Amendment to slander faith , morality and country and indoctrinate our children with repulsive ideas under the ridiculous guise of ' education ' . "
Being able to discipline oneself for the benefit of others is the very essence of maturity .
What examples are adults , entrusted with the awesome responsibility for their care , to the rapidly maturing next generation who will impact our society positively or negatively depending on to what we expose them .
Albert Einstein once said , " The world is a dangerous place to live ; not because of the people who are evil , but because of the people who do n't do anything about it . "
If we do n't stand for something , we will fall for anything .

US - backed Israeli siege creates humanitarian disaster in Gaza
By Bill Van Auken
22 January 2008
The Israeli government ’s drastic tightening of a blockade against the Gaza Strip has deepened an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in the Palestinian coastal territory , plunging its 1.5 million people into cold and darkness and threatening to unleash both mass hunger and a serious health crisis .
The Israeli cabinet voted last week to seal all border crossings into Gaza , cutting off food , medicine and fuel for the population and turning the entire territory into a vast prison .
By Sunday , the cutoff of fuel forced the shutdown of the Gaza Strip ’s only power plant .
“ We have had to close the power plant for want of fuel , ” the plant ’s director Rafik Mliha told reporters .
“ This closure is going to have very serious consequences for residents , but also for the operation of hospitals and treatment plants . ”
Indeed , the Palestinian Committee on Human Rights quoted Dr. Hassan Khalaf , the director of Gaza ’s al - Shifa Hospital , as warning that patients ’ lives were being placed at severe risk , including 30 premature babies at the hospital who would die if power remained cut off .
Meanwhile , the territory ’s second - largest medical facility , the European Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip , has been forced to suspend all major surgical operations .
The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , warned Monday that the situation was grave .
“ Disruptions in the continuity of essential services take a heavy toll on people needing emergency care and those suffering from conditions such as cancer , heart disease , and diabetes , ” she said .
Meanwhile , Al Jazeera ’s correspondent in Gaza reported that raw sewage was pouring into the streets , fields and homes because the cutoff of fuel had shut down sewage treatment plants .
“ Normally a pump would pump the sewage down the process line to a treatment plant ... but because there is no electricity the pump is standing still and as the sewage builds up it is flowing into the street , ” said the correspondent , Jacky Rowland .
“ This is a looming public health crisis . ”
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , the main UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees , said that the shutdown of the power station would have “ a devastating impact . ”
“ Depriving people of such basics as water is tantamount to depriving them of human dignity , ” said UNRWA spokesman Christopher Gunness .
“ It is difficult to understand the logic of making hundreds of thousands of people suffer quite needlessly . ”
The fuel shortage also forced the shutdown of a number of bakeries in the territory , which , combined with the turning back of all humanitarian food aid — upon which over 1 million residents depend — triggered increasing panic among the population and long lines at bakeries still in operation .
Prices on many basic commodities have doubled or even trebled .
UNRWA announced Monday that it may be forced to suspend all food aid to the Palestinians in Gaza by the middle of the week if Israel fails to reopen the border .
The Israeli siege against the territory ’s civilian population — ostensibly a retaliation for rockets fired by Palestinian militants against Israeli towns near the Gaza border — promoted condemnations of “ collective punishment ” not only from Arab governments , but also from the European Union and the French foreign ministry .
The international criticism prompted Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak to announce that on Tuesday Israel would allow a one - time delivery of diesel fuel and medical supplies to pass through the sealed border crossings .
The government made clear , however , that it would maintain the blockade , preventing any delivery of gasoline .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , the residents of Gaza can walk ... because they have a murderous terrorist regime that wo n’t let people in the south of Israel live in safety , ” Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared at a meeting of his Kadima party on Monday , confirming the charges of collective punishment .
The Israeli government claimed that its decision to allow a limited amount of emergency aid through the border was taken in response to a reduction in the number of rockets fired at Israel .
Olmert said Monday that he would “ not allow a humanitarian crisis in Gaza . ”
He added , however , that his government has no intention of letting the people of the territory “ live comfortable and pleasant lives ” as long as rocket attacks continue .
Earlier , the Israeli foreign ministry had issued a cynical statement claiming that the blackout of Gaza was a “ ploy ” by the territory ’s ruling Hamas party .
“ Noteworthy is the fact that while the Gaza population remains in the dark , the fuel generating power to the Hamas rocket manufacturing industry continues to flow unabated , ” it said .
For his part , Defense Minister Barak presented the barbaric blockade as an act of moderation , compared to the kind of all - out military assault that the Israeli regime is contemplating .
“ We are targeting the terror elements and we are saying to the international community that we are exhausting all possible options before Israel decides on a broad [ military ] option , ” a government spokesman quoted him as saying during Sunday ’s cabinet meeting .
In reality , the Israeli military has already unleashed a wave of murderous violence far out of proportion to the rocket attacks that are the pretext for this offensive .
While militants in Gaza have carried out over 150 rocket and mortar attacks since last Tuesday , none of them caused serious injuries .
In response , Israel has attacked Gaza with helicopter gunships , F - 16 fighter jets and surface - to - surface missiles , killing nearly 40 Palestinians — at least 10 of them unarmed civilians — and wounding hundreds .
The escalation began last Tuesday when Israeli forces killed 19 Palestinians , most of them Hamas members , and wounded dozens of others .
The bulk of the killings occurred after Israeli troops backed by tanks stormed into a Gaza City neighborhood .
Hamas militiamen sought to resist the incursion and were massacred .
In other strikes during the week , Raed Abu el - Foul , a senior member of the Popular Resistance Committees was killed together with his wife when an Israeli warplane fired a missile into their car in northern Gaza on Thursday .
In a separate raid , another missile killed a member of Islamic Jihad while he was riding in a car .
The missile also claimed the lives of a mother and child who were riding in a donkey cart next to the car .
And on Friday , an Israeli warplane attacked an unoccupied building that had formerly served as the Gaza Strip ’s interior ministry .
The Hamas - led government had abandoned it after a July 2006 air strike had severely damaged the structure .
The raid claimed victims in apartment buildings flanking the building , which is in a residential neighborhood of Gaza City .
One woman attending a wedding party next door was killed by shrapnel .
And 46 civilians were wounded , some of them seriously .
A number of the victims were children playing football in the street outside .
The chief United Nations official on human rights in the Palestinian territories , John Dugard , denounced the attack , saying that those Israeli officials responsible for “ such cowardly action ” are “ guilty of serious war crimes and should be prosecuted and punished for their crimes . ”
Standing in stark contrast to this condemnation was the response of the US government .
Speaking in Washington on the same day as this attack and as Israel began its total lockdown on the Gaza Strip , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack declared , “ The fact of the matter is that Israel is acting in self - defense . ”
Dismissing the civilian casualties caused by Israeli attacks , he added , “ Nobody can bring back those innocent victims , who might — may have been lost in these actions . ”
In relation to the blockade of the border crossings , McCormack said that Israel had informed Washington that “ they do not want to , in any way , degrade the — an already very difficult situation in Gaza .
And we take them at their word . ”
As a “ final point ” on the subject , the State Department spokesman added , “ you do have to remember that the unfortunate people of Gaza have found themselves in this situation because of the mismanagement and the decision making of Hamas . ”
The statement amounted to an unconditional US green light for the Israeli regime to continue massacring and starving the people of Gaza .
Coming in the immediate wake of George Bush ’s visit to Israel and Ramallah earlier this month , the brutal actions taken by the Olmert government with the full backing of the US State Department serve to expose the real meaning of the US president ’s support for the so - called “ peace process ” and the establishment of a Palestinian state .
This “ process ” consists of a military and political offensive conducted by Israel with the aid of the US and Europe — as well as the collaboration of Washington ’s willing accomplices in the Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas — aimed at forcing the Palestinian people by means of intimidation and terror to accept conditions of grinding poverty , political subjugation and colonial - style domination .
Meanwhile , the Israeli brutality against the people of Gaza , as well as the active support of the US government and the tacit backing of Europe and the bourgeois Arab regimes , sparked angry demonstrations in the Middle East .
In Egypt , over 29 members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood were rounded up by the regime of President Hosni Mubarak after protests in Cairo and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria .
The protesters demanded that the Egyptian government open its own sealed border crossing with Gaza to allow in humanitarian aid , extend gas and electricity supplies to the besieged territory and “ halt all dealings and relations with the Zionists . ”
“ If it had n’t been for the collaboration , impotence and paralysis of the Arab and Islamic regimes , there would have been no siege or suffering , and the Zionist enemy would n’t have been able to commit all these savage massacres against the Palestinian people , ” read a statement issued by a front of Egyptian opposition parties .
In response to the crisis triggered by the Israeli blockade , the Mubarak regime has rushed hundreds of extra riot police to the Gaza border in order to tighten control and confront several hundred Palestinians who gathered there to demand that those needing emergency medical attention be allowed into Egypt .
Meanwhile , in Amman , thousands of Jordanians demonstrated for the second day in a row on Monday , demanding that the Jordanian monarchy break relations with Israel .
Demonstrators marched on the Jordanian parliament , denouncing the Israeli actions as well as what they called “ the Arab silence . ”
Crowd boos after Clinton accuses Obama of ' Xeroxing ' language
Updated
Moments ago , during Thursday 's CNN / Univision debate , CNN moderator Campbell Brown asked Obama about an alleged plagiarism charge , where he used language similar to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick .
" The notion that I had plagiarized from one of my national co-chairs who gave me the line and suggested that I use it is silly , " he replied .
" This is where we start to get into silly season in politics and I think people start getting discouraged about it . "
The Illinois senator , smiling , went on to praise his own speeches .
" And I gotta admit , some of them are pretty good , " he said .
Brown asked Clinton , " Senator Clinton , is it the silly season ? "
" Well , I think that If your candidacy is going to be about words , then they should be your own words , " Clinton said , to initial applause .
" That 's a simple proposition .
Lifting whole passages from someone else 's speeches is not change you can believe in , it 's change you can Xerox . "
Obama interrupted , saying , " That 's not what happened . "
" Barack , " Clinton said , " it is .
If you look at the YouTube of these videos , it does raise questions . "
The crowd booed .

“ If they play this game they will walk away thinking ‘ wow , energy is a problem , ” he said .
Experts say video games can be fun as well as educational , although the outcome largely depends on the content .
“ They could in fact lead to changes in attitudes , beliefs , and ultimately , changes in behavior , ” said Craig Anderson , a professor of psychology at Iowa State University who studies the effects of video games on people .
The multi-player version of Fuel of War lets gamers connect and play along side or against each other from anywhere in the world .
They can choose to fight for the Western Alliance , made up of the U.S. and European countries , or the Eastern Alliance consisting of China and Russia .
And the choice of weapons is staggering – players can hop from ground combat with an array of hand - held munitions to flying helicopters , planes , or driving tanks – all futuristic designs DeLise and his team created using current weapons and intelligence gleamed from the Internet and other sources on next - generation military hardware .
Fuel of War , set for release in February , is a first - rate shoot ’em - up game with a well developed story line .
It is one of a growing number of games that center around the theme of energy .
A previous game from Kaos centered on an oil war in the Caspian region , and Energyville , a SimCity - like Web - based game from Chevron and the Economist Group , lets players plan the energy needs of a future city .
But Anderson , the psychologist , is concerned about the message that violent games like Fuel of War may send to players .
“ It may well change attitudes towards the use of these tactics as a political tool , ” he said .
Players may think “ of course we have to use military tactics to go take oil . ”
DeLise dismisses such concerns , saying nations go to war all the time over resources , and that the game is merely a reflection of reality .

Like many liberals , I ’ve never had a high opinion of Fox News , but even I was willing to believe they tried to adhere to some journalistic standards .
And apparently , they do – except that they ’re using the same standards as The Onion .
Yesterday , Fox posted a scaremongering story entitled Scientist : Terrorists May Use Robots in Future Attacks .
The story relies on the incredibly lazy “ journalism ” of simply reporting on a press release and embellishing it with a few facts the reporter no doubt gathered by typing the word “ robot ” into Google .
But personally , my favorite part of this story is the accompanying photo ( shown here ) .
Apparently , the robots the terrorists are going to use to kill us are none other than the Daleks , the brutal , ruthless mutant cyborgs developed by Terry Nation in 1963 for the BBC science fiction show Doctor Who .
It ’s a wonder Fox News did n’t call for the arrest of Nation ’s heirs , not to mention the show ’s current writing and production team , as terrorist sympathizers .
Instead of demanding Russell T Davies ’ head on a plate – I suppose after the Series 3 finale , there are enough Doctor Who fans demanding that themselves – Fox continues to link fact and science fiction , speculating that while it may be hard to believe terrorists are secretly designing homicidal killbots , in fact , U.S. company iRobot is allowing its customers to modify and reprogram their Roomba house - cleaning robots .
Obviously , because iRobot also has a thriving business designing and selling robots to the U.S. military , it must be possible for ordinary consumers to transform their ostensibly harmless carpet - sweepers into unstoppable death machines bent on destroying the American way of life .
Damn you , iRobot , for encouraging hobbyists interested in science and engineering !
Do n’t you know that learning about electronics and computer programming is tantamount to giving aid and comfort to the enemy ?
Oh , Fox News .
I never thought you ’d fill that void in my life left by the loss of The Weekly World News , but you just may do that yet .
Guest Scrogue Deborah Levinson is a design developer living and working in Boston .
She obviously knows way more about Doctor Who than is healthy .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About one - half of one percent of young adults living in homes in the United States are infected with the AIDS virus , around 600,000 people , the National Center for Health Statistics reported on Tuesday .
The agency ’s snapshot of HIV infection in the United States shows the rate continues to be stable and confirms other surveys that show black men are far more likely than other Americans to be infected .
The report covers adults aged 18 to 49 and only people living in households -- not prisoners , the homeless or patients in institutions , said Gerry McQuillan , who led the study .
The data comes from people taking part in the federal government ’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , who volunteer to have their blood tested for everything from cholesterol to AIDS and herpes , as well as undergo full physical exams .
“ What we have done is taken data from our surveys in 1999 to 2006 because HIV has a very low prevalence .
You have to combine all the years , ” Gerry McQuillan , who led the study , said in a telephone interview .
“ In 1999 to 2006 , the prevalence of HIV infection among adults aged 18 - 49 years in the civilian noninstitutionalized household population of the United States was 0.47 percent , ” the report reads .
That works out to anywhere between 447,000 people and 841,000 people , with 618,000 the middle number , McQuillan said .
Men were more likely to be infected ( 0.7 percent ) than women ( 0.2 percent ) .
People infected with the herpes simplex type 2 virus , known as genital herpes , were 15 times more likely to also be infected with HIV , according to the report , availablehere .
Black men aged 40 to 49 had the highest rate of infection , at close to 4 percent , the survey found .
The National Center for Health Statistics , part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , included 11,928 adults in the survey .
These numbers can be extrapolated to the full population .
“ We do see the disparities by race / ethnicity , ” McQuillan said .
“ We can say the prevalence is basically stable in this U.S. , household - based population . ”
The report does not include data on how many people are newly infected with HIV .
These numbers have not been released but AIDS advocacy groups say the new figures will put the number of Americans infected with the AIDS virus each year close to 50 percent higher than previous estimates , at 55,000 instead of 40,000 .
The CDC has estimated in the past that more than 1 million Americans in total are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS .
Globally , 33 million people are infected and 25 million have died from the fatal and incurable virus .
What do you get if the share price of the company you run topples from $ 50 to $ 30 on your watch ?
What do you get if your principal stockholder bails out , claiming you failed to act to maintain the share price ?
What do you get if you lay off hundreds of employees over the years to reduce expenses but fail to improve the product sufficiently to invigorate revenues ?
What you do get ?
You get rich .
Now that Chicago businessman Sam Zell has wheeled himself into ownership of the Tribune Co. , current Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis J. FitzSimons is expected to leave at the end of year â€ ” with an estimated $ 40 million , according to corporate disclosure documents .
FitzSimons , a 25 - year Tribune veteran who rose through Tribune broadcast management and sales , became CEO in 2003 three years after Tribune bought Times Mirror , owner of the Los Angeles Times .
From The Times :
That eventually put him in direct conflict with the Los Angeles - based Chandler family , which had controlled Times Mirror for more than a century .
By mid-2006 , the Chandler heirs , who were Tribune ’s largest shareholders , were openly disaffected with FitzSimons ’ management .
They contended that he had failed to exploit the promise of the Times Mirror acquisition , which had been predicated on the advertising and news - gathering synergies of owning newspapers and broadcasting in the same cities .
The Chandlers contended that Tribune management had failed to respond to the challenges of declining newspaper circulation , broadcast audience share and advertising revenue afflicting both its major businesses .
FitzSimons had been instituting expense reductions across the company .
But those actions created turmoil , especially at the newspapers .
At The Times , two publishers and two editors resigned , the latter in opposition to staff and budget cuts ordered from Chicago headquarters .
Similar turnover occurred at other newspapers in the chain .
In June 2006 , the Chandler family accused management of not moving decisively enough .
In an open letter , it complained that FitzSimons had “ failed to generate a viable strategic response ” to changes in the industry and had allowed “ value to deteriorate . ”
Tribune ’s stock price had fallen to about $ 30 from above $ 50 since FitzSimons took over , the letter claimed .
The family demanded that the Tribune board consider a breakup , a sale or a leveraged buyout of the company , which it contended would yield more than $ 35 a share .
FitzSimons led a search for potential suitors lasting nearly a year .
After a troubled auction , Zell emerged the winner with a $ 34 - a- share bid to be financed by debt .
The Chandlers sold all their Tribune shares in the first phase of the transaction in the summer .
So Mr. FitzSimons will receive , it appears , 40 really , really large for his business acumen , expertise and long service .
I suppose I should be shocked !
appalled !
outraged !
etc .
But it ’s just another story of the American Dream becoming the American Scheme .
Oh boy , tonight 's the night .
According to CNN sources , the US Navy plans to shoot down that failed satellite at 2230 ET from a ship west of Hawaii .
The idea is to get a shot off as early as possible in case a second or third attempt is required .
The $ 10 million missile fired from the USS Lake Erie will not carry a warhead .
Instead , the 22,000 mph impact on the school - bus sized satellite combined with the exploding hydrazine fuel tank should blast the satellite into bite - sized chunks expected to burn up in the atmosphere .
Unfortunately , the timing of the launch -- 5:30 pm locally -- means that our naked eyes wo n't likely be treated to much of a show .
That 's what observatories are for . :
The deed is now done
Today 's strip is dedicated to everyone who demanded more Pintsize at my NonCon panel .
See you tomorrow !

Kos attended NIU and was editor of the newspaper while he attended .
I find it pretty sad that he did n't make any sort of acknowledgment about the tragedy on his website .
While I agree that we generally should n't give press and sensationalism to these incidents , he has a past there .
A simple statement expressing his condolences to the friends and family who were affected would have been , in my opinion , appropriate .
Any bit of respect I had for Kos ( which was already very little ) is not at zero .

Well , when you have the kind of election mentality that would embrace Rube Goldberg election devices as wonderous ( without a clue about the nuance ) and think Bette Davis Ayes is a voice vote , those kinda posts are what you get and those kinda numbers are what they talk about .
" Obama got zero votes because porky pig shit in the hen house . "
What dorks .
Back to reality .
These stone fucking clowns would not detect Stalinism if it was in their shorts .

The election official pointed out , in kosspeak fashion , that only you naive nutters do not understand the election religion very well .
Hell any kossuck worth its salt knows that the stealing of votes is done right :
“ They steal votes for elections like Assembly District leader , where people have a personal stake , ” he said .
( NYT , emphasis added ) .
God Brad , do you think any righteous saint of election holiness would steal votes improperly ?
Where is your faith Brad ?

Tinfoil by association is clearly being astroturfed all over the internet .
When I looked into Bev Harris , the only dirt I could find was that she sold Clinton cigars .
So basically the only dirt on Bev Harris seems to be that she is a conservative .
Kos on the other hand is on tape whitewashing how corrupt the CIA is .
He does the same thing with election fraud .
All Kos can now do is ignore that he has been thoroughly exposed all over the internet and not just by Brad Friedman .
That do n't hyperventilate comment says it all .
Shills and hacks may succeed in the short - term , but I think long - term we the people will eventually succeed using the internet .
The only thing that will stop us is if the scroll button is outlawed .
Good , sincere people will find ways to expose the truth .
There is gonna come a time when the tinfoil by association scam gets thoroughly exposed , if it has n't already .
On a side note , I have mixed feelings about Brad 's comment about anonymity .
On the one hand , I think it is a good thing that people can post ideas and findings anonymously .
Yet , when I keep coming across domains which are utter rubbish , which feed into making most of us look like kooks , I do n't believe that those folks should be able to hide behind GoDaddy type proxies .

Um , sorry , but this takes one click on Kos ( on the ' About Us ' link ) :
Dana Houle is a political professional now living in Washington , DC .
He is the first in his family to graduate high school , to travel overseas without a rifle in his hand , and to work in politics , but he has maintained his family 's devotion to organized labor as a force for positive political and social change .
He became a contributing editor in 2003 , before Daily Kos ran on the Scoop system and thus before user ID 's , diaries and meta .
In 2005 he teamed with other contributing editors Meteor Blades and Trapper John to found The Next Hurrah .
He misses Tiger Stadium and rues the demise of the independent record store .
At 42 , he is technically a Baby Boomer , but he refuses to join any age cohort that would have him as a member .
He does n't seem so anonymous to me ...

I just want you to know , Brad , that I completely agree with your asessment of DK .
When I describe myself as " liberal " around my liberal friends , they all laugh and say , " No , Linda .
You 're VERY liberal . "
Yet , I think DK is BAD for the progressive cause .
I 'm middle - aged , and graduated from college before we had PC's to do our researching and assignments on , so I 'm not as quick as some of you younger people when it comes to using the internet and websites as a way to keep up .
When I first heard about DK , when it started up , it was hugely touted as THE place for progressives to go .
Yet , every time I went there , I was not only disappointed , but disgusted by the level of the average poster ( or what they call diarist ) .
I NEVER visit there anymore , unless I read , at a site like yours , about some outrageous post or thread there .
DK is overrated .
And it 's bad for the progressive cause , because it uses some of the same tactics that right - wingers use , only flipped around .
IMO , anyone who dislikes DK gets brownie points from me , and for progressives who dislike DK , you get double - brownies .

Eh .
They 're wrong about the election issue but right about Larry Johnson .
The guy has turned into a fact - free hack .
The sort of complaint you have about Kos and crew .

DHinMI denies it , but he resigned after a swiftboat incident during congressman Hodes ' campaign .
I have looked at Hodes ' votes and all those I saw were anti-bushie .
I don not associate Hodes with DHinMI thru mere guilt by association .
But how in the world kos gets by with claiming to be a progressive yet demanding to stay ignorant of the election machinery is perplexing .
There is something else going on inside kos who basically says there are no election problems bekos I say so .
Wake up political panty - waists , there is one hell of a problem which you are ignoring and thereby postponing fixing it .
Become political adults not political dolts .

Brad , Sorry have to agree with Dan , DHinMI , is / was not anonymous .
The question is not who , but why .
Whose dog did you and Bev run over with your reports on NH ?
BTW , Houle may be just paying back a favor or a debt .
In WA , CA , NYC , etc. the question is both who and why .
Esser is a major support of Dino Rossi , who lost the governor 's race two years ago , and who is RUMORED to be a corrupt real estate developer ( I do not have any substantiation on this ) .
You need to pay attention at what has happened to the Ron Paul vote .
I know he is way out there , but the numbers do n't add up .
And how about NYC numbers of Clinton and Obama .
What 's going on there ?
Corruption happens from both parties , at the same time .
That is proven by NH .
While paper ballots are the most important , do n't forget that there was ballot box stuffing screwing up the ballot count in the past .
While you and Bev focus mainly on the how , someone needs to focus on the who and why .
I think that where the really amazingly vicious attack on you and Bev by DHinHI came from : the who and why .
That said ,
Good Job !

Actually , both leeches and trepanation
are still widely used and accepted as good
ideas in modern medicine , with the former indeed
being FDA - approved as safe and effective .
wikipedia :
Trepanation is a widely accepted treatment for epidural and subdural hematomas , and for surgical access for certain other neurosurgical procedures , such as intracranial pressure monitoring .
Modern surgeons generally use the term craniotomy for this procedure .
In almost all cases , the removed piece of skull is replaced as soon as possible .
If the bone is not replaced , then the procedure is considered a craniectomy .

DHinMI is , as others have said , the second - biggest asshole on dkos .
( The biggest being kos himself . )
While I had been aware of the info in his site bio , he never made it clear exactly who he is and which politician he worked for .
In fact , the bio makes it seem that Houle left active work in politics some time ago .
Now it 's clear that he was the chief of staff for a congressman while at the same time acting as an administrator ( and petty tyrant ) on dkos from its inception .
What really interests me is the ethical angle here .
Houle never ( to my knowledge ) explicitly informed dkos members and the world at large of his position in Hodes ' office .
Was is ethical for a congressman 's chief of staff to be so intricately involved in that site ?
Was it ethical for kos to allow it without explaining upfront what Houle 's real status was ?
Besides the suppression of election integrity advocacy , what other agenda has Houle used dkos to advance ?
Have he and Moulitsas been secretly coordinating with the Democratic Party hierarchy while presenting a facade of independence ?
What other unseen influences are at work on Orange State that we may never hear about ?
For the record , I have never trusted Moulitsas or put much faith in his site as a champion of " progressive " values .
He is more of a slick operator who found a marketing model that he used to create a pure moneymaking machine .
His so - called progressivism is nothing more than naked republican opportunism in action because when it comes down to issues like choice and election integrity kos is still the reactionary Reaganite he always was .

What I 've learned from DailyKos frontpagers : ( 1 ) Ralph Nader is why the Democratic party " lost " the 2000 election .
Nader should be hated because , " but for " his candidacy , Bush would n't be elected .
( 2 ) Any variation from the official 9/11 conspiracy theory is a conspiracy theory that needs higher standards of evidence than the Government 's rubber - stamped conspiracy theory .
( 3 ) 3rd party candidates are evil , and it is better to vote for someone you do n't agree with that 's a Democratic party member .
Vote Democratic , no matter what , that 's the American Way ™. ( 4 ) Election results should be trusted and a high burden to avoid mockery is on anyone who would challenge the results .
( 5 ) Kucinich is a nutter by pursuing impeachment , and deserves to be primaried .
( Yes , Kos has said this much , slightly less flatteringly I might add . )
But we 're still supposed to be outraged that the administration 's new AG is not enforcing contempt citations .
Gosh , big surprise .
Notice a pattern ?
All of these are ESTABLISHMENT memes .
They do n't crash the gates .
They stand at the gate and defend the status quo .
But hey , it 's a PROGRESSIVE site because ...

Their disdain for the constitution , and their aversion to being forced to actually debate the merits of their positions .
The only difference is to whose secondary benefit will they support unconstitutional policies .
But when push comes to shove , and it looks like they might loose an argument , both invariably change the subject , and start sliming their opponents , hoping to distract them while putting them on the defensive .
They see the hypocrisy in each other , but not in themselves .

Dana Houle called Beverly and Brad nutters , and by extension , the millions upon millions of people very concerned with the outrageous election irregularities .
That 's called gatekeeping .
At best , that is about being a useful idiot .
At worst , Kos is still in the CIA and never left .
Does that make me a nutter for saying that ?
Is Brad a nutter for trying to get the Sibel Edmonds story out ?
You ever hear of Hal Turner ?
He has been busted for working for the FBI .
He appears to have been playing the part of a racist in order to give leads to cointelpro - like employers .
The same kind of scam has been going on at Mike Rivero 's WhatReally Happened forum , and I have the proof .
The link in my username will take folks to info on Hal Turner .
Also on that thread is proof that the same type of Hal Turner scam has been going on at Rivero 's forum .
With all these internet scams being exposed , from Netvocates to Advantage Consultants , from Steven Hertzberg as " Navari " at BreakforDisinfoNews to the cyber bullying of folks like Bev Harris , this all makes one wonder whether Kos is up to something insidious also .
Anyone can call folks a nutter .

I read that article and thought " what an idiot " .
That really ticked me off so I was glad to read you wrote this up .
Markos writes the same crap ... like the NY 80 precincts having zero votes for Obama is just an " accident " .
I am almost thinking someone gave him political favors to have he and his staff / headliners write that election fraud does not exist .
I guess with the Democratic Primaries they do n't ' want to acknowledge that Democrats steal elections too because when they all fall in line after the Primaries and tell us all to back whoever the candidate is , even if they are corrupt and steal elections ... well , as long as Kos gets his power plays and his bank account keeps increasing ... forget reporting the truth .
I think the reason is , Markos is really a conservative if you have been reading his writing the past 5 years and he makes millions off his site in advertising , gets a job at the very MSM he criticizes , book deals and others get to run the site .
He 's a good marketer , he is NOT a progressive and no one should look to him for any kind of leadership or uniting of progressives .
Basically , he is making more money than he ever has in his life and does n't have to do anything .
The people volunteering to write and the small staff do all the work that makes the site successful .
A sweet deal for him , for sure .
The website has really deteriorated , especially within the last year and the front page writers .
The only really good one they have now is the comedic guy Bill who donors are paying to have there .
There are occasionally good posts on the recommended list , but even then much less than in the past .
It seems all the good writers have fled .
I am so sick of every time Markos himself writes ( which is n't that often ) he has spelling errors , grammar error and his facts are constantly wrong ... things that can easily be fact checked with Google .
He criticizes established writers for this and the guy is just lazy .
Intellectually lazy and lazy in every regard .
Markos is really just using the site as a tool to promote himself , appear on TV , etc .
The Yearly Kos event they completely stole from DemocracyFest , and he did n't even acknowledge it .
This year , they even have the organizers who did the 2005 Democracy Fest organizing their " Netroots Nation " event in Austin .
How pompous too , to call themselves " Netroots Nation " when they do n't represent the netroots at all .
The 2007 event apparently was just a MSM and conservative lovefest .
All Markos and the organizing team cared about was the MSM attention they would get .
The people who paid to be there were very disappointed and this year they raised their prices to a ridiculous $ 450 .
Markos even publicly dissed the CEO of Jet Blue when he donated tons of tickets to them .
Unprofessional to the extreme .
A lot of people were pissed at the venue as well as the choice of speakers ... most of whom were conservative hacks .
Very few were progressives , unlike what you see at other " grassroots " events , though I would n't call it that since Markos is all corporate and censors anyone who challenges his status quo .
Let 's face it , he slams the James Carville 's of the world because he wants to be them .
He wo n't citizen the Democratic Party too much because he wants to be their inside man and have that power .
At the same time , he is making his money off of the everyday folks who come to his site which he uses those numbers to increase advertising revenue .
It would be interesting to see if the advertisers even get what they pay for since they do n't publish actual click - throughs nor does he base his prices on that ... only total hits .
It is interesting that DHinMI did not disclose he was on Holt 's team and had a conflict of interest , nor did Kos force him too .
For someone ( Markos ) who claims to support transparency , time and time again we find that he is dishonest and does not disclose his or his teams role in various things and then they write critical articles .
He calls out politicians and their staff , yet does the same thing .
That Susan is same way .
She bans people in violation of their own rules , with no warnings , nothing .
She did this to someone because they criticized her for not taking election fraud issues seriously , and the post even got all recommended and no troll ratings .
She completely cut off their ability to comment and post anything because she was mad posts criticizing her stance on election integrity got recommended .
Talk about gate keeping !
However , they did n't delete the account .
Why ?
Because they want to say they have 100,000 + members when in fact a lot of those people are no longer even there or have been banned by Kos .
That is just another reflection of that lack of integrity of that whole site .
The only thing it really has going for it is a great website developer guy that Markos has working for him .
Well , Brad , keep up the great work and the integrity .
Unsung heroes are the only ones who ever make real change .

Yes , the irony .
Brad has been trying forever to get that out , and now Dailykos is trying to take credit ... reporting on it after the other people did the work .
In the same sentence they chastise the MSM for not reporting it when they themselves did not until other blogs and individual bloggers kept pressing the issue .
They do this constantly .
It was interesting reading the diary defending Brad when the paid staffers got on to attack , and whined about Brad doing a hit job in effect , when their own writers started it .
They even talked about banning the author but MissLaura , as much as she wanted to , technically could n't because he already outted himself in the " about " page .
What a bunch of losers .
Then BarbarainMD makes a comment about how Brad can't be an expert on election integrity because he did n't know how to find their stupid ab out page and his readers had to tell them .
That is so rich !
99 % of everything on DailyKos comes from their readers researching it and brining it to Markos or his staff 's attention !
He would n't even have a site without them .
He would n't even have a popular site if were n't for the Dean campaign where the bulk of his fast growing readership in 2003 and 2004 came from , yet he has no problem dissing Dean when it serves his pupose .
I know Dean and he has ten times the integrity Markos will ever have .
Their hypocrisy knows no end .
I think with tv appearances with Crier and Robert Kennedy Jr. the Kos borg are just jealous that this might be a smaller website , but Brad has ten times the credibility Markos and crew will ever have .
They are so nasty too , then whine we are nasty here .

The same thing happened here in Boston with the Church pedophile story .
The Boston Phoenix , our local progressive type paper with the classifieds and whatnot , were the ones who really broke that story .
Then when it became obviously true , the Boston Globe showed up and took the credit .
It is kind of shocking how quick Kos ' credibility has tanked .
It goes back to that admission he made about how great the CIA is .
I really did n't give him the time of day before that .
I never liked the layout of the DailyKos , never knew much about him or that place .
But when the CIA thing came out , it rang a bell with other stuff .
I know Brad made a comment about how perhaps we should n't be so anonymous , if we are gonna be posting .
And sorry if that is a generalization on what he means .
But there is something beautiful and pure about ideas and sources used for posts transcending who makes the post .
E.G.
If we see a good piece of art , we need n't know who produced it to appreciate it and know it is art .
The same applies to the truth .
That 's why disinfo punks like to associate election reform with individuals like Mr. BradBlog and Bev .
That way , they just go into the cyber smear mode .
They figure if they can discredit those two , then this story will go away .
Same thing happened with Cindy Sheehan .
Disinfo punks went after Cindy figuring that by slandering her , that all peaceniks likewise would become tainted .
As Elvis Costello has sung before , " What 's so funny ' bout peace , love , and understanding ? "
We must not forget that we have the power of numbers .
Markos really blew it .
He has no one to blame but himself for now appearing to be a paid spook , astroturfer , troll , gatekeeper , etc . .
He praises the CIA and calls election reform people " nutters . "
It 's like one of the lines Brad puts up at the top , giving them enough rope or something ......

Someone Kos could n't say anything to without it getting back to his wife , and his wife tossing him on the sofa ... something like that .
DHinMI talked like a 18 year veteran enlisted sailor that just found out his leave 's been canceled .
DHinMI would make Andrew Dice Clay and Maryscott O'Connor blush .
I want to know how Nancy Pelosi 's chief of staff allowed someone the Speaker would have recognized on sight she would have known personally to fill up a very well known media outlet with f- bombs , c-bombs and ever other " - bomb " every single day 24/7/365 for years .

If he was screwing around doing propaganda posts on Kos while being paid by our tax dollars , there 's a bigger story here .
In other words , any posts from Mon-Fri 8 to 5 pm ought to be catalogued and exposed for the colossal waste of our tax dollars that they are .
I do n't have time to look into that but it is a story with real news value .
As you may recall , there was a kerfluffle a while back when it was learned that congressional staffers were wasting hours and hours editing Wikipedia articles to suit the agendas of their congressional bosses .

6 U.S. - Iranian incident in the Strait of Hormuz into a sensational story demonstrating Iran ’s military aggressiveness , a reconstruction of the events following the incident shows .
The initial press stories on the incident , all of which can be traced to a briefing by deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in charge of media operations Bryan Whitman , contained similar information that has since been repudiated by the Navy itself .
Then the Navy disseminated a short video into which was spliced the audio of a phone call warning that U.S. warships would " explode " in " a few seconds . "
Although it was ostensibly a Navy production , IPS has learned that the ultimate decision on its content was made by top officials of the Defense Department .
The encounter between five small and apparently unarmed speedboats , each carrying a crew of two to four men , and the three U.S. warships occurred very early on Saturday Jan.
6 , Washington time .
But no information was released to the public about the incident for more than 24 hours , indicating that it was not viewed initially as being very urgent .
The reason for that absence of public information on the incident for more than a full day is that it was not that different from many others in the Gulf over more than a decade .
A Pentagon consultant who asked not to be identified told IPS that he had spoken with officers who had experienced similar encounters with small Iranian boats throughout the 1990s , and that such incidents are " just not a major threat to the U.S.
Navy by any stretch of the imagination . "
Just two weeks earlier , on Dec. 19 , the USS Whidbey Island , an amphibious warship , had fired warning shots after a small Iranian boat allegedly approached it at high speed .
But that incident had gone without public notice .
With the reports from 5th Fleet commander Vice - Adm .
Kevin Cosgriff in hand early that morning , top Pentagon officials had all day Sunday , Jan. 6 , to discuss what to do about the encounter in the Strait of Hormuz .
The result was a decision to play it up as a major incident .
The decision came just as President George W. Bush was about to leave on a Middle East trip aimed in part at rallying Arab states to join the United States in an anti-Iran coalition .
That decision in Washington was followed by a news release by the commander of the 5th Fleet on the incident at about 4:00 a.m. Washington time Jan. 7 .
It was the first time the 5th Fleet had ever issued a news release on an incident with small Iranian boats .
The release reported that the Iranian " small boats " had " maneuvered aggressively in close proximity of [ sic ] the Hopper [ the lead ship of the three - ship convoy ] . "
But it did not suggest that the Iranian boats had threatened the boats or that it had nearly resulted in firing on the Iranian boats .
On the contrary , the release made the U.S. warships handling of the incident sound almost routine .
" Following standard procedures , " the release said , " Hopper issued warnings , attempted to establish communications with the small boats , and conducted evasive maneuvering . "
The release did not refer to a U.S. ship being close to firing on the Iranian boats , or to a call threatening that U.S. ships would " explode in a few minutes , " as later stories would report , or to the dropping of objects into the path of a U.S. ship as a potential danger .
That press release was ignored by the news media , however , because later that Monday morning , the Pentagon provided correspondents with a very different account of the episode .
At 9 a.m. , Barbara Starr of CNN reported that " military officials " had told her that the Iranian boats had not only carried out " threatening maneuvers , " but had transmitted a message by radio that " I am coming at you " and " you will explode . "
She reported the dramatic news that the commander of one boat was " in the process of giving the order to shoot when they moved away . "
CBS
News broadcast a similar story , adding the detail that the Iranian boats " dropped boxes that could have been filled with explosives into the water . "
Other news outlets carried almost identical accounts of the incident .
The source of this spate of stories can now be identified as Bryan Whitman , the top Pentagon official in charge of media relations , who gave a press briefing for Pentagon correspondents that morning .
Although Whitman did offer a few remarks on the record , most of the Whitman briefing was off the record , meaning that he could not be cited as the source .
In an apparent slip - up , however , an Associated Press story that morning cited Whitman as the source for the statement that U.S. ships were about to fire when the Iranian boats turned and moved away  a part of the story that other correspondents had attributed to an unnamed Pentagon official .
On Jan. 9 , the U.S. Navy released excerpts of a video of the incident in which a strange voice  one that was clearly very different from the voice of the Iranian officer who calls the U.S. ship in the Iranian video  appears to threaten the U.S. warships .
A separate audio recording of that voice , which came across the VHF channel open to anyone with access to it , was spliced into a video on which the voice apparently could not be heard .
That was a political decision , and Lt. Col .
Mark Ballesteros of the Pentagon ’s Public Affairs Office told IPS the decision on what to include in the video was " a collaborative effort of leadership here , the Central Command , and Navy leadership in the field . "
" Leadership here , " of course , refers to the secretary of defense and other top policymakers at the department .
An official in the U.S. Navy Office of Information in Washington , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue , said that decision was made in the office of the secretary of defense
That decision involved a high risk of getting caught in an obvious attempt to mislead .
As an official at 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain told IPS , it is common knowledge among officers there that hecklers  often referred to as " Filipino Monkey "  frequently intervene on the VHF ship - to - ship channel to make threats or rude comments .
One of the popular threats made by such hecklers , according to British journalist Lewis Page , who had transited the Strait with the Royal Navy is , " Look out , I am going to hit [ collide with ] you . "
By Jan. 11 , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell was already disavowing the story that Whitman had been instrumental in creating only four days earlier .
" No one in the military has said that the transmission emanated from those boats , " said Morrell .
The other elements of the story given to Pentagon correspondents were also discredited .
The commanding officer of the guided missile cruiser Port Royal , Capt .
David Adler , dismissed the Pentagon ’s story that he had felt threatened by the dropping of white boxes in the water .
Meeting with reporters on Monday , Adler said , " I saw them float by .
They did n’t look threatening to me . "
The naval commanders seemed most determined , however , to scotch the idea that they had been close to firing on the Iranians .
Vice - Adm . Kevin Cosgriff , the commander of the 5th Fleet , denied the story in a press briefing on Jan .
7 . A week later , Cmdr. Jeffery James , commander of the destroyer Hopper , told reporters that the Iranians had moved away " before we got to the point where we needed to open fire . "
The decision to treat the Jan. 6 incident as evidence of an Iranian threat reveals a chasm between the interests of political officials in Washington and Navy officials in the Gulf .
Asked whether the Navy ’s reporting of the episode was distorted by Pentagon officials , Cmdr. Robertson of 5th Fleet Public Affairs would not comment directly .
But she said , " There is a different perspective over there . "

Malware researchers at Prevx have highlighted what they are calling a ' massive growth ' in the number of PCs harboring rootkit infections .
More than 725,000 PCs were scanned using the Prevx CSI malware scanner over a two - month period .
Of the around 291,000 users who scanned their PCs during October 2007 , some form of spyware or malware was found on one in six .
Significantly , although rootkits were detected on 15.6 % of PCs during October 2007 , that figure had risen to 22 % by early December .
According to Prevx's Jacques Erasmus : " The rise of the rootkits has begun . "
Rootkits are often ' dropped ' or buried by other infections .
They then modify a PC 's operating system to hide themselves from both the user and any security products installed on the computer .
By so doing rootkits can allow criminals to remotely monitor , record , modify , steal and transfer data from the victim's PC .
Some rootkits are undetectable by conventional antivirus and antispyware applications .
A tech - savvy user may believe his or her computer is ' clean ' , and unwittingly pass on increasingly valuable personal and financial data .
Since 1 December 2007 , 114,891 new users have run Prevx CSI with rootkit - detection features enabled .
Of those PCs , 1,678 had what Prevx describes as ' significant rootkit infections ' .
That equates to 1.46 % or approximately one in 70 systems , which is almost 15 times higher than the one in 1,000 rootkit - infected PCs previously estimated by industry experts .
In the first nine days of this month alone , 93 companies used the free Business scan feature of Prevx CSI .
Of these companies , 68 had one or more infected PCs .
Thirteen companies , or 14 % , had one or more PCs harboring rootkit infections .
These stats do n't take into account the fact that users who scan their PCs are more likely to have concerns about infections .
" Consumers and businesses have a significant new threat to security and privacy to worry about , " said Erasmus .
" Rootkits are often undetectable and extremely difficult to remove .
Both detection and removal are well beyond the capabilities of traditional antivirus , antispyware and internet security suites , " he added .
This story , " One in Five PCs Infected With Rootkits " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .
Economists Finally Find a Cause : Saving ATUS
There is no shortage of groups made up of citizens banding together for a cause : Greenpeace , Doctors without Borders , Save the Children , the KKK , etc .
I suspect that if you look at the data , you will see that economists are nearly always underrepresented in these organizations .
No doubt there are many factors contributing to this result .
In general , economists tend not to be idealistic , and also are often more concerned about their private interests than the public good .
Economists also tend to be pretty conservative and not very religious , and my guess is that the lion ’s share of activist groups are from the left , or have religious links .
Finally , economists tend not to have much faith in governments , so they do n’t invest as much effort in trying to spur the government to take action .
Occasionally , large groups of economists do become galvanized behind a cause .
Sometimes , that cause is a policy issue , such as free trade .
At the present moment , however , the cause is a little known government survey known as the American Time Use Survey ( ATUS ) .
Unlike most government surveys , which ask large numbers of people relatively simple and broad questions about their lives , the ATUS takes a small number ( currently 14,0000 ) of people and actually tries to get at what Americans are doing with their time , minute by minute .
Thus , these data allow researchers to answer questions that otherwise would be out of reach .
For instance , when someone becomes unemployed , what do they do with their time ?
How much do time do they spend searching for a new job , and how much does that time increase or decrease as their unemployment benefits come closer to running out ?
Do husbands do any housework ?
Are black children and white children spending their days doing different activities ?
Funding for the ATUS has been eliminated from the proposed Fiscal Year 2009 budget .
Many economists are upset because it only costs $ 6 million to fund the program .
Although I could not find hard data on it , I ’m certain this survey is far cheaper to administer than others , such as the National Crime Victimization Survey , which , because of restrictions on access to the data , are largely a waste of money .
Even though the ATUS has only been around since 2003 , it is already used widely by economists .
As the number of years of available data increase , it will become more and more valuable .
Katherine Abraham , Suzanne Bianchi , Dan Hamermesh , and Alan Krueger are spearheading the effort to save ATUS which you can read about here .

Click to viewBy now you know waaaaay too much about Toshiba 's format - war surrender , the death of HD DVD at the hands of the larger Blu-ray armada .
You may even be eying the Blu-ray players mounted proudly in point - of - sale displays at Best Buy or Wal - Mart .
Pricing has n't come down to HD DVD player levels — and with those sinking even further , it 's unlikely they ever will — but the need to get in on the action might provoke you to spend some extra dimes .
All we 're saying is DON'T !
Not yet .
If you do n't know why , let us explain .

We 're not going to tell you that HD DVD will somehow come back from the grave to eat Blu-ray 's brains or anything Romero - esque like that .
Even China 's CH - DVD — an easily mass - produced sibling to HD DVD — once a looming HD DVD mercenary force on the horizon , now seems to serve the opposite purpose .
By keeping Chinese firms busy with something other than Blu-ray , Hollywood 's movie content may be kept safe from piracy , and big electronics brands may be able to hold onto their profit margins — at least for a short while .

No , the earth is Blu , and we are at least grateful for having a winner .
Now begins a different kind of shakeup , where once friendly compadres like Sony , Pioneer and Panasonic start to lock horns with one another .
This will bring multiple benefits , but here 's what all parties involved need to accomplish :
1. Get the Spec In Order
Now that Blu-ray is fully in the spotlight , it 's got to get its act together spec-wise .
You may recall that we lambasted many Blu-ray supporters for only building 1.0 spec players , including the $ 1000 + home - theater flagships from Sony and Pioneer .
Except for Panasonic 's DMP - BD30 and the PlayStation 3 with up - to - date firmware , no current Blu-ray player can even handle the 1.1 spec with picture - in - picture , already appearing in certain Blu-ray discs ( and quite the handful of HD DVD titles — but we 'll get to that ) .

The place to be is spec 2.0 , referred to as " full profile . "
Suddenly , it 's Sony who is looking the best here , with not only the amazingly upgradable PS3 but two new players announced this week , the BDP - S350 and S550 .
For $ 400 and $ 500 respectively , they are set to deliver all of the features promised in the Blu-ray palette , including both picture - in - picture and BD - Live internet connectivity ( with USB storage for downloaded content ) .
Nobody else , with the possible exception of Daewoo , has even muttered about a 2.0 spec player .

Samsung 's BD - UP5000 dual - format player is purportedly compatible with 1.1 , but besides the fact that it 's pricey even at $ 550 and requires a firmware update for full compatibility , it 'll soon be discontinued .
Given our initial experience with it , we say that it 's best to wait and see what its successor , the BD - UP5500 , can do .
Heck , dual - format playback may not be all that necessary for long .
But that brings us to another reason why you should wait ...

2. Finalize the Video Library
We only need dual - format players as long as the library is split down HD DVD and Blu-ray lines .
We are waiting for Universal , Paramount and DreamWorks to jump to Blu , and even once they do , it 's not a certainty that they can simply re-release everything currently out on HD DVD .
Universal claims 150 titles — surely the Bournes will go Blu as soon as Uni does , but how long do I have to wait for a Blu-ray of The Big Lebowski ?
Hell , it 's almost worth scooping up an ultracheap HD DVD player now just to enjoy that one movie alone , 47 or 48 times in a row .
At any rate , some speculation suggests that the remaining HD DVD studios may not even come around until summer or fall , depending on weird smoke - filled - backroom negotiations with Toshiba .
Advertisement
Even when all the studios are on the Blu-ray tip , though , a new problem begins to surface : second - edition releases of movies already on Blu-ray .
Think about it : a handful of big Warner titles like 300 and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix came out with more deluxe HD DVD versions which include picture - in - picture and certain online capabilities .
Who 's to say Warner wo n't re-release their 300 and Harry Potter Blu-ray discs with the same compelling extras , now that it 's feasible on the Blu-ray platform ?
Warner is easy to single out because we have that comparison , but who 's to say that half of the blockbuster movies out on Blu-ray now wo n't get a re-release with more interactive content when the spec 2.0 players saturate the market ?
3. Bring On the Old - Fashioned Electronics Store Competition
Sony 's more affordable new Blu-ray player will hit the market this summer for $ 400 .
Nothing built by Sony or anyone else should be considered before then , the one exception being the PS3 .
But even the Sony standalone at $ 400 is expensive , especially for a player whose capabilities are more or less the same as Toshiba 's HD - A30 HD DVD player , now ( in a price nose dive ) selling for around $ 130 .
Only when Panasonic , Samsung and LG announce their own Blu-ray 2.0 players , will true competition finally exist .
( Pioneer will launch a 2.0 player too , but it probably wo n't get involved in a price war . )
It surely would n't be long after that that we see a full - spec Blu-ray player for $ 200 or maybe even less .
Our bet is Christmas , since Sony does n't seem like it will have anything on the market until " summer " and no one else is talking about their next Blu play .
Advertisement
There you have it , the three big reasons why you need to hold off on buying a standalone Blu-ray player , and amassing a library of Blu-ray to rival your intimidating DVD collection .
Do n't worry though .
Your patience will have its rewards .
And Christmas will be here again before you know it .

VIEWPOINT
John Nelson
Some people may not sit so comfortably on their patio furniture if they knew where the wood came from , argues John Nelson .
In this week 's Green Room , he says the demand for wood products is threatening the long - term survival of communities around the globe .
Up to now , indigenous communities such as Baka have been powerless to stop logging from occurring on their lands
Most DIY enthusiasts would be shocked to find that their new garden decking helped to increase the poverty of hunter - gatherer communities in the Congo Basin of Central Africa .
What about the recently purchased hardwood table and chairs ?
Did these come from a 300 - year - old tree that , until cut down for export to Europe , supplied a hundred poor people in Cameroon with oil , protein and medicine ?
Armed with this knowledge , would the customers ' new furniture be quite so comfortable ?
Ngola Baka typifies
Pygmy hunter - gatherer communities in Cameroon ; it is small , remote , cash - poor and surrounded by small fields of manioc and plantain to supplement a varied and healthy forest diet based upon meat , fish , fruits , nuts , honey , leaves and mushrooms .
Since there is no dispensary , and little money , medicines are found in the forest , in the barks , roots and leaves gathered during hunting and gathering excursions up to 20 km ( 12 miles ) away .
Diminishing returns Forest biodiversity is at the heart of Baka community subsistence , and Congo Basin forests are widely recognised as a global asset .
The UK government has committed more than £ 50 m ( $ 25 m ) towards protecting them .
The wealth of the basin 's rainforests is also targeted by big business .
Logging and mining companies are legally entitled to exploit millions of hectares .
Only two kilometres from Ngola Baka , for example , the community forest gives way to an industrial logging concession .
The Moabi tree found there is particularly favoured by loggers for its hard , dark wood and high market price .
Cameroon law stipulates that commercial loggers must consult with local communities over their logging plans
The Moabi's fruit is also a key component of Baka subsistence , especially for the rich oil pressed from the nut .
People rely upon it for their survival .
Last year , it was harvested by Baka women in a forest grove 12 km from the village , in the middle of the logging concession , as has been done seasonally for years .
But those trees are now gone , cut down during 2007 and exported to Europe to make garden furniture and coffee tables .
Ngola Baka is a poorer , hungrier place as a result of European tastes for luxury .
Last week I saw once again - like a scratched record repeating a verse - how the systematic exploitation of such areas by industrial loggers progressively undermines the welfare of indigenous forest communities .
New forest - use maps , created by local Baka communities with the support of the UK Forest Peoples Programme ( FPP ) and the Centre for Environment and Development in Cameroon ( CED ) , illustrated the huge overlap between Baka traditional lands and the legal boundaries of neighbouring logging concessions .
We discovered that up to 40,000 hectares of forest used by Ngola Baka are now being logged .
Moabi are targeted along with a host of other tree species used by Baka .
The future of the community is at stake as its forest is stripped of trees .
This should be stopped , but who on Earth is going to do that ?
Cameroon law stipulates that commercial loggers must consult with local communities over their logging plans .
They must help local communities to document their traditional use areas , negotiate with them where overlaps are identified , and establish mechanisms to avoid conflicts with communities in areas targeted for logging .
However , there is little evidence that this occurs anywhere in Central Africa .
The results are systematic , long - term degradation of forest wealth , reduced forest community welfare and increasing poverty of an indigenous population experiencing jaw - dropping rates of mortality for children aged under five .
Logging on Up to now , indigenous communities such as Baka have been powerless to stop logging from occurring on their lands .
However , with the support of a few progressive European donors , some have started to document their traditional lands .
They are entering into dialogues with government , conservation agencies and logging companies to negotiate protection for their forest rights .
GPS helps defend forests New GPS mapping technologies developed for use by non-literate communities such as Baka are helping forest communities to take over documentation of their traditional forest use .
They are putting themselves on the map and being given a stronger negotiating position with loggers , as well as with conservation and development agencies targeting their regions .
But these fire - fighting efforts by communities and their local supporters alone are not enough .
Without significant additional support from European timber dealers - the buyers who drive the industrial wood trade - indigenous communities will remain powerless to stop their forests being destroyed by unscrupulous producers .
Their children are doomed to increasing poverty because there is too much money being made in Europe .
Most European consumers do not understand the impact on poor African communities of their timber purchases , due to the lack of information about where it comes from and how it is produced , and the impacts of its harvest on forest community welfare .
I believe that if most knew the reality , they would be far more discerning about what they bought .
The cruelty of battery poultry farming in the UK , which has received so much attention recently , pales into insignificance when compared with the logging injustices and increasing poverty of indigenous forest communities who simply want their children to survive childhood , to gain greater access to health services , and to learn to read even a little bit .
Europeans , and consumers across the globe , have the power to stop the disaster that is overwhelming forest peoples , but will they take up the challenge ?
John Nelson is Africa policy adviser for the Forest Peoples Programme , a UK Non-Governmental Organisation ( NGO ) working to support forest communities around the world to secure their lands and destinies The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with John Nelson ?
Can consumer power help save forests thousands of miles away ?
Do retailers provide enough data for people to make informed choices ?
Or is it the job of governments to ensure that existing measures to protect indigenous people 's welfare are enforced ?
Glad to see this discussion .
I work with private forest landowners in Wisconsin and encourage certification by FSC of our sustainable forestry practices .
One thing FSC is strong on is protecting native peoples rights so it is too bad Mr. Nelson did not mention consumers can look for FSC labeling to certify both sustainable forestry and development are part of the management that created a given wood product .
We need this market to develop and grow to pay for the cost of considerate land stewardship .

The problem here in America , is that we have hundreds of enviornmental laws that will not allow logging of US trees .
We have the same amount of trees here in the US then we did hundreds of years ago .
What these enviornmentalists do n't relaize is that when you chop down US trees , you order new ones to be planted .
Unfortunatly , we now have to order our lumber from South America , and Africa .
The countries we get lumber from do n't replant trees and millions of poor people build communities in the vacant land .
if you want to save trees , buy domestic lumber .
Philip Lorio , Richmond Mi. US
Local forest resource is enough for local use and their survival , but not enough for ' out side ' consumption .
So if we as consumer stop buying wood furniture which made of local owned wood will help a lot to conserve local forest and world environment .
surin , Bangkok , Thailand Canada is the world largest producer of timber .
There is no organised planting of trees to balance the cutting dawn of trees .
Besides this thousand of trees get burned due to wild fire every year .
Logging in reserved lands own by native Canadians is also very high .
People must be requested to plant more trees in those land used for logging .

It is time for people to wake up and ask the real questions .
NGOs can not figth with the power of States .
We need a real political decision in order to stop this destructive and illegal operation .
The European Union should require States producers to provide products of a flawless traceability .
They must oblige European importers who turn a blind eye to the timber they import , which is very often the result of a fraudulent exploitation .

Most of my patio furniture was bought used from yard sales .
My shelves in the house are used from craigslist and my dining room table is about 60 years old , handmade by my grandfathers friend .
Maybe the best form of consumer activism is also a form of environmental activism : buy used stuff !
This way you save good usable furniture from the wasteheaps and also prevent exploitation of hardwoods from other countries .
I think if everyone embraced recycling , even big things like tables and sofas , these issues would be less of a problem .

In response to Dan Grandage , I would like to point out that B&Q was a founder member of the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) and is committed to sourcing products that are both sustainable and ethical .
B&Q has received several awards for its social responsibility policy and topped the Greenpeace league table for garden furniture in 2006 - its wooden garden furniture being 100 % constructed from FSC certified wood .
Neil Derham , Southampton , UK Wood is a renewable resource .
The annual growth of wood is 3 to 4 times annual demand !
The greatest cause of deforestation is clearing land for agriculture due to population increase and for cash crops .
With better management , more wood and other forest products could be used .
To reduce deforestation , agricultural productivity has to increase and population increase has to be reduced .
Curtailing the use of forest products could lead to more deforestation due to land clearing for cash and subsistence crops .
Keith Openshaw , Vienna VA USA
Mankind has a problem whether it is eating a fish that has been caught in the oceans that are plundered , using a tree from the forest or driving a piece of steel .
Our foot print on this earth is rather severe but unless we are prepared to act like the Chinese and restrict population growth .... we will continue to create major problems for other species .
We simply have a world with at least 4 billion to many people in it .... the trouble being , I want to stay , which of you are prepared to go ?

The points this article advance are valid .
Customers must be conscious of where the raw materials of the products come from and the effect of harvesting or utilizing these raw materials on the people who depend on them .
However , customers must be presented with other options ; otherwise , how will they satisfy their needs , for furnitures , for example .
And customers must be educated on the effect of their buying behavior .
Willie Bobis , Davao City , Philippines
Why is this a big problem ?
Why not make logging illegal in these areas ?
Is that not the simplest answer to this problem ?
The Africans own that land .
If they decide that the logging companies must go , then the logging companies must go .
End of discussion , no ?
RAJIB , Toronto , Canada
I wish there would be a moratorium on the logging of tropical forests and a forest peoples conference to discuss how to best protect forest habitat .
It 's an oversimplification to think consumers in far off lands can single handedly stop forest exploitation by changing their buying habits although it may help some .
End use affects the price of wood but people with chainsaws are n't concerned with whether a tree they cut goes to make charcoal or into patio furniture as long as they get paid .
The moment a section of forest gets a price tag it 's fair game and I think it takes government action to put a stop to this .
The world 's countries should band together to pay what 's needed to keep standing timber standing and invest in job creation where it 's needed most .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado USA
Who decides what timber to use ?
Interior designers .
Do hotels care who furnish their lobbies and where the material comes from ?
Do the glossy magazines beloved by the British indicate the source of material ?
Is it a subversive lingering for a colonial past that fosters the demand for dark woods ?
All certification can be by - passed .
How " certified " is FSC MDF produced in Brazil , converted into cheap furniture in China and sold in the UK ?
Do you " NEED " it anyway ?
Adam Colledge , Czech republic Wooden furniture , wooden poles and wooden equipment are indeed the driving force for massive deforestation .
Plastic and recyled plastic do offer a viable alternative in most cases .
Sam Chow , Hong Kong Yes -
But you need strict labeling on all forest products on the sustainability of all the different woods and perhaps a significant " environmental tax " placed on hardwoods etc. whose harvesting is damaging cultures and ecologies .
Education is a must too .
Charles Dunn , Fairfield , CT .
USA Consumer power can help save forests and limit de-forestation , but only if responsible retailers provide them with sufficient data to actually make an informed and responsible choice .
Myself and my Indonesian wife founded an online furniture retail company recently with this issue specifically in mind and in part driven by a desire to limit the deforestation which is currently occuring across Asia aswell as Africa .
We actively monitor our suppliers and their sources of wood to ensure that our furniture is produced using sustainable sources of wood whether government or FSC accredited , perhaps if some of the big players eg John Lewis , Marks & Spencer , B&Q did the same and actually informed their customers of what the true cost of their solid wood coffee table was many would think again or at least be prepared to pay a little extra ...
Dan Grandage , Manchester , UK Consumer power can help .
However , we need to turn around the voices in western society that say ' It 's my right to buy what I want , you can't stop me .
Who are you to tell me to stop buying a 4 * 4 or a new hardwood floor ? '.
It 's about responsibilty and the I 'm alright Jack mentallity of these people .
We need to ahve the guts to stand up and say , 'it is wrong to buy battery raised chicken , or 4 * 4s if you live in london , or a hardwood floor if it is not from a sustainably managed forest ' .
So what if things get more expensive , we all eat too much and spend too much on rubbish anyway .
I 'm sick of pussyfooting around the issues , lets tell it like it is !
Chris , leeds
It 's all about money .
It 's unfortunate that it 's cheaper to import wood from the other side of the world instead of using local hardwoods .
Our own woodlands are gradually being brought back to the way they were managed for hundreds of years and this managment can provide the timber for our own consumption .
If people were willing to pay a little extra for local products then the worlds rainforests would be in much better shape .
When I make furniture for customers I 'm forced to use European plywood and other simalr , cheaper products because people are n't willing to pay for proper English Oak !
What a shame .

I agree the decisions made by consumers in developed economies have a notable impact on the state of forests irrespective of how far removed the forest is from the consumer of wood - products .
At this point in time , due to the usual pre-occupation with just the bottom line un -tempered by the ethics of ones business practices means foresters , importers and retailers do not have the necessary motivations to adequately inform their customers on where and how the wood was harvested .
Until consumers and regulators apply the necessary pressures on the the enterprises involved from harvesting to retailing of wood products the status quo weill remain and indigenous communities and the natural environment will continue to pay an exacting price for someone else ' profit margin and luxury .
Governments of where the wood is harvested and the governments of where the wood products , along with the consumers at the tail end of this process have a joint responsibility in ensuring that the harve !
sting of wood is done from forests farms and not from native and ancient woodland which support not only indigenous communities but irreplaceable bio-diversity .
dm , Guernsey Please explain why the cruelty of battery farming " pales into insigificance " , when it is the grossly over - populated human race at the root of all these issues ?
Has biodiversity slipped off the agenda ?
becs , colchester Consumer power can make a real difference and it doesnt even have to cost more , it 's just about buying a product that has an FSC seal of approval on it .
Retailers need to do more to ensure that the wood entering there stores is sourced responsibily and sustainably but to make this easier and more widespread the government also need to get involved to stop illegally logged wood ( and palm oil for that matter ) entering the UK .
This would allow consumers to make informed choices everyday , rather than occassionaly sending these countries a pitiful cheque ( £ 50 m wont even start to combat the damage we 've done ) to make up for our wrong doings over time .

It 's great that the BBC highlights these issues - this world is all that the human race has and we are destroying it for financial profit .
I feel that news items like these should eclipse coverage of mundane and unimportant articles such as the investigation into the death of Diana Spencer , and warrant much higher profile coverage on BBC news .
Russell Jakubowski , Alton Like so many things in modern environmentalism there seems to be so many paradoxes .
On the one hand we 're supposed to buy fair trade products from a subsistence farmer in the third world .
But if we do that then our carbon footprint increases so we 're supposed to buy local .
Bad luck Mr Third World Subsistence Farmer .
Then we 're supposed to encourage exports from poor countries in order to alleviate the poverty there .
But we can't do that either because we 're destroying forests and indiginous people 's lives .
How can we be ethical ?
No matter what we do it will be wrong .
Steve , Teesside , UK Nearly there - so close !
All it needs is one final little intellectual leap and he 's done it .
More more more ; 300 years is nothing in human history ; it 's simply a brief glitch .
Yet the habit we have gotten into these brief last 300 years is going to kill everything .
Unless we stop ; stop having more people , who in turn must stop wanting more stuff , and in turn stop wanting more people after that .
The human race has been over - manned since about 1973 , when the human population was 3 billion people ; half what it is now .
Well , sorry western " more more more " expansionist economics ; there is no " more " left ; you 've dug it up , burned it , buried it , trashed it .
There is no more " more "
If you want to live ; if you want any planet left to live on ; it 's time to stop " more more more " .
That 's the last intellectual dot to join up .
This guy is close ; give him another year , and he 'll figure it out .
So ; how bad will it have to get for the other 6 billion of you to figure it out ?
Cheers Steven
steven walker , Penzance Consumers should look for the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) logo on any wood products that they buy .
What this means is that in theory the product has been sourced from sustainably managed forests .
In practise the certification system is far from flawless , but it is a good starting point for consumers to excert some market pressure on producers to manage their forests in a sustainable and sensitive way .
Graham Phillips , Luss , Scotland
I agree that consumers in developed countries are the key method of bringing about change .
If they reject tropical hardwood products , then timber dealers will not buy the logged timber .
In order to stimulate demand for hardwood products again , Governments would be under pressure to enforce their own laws concerning the rights of indigenous people and timber dealers would be under pressure to account for the sustainability of their product .
Roger Parsons , Chichester UK Consumer power is indeed a powerful tool .
However , this article does n't tell consumers how to flex their muscles .
Forest certification schemes such as FSC require forestry companies to protect the traditional rights of local communities , as well as having standards for biodiversity , water use , worker rights etc. and to share the benefits of the forests .
The mark can be clearly seen on certified products ( furniture , timber , paper , charcoal ) , and assures the consumer that the wood was obtained fairly , responsibly and sustainably .
Anne Danby , Nzara , South Sudan
There is not enough detail about where wood products come from anywhere .
Firstly , no government should allow imports of endangered forest products .
We should only be sourcing wood from properly supervised plantations .
Though this is not a guarantee on the sustainability of the wood , it would be a big step forward .
Any country not conforming to high standards would have their timber license revoked .
It is time to get tough everywhere , or otherwise it will be too late for indiginous people and animals .
Given an informed choice , I would like to believe that people would make a purchase based on conscience .
Chris Hargreaves , Melbourne Australia
I absolutely think that consumer power can save forests if the consumer is knowledgeable of where the products they buy come from and the effect on native people .
That is where the problem exists , on the lack of consumer knowledge .
This could be remedied if consumers did a little research about the product , however this is usually not the case .
This leaves it to retailers , who likely do not want to share negative information about their product .
This is where the govt .
should step in and enforce regulations that would require retailers to post accurate information about the origins of their products .
Regardless , it is up to consumers to be responsible and full understand where the products they buy come from , whether it be a highly valuable forest in Africa or sweatshop in Indonesia .
Lesley Jenkins , Dayton , Ohio - U.S.A . Consumers need to demand specifics about the wood or wood products they buy .
Where does it come from and exactly what species is it ?
Common names , as opposed to botanical names , add to the confusion faced by consumers .
Many woodworkers and retailers do not seem to know or care where their wood comes from .
They need to .
People can make a clear statement that can help forests worldwide by demanding the right to be informed about any wood that they buy , raw or product , and only buying what wood has definite verifiable sources .
Governments will never do the job .
3t Vakil , Patillas , Puerto Rico
Yes we agree that every thing possible should be done to protect the well - being of poor communities dependant on the natural products of long existent forests the world over .
Michael and Sarah Smith , Weymouth Dorset England I was surprised that John did n't mention the Forestry Stewardship Council ( FSC ) .
The FSC appraise local national bodies to audit companies wishing to become FSC approved .
FSC approval means organisations can publicise the fact that they stock only sustainably sourced timber .
Sustainable in this case meaning non-illegally sourced timber from managed forests .
Having said this , I 'm unsure what the FSC do in cases where the logging is legal , yet damaging .
Russ , Wellington , NZ I 've never seen any info .
in diy stores about where wood comes from and very few people think it is an issue .
Most people want wood to be long lasting and to have been " treated " .
If you ask the seller where wood has come from , or say you would prefer wood sustainably produced he will say perhaps that there is no demand or that people prefer exotic hard wood .
Not easy to spread the conservation message Been trying to do so for years .
susan , france
Yes , consumers would boycott all companies using such wood if we understood the facts as presented in this article .
What can we do ?
Carol Hedberg , Minneapolis , MN USA
We need a lot more exposés like this , but why play down the suffering of battery chickens as this article does ?
It 's unscientific as well as speciesist to say the suffering of other vertebrates is relatively insignificant .

What are these ?
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
Power was restored Tuesday for most of Florida after a failed switch and fire at an electrical substation outside Miami triggered widespread blackouts across the state .
Problems at an automated substation knocked out power Tuesday to millions of customers across Florida .

Utility workers were still trying to piece together exactly what happened , Florida Power and Light President Armando Olivera said .
Olivera said disconnect switch failed at 1:08 p.m. at the automated substation west of Miami , and a piece of equipment that controls voltage caught fire about the same time .
Neither failure by itself would have caused a widespread outage , he said .
While the outages cut power to more than two million people at its peak , power was quickly restored to most parts of the state and authorities said no injuries were reported .
Watch why Floridians were briefly in the dark »
The " initiating event " was the failure of the disconnect switch , Olivera said .
" These systems are all designed so that you can handle two contingencies , " Olivera said .
" If you had a switch that failed , protective devices would have isolated the problem .
That did not occur today .
That 's the part we do n't have an answer for . "
Olivera said about 475,000 Florida Power and Light customers and about the same number of customers from other utilities lost power as a result .
The affected region ranged from Miami to Tampa , throughout Orlando and east to Brevard County , home to Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center .
See a map of the areas affected »
The substation trouble set off a sequence of events that within two to three minutes had knocked numerous power plants off - line -- including the Turkey Point nuclear power plant south of Miami .
Olivera said Turkey Point's two nuclear reactors and a natural gas - powered generation unit automatically shut down when the plant 's systems detected a fluctuation in the power grid .

" In a fraction of a second , the demand was far greater than the power plants that were on line generating electricity could handle , " he said .
" When you have that kind of imbalance , we have a system that kicks in and it starts turning people 's lights off , essentially balancing the demand with what 's available . "

Mike Stone , a Florida Department of Emergency Management spokesman , said 2 million to 3 million people were affected at the height of the outage .
Detective Robert Williams , a Miami - Dade County police spokesman , said power was out across the entire county within 20 minutes of the initial failure .
Outages extended into neighboring Broward County , which includes Fort Lauderdale , and north to Palm Beach County -- a region of about 6 million people .
But Miami International Airport , which has emergency generators , reported fewer than a dozen delays and had normal electric service back on within half an hour .
Schools remained in session during the blackout , said Cmdr. Charles Hurley , a spokesman for the Miami - Dade school system 's police department .
And Delrish Moss , a county police spokesman , said no major traffic problems had been reported .
" Most of the calls that we 're getting have to do with people being stuck in elevators and things of that nature , and people concerned about what is going on . "
Moss told CNN .
He advised people " not to panic , and if you go out , be courteous to other drivers . "
" If you come to a place where there is a no light and no policemen ... be courteous , " he said .
" If you 're not courteous , that 's when accidents occur . "
The outage struck as a strong cold front and scattered thunderstorms passed through the region -- including one that prompted a tornado warning for Fort Lauderdale , the National Weather Service reported .
Stan Johnson , a spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , said a total of eight generating units were off - line across the region .
Ken Clark , a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , said Turkey Point 's nuclear reactors are likely to remain off - line for 12 to 24 hours .
Both were in " hot standby , " and operators kept them in that condition without resorting to emergency diesel generators , Clark said .
In Washington , a Department of Homeland Security official said there was no indication that terrorism was behind the blackout .

( CNN ) -- Mitt Romney suspended his bid for the Republican presidential nomination Thursday , saying if he continued it would " forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win . "
" In this time of war , I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror .
This is not an easy decision .
I hate to lose , " the former Massachusetts governor said .
" If this were only about me , I 'd go on .
But it 's never been only about me .
I entered this race because I love America , and because I love America , in this time of war I feel I have to now stand aside for our party and for our country . "
Romney made the announcement Thursday afternoon at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington .
With Romney out , Sen. John McCain is locked in as the front - runner in the GOP race .
Romney had won 286 delegates through the Super Tuesday contests , compared with McCain 's 697 .
The crowd booed when Romney mentioned McCain , saying , " I disagree with Sen. McCain on a number of issues . "
Watch as Romney bows out »

" But I agree with him on doing whatever it takes to be successful in Iraq , on finding and executing Osama bin Laden , and I agree with him on eliminating al Qaeda and terror worldwide , " he said .
According to a senior McCain adviser , McCain called Romney and told him he " admired his speech today and that he was a tough competitor . "
McCain also told Romney he looks forward to sitting down with him at the earliest opportunity .
McCain did not ask Romney for his endorsement .
Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama viewed Romney as a more vulnerable candidate , preferring to run against him rather than McCain , CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said .
" They were looking at Mitt Romney as pretty doable in the political sense saying , ' This is a guy that has a record that we can really run with ' and they ran with it in the Republican Party as you know , saying that he used to be pro-choice , now he 's anti-abortion .
He has changed his position on stem cells , he has changed his position on gay unions , that sort of thing , " she said .
As recently as Wednesday , Romney met with aides to discuss strategy to stay in the race through March 4 .
Although he outspent his rivals , Romney received just 175 delegates on Super Tuesday , compared with at least 504 for McCain and 141 for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , according to CNN estimates .
Romney came in first in Massachusetts , Alaska , Minnesota , Colorado and Utah on Super Tuesday .
In the early voting contests , he won Nevada , Maine , Michigan and Wyoming .
After his win in the first - in - the - nation Iowa caucuses , Huckabee became Romney 's chief rival for the party 's conservative vote .
Huckabee on Tuesday won Arkansas , Tennessee , Georgia , Alabama and West Virginia .
Romney entered the race in early 2007 after finishing his single term as governor with the support of much of the GOP 's conservative establishment .
He had campaigned as the viable conservative alternative to McCain , who has infuriated much of the party 's activist base over the years .
But voters " just did n't get a sense of him that gave enough of them enough confidence , " said former education secretary and radio talk - show host Bill Bennett .
" A lot of people could n't get comfortable with Romney for one reason or another -- changes in position ; ' Why is he going this way ?
He 's a businessman , why does he sound like he is a born - again Christian ? '
People were just not sure of what the message was , " Bennett said .
The 60 - year - old former investment banker touted his management credentials throughout the campaign , citing his experience in Massachusetts and his turnaround of the scandal - plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Despite pouring millions of his own fortune into the campaign , Romney struggled after Huckabee upset him in the Iowa caucuses and McCain came from behind to beat him in New Hampshire .
" Primaries are a killing field , " said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider .
" They take losing candidates and get their bodies off the field . "
Suspending a campaign has a different meaning depending on the party .
On the Republican side , decisions on how to allocate delegates are left to the state parties .
On the Democratic side , a candidate who " suspends " is technically still a candidate , so he or she keeps both district and statewide delegates won through primaries and caucuses .
Superdelegates are always free to support any candidate at any time , whether the candidate drops out , suspends or stays in .
National party rules say a candidate who " drops out " keeps any district - level delegates he or she has won so far but loses any statewide delegates he or she has won .

特に、 Rails2.0 のような REST 指向の場合は URL のルール付けが重要になるので 、 1.2 の頃よりもルーティングを操作する機会が増える。 日本語で読める Rails2.0 の情報は少ないから、こういう記事はとっても参考になるなぁ。
先日書いた Rails 2.0 で map .resource のネスト の日記に、 moro さんから TrackBack をいただいた 。 map .
resource でどのような URL が定義されるかという話を、詳しく調べられている。 rake routes で定義された URL を確認できるってのも初めて知った。これは便利だなぁ。
■ RESTful Web サービス 本
去年 Amazon で衝動買いした RESTful 本をのんびり読んでる。 久々にいい技術書にめぐり合えたなぁ。これ。読んでてワクワクする。 書評なんてする柄じゃないけど、これ は
Web 開発に携わる人にぜひ読んで欲しい本だと思ってるので、紹介してみるよ。
この本は2007年の5月に米国で出版されて、それからわずか半年強で日本語訳がでている。
監訳をされているのが、日本での REST
の第一人者の山本さんなので安心。 最初 の 「はじめに」はちょっと読みにくい訳だな…って思って心配になった（「うぶな観念的理想主義」とか）。
でも第1章以降は別人（？）のように読みやすくなって、特に気になるような言い回しも出てこなくなった。
この本の好きなところはいくつかある。
理論と実践のバラン ス
RESTful はアーキテクチャの考え方の一つなので、ともすると理論を追求して教科書的になりがち。 でもこの本は、理論だけに走るのではなく、 del.icio.us , flickr , Amazon S3 などのサービスを教材として取り入れている。 これらのサービスの REST 的なところと REST 的でないところを指摘した上で 、4章以降では Rails1.2 を使って REST 指向のサービスを作っていく。 抽象的な REST の考え方が、具体的な例として頭に入ってくる 。
原書がでてからそんなに時間が経っていないので、書かれている内容は新鮮味がある。
ActiveResource やルーティングの話も書かれているので、 Rails2.0 の参考資料にもなった（1.2と2.0で変わっている部分も多いけど）。
視野が広が る
Java のような静的言語 と Ruby のような動的言語の両方を覚えると視野が広がるように、異なる概念のものを理解することで考え方の引き出しが増える。 開発環境だと vi + make と
Eclipse の両方を試すとか、言語だと手続き型だけじゃなくて Haskell のような関数型言語を知るとか 。
同じことが REST でも言える。 SOAP を使ったメソッド主体の RPC だけじゃなくて、リソース中心の ROA を知ることで、実際に使わないにしても考え方の幅を広げられる。
カバー範囲が広 い
単に REST アーキテクチャだけを解説するんじゃなくて、その周辺の解説も幅広い。 個人的にビックリしたのは 、 「 8.17 ユーザはなぜHTTPクライアントを信頼するのか」のところ。
OAuth という単語はでてこないものの 、OAuth のような認可トークンが必要になるっていう話まで書かれている。
そんなわけで、個人的には達人プログラマーくらいの当たり本。
まだ途中までしか読めていないので、じっくり読んでいこうっと。
追記
書こうと思って忘れてた。 日経ソフトウエア の12月号に「 URLは短く鋭く愛を込めて」って記事を書いたのを思い出した。 もちろん tDiary の「ツッコミは短く鋭く愛を込めて」のオマージュなんだけど、キーワードとしては結構気に入ってる。 どうだろ？
No way to recuperate
The Brain Behavior and Immunity study indicates stress has a major impact on the body 's ability to repair itself .
Nearly 100 participants were asked to rate how well they could control their temper , and the speed at which they recovered from a blister was monitored .
Hotheads were more than four times likely to take more than four days to heal than mild - mannered counterparts .
Your body prioritises and sorts one thing out at a time , so if you are stressed your body works through that before it gets on with the process of healing
Steve Bloom
Imperial College London
The team at Ohio State University gave participants blisters on one of their arms and then monitored how the wound healed over the course of eight days .
They were asked to fill in a questionnaire which looked at how anger was expressed - whether externally , by shouting at others , for instance , or internally , when one rages insides but keeps a cool exterior .
They were also asked to judge their general ability to manage their anger .
Whether one directed one 's anger externally or internally proved to have no bearing on recovery - what was crucial was just how much control the individual was able to exert over their feelings .
Those with low anger control produced higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol , which was in turn , associated with delayed healing .
" Such stress - induced delays in healing could increase the susceptibility to infection at the wound site , a process that fuels further decrease in the speed of repair , " the team , led by Jean - Philippe Gouin , wrote .
They suggested that therapeutic strategies such as relaxation , or even cognitive therapy , could help those at risk make a swifter recovery .
Bedside manner
The team sought to ensure the association between anger control and healing was not explained by other health factors by taking into account sleep , amount of physical activity and alcohol consumption .
Four participants ended up being excluded because these details were missing , but for the rest of them , anger control still proved to be the most significant factor affecting recovery .
The findings also tally with others in the field of stress and recovery .
One study for example found women caring for a spouse or parent with dementia took on average 24 % longer to heal a wound than a control group .
Another found that even marital spats could slow down recovery from a simple wound .
Steve Bloom , professor of metabolic medicine at Imperial College , London , said stress was now increasingly recognized as a factor in recovery rates .
" Your body prioritises and sorts one thing out at a time , so if you are stressed - angry in this case - your body works through that before it gets on with the process of healing .
" We 've yet to see a study that categorically proves having an attentive , calming presence by your bedside actually speeds up your recovery , but the evidence is certainly pointing that way . "
Top US general praises man who got US into Iraq , WMD fabricator Ahmad Chalabi Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 29 , 2007

Print This Email This Chalabi , fomer dissident who pushed bogus WMD claims , assumes a new post in Iraq 's government
At least Ahmad Chalabi seems to be taking the " Pottery Barn rule " to heart .
The controversial Iraqi politician and alleged Iranian intelligence asset -- perhaps as responsible as anyone in drumming up false pre-war claims about Saddam Hussein 's weapons capabilities -- has reemerged as a central figure in the latest US attempts to put his broken country back together .
Chalabi's latest job , according to McClatchy Newspapers , is lobbying Iraq 's central government to build on security gains to provide " better electricity , health , education and local security services to Baghdad neighborhoods . "
" The key is going to be getting the concerned local citizens  and all the citizens  feeling that this government is reconnected with them , " Gen .
David Petraeus , the top military commander here , told McClatchy .
Chalabi " agrees with that . "
Iraqis are skeptical of the central government 's ability to help them .
Government critics say local tribal leaders and residents have reinvigorated neighborhoods by pushing insurgents off the streets , but US officials believe it is the central government 's responsibility to provide long - term stability by providing reliable electricity , putting doctors back in neighborhoods and establishing permanent schools and police departments .
Before the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , Chalabi was a primary merchant of bogus intelligence that inflated the country 's weapons capabilities and ties to terrorists .
His top customers were the White House , Pentagon and American journalists .
Most surprising , perhaps is his alleged associations with Iran .
According to a 2004 report in the UK Guardian , US intelligence has " hard evidence " that Chalabi passed US secrets to Iran .
" Some intelligence officials now believe that Iran used the hawks in the Pentagon and the White House to get rid of a hostile neighbor , and pave the way for a Shia - ruled Iraq , " the paper said .
Chalabi is also has been sentenced to 22 years in jail in Jordan for embezzling $ 300 million at a bank he created .
In the wake of the 2003 US invasion , Chalabi oversaw efforts to dismantle Saddam 's government through de-Baathification , served as deputy prime minister and chaired several investigative committees .
Now , he 's in charge of the services committee , which comprises eight service ministries and two Baghdad city commissions and is in charge of providing services to Baghdad .
Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki appointed Chalabi to the post in early October .
A Petraeus spokesman told McClatchy that Chalabi " is an important part of the process " and " has a lot of energy . "
US military commanders fear any tactical progress from President Bush 's troop surge this year will dissipate without strong intervention from Iraq 's central government .
America 's military might was able to expel al Qaeda troops from some neighborhoods when Bush sent 30,000 extra troops to Iraq this summer , but with the Pentagon unable to maintain so many troops in Iraq much longer , the same vacuum that al Qaeda stepped into before threatens to open again .
" Right now , it 's a Band - Aid . ... But boy it would be nice if we got the government 's help , " said Lt. Col .
Ken Adgie , who is in charge of controlling a souther Sunni Baghdad neighborhood long controlled by al Qaeda .
" We refuse to let al Qaeda creep back in .
... You ca n't let up .
It 's slow constant pressure . "

FOR much of the past century Maclean's , Canada 's main newsweekly , has been as colourless as its name .
But since early 2005 , when slumping sales prompted a management overhaul , it has become livelier and more provocative .
Too provocative , it seems , for some Canadians .
One of its star attractions is Mark Steyn , a columnist who is a sparkling , often side - splittingly funny writer and , by his own admission , “ a Zionist neocon Bush shill ” .
Some readers added “ Islamophobe ” after Maclean 's published an alarmist screed by Mr Steyn in October 2006 predicting , among other things , that Europe was becoming a “ Eurabia ” overrun by Muslim hordes , intent on jihad and sharia .
The piece , an excerpt from Mr Steyn 's book “ America Alone : The End Of The World As We Know It ” , was notable for its simplistic demographic projections — Yemen ( population 22 m ) will outnumber Russia ( 141 m ) by mid-century , he wrote confidently — and for the reaction it generated .
Maclean 's published 27 letters , many of complaint .
That was not enough for some offended Muslims .
Last spring a group of Toronto law students marched into the magazine 's offices demanding equal space for a rebuttal by an author of their choosing .
Ken
Whyte , the editor and publisher , told the group he would rather see Maclean 's go bankrupt .
Last month the students and the Canadian Islamic Congress ( CIC ) , a lobby group , filed complaints against Maclean 's at the Canadian Human Rights Commission , as well as those of Ontario and British Columbia .
The article , the CIC claimed , harmed Muslims ' “ sense of dignity and self - worth ” .
Their choice of forum has brought protests .
The criminal code has hate - propaganda provisions , but using these requires convincing a prosecutor .
The bar is much lower for Human Rights Commissions and their tribunals .
These were set up to deal with discrimination on grounds such as race or sex in jobs , housing or services .
Even the man who inspired them , Alan Borovoy , a civil - liberties lawyer , is dismayed at their misuse to limit free speech .
The tribunals can only levy small fines and give an order to desist .
But the proceedings involve steep costs for defendants , whereas plaintiffs pay nothing if the commission decides there are grounds to proceed .
Much of Canada 's press and many broadcasters are already noted for politically correct blandness .
Some fear that the case can only make that worse .
Mr Steyn and others hope it will prompt a narrower brief for the commissions , or even their abolition .
As he put it in his blog , “ I do n't want to get off the hook .
I want to take the hook and stick it up the collective butt of these thought police . ”
Video : Stewart slams media for provoking campaign drama
Host Jon Stewart slammed the media for provoking campaign drama on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show " this Friday .
" For those of you not following the campaign , you may be tempted to believe that you 're missing out on some pretty fantastic stuff , " Stewart said before playing a montage of reporters lashing out against presidential candidates .
Stewart 's piece focused first on the media 's portrayal of the overall election process , fixating on one reporter 's description of the campaign trail as " nasty and intense . "
During the rest of the segment , Stewart explored the media 's attitude towards particular candidates .
" In the case of Mitt Romney , we are dealing with nothing less than a human volcano , " Stewart joked , before playing various clips of reporters referring to Romney as " fired up " and " incensed . "
" If you live in the foothills of Mitt Romney , flee ! "
Stewart fake - warned , then wondered aloud if Romney truly " exploded . "
The following clip showed Romney involved in a mild dispute with a reporter .
" You could say Romney was playing with semantics ... but that 's not erupting , " Stewart said .
" When did the media become Don King ? "
Stewart also juxtaposed clips of Bill and Hillary Clinton with the way the media has depicted them .
" Yes , Hillary Clinton 's voice is annoying ... yours sounded great , " said Stewart sarcastically after showing a clip of a reporter comparing Ms. Clinton to an overbearing housewife .
" You watch the media talking about people who are erupting and lashing out , it 's ridiculous ... if anything [ is ] remarkable it's the candidates ' restraint , " Stewart said .
This video is from Comedy Central 's A Daily Show , broadcast January 24 , 2008 .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  Pakistanis dealt a crushing defeat to President Pervez Musharraf in parliamentary elections on Monday , in what government and opposition politicians said was a firm rejection of his policies since 2001 and those of his close ally , the United States .
Almost all the leading figures in the Pakistan Muslim League - Q , the party that has governed for the last five years under Mr. Musharraf , lost their seats , including the leader of the party , the former speaker of Parliament and six ministers .
Official results are expected Tuesday , but early returns indicated that the vote would usher in a prime minister from one of the opposition parties , and opened the prospect of a Parliament that would move to undo many of Mr. Musharraf ’s policies and that may even try to remove him .
Image Pakistani supporters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement party , MQM , react after the closing of the polls in Karachi , Pakistan .

Early results showed equal gains for the Pakistan Peoples Party , whose leader , Benazir Bhutto , was assassinated on Dec. 27 , and the Pakistan Muslim League - N , the faction led by Nawaz Sharif , like Ms. Bhutto a former prime minister .
Each party may be in a position to form the next government .

Activist Ralph Nader announced on Sunday that he will be running again as a Green Party candidate for president .
The announcement has provoked some acrimony among Democratic Party supporters who blame Nader 's candidacy for throwing the 2000 election to George W. Bush .
On Tuesday , late night TV host David Letterman offered his own list of Top Ten Ralph Nader Campaign Promises .
Among the items :
9 - Give the presidency a rumpled , Walter Matthau quality .
4 - Will hover in polls between 1 % and " statistically insignificant . "
2 - Will not sleep with lobbyists , or for that matter , anyone else .
1 - Get Bush re-elected like in 2000 .
The following video is from CBS 's Late Show with David Letterman , broadcast on February 26 , 2008
The release of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’s alleged nuclear weapons program has everyone breathing a sigh of relief .
According to our best intelligence , the Iranians stopped their weapons program in 2003 .
The liberal pundits and the more reasonable Sullivanesque conservatives are shouting " Hallelujah ! "
War has been averted !
My response : not so fast .
Before we segue into all the reasons why we should n’t be letting our guard down , however , let ’s take a moment or three to savor the War Party ’s distress .
This morning ’s edition of National Review Online is a veritable cornucopia of spittle - on - the - screen invective .
There ’s a whole section devoted to debunking the debunkers , and each and every article is a study in sophistry elevated almost to an art form .
Michael Ledeen avers that since " you ca n’t prove a negative , " the NIE is wrong .
Thus , there is no need for any empirical evidence , since , after all , you ca n’t be 100 percent certain , so Iran is guilty as a given .
And were n’t these the same guys who thought Iraq had WMD ?
What Ledeen fails to mention is that he and his gang agreed with that assessment , but in the solipsistic universe of the neocons , a different set of rules applies .
Victor Davis Hanson is uncharacteristically laconic .
Instead of the usual 1,200 words detailing why the failure to strike Iran yesterday will lead to the Decline of the West and the Victory of Islamofascism , we get little more than 200 words of self - contradicting evasions : the NIE report , taken at face value , proves the Iraq war was a success  after all , it succeeded in deterring the Iranians , who would have gone nuclear had they not witnessed the wrath of the Americans up close .
He then turns around , however , and refutes himself by smugly asking us to " expect a variety of rebuttals to this assurance that for 4 years the Iranians have n’t gotten much closer to producing weapons grade materials . "
So , then , the Iraq war did not sufficiently impress the Iranians to divert them from going down the nuclear road ?
Which is it ?
On a scale of one to 10  one meaning Ledeenian incoherence and 10 meaning a chameleon - like ability to mimic rationality 
I give Michael Rubin a nine .
He ’s a clever boy who can think of six different reasons why " no " means " yes . "
What about " the Syrian episode , " Rubin asks : does n’t that prove the Iranians are going after nukes without having to produce one themselves ?
But it proves nothing of the kind .
" The Syrian episode " is an elaborate hoax carried out by the one country that has everything to gain by provoking war between the U.S. and Iran .
The best analysis I ’ve seen describes the Dair - el - Zor strike as an attack on a giant underground weapons depot , where medium - and long - range missiles bought from North Korea and Iran are stored .
My best guess is that Israel ’s amen corner in the national security bureaucracy saw the NIE coming and engineered the Israeli strike to raise the possibility of imported nukes .
Forgetting that the NIE is supposed to be entirely wrong , Rubin avers that it proves " pressure works " and that it ’s time " for another round of sanctions " on Tehran .
If they do what we want , punish them .
And if they do n’t , punish them some more .
This is the neocon prescription : torture the world , and do n’t let up when they scream  and never take yes for an answer .
Rubin has all the talking points laid out like pearls on a string : if they stopped in 2003 , then were n’t they talking about the " dialogue of civilizations " in somewhat less than good faith ?
Except we do n’t know how advanced that program was , or how seriously they took it , and , in any case , as things now stand , they wo n’t have an operable nuke for at least a decade .
Evading this vital piece of information is the whole point of Rubin ’s Olympic - level display of verbal gymnastics .
The best defense being a good offense , Rubin comes up with this : " Will the analysts who agreed with Iran come clean and explain how they got it wrong ? "
Who are these " analysts , " and how , exactly , did they " get it wrong " ?
No one said the Iranians did n’t have nuclear aspirations .
What the analysts inside the government and in the non-neocon think - tanks were saying , and continue to say , is that the Iranians are n’t even close to going nuclear , that they ’ve had technical difficulties and just do n’t have the capacity at present .
There is no imminent threat , no need to act , no reason to put a military strike against Iran " on the table , " as have all the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates except Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul .
According to Rubin , it was n’t the alarmists like himself who got it wrong : the Iranians are inveterate liars and ca n’t be trusted under any circumstances .
What ’s difficult for the neocons at this point is to transfer the liar - liar - pants - on - fire epithet to our own government .
Are they now saying we ca n’t trust the CIA , the DIA , and the rest any more than we trust the Iranian mullahs ?
Has the American intelligence community been infiltrated by the Revolutionary Guards ?
Good luck with that one , guys
Oh , this is truly a comedic situation , and I just ca n’t help taking an inordinate amount of pleasure in listening to the chorus of outrage that has greeted the NIE in neocon-land .
It ’s like music to my ears !
Ah , but I ’m saving the best  Norman Podhoretz , obviously  for last .
For now , we ’ll just have to content ourselves with the second - and third - tier neocon hacks at NRO and the Weekly Standard .
I ’m just getting warmed up
I had an especially good laugh over Frank Gaffney ’s contribution , which dismisses the NIE with the assertion that , since no one " outside a very small circle in Iran has certain knowledge about the current state of Iran ’s nuclear - weapons program , " therefore " we had better be prepared to use military force . "
In Gaffney ’s world , life is risky : if you ca n’t prove you are n’t a terrorist , then get ready for Guantanamo .
Countries have it worse .
Washington must know for certain that a given country is n’t about to nuke Washington , and they ’re guilty until proven innocent .
If you ’re the leader of a Muslim nation in the Middle East with a long history of hostility to Israel , expect an attack at any moment .
Poor Seth Leibsohn is beside himself .
He ’s so distraught by the NIE that he does us all a service by compiling a wide range of sources for the report ’s conclusions .
The New York Times attributes the estimate to " new information obtained from covert sources over the summer , " the Washington Post says it was " intercepted calls between Iranian military commanders , that steadily chipped away at the earlier assessment , " the Washington Times points to the defection of " a senior Iranian official , Ali Rez Asgari , " who " defected to the West during a visit to Turkey in February . "
USA Today , on the other hand , somewhat vaguely claims it was " news photos " that played a major role in turning the spooks around .
" Maybe it ’s all of this , " Leibsohn concludes , to which one can only add : Duh !
The Weekly Standard runs one Thomas Joscelyn , a blogger associated with fringe neocon David Horowitz and his David Horowitz Freedom Center .
As a self - proclaimed " terrorism expert , " Joscelyn had the honor of being cited by Rush Limbaugh recently for " proving " that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden really were in cahoots , in spite of the National Commission on 9/11 ’s conclusion that no such links existed .
He demands that the intelligence community immediately release to him the evidence for its conclusions  this in spite of his acknowledgment , in the beginning of his piece , that it can and should do no such thing .
The NIE seems to have unhinged the lesser neocons , who are reduced to the sort of noises a small mammal makes when cornered .
Norman Podhoretz , however , is quite a different story : his contribution to the " debate " is a perfect gem of the purest nihilism , a textbook example of Bizarro World logic .
According to Podhoretz , since the last NIE was wrong , this one can not be right .
They were wrong then , he wails , so how can we trust them now ?
This principle , applied to , say , the realm of science , would ensure that no progress , no advance on the road to truth , no technological or theoretical innovation would ever be possible , because , after all , scientists have been wrong before .
But truth is not Podhoretz ’s concern : he ’s already determined , a priori , that the truth is whatever he says it is .
This kind of radical subjectivism leads naturally to an accusation that the whole thing is a political ploy by Bush - haters in the national security bureaucracy who are sabotaging the lovely war he thought he talked the president into .
Podhoretz has " dark suspicions , " he confides , that the intelligence community is " bending over backwards " to avoid the mistakes it made during the run-up to war with Iraq .
Naturally , he avoids mentioning that he , Norman Podhoretz , was just as wrong as they were , if not more so  so why , given his own Bizarro World logic , should we believe anything he says ?
According to Norm , it was n’t the Iranians who succumbed to pressure from the international community to end their nuclear weapons program , it was the intelligence community that caved in to pressure in producing this NIE .
Intercepts , defectors , news photos , whatever  he is n’t interested .
The whole thing is a plot by the advocates of " appeasement " to undermine the sacred goal of killing thousands of Iranians and embroiling us in another war in the Middle East .
Okay , that was fun , now was n’t it ?
Yet there is a price to pay for all this glorious gloating  all pleasures , my Catholic conscience tells me , come with a price .
A number of commentators are now certain that , as Fred Kaplan puts it , " If there was ever a possibility that President George W. Bush would drop bombs on Iran , the chances have now shrunk to nearly zero . "
If only it were so .
The Iranian nuclear issue has always been a slow - burning fuse .
It took the neocons a good decade to gin up the invasion of Iraq and frame the Ba’athist regime on charges of covert WMD : taking on the much more formidable Persians , in the face of a more skeptical public , naturally requires an even greater effort .
Think of it as a long - term project , one that has been set back for the moment  but the damage is n’t irreparable .
This NIE can always be revised , although we can say with confidence that the thorough debunking undertaken by the intelligence community in this instance has thrown the War Party on the defensive .
Hence the howls of rage coming from the peanut gallery .
However , the nuclear issue has never been the primary thrust of the neocons ’ case for war with Iran : far more important has been the accusation that we are already at war with Iran because they ’re supposedly funding , harboring , and directing " terrorist " activities against U.S. troops in Iraq .
According to what the administration has been saying for many months , the Iranians are killing U.S. soldiers  so when are we going to take them out ?
Hillary Clinton , too , is asking this question : that ’s why she voted for the Kyl - Lieberman resolution declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guards to be an official " terrorist " organization , the only time a military component of a foreign regime has been so defined .
Kyl - Lieberman will give the president full authority to engage in " hot pursuit " and precipitate a cross - border incident with Iran that could easily escalate into a full - scale military conflict .
It ’s a very long Iranian - Iraqi border that snakes through every enclave of ethno- religious tension in the region .
Somewhere in that vast and volatile wilderness the first shots of what George W. Bush warns is going to be World War III will be fired : it ’s the most likely scenario , far more plausible and defensible than a strike at what the administration claims are nuclear facilities in or near heavily populated Iranian cities .
War with Iran is no less likely now than it was last week , last month , or last year .
Indeed , it is conceivable that the chances of just such a provocation occurring sometime before we get a new president have increased , precisely because the War Party has been dealt such a devastating setback on the nuclear front .
Desperation makes people do very odd things , and in this case I would reverse one of Victor Davis Hanson and Michael Rubin ’s arguments and apply it to those seemingly intent on taking us into yet another disastrous war , including the president .
Hanson and Rubin argue that the Iranians are not entirely of sound mind , that all that stuff about the Twelfth Imam returning indicates an irrational millennialism that can only end in a nuclear conflagration .
In short , the Iranians are crazy .
I suggest Rubin , Podhoretz , et al. , take a good , long look in the mirror .
Unlike Iran ’s hardliners , ours are openly calling for war .
As crazy as Ahmadinejad and his pals may be , Podhoretz and his pals are even wackier .
I ’d sure like to believe that the relatively rational sectors of our government  the professional intelligence analysts , career diplomats , and assorted " realists " in the national security bureaucracy  have succeeded in putting a stake through the heart of the neocons and spiking the much - rumored war plans of this administration .
Unfortunately , I owe it to my readers to tell it like it is : do n’t break out the champagne just yet .
Oh , and keep your eye on the Iran - Iraq border , including the somewhat blurry line of demarcation in the Gulf .
We are n’t in the clear yet , not by a long shot , and we wo n’t be until all U.S. troops are out of Iraq .
February 6 , 2008 , 9:20 am
Over at Climate Skeptic , I discuss a Cato study that finally gets at an issue I have tried to press for years :
That even if one accepts the worst of the IPCC warming scenarios ( which I do not ) the
cost of CO2 abatement , particularly in terms of lost economic growth , is far
higher than the cost of rising temperatures -- ESPECIALLY for the poor .
Hurricanes are a great example .
The world is probably warming a bit due to man 's CO2 , but likely less than the catastrophic rates one sees in the press .
This warming may or may not increase hurricane severity .
But let 's assume it does .
Let 's say Asia faces an extra cyclone or two each year from global warming .
Over time , trends in deaths from hurricanes and severe deaths have shown no correlation with storm frequency or severity .
Death rates from storms track nearly perfectly with wealth :
As wealth has increased in the US , severe storm deaths have dropped to nearly zero ;
Where countries are less wealthy , they experience more death .
Bangladesh is not the site of some of the deadliest storms on record because they get hit by the worst storms , but because they are poor .
( figure source )
As a result , if we really face this tradeoff ( which I doubt ) the world still is better off richer with 10 hurricanes than poorer with 8 .
Content filter version one : A massive , network - wide dragnet .
Not really feeling that Big Bro deal , even though RIAA chief Cary Sherman says it " does n't give rise ... to any privacy concerns because it can operate automatically and anonymously " ?
It 's cool , there 's a better approach : A locally installed filter on your computer .
Advertisement
As a bonus , a local filter would defeat encrypted torrents , since you 've gotta decrypt 'em , at which point the filter would kick in .
Sherman is a smart cookie though , and knows people are n't just gonna sign up to have their machine lojacked :
" Why would somebody put that on their machine ?
They would n't likely want to do that , they'd do that when it benefits them such as for viruses and so on and so forth ... it could be enforced at the modem or put in by the ISP . "

I 've got nothing here .

Comcast Cable Bait & Switch – Sales Tactic #
8
This post is part of the Sales Tactics Revealed series .
Make sure you check out the other Sales Tactics .
Have you read my post on How 5 Minutes Can Save You $ 120 ?
If so , beware the advice I gave because it may come back to bite you !
How 5 Minutes Can Cost You $ 180
Comcast just pulled a version of bait and switch on me today ; do n’t fall into the same trap .
I did n’t give the details in my original post , but I was able to drop my cable bill $ 20 a month for 6 months by upgrading from Expanded Basic to Digital Cable .
What I did n’t know is that I was actually setting myself up to lose money in the long run .
Comcast Baits the Trap
At the time Comcast offered several tiers of service : Limited Basic , Extended Basic , and Digital Cable .
I felt I was paying more money for cable than I needed to be .
We receive many , many channels we do n’t watch and wanted something in between the Limited & Extended Basic plans in terms of channels available and rates .
They did n’t offer such a package and would n’t give me a discount on Extended Basic but did make the offer to drop $ 20 a month from my current bill if I upgraded for “ free trial ” of Digital Cable .
I was n’t really interested in Digital Cable but wanted the discount so I agreed to the deal .
I specifically asked the phone rep if I could switch back to Extended Basic after the 6 months ended and he assured me that I could .
The Trap is Sprung
My six months has ended so my cable bill jumped back up , not to the Extended Basic rate but the even higher Digital Cable rate .
I took in my digital box today to cancel Digital Cable and revert back to Extended Basic and they informed me that was no longer an option .
Comcast is phasing out Extended Basic and slowly moving channels over to Digital Cable in preparation for a 2009 change to all digital broadcasting .
Comcast ’s Bait & Switch
Comcast knew what they were doing six months ago when they baited me into changing over to Digital Cable .
They knew Extended Basic was going away and that I would n’t be able to change back to the service when my promotion ended .
I ’m not sure what angers me more , the fact the phone rep lied to me last spring or the horrible customer service they offered when delivering the news today .
Their only response to my protests about being lied to was :
“ We apologize an uninformed associate gave you the wrong information but we ca n’t help you .
We ’re not allowing anyone to transfer to Extended Basic ” .
A company that values their customers and discovers that one of their employees misled a customer will take the necessary action and correct the wrong in the eyes of the customer .
The fact that Comcast is n’t willing to do that leads me to believe they knew exactly what they were doing when they made the offer and intentionally lied to me in order to convert me over to Digital Cable .
Financial Implications
Now I ’m faced with the option of paying an extra $ 15 a month for Digital Cable ( $ 180 annual increase ) or looking for an alternative .
For whatever reason , Comcast is the only cable option in my part of the city so I ’ll have to research the Dish network or DIRECTV .
Be aware of this tactic since Comcast seems to be heavily promoting the Digital Cable route .
As I stood in line today I heard the reps try and push the digital box on many other customers .
You ’ve been warned : )

Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren
Is Close to Getting It
Submitted by davidswanson
Rep .
Lofgren is sending the following letter to her constituents who urge her to back impeachment hearings .
Please let her know that impeachment hearings are not a leap ahead to impeachment , and that they need not take long , given the evidence already publicly known .
Point out to her that contempt is a process that could take months or years .
Phone ( 202 ) 225-3072 – fax 202-225-3336 .
Thank you for contacting me in support of impeachment .
I understand that great passion and urgency is felt on this subject .
When I voted to send H.R. 333 to the Judiciary Committee , I felt that it was the right thing to do .
My decision was not based on fear of confronting either the President or Vice President .
Rather , it was undertaken in an effort to conform to the requirements of the Constitution .
I have been involved in both of the modern impeachments in the House .
First as a staff member in the office of my predecessor , Congressman Don Edwards , when the House Judiciary Committee reported out articles of impeachment against President Nixon .
My second impeachment experience was as a Member of the House serving on the Judiciary Committee when Congress impeached President Clinton .
The standard for impeachment of a President or Vice President is very clear in the Constitution .
The standard is “ treason , bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
While the impeachment of President Clinton gained majority support in the House , it did not comply with the requirements of the Constitution .
I will never be involved in any impeachment effort that does not comply with the Constitution .
Clearly , a vote on H.R. 333 on the House floor after one hour of debate , as urged by Congressman Kucinich , would not have afforded the opportunity to explore and insure that Vice President Cheney ’s conduct had met the standards in the Constitution on which to base impeachment .
I have strongly objected to many of the actions and policies of President Bush and Cheney .
In fact , I believe that this is the worst administration in American history .
It is abundantly clear that they have had an unrelenting objective to expand executive power at the expense of the authority of both the judicial and legislative branches .
I oppose these efforts .
However , to determine that these efforts meet the standards for impeachment in our Constitution would require more .
I recall that the impeachment inquiry into President Nixon ’s behavior took more than half a year and that development of the facts were aided by information gained in Senate hearings held a year before the House Judiciary Committee vote .
Substantial additional evidence was also provided to the Judiciary Committee by the special prosecutor investigating the administration .
As you may know , the House Judiciary Committee has voted on and reported out contempt citations for both Josh Bolton , the President ’s Chief of Staff , and Harriett Myers , the former White House Counsel .
I expect that the full House will consider these contempt citations before the end of the first session of this Congress .
In the pursuit of this matter we may well find necessary information for the further consideration of H.R. 333 .
We will also find out whether the judiciary will assist the legislative branch in compelling the executive to produce information necessary for Congress to discharge its duties .
In my opinion , there is a tremendous need to undo the damage this administration has done to our country .
The Democratic majority in the House is eager to place the legislative and judicial branches back in their traditional and appropriate roles as evidenced by our successful efforts to rewrite the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Should the nation choose both a Democratic President and Democratic Congress in the 2008 elections , the first order of business as far as I am concerned , is overturning what this administration has done to alter the traditional constitutional checks and balances , aided for the last 8 years by a Republican House .
Should voters decide to return me to the House in the 111th Congress , I will be in the forefront of that effort .
It is a task that I look forward to with eager anticipation .
Sincerely ,
[ Signature ]
Zoe Lofgren Member of Congress

If you are hesitant about choosing the perfect template for your website , then maybe it is high time to stop browsing and order one for yourself .
There are many professional companies who can forge your concept into an ideal template .
However , gathering all the necessary details and information about these suppliers can be troublesome and time - consuming .
To simplify this process , you should employ a professional RFP template for software development .
With a nearly unlimited pool of WordPress themes to choose from , it becomes so easy to feel overwhelmed and resort to inaction or choosing a low - quality theme .
In cases where you have a lot of options , it pays to know exactly what you need .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
In this post , I ’ll share what I believe are the most important factors to consider , so that you know exactly what to bear in mind the next time you ’re on the hunt for a good theme .
Put another way , how much easier is buying a bottle of wine when you know that you prefer reds and that your favorite red is Australian Shiraz ?
This small amount of knowledge cuts a choice between 500 bottles in a store down to 10 .
To start off , let ’s answer one of the most common questions asked :
Is it worth paying for a WordPress theme , or can you get away with a free one ?
1. Price : Free Vs. Premium WordPress Themes
Several years ago , the price of a theme was a good indicator of its quality .
Free themes were often poorly coded at best , and were used to capture sensitive user data at worst .
But times have changed , and developers in the WordPress community have created thousands of great free themes to choose from .
As such , there is no conclusive winner .
Both free and premium themes have their pros and cons , which are detailed below .
Pros of Premium Themes
More updates .
Perhaps the most compelling reason to choose a premium theme is that such themes are typically updated more often .
Given the rapid evolution of the WordPress content management system ( CMS ) , having a theme that is regularly updated to patch new security issues is critical .

Less recognizable design .
Because free WordPress themes are so popular , it ’s not uncommon for tens of thousands of websites to use the same free one .
Premium themes are less common , which set them apart a bit more .

No attribution links .
Many free themes often require a link to appear in the footer crediting the theme ’s author .
While this is becoming less common in free themes , you can be sure that no links are required in premium themes .
Cons of Premium WordPress Themes
The price .
You ’ll have to invest anywhere between $ 50 to $ 200 in a premium theme .

Unwanted features .
Premium themes tend to include a lot of bells and whistles , such as multiple slider plugins , a portfolio manager and extra skins .
While these do make a theme very versatile , a lot of unwanted features will bloat the theme .
In general , the most important aspect to look for in a theme , whether free or paid , is the quality and care that ’s gone into making it .
The quality of the code will influence everything we discuss in this article , from security to page speed .
The easiest way to gauge quality is to read what customers are saying .
If a theme has a public support forum , read what kinds of issues people are having , and how responsive the developers are in resolving them .
2. Speed : Lightweight Vs. Feature - Heavy Themes
In my last post here on Smashing Magazine , I emphasized the importance of optimizing website speed .
Fast page - loading speed does not just improve the general user experience of a website , but has also been confirmed to improve search engine rankings , conversion rates and , thus , online revenue .
It should come as no surprise that I recommended avoiding sluggish themes like the plague .
Understanding a problem is the first step to avoiding it .
So , what causes a theme to drag a website ’s page speed into the gutter ?
In general , it comes down to three things :
Too feature - heavy .
Be wary of themes that boast 10 different sliders , 20 preinstalled plugins and a lot of JavaScript animation .
While this might sound like a good deal , no website that makes HTTP requests to 50 JavaScript files will run optimally .

Overuse of large file formats .
The keyword here is “ overuse , ” which admittedly is a bit subjective .
Try to steer clear of themes that use a lot of full - width images , background videos , etc .
Less is more .

Less is more .
Poor coding .
From wildly scaled images to inline CSS injection , poor coding has a significant impact on website performance .
As mentioned , poor code usually means that a theme has n’t been updated in a long time , so always check a theme ’s update history .
Here ’s a litmus test you can use to figure out how bloated a theme is .
Go to the Pingdom Website Speed Test , enter the URL of a theme ’s demo and see how long the page takes to load and how many HTTP requests are made .
Let me give you a quick comparison as a benchmark .
Earlier this year , I built two websites with very different theme frameworks .
The first website , BrokerNotes , was built with the Frank theme ( a very lightweight theme designed for speed ) .
According to Pingdom , the home page makes 38 HTTP requests and loads in under 1 second .
3.9
Mb in bandwidth is way too heavy though .
Now , let ’s compare this to Qosy , a website I built using a relatively feature - heavy theme .
As you can see , the home page makes 61 HTTP requests and take just over 2.5 seconds to load .
While still not bad , that ’s a noticeable increase in loading time .
Themes that make hundreds of HTTP requests before showing any content are not uncommon .
Avoid them unless you ’re confident that you can slice off some of that fat .
3. Design And User Experience
Of course , the purpose of a theme is to make your website look great and show off your brand in the best possible light .
While design can be quite subjective , you will boost your odds of finding a well - designed theme by following a few steps .
Not a pretty website at all !
( View large version )
First , search on websites where the best designers sell their themes .
This might sound obvious but is still worth mentioning .
ThemeForest is my personal favorite , but plenty of other good ones are out there , including StudioPress and Elegant Themes .
Secondly , spend some time browsing the demo .
Does the website feel easy to use ?
Is there enough white space ?
Do you get a headache looking at it ?
Does it excite you ?
This is where your gut feeling plays an important role .
Finally , be sure to choose a theme that is cross - browser compatible and has been built with accessibility in mind .
4. Responsiveness
While mobile traffic varies between industries , most reports seem to agree that , on average , about 30 % of all website visits now come from mobile and tablet devices .
Regardless of the exact ratios , there ’s no excuse to use anything but a responsive theme .
Thankfully , virtually all reputable themes are mobile - friendly out of the box , so the lack of responsiveness in a theme is really a red flag .
Most theme vendors allow you to filter out themes that are not responsive .
Another good option is to look through a curated list of responsive themes .
One of the best ways to determine whether a responsive theme is good or not is to run the demo through Google ’s new mobile - friendliness tool .
5. SEO
When enabled with one of the many good SEO plugins , WordPress is one of the most SEO - friendly CMS ’ around .
However , plenty of themes render all manner of on - site SEO mistakes , such as the omission of header and alt tags , full - blown duplicated content and dynamic URL errors .
When choosing a theme , look for “ SEO optimized ” or “ SEO ready ” in the theme description , but do n’t trust it blindly .
A lot of developers include this to check of a box and sell their theme .
That being said , knowing that a designer has at least considered SEO when developing their theme does offer some assurance .
A good practice is to install an extension for the Chrome browser , such as MozBar or SEO Site Tools , to run some quick SEO checks on a theme ’s demo .
Explaining what to look for is beyond the scope of this article , but that has been covered in depth by Joost de Valk .
6. Ease Of Customization
A customization dashboard has become standard in a lot of themes .
This saves you the hassle of having to make direct changes to style sheets .
In addition , plugins such as Visual Page Editor make it easy to build complex page structures without having to touch code .
While some of these WYSIWYG editors are somewhat limiting , I find that overall they ’re very beneficial to getting a website looking very nice with little effort .
If a developer has a demo of their administration panel , I ’d recommend playing around with it to make sure you can customize everything you need to .
7. Security
A lot affects the security of a website , including hosting , plugins and password strength .
Look at reviews of the best hosting companies , and pay attention to which of them prioritize security .
Daniel Pataki has already covered some great steps to secure your WordPress installation .
This should not be an afterthought ; rather , consider it when selecting your theme .
As when you ’re buying a home , one of the best things you can do to gauge a theme ’s security is to read what customers say about it .
Unless a theme was created by a trustworthy developer , I avoid any theme that does n’t have many downloads or reviews .
My advice is to evaluate themes on community websites like ThemeForest , where all customer reviews are displayed by default .
This level of transparency tends to reveal the truth about themes , which you would n’t get directly from a developer ’s website .
While buying a theme directly from its developer ’s website is fine , do so only after evaluating it on a community website with transparent reviews .
If a theme has a security loophole , then customers have probably picked up on it and flagged it in their reviews for future customers .
While the developer might have fixed such issues , the overall ratings from customers should give you an idea of a theme ’s overall quality .
How To Choose A Wordpress Theme - Conclusion
While ticking off all of these boxes might sound ambitious , the truth is that they ’re interrelated , and they all come back to a single point :
Themes should be built with quality in mind .
One of the best things you can do when choosing a theme is to learn about the person or company who made it .
If they have a reputation to live up to , then their themes will undoubtedly be of a higher quality than developers who do n’t .
Of course , no theme is perfect , and you ’ll almost always have to make some compromises .
That being said , with the recommendations in this post , you are hopefully now better informed to avoid the really bad themes and to choose one that is fast , well coded and SEO - friendly and that includes all of the features you need .
The subject says almost all of it .

I just wanted to generate a pie chart ( PS : I have no connection to this Google service beyond working at the same megacorp . )
The Arkansas Legislature scrambled today to rewrite a bill intended to protect storm victims after Gov. Mike Huckabee , a Baptist minister , objected to language describing such natural phenomena as tornadoes and floods as ' ' acts of God . ' '
Mr. Huckabee said that signing the legislation '' would be violating my own conscience ' ' inasmuch as it described ''a destructive and deadly force as being ' an act of God . ' ''
The Governor , a Republican , said the legislation was an otherwise worthy bill with objectives he shared .
Mr. Huckabee did not veto the bill but instead asked that it be recalled by the General Assembly .
He suggested that the phrase '' acts of God ' ' be changed to '' natural disasters . ''
The House of Representatives refused today to remove the offending phrase , but added the words , '' or natural disasters ' ' after the words '' acts of God . ' '
The female condom has never caught on in the United States .
But in the third world , where it was introduced in the late 1990s , public health workers hoped it would overthrow the politics of the bedroom , empower women and stop the AIDS epidemic in its tracks .
It did not .
Female condoms never really caught on there , either .
Only about 12 million female condoms are delivered each year in poor countries , compared with about 6 billion male condoms .
Couples complained that the female version was awkward , unsightly , noisy and slippery — or , as Mitchell Warren , who was one of its earliest champions , now says , “ the yuck factor was a problem . ”
Many women tried it , but in the end , it was adopted mainly by prostitutes .
Now scientists are trying again .
A new design — much the same at one end , different at the other — has been developed , and its makers hope it will succeed where its predecessor failed .
“ Over 15 years , there ’s been no real competition , no second - generation product , ” said Michael J. Free , head of technology at PATH , a nonprofit group based in Seattle that did the redesign .
“ There ’s no lack of interest , but we ’ve been stalled . ”

I 'll admit , this post is a bit tongue in cheek .
It 's mostly inspired by the numerous Rails Community anti-Java posts .
For the record , I do n't see J2EE and RoR as competing .
They each have different strengths and weaknesses and excel in different areas .
Anyway ( images from payscale.com ) :
These are in no way comprehensive , or even accurate , considering according to these guys I 'm way over the median .
But , as they say , nothing lies like polls , statistics , drunks and children .
And nothings impresses like pretty charts
The difference in median pay ( in my area ) is a new car every two years .
It 's interesting to note that there were 126 respondents to the Rails survey and 959 for the J2EE survey .
I could n't find any cool charts on number of job postings by category , but , I tend to use job postings as one of the best predictors ( and validators ) of a technology .
One of my primary objectives , as an engineer , is to stay employed and employable .
A quick check on computerjobs.com shows : 171 Ruby Jobs and 2689 Java jobsdice.com shows 636 Ruby Jobs and 14856 java jobs I think one of the primary reasons that the pay will be lower for RoR is actually the fault of the RoR community .
The framework is constantly promoted as .
Yet , you often hear , even form the experts , that Java is .
It is quite a bit harder to negotiate a higher salary to perform an " easy " task .
I think to bring salaries up , they need to drop the " easy " part .
Development is hard , and no language or platform is going to change that .
We solve complex problems .
Complex problems are hard to solve .
period .
They should focus on the productivity gains in the areas where Rails shines , and try to avoid the areas where it does n't .

The way I see it , if youâ€ ™re a self - aggrandizing , loudmouthed peckerhead whose successful career is built on being a self - aggrandizing , loudmouthed peckerhead , the least you can do is own your own persona .
Stick to your rage .
Cherish your bigotry .
Wrap your narcissism in swaddling cloths of steel and never ever let it go .
Thatâ€™s a little thing called â€œintegrityâ€ …. and Mr. Chris Matthews , Iâ€™m talking to you .
One controversial comment , a few bitchslaps from every major feminist organization ( and your boss ) , and you fold like a pair of well - worn granny panties .
Why , Chris ?
Why ?
So … you routinely salivate while interviewing attractive female guests .
So you have an obsession with castration scenarios involving powerful females .
So your view of American women is limited to sweetly ignorant homemakers and demonic man-hating harpies .
So what , big guy ?
MSNBC doesnâ€™t pay you to put on the pancake and be rational or dignified , for Godâ€™s sake .
That tenuous hold on sanity youâ€™ve got going is the slimy , oozing heart of your appeal .
Oh , Chris .
You didnâ€™t â€œsound likeâ€  you were claiming Hillary Clintonâ€™s entire political success was the direct result of Billâ€™s inability to keep his cigar in his pants ; you were laying down your truth , baby .
You were committed .
Now , with this wimpy , weaseling semi-apology , youâ€™ve caved to those nut - busting feminazis â€ “ and betrayed your true self .
Please , please , Chris Matthews : come back to us .
Find yourself again .
Snarl and foam your way back into our hearts .
One thing , though : lose the public hard - on for Ann Coulter , okay ?
Because thatâ€™s just stank .
FEBRUARY 7--Dozens of reputed Gambino crime family members and associates were named today in a racketeering indictment charging the New York - based Mafia family with most of the felonies covered in the United States Code ( murder , narcotics distribution , robbery , extortion , loansharking , securities fraud , labor schemes , etc. ) .
But we 're going to focus on the 83 wiseguy nicknames listed in the 169 - page indictment , which was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn .
As seen on these pages , the charged hoodlums include ' The Greaseball , ' ' Bobby the Jew , ' ' Tommy Sneakers , ' and ' Mike the Electrician . '
Some arrestees , like Gambino captain Leonard DiMaria , even have multiple nicknames .
DiMaria , the indictment notes , is known alternately as ' L , ' ' Lenny , ' ' The Conductor , ' ' Nike , ' ' Uncle , ' and ' Fatso . '
Until his death in June 2002 , John Gotti , pictured at right , headed the Gambino family , which , next to the Genovese crew , is the country 's second most powerful Mafia group .

The latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations were released this morning , and , as expected , a number of high profile consumer magazines took a big hit in overall circulation while others saw a precipitous drop at the newsstand .
Among the top 25 magazines in terms of total paid and verified circulation , only AARP ( with a membership - based paid circulation of 23.4 million for its bimonthly magazine ) showed an increase of more than two percent over the second half of 2006 .
Time ( - 17.57 % ) Playboy ( - 10.04 % ) and Reader ’s Digest ( - 7.64 % ) all showed significant drops in overall circulation .
In terms of single copy sales , seven of the top 10 showed decreases in sales in the last six months of 2007 versus the previous year , with Glamour ( down 13.24 % ) taking the biggest hit .
American Media Inc. ’s National Enquirer ( - 15.25 % ) and Good Housekeeping ( - 20.71 % ) also saw significant declines among the top 25 magazines sold at the newsstand .
Even Every Day with Rachael Ray , one of the industry ’s most heralded launches in recent memory , struggled to match its 2006 newsstand success , with its single copy sales dipping 6.37 percent .
( The magazine , however , more than made up for it in total subscriptions , climbing 133.7 percent — one of the largest increases in the industry . )
While the celebrity titles did n’t suffer a precipitous decline in single copy sales , their former dominance has been tainted with continuing weak performances–even if they are still in the top 25 .
It was n’t so long ago when newsstand trackers were commenting that the celebrity category was almost single - handedly propping up newsstand sales as a whole .
People ( - 8.49 % ) , Star ( - 4.10 % ) , In Style ( - 8.59 % ) , and Life & Style Weekly ( - 9.67 % ) are all down , while In Touch Weekly ( .06 % ) , Us Weekly ( 2.74 % ) and OK ! ( 7.13 % ) showed nominal increases .
Still , these seven celebrity titles account for about 32 percent of overall single copy sales in the top 25 .
In the consumer business category , most titles were either flat or down in terms of overall paid circulation , with a few notable exceptions .
Fast Company ’s single copy sales jumped nearly 38 percent , though its overall paid circulation remained flat ; BusinessWeek ’s single copy sales increased 9.3 percent in the second half of 2007 , while its overall circulation inched up 1.3 percent .
( Interestingly , Business 2.0 — which folded in September — did not have a terrible year , as its average paid circulation decreased just 3.8 percent ; it tanked , however , at the newsstand . )
Predictably , the major newsweeklies — arguably the category most affected by the seismic cultural shift to the Web — did little to dispel that notion .
Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report were flat ;
Time saw a dramatic drop of 19.4 percent in single copy sales .
Meanwhile , the Economist ( up 12.8 % overall , 10.1 % in single copy sales ) and The Week ( 8.1 % ) posted circulation gains .

The Design and Implementation of Typed Scheme .
POPL 2008 .
When scripts in untyped languages grow into large programs , maintaining them becomes difficult .
A lack of types in typical script ing languages means that programmers must ( re ) discover critical piecs of design information every time they wish to change a program .
This analysis step both slows down the maintenance process and may even introduce mistakes due to the violation of undiscovered invariants .
This paper presents Typed Scheme , an explicitly typed extension of an untyped scripting language .
Its type system is based on the novel notion of occurrence typing , which we formalize and mechanically prove sound .
The implementation of Typed Scheme additionally borrows elements from a range of approaches , including recursive types , true unions and subtyping , plus polymorphism combined with a modicum of local inference .
Initial experiments with the implementation suggest that Typed Scheme naturally accommodates the programming style of the underlying scripting language , at least for the first few thousand lines of ported code .
The key feature of occurrence typing is the ability of the type system to assign distinct types to distinct occurrences of a variable based on control flow criteria .
You can think of it as a generalization of the way pattern matching on algebraic datatypes works .

See what Lissen Up TV had to say in their recent documentary of one of London ’d fastest growing underground events .
ABSORBED by speculation about their government 's future after an inquiry commission this week released its final report on the 2006 Lebanon war ( see article ) , Israelis seemed briefly to forget about last week 's dramatic breach of the Gaza - Egypt border by Hamas , the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip .
Yet in Gaza as in Lebanon , the short - sighted planning that the Winograd commission criticised was much in evidence .
More to the point , there is a gloomy sense among Israelis , alongside a pleasurable mood of Schadenfreude across much of the Arab world , that Israel has taken a bad knock .
The border breach seems to have taken Israeli leaders and generals by surprise , yet there was no shortage of warnings .
Blowtorched perforations outlining a large hole in the corrugated - iron border fence had been noticed by outsiders in October and mentioned in meetings with Israeli officials .
A European military source says Egyptian officers first warned their Israeli counterparts in November of a possible breakout .
Perhaps a stream of such low - level alerts had dulled the military planners ' senses .
And Hamas bided its time .
After an Israeli suspension of fuel deliveries provoked widespread power cuts , Hamas took advantage of international sympathy to knock down the border wall , letting hundreds of thousands of Palestinians stream into the nearby Egyptian towns of Rafah and el - Arish to stock up on goods .
The mood among Gazans was one of euphoria mixed with desperation , as young boys , old women and hardened traders and smugglers scrambled up and down ladders and struggled across ditches under the flattened wall to grab whatever they could from Egyptian shops and hawkers on the other side .
The array of goods , some on donkey - carts , others on pick - up trucks , mostly on people 's backs , was baffling in its magnitude : bags of cement , mattresses , Japanese scooters , goats , cows , chickens , flour , washing - up liquid and soap , cans of every sort of fuel , chairs ; in one battered car , four live sheep were crammed into the back seat .
But the sense of freedom and exhilaration was also mixed with foreboding .
No one seemed to know what the future might hold .
By this week Hamas militants were co-operating with Egyptian troops to put the barbed wire back up .
But this is the third time Hamas has taken the world by surprise by keeping its extensive preparations discreet enough to be just under the radar .
And as with the first two times — its overwhelming election victory two years ago and its rout of forces loyal to Fatah , its secular rival , in Gaza last June — most would agree it has shifted the strategic balance .
The Egyptian and Israeli strategy , discreetly backed by many Arab countries , of strangling supplies to Gaza as a way to squeeze the population and make Hamas unpopular has backfired .
Hamas , which rejects a peace deal with Israel , is now seen as the people 's saviour , while Fatah 's Mahmoud Abbas , the moderate Palestinian president with whom Israel is holding peace talks in the hope of making him a more attractive choice to Palestinians , looks weaker than ever .
The breach also made Israel 's border with Egypt , which is 255 km ( 158 miles ) long and in many places has no fence , vulnerable to infiltrators .
Police in Sinai reportedly apprehended at least one team of armed Palestinians , equipped with suicide belts , sniper rifles , and detailed plans of Israeli border installations .
Above all , pressure has shifted onto Egypt .
Many Israelis would be happy to dump Gaza and its troubles in Egypt 's lap .
But as an offshoot of Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood , the main opponent to the regime of the ageing Hosni Mubarak , Hamas has considerable leverage over Egypt .
The Brotherhood had sponsored dozens of demonstrations in the week before the breach , demanding relief for Gaza .
Hamas has also been skilled at manipulating wider Arab opinion through television channels such as al - Jazeera , where its leaders swiftly moved from slamming Mr Mubarak for collaborating in the siege of Gaza to praising him after he let the Gazans in .
With viewers riveted to scenes of the Gazans ' joy at even a brief escape , the Arab mood was captured by Muhammad Abu Trika , a star Egyptian footballer , when he received a warning for raising his jersey after scoring during the current Africa Cup to reveal a T - shirt emblazoned with “ Sympathise with Gaza ” .
Hamas 's action succeeded also in sowing discord among its foes .
Israel has long accused Egypt of failing to stop smuggling across the border , to the point that its supporters in Congress had conditioned part of America 's $ 1.7 billion in annual aid to Egypt on imposing tighter controls .
The breakdown of control led to still more bitter recriminations .
Right - wing Israeli commentators claim the Egyptians may themselves have engineered the border collapse , with the aim of incorporating Gaza as part of a long - term strategy to encroach on Israel .
Egyptian conspiracy theorists see , instead , an Israeli plot to dump Gaza and its troubles on them .
Egypt 's tight - lipped foreign ministry blamed Israel for the problem , saying it remained Israel 's responsibility , as an occupying power ( though it withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005 ) , to find a solution to Gaza 's woes .
Yet Hamas cannot afford Gaza to lose all its economic ties with Israel or its political ties with the West Bank ; it cannot even issue passports that anyone will recognise .
So there is scope for compromise , but , says Ezzedine Choukri-Fishere , a former Egyptian diplomat who runs the Cairo office of the International Crisis Group , a Brussels - based lobby , “ unless somebody comes to their senses it will be difficult to achieve results ; there are four parties involved , all tied to each other , like four boats .
None can move alone , or impose a solution without engaging the others . ”
Hamas has proved that Gaza 's isolation cannot go on and that it can obstruct .
“ But it is now drunk with its victory , and thinks it can force Egypt into an agreement that would exclude the PAand Israel . ”
No wonder , then , that Egypt ordered its troops to let Gazans in for a few days and summoned a Hamas team , led by Mahmoud Zahhar ( see article ) , to Cairo for talks with Fatah to hash out a new deal for securing the border .
Mr Abbas wants the interim government he appointed after Hamas 's Gaza takeover in June to resume control of the Gaza - Israel crossings , perhaps with European supervision at the Rafah one into Egypt , as per a deal reached in 2005 .
The Arab League , the Europeans and the Americans back him .
However , none of them wants to involve Hamas in the arrangement .
Hamas , for its part , wants more say in running the crossings , particularly the Rafah one .
As it has shown , it can spoil any scheme it does n't like ; in any case , nobody else can run the crossings without its acquiescence .
It has used the crisis to repeat its demand for unconditional dialogue with Fatah , while Mr Abbas insists that it first apologise for the bloody overthrow in June .
Meanwhile , Israel has so far rejected any new border deal .
Do n't say Hamas is winning
Some prominent Israelis dismiss the idea that its squeeze - Gaza strategy has failed .
“ So Hamas destroyed the fence — so what ? ” says Ephraim Sneh , a former general and minister who is a member of parliament for the Labour party , which is part of Israel 's ruling coalition .
“ It ca n't restore the economy without connections with Israel .
If they keep firing rockets we 'll just close the border again . ”
Many others disagree .
Hawks think that since economic pressure and the continuing assassination of Hamas fighters have not stopped the Palestinians firing rockets from Gaza or weakened Hamas , a full military takeover of Gaza is the only remaining option .
But that would be bloody .
Hamas has been following the example of Hizbullah , Israel 's foe in south Lebanon , preparing bunkers and tunnels , reinforcing buildings and laying anti-tank mines along likely approach routes .
Eliminating Hamas 's militia would take months , and the army might have to stay in place for years — unpalatable echoes , especially in the wake of the Winograd report , of both the 2006 war in Lebanon and Israel 's earlier 18 - year occupation of it .
More pragmatic Israelis such as Ami Ayalon , a former head of Israel 's domestic security agency , the Shin Bet , who is a minister in the coalition government , argue for a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza .
The Islamists themselves have given hints that they are open to this , having previously demanded that it extend to the West Bank too .
The daily dose of rockets has dropped sharply since last week , suggesting that Hamas does have some control over the other groups that fire them and possibly signalling its openness to a deal .
Until something moves it will be ordinary Gazans and the rocket - weary residents of Israel 's southern towns , especially Sderot , who pay the price .
According to the UN , Gaza 's power supplies are still running at 75 % of normal , which means long power cuts in most places , sporadic running water , and 30 m litres of sewage a day being dumped near the beaches that are one of Gaza 's few natural resources .
Even the most basic food aid ( including flour and sugar ) is not getting in fast enough , and rubbish is piling up in the streets .
A lasting solution may not come quickly .
Each party , including Hamas , can make political capital from the continued closure of the borders , as long as it is not the one getting blamed .
But Hamas is the one that has gained in strength , while the others , Egyptian and Israeli governments included , are on the defensive .
According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service , entitled " Pakistan ’s Nuclear Weapons : Proliferation and Security Issues , "
" The main security challenges for Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal are keeping the integrity of the command structure , ensuring physical security , and preventing illicit proliferation from insiders .
" While U.S. and Pakistani officials express confidence in controls over Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons , it is uncertain what impact continued instability in the country will have on these safeguards . ”
U.S. officials confident that Pakistani nukes are safeguarded and secure against outsiders ?
Yes , according to a BBC interview of Pakistani " nuclear expert " Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy
“ The U.S. has been actively planning contingency measures as Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons are , and will remain , a major concern . ”
Hence , Pakistani personnel who guard actual weapons storage facilities have been sent to the U.S. for " training . "
As a result , according to another Pakistani " nuclear expert , " Brigadier Shaukat Qadir ,
“ Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons are only as much at risk as those of the U.S. or India , ”
Well , that ’s a relief .
Or is it ?
The Pentagon has just released its Defense Science Board Task Force on Nuclear Weapons Surety Report on the Unauthorized Movement of Nuclear Weapons .
If the Pakistani " surety " measures taken by " insiders " are no better than those of our Air Combat Command , we ’re all in a heap of trouble .
According to the DSB Task Force Report , on August 29th , 2007 , a pylon  carrying six cruise missiles , each armed with nuclear warhead  was without authorization removed from a nuclear weapons stockpile storage site at Minot AFB , transported without authorization  and mated without authorization  to a B - 52 bomber .
The nuke laden B - 52 then sat , improperly , unguarded overnight , and was then , without authorization , allowed to take off the following morning , make an unauthorized flight to Barksdale AFB , to make an unauthorized landing , and then sit , unguarded , until alert Barkdale personnel discovered the six nukes , just sitting there on their tarmac .
For more than 36 hours no one in the U.S. nuclear weapon command - and - control system knew where those nukes were , or in whose possession .
Not to worry .
The Task Force seems to conclude that it was a paperwork problem .
An ACC documentation problem .
Some of the cruise missiles in the Minot AFB nuclear weapon storage site contained live nuclear weapons , but others did not .
However , as incredible as it seems , neither the external appearance nor the serial numbers of the cruise missiles reflected which was which .
And even though the custody of these " nuke - capable " missiles changed at least three times at Minot AFB , there were no paper trail , no check lists and no formal chain - of - custody documentation .
The DSB solution ?
" Re-establish formal change of custody requirements for any movement of nuclear - capable cruise missiles outside the weapons storage area , to include serial number verification and custody change documentation , using a formal document signed at each change of custody . "
Of course , that would n’t have prevented the Minot fiasco , because the serial numbers on the missiles that were actually moved matched those on the movement paperwork .
But Dave Lindorff has raised some deeply troubling  to anyone who knows anything about the care and feeding of nuclear weapons  objections to both the DSB and the Air Force unclassified - version reports of the incident .
" The problem with this explanation  for the first reported case of nukes being removed from a weapons bunker without authorization in 50 years of nuclear weapons  is that those warheads , and all nuclear warheads in the U.S. stockpile , are supposedly protected against unauthorized transport or removal from bunkers by electronic antitheft systems  automated alarms similar to those used by department stores to prevent theft  and even anti-motion sensors that go off if a weapon is touched or approached without authorization . "
Lindorff notes that the U.S. has just completed helping the Russians install state - of - the - art electronic " alarm and motion - detection systems " as well as " detectors for explosives , radiation and metal " at all Russian nuclear weapons and fissile - material storage sites .
There have been reports that we have similarly helped the Pakistanis .
Another thing .
Virtually every live nuclear weapon in our stockpile contains significant quantities of high - explosive .
In fact , one of the principal criteria for storage of our nukes is that the device be well electrically grounded at all times to prevent inadvertent detonation of that high - explosive and that the storage igloo be capable of containing that explosion in the event it occurs .
And if those " nuclear - capable " cruise missiles are routinely stored by the ACC at Minot already mounted six - to - a - pylon , that storage igloo for just one pylon better be capable of containing six of those explosions .
For multiple pylons stored in the same igloo , do n’t even think about it .
The DSB Task Force laments a " marked decline in the level and intensity of focus on the nuclear enterprise and the nuclear mission " within the Department of Defense .
" The decline is characterized by embedding nuclear mission forces in non-nuclear organizations , markedly reduced levels of leadership whose daily focus is the nuclear enterprise , and a general devaluation of the nuclear mission and those who perform the mission . "
In particular , strategic bombers were assigned to the new Air Combat Command  established when Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense  which is predominantly a tactical fighter command .
According to the DSB Task Force , B - 52 aircrews and weapons - handling crews spend as little as 5 % and no more than 20 % of their time on the " nuclear mission . "
Reportedly neither the B - 52 involved in the Minot fiasco , nor its crew , were " nuclear - qualified . "
As for the Minot AFB nuclear weapons storage site " nuclear - qualified " custodians and transportation crews and / or whoever disconnected all the electrical grounds and disabled all the radiation monitors and alarms , motion detectors and anti-theft devices  some of which one - point detonate the high - explosive to prevent theft and reverse engineering  and proceeded to handle six missiles armed with hundreds of pounds of conventional high - explosives like they were sacks of cement , they ’re lucky they ’re still alive .
The grand pooh - bahs of the Air Force apparently satisfied members of the Senate Armed Services Committee this week that the American people had never been in any real danger .
Unless , of course , you consider the possibility of being killed by high - explosives a real danger .

Day 1
Hi A.L ,
According to Australian Education Union election advertising , we need a federal government that will put public education first .
But do we need public education at all ?
Would there be anyone calling for it , if we did not have it already ?
People are used to the idea of state schools , so they do n’t think about how uneasily government - controlled education fits with liberal democracy .
If someone said that Australia ’s media should be owned by the state , with journalists told by the state what they should say , with media audiences examined to make sure they had absorbed the official line , there would be predictable and justifiable outrage .
Yet public education means essentially that for Australia ’s young people .
The government owns most schools , employs most teachers , tells them what to teach through state - set curricula , and examines students to make sure they have it right — even kids escaping to private schools can’t avoid these last two aspects of state - run education .
And unlike state - owned media , there are severe consequences for ignoring state education .
Across the political spectrum , activists want to use public education to influence young minds .
In his book Dumbing Down , Kevin Donnelly documents how left - wing academics and teachers shape curricula to fit their political agenda .
In government , the Liberal Party proposed a national history curriculum , which was widely seen as another front in the so - called ‘ culture wars ’ .
Rather than fostering social unity , as some of its supporters claim , state - controlled education is a source of division and nastiness .
Instead of allowing different groups to devise their own curriculum , and letting parents choose between them , we fight over a common curriculum .
The public education lobby stirs class and sectarian resentment in its attempts to take funding from private schools .
And what is it , can you remind me , that makes public education worth preserving ?

While she waited to own it , paying it off , Hanley , now a second - year fashion student at RMIT and as near to a professional corsetier as you can get , experimented , making her own corsets from scratch .
" They were OK , not so great when I look at them now , but I did n't want to wait .
I 'd fallen in love with that shape .
All these parts of you that you might not really like , suddenly moulded into this lovely , this gorgeous , shape . "
This hour - glass .
It is the iconic shape of woman : full breasts , narrow waist , wider hips .
Out of a fashion market awash with " shape - wear " - virtually high - tech elastic girdles and underpants that suck in , flatten and ostensibly shrink a womanly figure - corsets have emerged like cultural counterpoints , accentuating and celebrating curves , and not only in bridal and evening - wear , fetishist lingerie and gothic costume either .
Corsets have gone mainstream .
" They 're for people who like to look like people , more than people who look like grasshoppers , " states corset lover Janet Coath , 22 , a student of martial arts , part - time bookshop staffer , and owner of " seven or eight " bespoke , couture corsets .
So far .
" My first ever was blood red velvet , " she reminisced .
" It felt fantastic ; it hugs you .
I was addicted from that moment . "
Coath 's corsetier is Carly Van Groeningen , 21 , also a student , but as involved in corset making and design techniques as her studies in natural therapies .
" I love corsets because they are more of a challenge , more unique , and require precise measurements and a lot of fine work . "
They also meld well with her dramatic clothing designs , elegantly cinching the volume of one trumpet - sleeved satin gown , for example , pushing Janet Coath 's figure into a compelling , almost cartoonishly beautiful picture .
Van Groeningen took private corset - making lessons but , like Hanley and others who are reviving an art crushed by a century of bad press , she has had to rely more on trial and error to perfect her techniques .
" We learnt together , " she said of her teacher .
" There are some costume design courses that teach some corsetry , but they 're hard to find .
And it 's quite hard anyway ; you have to know how to use the right sort of boning , how to shape and finish , what corset suits what person and what they 'll be doing . "
The rarity of corsetiers means most corsets are still bought off - the - rack and online from companies geared to sexy and fetish lingerie .
But that market is changing , too .
Carol White of Corsets.com.au has done brisk business in her sexy and mostly imported American ready - to - wear corsets for three years .
But increasing demand for corsets suitable for wear with mainstream fashion , evening and bridal wear recently persuaded her to launch a new brand with business partner Rebecca Wood .
" Miss Kitty Couture will suit new styles of dresses , " says White , " or they can be worn on their own . "
Because the Miss Kitty Couture collection , due for launch in March , is off - the - rack , prices are comparatively cheap at $ 125 to $ 195 .
With a professional fitting ( White and Wood have a retail outlet called Naughty Butt Nice in Newport , staffed by expert fitters ) ,
White adds , that an off - the - rack corset is good value for money compared with a custom - made design .
For some corset connoisseurs , however , anything less than an haute couture version is still unthinkable .
They believe that the perfect , personalised design is only possible in the process that begins with an idea , teased out between client and corsetier .
It 's a process that can take a couple of days and one or two fittings , or up to three weeks and four fittings , depending on how elaborate the corset , how finicky the client and how busy the corsetier .
There are three basic corset styles : full corset ( over - bust ) , under - bust and waist cincher .
Prices average $ 180 to $ 200 for an haute couture version , up to $ 400 or more for exceptional corsets , and down to $ 39 for a lingerie style with synthetic boning .
The shape and length , internal structure and finishes vary so infinitely that a bespoke couture corset is not only unique , but innately " yours " .
There can be as many as 10 separate sections of stiffened wadding and outer fabric , each shaped , when flat , like a long hour - glass in a classic , full corset .
Each section or panel is also " boned " , meaning it is separated from the next by spiral steel rods sewn into the structure .
These flex : " They curve with your curves , allow you to move from side to side , " explains Hanley , to assume the hourglass shape when a corset is laced .
Up to 20 bones can be incorporated in a single corset .
In cheaper , off - the - rack styles , these are often plastic and serviceable enough , but unlikely to maintain their shape for as long as steel .
In corset hierarchy , plastic ranks the lowest .
In a classic corset , on the other hand , rigid , flat steel " bones " form a busk at the front or back or both , and force the stiffening , lengthening and straightening effect on the wearer 's spine .
" They are , simply , fantastic for your posture , " Coath says .
" And not uncomfortable to wear .
I can wear a corset for 12 hours , easily . "
There are devotees , however , whose passion evolves into obsession , and recalls corsets ' occasionally ugly Victorian history .
" Waist training " is a technique some women use to shrink their measurements over time .
" I do n't do it , but I know some who do , " Coath says .
" It needs to be done very carefully , or it can damage ribs and internal organs . "
Waist training is also a chore for the particularly dedicated : " They have to eat , sleep , work in them , " says Coath of the under - bust corsets or waist cinchers , designed to be laced tighter and tighter every day until a waist as tiny as 41 centimetres can be achieved .
" It does seem that waist training is coming back , " said Van Groeningen , " But it 's not good for you .
Most people wear a corset on special occasions , or for going out ; being able to see that proper , hourglass curve .
That 's enough .
That 's a rarity these days .
There 's no need to overdo it . "

KANSAS CITY , Mo. When a Starbucks moved in next door , the coffee fanatics who run the Broadway Cafe trembled .
Sure , they roasted their own beans and served up handmade espresso drinks to a loyal clientele .
But would it be enough to fight off a corporate behemoth ?
That was nearly 10 years ago , and now the results are in : the Starbucks is about to shut down .
The store had a funereal air the other day as a handful of loyal customers sipped beverages and jotted goodbye notes in what amounted to a book of condolences .
Next door , the Broadway Cafe was bustling .
“ You win because of the coffee , ” said Jon Cates , one of the owners .
After more than a decade of sensational buzz , Starbucks is struggling nationwide as it faces slowing sales growth and increased competition .
In 1991 , Pakistan 's intelligence services stashed a massive cache of assault rifles and ammunition at a secret weapons dump in Spin Boldak , rushing armaments across the border as a ( phony ) deadline loomed for ending direct supply of their favoured combatants in Afghanistan 's civil war .
Seventeen tunnels beneath the dump contained enough weaponry to arm thousands of soldiers .
Three years later , the Taliban broke the depot open and handed out rifles – still wrapped in plastic – to volunteers summoned from local madrassas , an incident documented in the authoritative book Ghost Wars .
Within 24 hours , the Taliban captured Kandahar , Mullah Omar took possession of the governor 's headquarters , and the airport was seized – with its six MiG - 21 fighter jets , four Mi-17 transport helicopters , fleet of tanks and armed personnel carriers .
The Taliban gutting of Afghanistan was on , nearly all opponents swept aside , Kabul falling with barely a whimper .
As Ghost Wars author Steve Coll so dryly put it : " Benazir Bhutto was suddenly the matron of a new Afghan faction . "
The late – twice – but no longer future prime minister of Pakistan was far , far from a stupid woman .
The Taliban was a gamble she took , cunningly if not without considerable trepidation – and certainly at the behest of a powerful intelligence service , the ISI , she feared but had to accommodate , in the doomed hope of retaining office .
But make no mistake :
The woman who is now being so widely mourned – assassinated last week , perhaps by the very elements she empowered more than a decade ago – was nurturing stepmother to terrorists incubated under her watch ; the same Islamist fanatics she inveighed against during the election campaign that came to a screeching halt in the calamitous assault on her motorcade .
She was a brave woman , without question , but Bhutto was much to blame for the tinderbox that Pakistan became during her exile in Dubai and London – the toxic military entanglement with the Taliban – having helped to create a monster that not even the sponsoring ISI can control any longer .
For years , during her second tenure as PM , Bhutto lied brazenly to Washington about the extent to which Pakistan , with her approval , was covertly arming and funding the Taliban .
As Bhutto admitted in a 2002 interview : " Once I gave the go - ahead that they should get the money , I do n't know how much money they were ultimately given ... I know it was a lot .
It was just carte blanche . "
For Bhutto , the objective was to keep a new Afghanistan yoked to Pakistan and out of India 's orbit .
( Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud was considered far too Delhi- friendly . )
Out of this relationship would flow the riches of a Pakistan - controlled trucking industry circumventing Kabul – a modern Silk Road trade incorporating the markets of Central Asia – the never realized gas pipeline from Turkmenistan , and training camps , off the Pakistan reservation , for fighters deployed to Kashmir .
Bhutto had an economic and political vision for Pakistan , one that depended largely on creating a compliant client state next door .
It all got away from her , as it did also from the ISI .
Indeed , Al Qaeda – now firmly interwoven with the Taliban – was contemptuous of Bhutto from the start , plotting her political demise , at the invitation of some ISI officers , as early as 1989 .
Maybe by 2007 , Bhutto had learned from her mistakes .
Perhaps there was more to her than the democratic platitudes she espoused , as Washington 's latest putative ally in the region .
But this was a woman who lied and connived with brio , bewitching even the most garrumphing skeptics with her intelligence , charm and beauty .
She 's already a better martyr than she ever was a leader of state .

More than 200 Palestinians have been killed since November
The boys were playing near the Jabaliya refugee camp .
The Israeli army said it had targeted a rocket - launching cell .
Later , two Hamas militants were killed by Israeli strikes in Beit Hanoun and on a security post near Hamas leader Ismail Haniya 's home in Gaza City .
On Wednesday , a rocket fired by Hamas killed an Israeli student near Sderot , the first such death in nine months .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said " terrorists " in the territory would pay a very heavy price for the attacks .
Assassinations and bombardment are not going to weaken the steadfastness and the determination of the Palestinian people

The US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , said that the Palestinian rocket attacks " need to stop " .
Ms Rice will visit the Middle East next week for talks with Mr Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has separately expressed " deep concern " at the escalation of violence in which at least 24 Palestinians have been killed in the last two days .
' Continuous crimes '
A string of Israeli air raids targeted Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip on Thursday .
In the afternoon , four boys reportedly aged between eight and 15 were killed whilst playing football near the al - Salam mosque in Jabaliya .
Three of them were members of the same family , according to the Palestinian news agency Maan .
GAZA AIR STRIKES
Thursday : Four children killed near Jabaliya refugee camp Hamas militant killed near Shati refugee camp Hamas militant killed near Beit Hanoun Three Hamas militants and two from Popular Resistance Committees killed in Gaza City Wednesday : Six - month - old boy killed near interior ministry Five Hamas militants near Khan Younis Islamic Jihad militant near Bureij refugee camp
An Israeli army spokeswoman told the AFP news agency it had launched " several strikes that targeted and hit rocket - launching cells " in the area .
Shortly afterwards , a separate Israeli strike in nearby Beit Hanoun killed a member of Hamas ' military wing , Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , medics said .
A Hamas security post 150 m from the home of the former Palestinian Prime Minister , Ismail Haniya , was also attacked by an Israeli helicopter , killing a member of Hamas and wounding four other people , officials said .
Hamas said Mr Haniya had not been in the area at the time and his home was not damaged .
After his office was bombed on Wednesday , Mr Haniya condemned what he called " continuous crimes " by Israel .
Earlier on Thursday , Hamza al - Haya , son of a prominent hardline leader in the Gaza Strip , Khalil al - Haya , was killed along with a fellow militant .
Another strike killed a Hamas militant and two from the Popular Resistance Committees .
The interior ministry building in Gaza City , run by Hamas , was hit on Wednesday evening .
The building was empty .
Israel has vowed the militants will pay a heavy price
Nearby buildings were caught in the blast , killing a baby and wounding at about 30 other people , Palestinian medical officials said .
Most of the other recent Palestinian fatalities have been militants , including five Hamas members killed in an air strike in Khan Younis on Wednesday morning .
Another two were killed by Israeli troops in the Balata refugee camp .
One of Hamas 's rockets exploded in a car park at Sapir College in Sderot late on Wednesday afternoon , killing an Israeli 47 - year - old studying at the college .
Although the Israeli fatality was the first caused by rocket fire in nine months , four other Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinian militants since the relaunching of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
In that time , more than 200 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military .

The former Mayor of San Francisco has made comments that contradict his own previous claims regarding a warning he received on September 10th 2001 not to fly the following day .
Willie Brown , the incumbent mayor of San Francisco at the time , was questioned earlier this month by members of the Philadelphia 9/11 Truth group during a public engagement .
Brown famously hit the headlines the day after 9/11 when he informed the San Francisco Chronicle of the early warning he received a full eight hours before the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington began .
Realizing the importance of this evidence of prior knowledge , we saved and archived the original article here .
Also see below for scans of the article in the Chronicle from September 2001 .
Brown , who was scheduled on a morning flight to New York where he was to attend a state retirement board meeting , had originally stated that the warning came from his “ security people at the airport " , without elaborating further .
In the months and years that followed , researchers demanded to know where this warning came from and why it was not subsequently addressed .
Philly 9/11 truth writes :
On February 12 , 2008 , Willie Brown spoke about his new book , “ Basic Brown : My Life & Our Times ” at the Free Library of Philadelphia .
After speaking , Brown took questions from the audience and emphasized , “ no subject was off - limits . ”
Little did Brown know , but he was about to be on the receiving end of some salient questions regarding his activities related to the events of 9/11/01 .
The Philly 9/11 Truth - squad unleashed a fury of questions pertaining to Brown ’s early warning , backing up their claims with reports from mainstream media publications .
Brown , while attempting to controvert the issue , contradicted previous statements he made to the San Francisco Chronicle in the September 12 , 2001 article titled “ Willie Brown got a low - key early warning about air travel . ”
Upon receiving the 9/11 group ’s first question about the warning , Willie Brown denied the existence of the Chronicle article altogether declaring " some jerk on the internet started that nonsense and it has taken on it ’s own life . "
A separate audience member then told the former mayor that he was holding the original article in his hand and began to read from it !
Brown then confirmed that despite his admissions to the Chronicle in 2001 , he was not asked to testify before the 9/11 Commission , encouraging the questioner to " drop it " .
When informing Mr Brown that several victims ’ family members interviewed on MSNBC brought up the issue , Brown became agitated and shot back " They ’re wrong , they ’re wrong , they ’re wrong , that is the end of it , they ’re wrong "
" Why do n’t you go to a library and read the 9/11 report … read the damn report " Brown continued , declaring that it " speaks for itself " despite the fact there is no mention of the prior warning .
Later on at a book signing the Philly group approached Brown again with the Chronicle article .
Brown responded " it means nothing , move on , move on friend , it did n’t happen " .
Watch the video :
Philly 9/11 truth points out the contradictions in Willie Brown ’s comments that directly conflict with his original statements .
Of course given that he now denies the existence of those statements altogether he obviously does n’t see them :
As Brown narrated his experience of the morning of 9/11 , he created a sequence of events contrary to existing accounts .
Brown stated that he received a call from “ one of his people ” – noting the caller as a female by referring to the person as “ her ” – that alerted him to the events happening in New York City .
This statement stands in stark contradiction to what Brown said to the San Francisco Chronicle because he reportedly did not receive any calls that morning until the District Attorney Terence Hallinan contacted him .
" You know , you ’re the first call I ’ve gotten on this , " Brown said to Hallinan , as they were signing off .
– San Francisco Chronicle 9/12/2001 Furthermore
Brown replied to questions about the 8 - hour advance warning by stating that the aforementioned warning was “ a reference to the standard report that comes out of Washington , everyday of our lives .
There are always those kinds of notices floating around … period and they did that regularly ” and told the questioner to “ drop it ! ” Prima - facie this claim is false because Brown stated in 2001 that he received a call from his “ security people at the airport ” which regarded Americans being cautious about their air travel .
Moreover , the call could not have been a general warning because the deputy director at the San Francisco International Airport details that there were no warnings made by the FAA in the days leading up to 9/11 in the following abstract : Mike McCarron , assistant deputy director at SFO , said the Federal Aviation Administration " routinely " issues security notices about possible threats .
He said two or three such notices have been received in the past couple of months , but none in recent days .
– San Francisco Chronicle 9/12/2001
As we can see , Brown ’s statements as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle on 9/12/2001 undoubtedly conflict the narrative he delivered on 2/12/07 in Philadelphia .
Only one question remains , who warned Willie Brown ?
Willie Brown ’s prior warning of the attacks was just one among scores of others that have been poured over by independent researchers but simply ignored by all official sources including the 9/11 Commission .

Explanation : Dust from curious near - Earth asteroid 3200 Phaethon seems to fall from the constellation Gemini in this fisheye skyview .
The composite image was recorded over four December nights ( 12 - 15 ) just last year from Ludanyhalaszi , Hungary .
Of course , the streaks are meteor trails from the annual Geminids meteor shower .
The work of astronomer Erno Berko , the finished picture combines 113 different frames and captures 123 separate meteors .
The Geminids is one of the northern skies most reliably performing meteor showers and did not disappoint last year .
Under good conditions some skywatchers reported well over 100 meteors per hour near the December 14/15 peak for the Geminids in 2007 .

It ’s been a particularly grim and bloody month on one of the world ’s great killing fields -- the United States of America .
On Friday , Los Angeles paused for the largest police funeral in its history when it buried Officer Randal Simmons , a 51 - year - old father of two and the LAPD ’s first SWAT team member to die in the line of duty .
Simmons was shot dead and Officer James Veenstra was badly wounded when they -- along with others in their unit -- rushed into a San Fernando Valley home where a disturbed young man had killed three members of his family and was believed to be holding others hostage .
In Oxnard this week , an eighth - grader walked into a classroom and fatally shot a classmate in the head , apparently because the boy was gay .
On Thursday , at Northern Illinois University , a graduate student walked into a lecture hall , shot five students to death and wounded 16 other people before committing suicide .

There have been three other campus shootings since Feb. 8 , including one at Louisiana Technical College , where a woman shot two students to death before killing herself .
Earlier in the month , a gunman in Kirkwood , Mo. , burst into a City Council meeting , killed five people and wounded the town ’s mayor .
A few days before that , a gunman herded five women in a suburban Chicago clothing store into a back room and shot them all to death in what authorities believe was a botched robbery .
All these wrenchingly tragic crimes are linked by a common factor -- the ubiquity of guns in America .
Given that we ’re in the midst of the most hotly contested presidential campaign in recent memory , you ’d think that all this bloodletting might become a campaign issue .
If you thought that , you ’d have reckoned without regard to the gun lobby ’s near - total victory among the politicians of both political parties .
The 2nd Amendment fundamentalists who cluster around the National Rifle Assn. are the most successful single - issue constituency in modern American politics .
The truth is that guns make the malicious , the malcontent and the mad powerful .
They confer the power of life and death on the demented and deranged -- and yet we do nothing .
There are more guns circulating in the U.S. today than ever before , somewhere around 250 million , according to projections by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .

The only one of the candidates who even nodded to the Illinois college massacre was Sen.
Barack Obama , who happens to vote an easy drive from the campus .
Campaigning Friday in Wisconsin , he said his “ prayers ” were with the victims and their families , then quickly added that he believes the 2nd Amendment confers an “ individual right ” to gun ownership .
The reason for that bob and weave is that the latter point is the gun lobby ’s current cause celebre .
Over the years , 11 of the 13 federal appellate districts have held that 2nd Amendment rights are collective , pertaining , as the Constitution says , to the maintenance of “ a well ordered militia . ”
Recently , however , a court in the District of Columbia struck down that jurisdiction ’s handgun ban , ruling that the 2nd Amendment confers individual rights to gun ownership .
The case -- District of Columbia vs. Heller -- is before the U.S Supreme Court .
Vice President Dick Cheney , 55 senators and 250 members of the House have filed a brief supporting the individual rights position to which Obama hastened to show such deference .
It is n’t as if our lawmakers are n’t willing to do something to protect our students , however .
Twelve state legislatures -- those in Alabama , Arizona , Georgia , Indiana , Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Virginia and Washington -- are considering bills that would allow students who obtain concealed - weapons permits to carry guns on campus .
Presumably , they ’ll only fire in self - defense .
Confronted with this sort of social idiocy , it ’s hard to know whether to chortle or choke .

How many times can we really stomach another politician telling us -- as Obama did Friday and President Bush did after Virginia Tech -- that their “ prayers ” are with the victims of that day ’s gun-inflicted atrocity ?
Prayers wo n’t bring the dead back or make the living safer .
Our children do n’t need prayers ; they need leaders with a modicum of moral courage .
Nobody is asking anybody to commit political suicide .
But it would be better than edifying to watch just one of these dreary temporizers exhibit a fraction of the courage Randal Simmons , James Veenstra and their comrades showed when they put themselves at risk for people they believed were hostage to violence .
At the moment , we are a nation held hostage by the pandemic of gun violence .
We need leaders brave enough to admit that , and to offer our children something more than a collective shrug and the chance to join the arms race that has made our school campuses a killing ground .

Event - Based Programming without Inversion of Control
The actor computation model is especially suited for concurrent and distributed computations .
Actors are basically concurrent processes which communicate through asynchronous message passing .
When combined with pattern matching for messages , actor - based process models have been proven to be very effective .
To the best of our knowledge , event - based actors are the first to ( 1 ) allow reactive behavior to be expressed without inversion of control , and ( 2 ) support arbitrary blocking operations in reactions , at the same time .
Our actor library is written in Scala and outperforms other state - of - the - art actor languages with respect to message passing speed and memory consumption by several orders of magnitude .
Our implementation is able to make use of multi-processors and multi-core processors because reactions can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors .

German website adds international angle to ' draft Gore ' movement Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 1 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This Democrats heading the still - strong movement to convince Al Gore to mount a presidential run are being given a run for their money in sheer , " Draft Gore " zeal -- all the way from Germany .
This August , Michael Kachel , a 42 - year - old IT director from Munich , launched what may be the first foreign website dedicated solely to luring the former vice president into the 2008 race .
" We want to offer a forum for everyone to send a clear signal that there are many people in Europe who are in favor of a candidate Al Gore , " Kachel told RAW STORY by email .
" However you will decide , " he wants Gore to know , " we want to show you that we appreciate very much what you are doing and what you are : a rare species of politician , a noble man , a man with a genuine vision . 
The website idea occurred to Kachel soon after seeing Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth , during which he found himself " captivated by the character of Al Gore , " and decided he should get directly involved .
 I know exactly that there are only few opportunities in history to get a likewise upright and bright character into the most important office in the world , " he said .
" I believe devoutly that Al Gore is this man . "
For Kachel , the benefits of a Gore presidency would extend far beyond American borders and reverse the course of a Bush administration he believes has largely abdicated its international responsibilities .
Listing what he views as as significant Bush missteps -- " Refusal of Kyoto , denial of the competency of the International Court of Justice , non-cooperation with the United Nations in questions about war & peace , just to name few , " he says -- Kachel wants a different brand of American president .
" More than ever we now face complex , global questions which can only be solved when international cooperation is functioning , " he said , adding that he " could not identify a US administration which broke with almost all rules of cooperation as the current one did . "
Acknowledging the fact that most people in his country do not actively follow the inner workings of American politics very closely , Kachel hopes his site can kick - start some international attention for the primary process during what he believes is a critical time .
" That 's pretty normal , " he said of the relative disinterest he perceives among fellow Germans and others in Europe .
" But from my point of view that is not welcomed in these times .
Too much is at stake .
Europeans should get involved and show their attitude . "
" Sure , Al Gore is well - known , " he added , " But he is not considered as a potential candidate . "
Asked about his feelings toward other contenders for the presidency , Kachel is n't keen on the GOP 's 2008 chances .
" I ca n't see any Republican to be the next President and this is definitely not a question of parties , " he said .
" I am afraid they are all too much involved in the case of George W. Bush . "
As for the Democrats , Kachel praises Hillary Clinton for her " brightness , " and singles out Barack Obama as a Kennedyesque charmer that would make an " inspiring vice president . "
But there 's no talking him out of his man .
" Who else could shoulder the challenges of this time ? " he asks , going on to explain that the biggest reason a man like Al Gore should be president is simple .
" America , " he said , " deserves it . "
With John Edwards announcing that he will drop out of the Presidential race today and Dennis Kuchinich doing so last week , leaves only one Progressive still in the race .
This happens to be the one man I originally supported , before I was sidetracked by Edwards , who had promised all of his supporters that he would remain in the race until the end .
I guess that Edwards has had enough .
Maybe it is a good thing for America , for if he ca n’t weather the storm of a Presidential race , what kind of president would he have made ?
The only Progressive still in the race and who remains true to his principles is Mike Gravel .
To line up behind Gravel is easier to do now more than at any time in his candidacy .
We have only two corporate candidates that are opposing him , the choices have narrowed to such a point that to support Gravel is now a no - brainer .
Am I proposing that Mike could capture the Democratic nomination ?
Of course not , but a strong bid by Gravel could pave the way for a third party run by Gravel or maybe somebody else .
There is nothing that Gravel has said that I cannot support .
The greatest thing about supporting Gravel is that by doing so , you will not hurt any other candidate that do n’t need to be hurt politically .
Throwing in for Mike Gravel would make a statement nationwide that we understand what is happening to our political process and we are not going to stand for it .
Mike is the only one with the tenacity to see this process through to the end .
A strong show of support for the only Progressive still in the race is the only logical thing for us to do .
Forget about “ the lesser of two evils ” argument .
This is a terrible way to choose a leader and we should n’t have to be put in a position like that .
Mike might be a folksy , homespun type of guy , but he is the only one that see ’s through the smoke and mirrors that all the rest are using .
Hillary Clinton may have been a Progressive once in her life , but the support of the oil and pharmaceutical industries and the banking interests , as well as her membership in the Bilderburg group and her support of AIPAC and it ’s objectives , completely destroy her credentials as an agent of change .
The exact same case can be made for Obama and his pandering to AIPAC .
He has also taken money from the same corporations that have made our democracy nothing but a front for corporate controlled government .
His recent remarks about Israel “ defending themselves ” from the Palestinian terrorists on the Gaza Strip have also negated any call for change that he may have supported in the past .
Supporting Mike Gravel is the only real choice that we can make .
The thought of him becoming a player in the political arena would send a message to corporate America that we are not defeated .
This would be a message that they would hear loud and clear .
The message we must send to these political candidates and their corporate backers is “ What are you going to do about us ? ”
We have their number and we should n’t go away quietly , or play nice with their candidates .
If you think you are beaten you are .
Maybe , just maybe , we can pull off a miracle , God knows we need one , As Dylan once said ; " You do n't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows " .
That ’s the way I see it .
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein is the key witness in the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's class - action lawsuit against the telecommunications company , which alleges that AT&T cooperated in an illegal National Security Agency domestic surveillance program .
Klein 's evidence is a collection of sensitive documents he retained when he retired from AT&T .
Those documents are now filed under court seal , but Wired News independently acquired and published a significant portion of them in May , 2006 .
Those excerpts follow .

Study Group 3 , LGX / Splitter Wiring , San Francisco
This four - page excerpt is from a 60 - page document a management technician " left lying around on top of a router , " says Klein .
It describes AT&T 's efforts to install splitters on internet fiber optic cables at the company 's San Francisco internet hub .
Page 2 describes the splitter and lists the equipment at the receiving end of the tapped lines .
Page 3 is a diagram depicting the tap , and page 4 details some of connections between the splitter cabinet and what Klein calls a " secret room " housing the equipment .
SIMS , Splitter Cut - In and Test Procedure
A departing AT&T technician gave this 44 - page document to Klein as he cleaned out his desk .
These two pages , excerpted by Klein , show AT&T re-rerouting its high speed data circuits through the splitter cabinet that performs the physics of the alleged wiretaps .
The work was apparently overseen by AT&T's Network Operations Center in Bridgeton , Missouri .
" SIMS " is an unexplained reference to the secret room , according to Klein .

Download YouTube & Google Video clips via bookmarklets
Save video clips from YouTube , Google Video and others hassle - free
In March 2006 a digg.com frontpage story promoted KeepVid.com , a web site targeted at helping people with downloading files from popular video publishing services such as Google Video or YouTube .
The service instantly appealed to many video clip aficionados , but I considered visiting the Keepvid.com website for each and every video download uncomfortable and undesirable with regard to privacy .
Hence I built my own scripts .
The All - In - One Video Bookmarklet
The all - in - one bookmarklet supports YouTube , Google Video , Metacafe , Myspace , Break.com , Putfile , Dailymotion , Sevenload , MyVideo.de and Clipfish.de .
Bookmark the link below and access the bookmark when looking at videos on any of the supported websites .
The bookmarklet will give you the download - link (s ) for the video you were looking at .
Bookmark this link :
Please notice : I am no longer updating the bookmarklet or scripts .
As regards YouTube future problems that may arise may be fixed , provided I find the time .
Support for all other video services is no longer maintained .
How does it work ?
Have a look at the following video in order to see the bookmarklet in action :
( XviD video , 4,45MB )
The bookmarklet has been tested successfully with Seamonkey ( 1.1 ) , Firefox ( 2.0.0.4 ) and Opera ( 9.01 ) .
It will not work with Internet Explorer due to IE 's limitation of URL length ( some of the old links will ) .
Greasemonkey - Script
Firefox users with the greasemonkey - extension installed may prefer to install this greasemonkey - script which will show a small notice - bar at the top of supported video clip pages when a video is found .
If the bar is clicked upon , video download links are given on a small results page .
Install user script :
The script has been tested successfully with Firefox ( 2.0.0.4 ) and Greasemonkey ( 0.6.9 ) and with Opera ( 9.01 ) .
Alternative Greasemonkey - Scripts
If you dislike the notice - bar of the All - In - One Greasemonkey script have a look at these unobtrusive alternative scripts for Google Video , YouTube and Sevenload :
Google Video Script ( allows Windows users to directly download the AVI file )
YouTube Video Script ( replaces " Share video " with " Save to File " )
Sevenload Video Script ( adds a Download button to Sevenload 's video pages . )
The scripts have been tested successfully with Firefox ( 2.0.0.4 ) and Greasemonkey ( 0.6.9 ) and with Opera ( 9.01 )
Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ )
Why not use Google Video 's download links ?
Google Video provides download links but depending on your operating system you may get varying content .
When using " Download for Windows / Mac " users of Microsoft Windows will be offered the setup file for Google Video Player instead of an AVI video file .
An option to " Manually download the video " provides the user with a GVP file .
Is GVP not just AVI with a different name ?
No. GVP ( Google Video Pointer ) files are playlist files for Google Video Player .
A GVP file can be opened in a texteditor and contains a link to the respective AVI file .
Do not mistake GVP for GVI ( Google Video files ) .
GVI clips are AVI files with additional header information .
They are usually composed of a video stream encoded in DivX alongside an MP3 audio stream , with AVI being the container format .
Renaming GVI files to AVI can help with getting a video player to render the video .
I can't get the GVI / AVI files to play .
Google adds addtional header information to the AVI files ( more precisely a list of type " goog " ) .
Some video players ( such as Media Player Classic or VLC media player ) will ignore the extra information and play the files fine , others however ( like Windows Media Player or Winamp ) will fail .
One can " fix " the AVI files by removing the " goog " list , which can easily be done with a hexeditor or several tools and scripts :
How can I play Flash Video ( FLV ) files on Windows ?
Combining current CVS builds of Media Player Classic with the latest daily builds of ffdshow provides thorough FLV support .
While ffdshow is capable of rendering FLV1 , the FLV splitter / decoder incorporated in the CVS builds of Media Player Classic adds support for On2's VP6 codec ( Flash8 ) .
The FLV splitter / decoder can also be downloaded as a standalone DirectShow filter ( source filter + splitter + decoder ) to be combined with Media Player Classic 's official stable builds or other DirectShow video players including Windows Media Player .
Another full - fledged video player with native ( yet limited ) FLV support is VLC media player .
Designated Flash Video players like FLVPlayer by Martijn de Visser or Riva FLV Player handle FLV files ( FLV1 & On2 VP6 ) fine , but are otherwise limited in functionality .
How do I convert FLV files into other video formats ?
Riva FLV Encoder and SUPER are two popular freeware applications capable of converting FLV video .
Both are based on ffmpeg and therefore natively support FLV1 but lack support for On2's VP6 codec .
SUPER 's capabilites can be extended by installing an FLV DirectShow filter with VP6 support .
This will not only provide SUPER with VP6 functions but enhance all video applications that support DirectShow , which opens up endless opportunities such as loading VP6 encoded FLV files into popular open source applications like VirtualDub with the help of AviSynth .
How do I install the FLV DirectShow filter ?
Download the packed binary file ( build by " Celtic Druid " )
Extract the filter file ( flvsplitter.ax ) from the archive Copy the file to your " windows/system32 " directory From the Start menu choose " Run " and enter : regsvr32 flvsplitter .ax
If you intend to uninstall the filter at any time run regsvr32 -u flvsplitter .ax and remove the file .
What about Keepvid.com & Videodownloader.net ?
Keepvid.com and Javimoya are server - based solutions while my scripts are client - based .
Both concepts have pros and cons .
Keepvid.com and Videodownloader.net also offer bookmarklets and Greasemonkey scripts , but those just refer to their webpage and will let them know about any video download done through them .
None of my scripts involve third party interaction .
It 's all between you and the video publisher .
Where do the scripts load the images from ?
The images are embedded in the source code of the scripts ( encoded in Base64 ) .
Thus the images do not have to be loaded remotely and do not allow for tracking the use of the scripts .
While embedding the images increases the size of the scripts , users I talked to prefered this over my former approach of removing all images by default and offering instructions on how to embedd custom images .
Are you aware of other people stealing your idea ?
I am fine with other people providing similar bookmarklets or scripts .
It does n't require a genius to have the idea or to create the code and I appreciate variety .
Choose the solution you like best .
Can you add support for my favourite video website ?
Due to lack of time I currently have no intention of adding further websites to the list .
Sorry .
I like the scripts .
How can I thank you ?
If you feel inclined to reciprocate you can link back to this page from your blog or homepage .
If you want to be really nice you can send me a postcard ( my personal favourite ) or a small gift from your local area ( see imprint for shipping address ) .
You can also make a paypal donation at your discretion .
Thank you very much to everyone who has made a donation in whatever form or amount !
Special thanks to Joni Keller for sending a postcard .

On Sunday evening , an alleged drug dealer was tarred and feathered in a Belfast street as passers - by looked on .
His balaclava - wearing attackers then tied him to a lamp - post and put a placard around his neck that read : " I 'm a drug dealing scumbag . "
Images were taken on a mobile phone and released to the media .
Politicians who condemned the assault described it as a lamentable return to 1970s Northern Ireland when such so - called " punishment attacks " were visited on women accused by the IRA of fraternising with police or British soldiers .
Tarring and feathering is an ancient punishment , first referred to officially in 1189 , when Richard the Lionheart ruled that any robber found sailing with his army of crusaders to Jerusalem " shall be first shaved , then boiling pitch shall be poured upon his head , and a cushion of feathers shook over it so that he may be publicly known ; and at the first land where the ships put in he shall be cast on shore . "
The practice has since been used to punish London bailiffs , nuns and friars in Madrid , French - women suspected of fraternising with Nazi soldiers , and Joseph Smith , founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , who was tarred and feathered for alleged acts of depravity against a 15 - year - old girl in 1832 by her brothers .
It was also used in the last century by the Ku Klux Klan against African - Americans .
When tarring and feathering was widely used in the American Revolution by both colonists and patriots , victims were often stripped and forced to watch tar boil over a fire .
When they attempted to clean themselves after the attack , blistered skin would often come off with the tar .
A similar practice called pitchcapping was later used by British authorities to torture Irish rebels in 1798 .
It involved placing a conical cap filled with boiling pitch on a bound victim 's head until it cooled and hardened .
The pitch would then be removed , taking away skin from the victim 's head and leaving them scarred .
Why was tarring and feathering revived in Belfast on Sunday ?
" The community responded in the way that it did because it had no confidence in the police , " said Frankie Gallagher of the Ulster Political Research Group , a body connected to the Ulster Defence Association , a loyalist paramilitary organisation that has denied involvement in the attack .
Margaret Ritchie , Northern Ireland 's social development minister , said : " This type of behaviour has no place in civilised society . "
My Rant on C++'s operator new
by David Mazières
Abstract
Memory allocation in ANSI C
void * malloc ( size_t ) ; void free ( void * ) ;
void f ( void ) { struct sss *s = malloc ( sizeof ( * s ) ) ; char * string2 = malloc ( strlen ( string1 ) + 1 ) ; /* ... */ free ( s ) ; free ( string2 ) ; }
The simplicity of malloc 's syntax offers many benefits .
Though malloc is defined as part of the C language , it can be implemented as an ordinary library function requiring no special support from the compiler .
Thus , anyone can define additional malloc - like functions .
Many programs define a function called xmalloc that aborts execution if the system runs out of memory .
People also write special purpose memory allocators , such as arenas , which are ordinary C functions returning type void *.
Another great advantage of malloc 's syntax is that malloc can be defined as a preprocessor macro .
This technique is invaluable for tracking down memory allocation bugs such as memory leaks .
Debugging malloc libraries like Gray Watson 's dmalloc library can define malloc and free as follows :
void * malloc ( size_t ) ; void * _malloc_leap ( const char * file , int line , size_t size ) ; # define malloc ( size ) _malloc_leap ( __FILE__ , __LINE__ , size ) void free ( void * ) ; void _free_leap ( const char * file , int line , void *) ; # define free ( ptr ) _free_leap ( __FILE__ , __LINE__ , ptr ) ;
With malloc defined in this way , the dmalloc library can record the source file and line number at which most pieces of memory are allocated .
This does n't work in every possible situation .
The program may , for instance , assign malloc to a function pointer .
In that case , the function malloc may get called rather than _malloc_leap .
Nonetheless , the code still compiles and runs fine .
( malloc as a function pointer has no arguments and consequently does not get expanded by the preprocessor ) .
Any code can also call _malloc_leap directly .
For instance , if a memory leak is tracked to the strdup function , strdup could be reimplemented as follows :
static inline char * _strdup_leap ( const char * file , int line , char * str ) { return strcpy ( _malloc_leap ( file , line , strlen ( str ) + 1 ) , str ) ; } # define strdup ( str ) _strdup_leap ( __FILE__ , __LINE__ , str )
Of course , there is one drawback to malloc 's simplicity -- it is not type safe .
A small typo , such as
struct sss *s = malloc ( sizeof ( s ) ) ;
struct sss *s = malloc ( sizeof ( * s ) ) ;
Memory allocation in C ++
Why did they eliminate implicit casts from void *?
Such implicit casts were probably viewed as a hole in the type system .
In general , Stroustrup deprecates any use void * for something other than " low - level software , " because he feels that with C++'s protection mechanisms all pointers should be typed .
More importantly , in C , if p1 and p2 are pointers , the two statements
p1 = p2 ; p1 = ( void *) p2 ;
Thus , no ordinary function can perform the role of malloc in C++-- there is no suitable return type .
More importantly , even , C++ classes have constructors and destructors that must be called when the objects are allocated and freed .
The C++ compiler must be aware of memory allocation so as to ensure that proper constructors are called for a new object , and to create a pointer of the appropriate type .
Thus , C++ has a special syntax for allocating and freeing memory .
It uses the new and delete operators , with the following syntax :
[ ::] " new " [ " ( " expression - list " ) " ] { new - type - id | " ( " type - id " ) " } [ " ( " expression - list " ) " ]
[ ::] " delete " [ " [ ] " ] cast - expression
class foo {
/* ... */ } ; void f ( ) { foo * foop = new foo ; char * string = new char [ 20 ] ; int * intp = new int ( 7 ) ; // ... delete intp ; delete [ ] string ; delete foop ; }
void * operator new ( size_t ) ; void operator delete ( void * ) ; void * operator new [ ] ( size_t ) ; // for arays void operator delete [ ] ( void * ) ;
struct nothrow_t {} ; extern const nothrow_t nothrow ; void * operator new throw ( ) ( size_t , const nothrow_t& ) ;
foo * fp = new ( nothrow ) foo ; if ( ! fp ) { /*
Deal with being out of memory */ }
inline void * operator new ( size_t , void * p ) { return p ; }
In addition to overloaded global new functions , each class can have its own set of operator new and delete functions .
Note , however , that operator delete cannot be overloaded .
There is at most one operator delete and one operator delete [ ] per class .
While the global :: operator delete and delete [ ] take one argument of type void * , per-class operators can optionally take a second argument of type size_t .
This second argument will contain the size of the deleted chunk of memory .
delete vs. delete [ ] and free
Why are operator delete and delete [ ] different ?
First , given a pointer of type foo * , the compiler has no way of knowing if it points to one foo or an array of them -- in short , the compiler does n't know which memory allocator was used to allocate the memory pointed to by foo .
Second , when the elements of an array have destructors , the compiler must remember the size of the array so as to destroy every element .
Even when array elements do n't have destructors , the per-class operator delete functions may rely on being told the exact size of what is being freed .
For non-array types , the compiler can reconstruct the size from the type of the pointer being freed ( in the case of deleting a supertype , the compiler gets the actual size from the virtual function table if there is a virtual destructor ) .
Thus , when allocating an array , the compiler must sometimes stash its length somewhere ; operator delete [ ] retrieves the length to perform the necessary destruction and deallocation .
The global operator delete and delete [ ] functions cannot take a second size_t argument .
For types without destructors , then , the global operators new and new [ ] essentially perform the same function .
They are usually both just wrappers around malloc .
However , the compiler may treat memory allocated by the various allocators differently even when it does n't need to .
Thus , any memory allocated with new [ ] must be freed with delete [ ] , memory allocated with new freed with delete , and memory allocated with malloc freed with free .
The most obvious way of dynamically allocating n bytes of memory is to call new char[n ] .
Unfortunately , memory allocated this way must subsequently be freed with delete [ ] , which may lead to inconsistent or counter - intuitive function interfaces .
Consider the following C code :
#include < stddef.h > typedef struct intlist { int size ; int i [ 1 ] ; } intlist ; intlist * makeintlist ( int size ) { intlist * ilp = malloc ( offsetof ( intlist , i[ size ] ) ) ; /* not C++ */ ilp -> size = size ; return ilp ; }
intlist * ilp = new intlist ; intlist * ilp = ( intlist *) malloc ( offsetof ( intlist , i[ size ] ) ) ; intlist * ilp = ( intlist *) new char [ offsetof ( intlist , i[ size ] ) ] ;
In either case 2 or 3 , the person invoking the function will have to remember how to free the object -- with either free or delete [ ] .
It might provide a more intuitive interface if the user could instead free such an object with the simple scalar ::operator delete .
In this case , the memory should be allocated through an explicit call to ::operator new :
intlist *ilp = ( intlist *) operator new ( offsetof ( intlist , i[ size ] ) ) ;
Specialized allocators
class arena {
/* ... */ arena ( const arena & ) ; //
No copying arena &operator= ( const arena & ) ; //
No copying public : arena ( ) ; ~arena ( ) ; void * allocate ( size_t bytes , size_t alignment ) {
/* ... */ } } ; inline void * operator new ( arena &a , size_t bytes ) { return a.allocate ( bytes , sizeof ( double ) ) ; } inline void * operator new [ ] ( arena &a , size_t bytes ) //
This function is bad news { return a.allocate ( bytes , sizeof ( double ) ) ; } class foo { /* ... */ } ; void f ( ) { arena a ; char * string = new ( a ) char [ 80 ] ; // opreator new [ ] ( arena & , size_t ) int * intp = new ( a ) int ; // opreator new ( arena & , size_t ) foo * fp = new ( a ) foo ; // better hope foo : :~ foo( ) is n't useful /*
No need to free anything before returning */ }
Though this may seem nice on the surface , there are some fairly ugly aspects to this use of new .
Consider what happens during " new ( a ) foo " .
Two functions are invoked : the arena allocator - - operator new ( arena & , size_t ) -- and foo 's default constructor , foo : : foo ( ) .
Operator new does not know what type is being allocated , while foo : : foo ( ) does n't know what memory allocator is being used .
If , for instance , foo : : foo ( ) dynamically allocates memory , it cannot do so from the arena in which it resides itself .
Thus , the speed benefit of an arena allocation may be overshadowed by several heap allocations within foo : : foo ( ) .
Moreover , foo 's destructor must be called before freeing the arena so as to avoid a memory leak .
C++ does allow explicit calls to destructors , so function f can be fixed with :
void f ( ) { arena a ; // ... foo * fp = new ( a ) foo ; // must be destroyed // ... fp->~foo ( ) ; }
void f ( ) { arena a ; // ... foo * fp = new ( a ) foo ( a ) ; //
Tell foo about our arena // foo no longer needs its destructor invoked }
A potential problem may arise if the constructor for foo throws an exception .
Because constructors have no return values in C++ , exceptions are the simplest way for them to indicate failure .
When constructors throw exceptions , the compiler will try to free the memory allocated by new .
While this may ordinarily be a good thing , it would have disastrous consequences in the case of the arena allocator , where calling :: operator delete on a pointer in the middle of the arena would have unpredictable results .
One can avoid this problem through so - called " placement - delete " functions that , after the first argument , match the argument types of particular placement new operators .
For the arena type , we should therefore declare an empty placement delete :
inline void operator delete ( void * , arena & ) {}
arena a ; foo * fp = new ( a ) foo ; operator delete ( fp , a ) ; // Problematic
inline void operator delete ( void * , void *) {}
Another annoyance of operator new is that operator new [ ] ( arena & , size_t ) does n't know what kind of objects it is allocating .
If it did , it might be able to relax the alignment requirements on arrays of certain objects .
Worse yet , as we will see in the next section , it is almost certainly incorrect to use the arena operator new [ ] for any class with a destructor , and probably incorrect to use the arena operator new [ ] at all .
Dangers of overloading ::operator new [ ]
inline void * operator new [ ] ( size_t , void * place ) { return place ; }
obj * f ( ) { void *p = special_malloc ( sizeof ( obj [ 10 ] ) ) ; return new ( p ) obj [ 10 ] ; // Serious trouble ... }
struct sizenew_t {} ; const sizenew_t sizenew ; inline void * operator new [ ] ( size_t size , const sizenew_t & , size_t * sizep ) throw ( ) //
Do n't let NULL return throw an exception { * sizep = size ; return NULL ; //
Do n't let compiler call constructors } obj * f ( ) { size_t size ; ( void ) new ( sizenew , &size ) obj [ 10 ] ; void *p = special_malloc ( size ) ; return new ( p ) obj [ 10 ] ; }
If placement operator new [ ] can't work , what about the arena operator new above ?
It certainly was convenient and intuitive to say " new ( a ) char [ 80 ] " for 80 bytes of space .
Does this create a problem ?
In fact , the arena new [ ] above will work with g++ , but will cause a memory leak on other compilers .
According to The C++- FAQ - Lite :
[ 16.13 ] After p = new Fred[n ] , how does the compiler know there are n objects to be destructed during delete [ ]
p?
Short answer : Magic .
Long answer :
The run -time system stores the number of objects , n , somewhere where it can be retrieved if you only know the pointer , p .
There are two popluar techniques that do this .
Both these techniques are in use by commercial grade compilers , both have tradeoffs , and neither is perfect .
These techniques are : Over-allocate the array and put n just to the left of the first Fred object [ 33.5 ] .
Use an associative array with p as the key and n as the value [ 33.6 ] .
For that reason , operator new [ ] ( size_t , arena & ) should probably not exist .
Instead of writing
char * string = new ( a ) char [ 80 ] ;
char * string = ( char *) a.allocate ( 80 , 1 ) ;
Punching a hole in the type system
class voidp { void * p ; public : voidp ( void * pp ) : p ( pp ) {} template < class T > operator T *() { return ( T *) p ; } } ;
inline voidp mymalloc ( size_t size ) { return malloc ( size ) ; } #define malloc mymalloc
Of course , as in C , such memory allocation is not type safe .
Moreover , the memory allocation process is entirely separate from the invocation of constructors .
Thus , you certainly can't call malloc to allocate any types with virtual functions .
It might , however , be reasonable for a simple arena allocator used only on basic types to return voidp .
Note that as of version 2.8.1 , g++ will not compile voidp correctly .
However , the code does work with egcs .
Debugging memory allocation in C ++
The short answer is no .
Not for a general C++ program .
However , the benefit of such a tool is so great that it is worth shaping a project around a plan for effectively debugging memory problems .
If one restricts oneself to particular coding conventions , it is possible in C++ to reap some of the benefits of a C debugging malloc .
Here is a simple attempt at using a debugging malloc in C ++:
void * _malloc_leap ( const char * file , int line , size_t size ) ; void _free_leap ( const char * file , int line , void *) ; struct dmalloc_t {} ; extern struct dmalloc_t dmalloc ; inline void * operator new ( size_t size , dmalloc_t , const char * file , int line ) { return _malloc_leap ( file , line , size ) ; } inline void * operator new [ ] ( size_t size , dmalloc_t , const char * file , int line ) { return _malloc_leap ( file , line , size ) ; } inline void operator delete ( void * p ) { _free_leap ( " unknown file " , 0 , p ) ; } #define NEW new ( dmalloc , __FILE__ , __LINE__ ) # define new NEW
void f ( ) { int * intp = new int ; delete intp ; }
void f ( ) { int * intp = new ( dmalloc , " foo.C " , 31 ) int ; delete intp ; }
class bar {
/* ... */ public : void * opreator new ( size_t ) ; void operator delete ( void * , size_t ) ; /* ... */ } ; void f ( ) { bar * bp = new bar ; delete bp ; }
void f ( ) { bar * bp = new ( dmalloc , " bar.C " , 23 ) bar ; delete bp ; }
#ifdef DMALLOC
#define delete :: delete #endif /* DMALLOC */ /* ... */ class bar {
/* ... */ public : #ifndef DMALLOC void * opreator new ( size_t ) ; void operator delete ( void * , size_t ) ; #endif /* !
DMALLOC */ /* ... */ } ;
Class - specific allocators are a pain when debugging , but they are manageable .
Unfortunately , arena allocation brings on some far more serious problems .
Recall we were allocating objects like this :
void f ( ) { arena a ; foo * fp = new ( a ) foo ; fp->~foo ( ) ; }
void f ( ) { arena a ; foo * fp = new ( dmalloc , " arena_test . C " , 14 ) ( a ) foo ; fp->~foo ( ) ; }
Changing most uses of new to NEW is problematic , particularly when a project regularly imports lots of code that uses does n't follow the same convention .
Changing the syntax of specialized allocations is incredibly tricky , however .
It 's not enough simply to write
foo * fp = arena_new ( a ) foo ;
Do n't use operator new
( I say almost because there are two exceptions : First , because C++ has no varargs templates , new - like functions in C++ must set some fixed , though arbitrarily large , maximum number of constructor arguments .
Second , the compiler 's memory allocation functions have the benefit of knowing whether a type has a destructor or not .
This allows some space and time optimization in certain circumstances . )
Our goal is then to define memory allocators other than new and delete .
Let us call these functions New , Delete , and Delarray .
They will behave as follows :
void f ( ) { int * intp = New ( int ) ( 7 ) ; foo * fp = New ( foo ) ; char * string = New ( char ) [ 20 ] ; Delete ( foo ) ; Delete ( intp ) ; DelArray ( string ) ; }
There will have to be a few syntactic differences between New and new .
New 's type argument must be surrounded by parentheses , whereas new only requires parentheses around complex types ( those containing parentheses themselves ) .
Non-constant array dimentions will have to go outside the parentheses containing the type .
New also wo n't have any placement syntax , which is fine since it also has no special support from the compiler -- other allocators can simply go by other names .
Delete and Delarray are similar to delete and delete [ ] , but their arguments must also be in parentheses .
Before actually implementing New , we need a few pieces of infrastructure .
One of the big advantages the compiler 's new has over a user - defined one is that the compiler knows what types have destructors .
Thus , for instance , when allocating an array of chars the compiler does n't need to remember its length .
While the language provides no way of knowing for sure if a type has a destructor , we can approximate the problem using templates :
#include < new > # include < cstdlib > # define size_t unsigned int //
Work around specialization bug in egcs /* * isTypeSimple ( T ) - returns true only if T has no constructor * or destructor .
By default only built in * types are simple , but more can be declared * simple with SIMPLETYPE ( T ) */ template < class T> struct SimpleType { enum {value = 0} ; } ; template < class T> struct SimpleType <T *> { enum {value = 1} ; } ; template < class T> struct SimpleType<const T> { enum {value = SimpleType<T>:: value} ; } ; template < class T , size_t n> struct SimpleType < T[ n ] >
{ enum {value = SimpleType<T>:: value} ; } ; #define SIMPLETYPE ( T ) \ template <> struct SimpleType<T> { \ union { \ T t ; \ } catcherr ; \ enum {value = 1} ; \ } SIMPLETYPE ( bool ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( char ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( unsigned char ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( short ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( unsigned short ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( int ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( unsigned int ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( long ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( unsigned long ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( float ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( double ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( long double ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( long long ) ; SIMPLETYPE ( unsigned long long ) ; # define isTypeSimple ( T ) ( ( bool ) SimpleType <T > :: value ) template < class T , bool S = isTypeSimple ( T ) > struct EnsureSimple ; template < class T> struct EnsureSimple < T , true > {} ;
Welcome to another installment of Horrorhead , a column where we talk about the intersection of horror and scifi .
Anyone who saw Alien as a kid knows that the smashed - up alien ship where Ripley 's crew first finds the alien is one of the scariest places ever .
It 's basically a haunted house set in space , with its bulging , intestine shape , cobwebby alien skeletons ( their ribs burst open ) , luminescent mists , and the hushed creepiness of that cargo bay full of dormant eggs .
Setting is a crucial ingredient in scifi horror , and for your spine - tingling pleasure , here are some of the scariest settings ever created for scifi film .
Advertisement
I already mentioned Alien , but the prison planet on Alien 3 was actually even creepier than the smashed alien ship .
That bleak , abandoned planet with its industrial freakshow prison was so depressing and hopeless that audiences stayed away from this film in droves — even though it was directed by David " Se7en " Fincher , a guy who certainly knows how to give good setting .
William Gibson worked on an early version of the script .
If you have n't seen this one in a while , give it a second viewing .
You might be surprised .

One of the all - time most horrifying scifi settings is the hallucinatory , hellish veterans hospital in Jacob 's Ladder .
This film about a guy given weird " super soldier " drugs during Vietnam has strange religious overtones , but mostly is about someone driven crazy by government - conspiracy pharmaceuticals and high - tech warfare .
Played with wide - eyed hysteria by a very young Tim Robbins , the guy begins seeing himself in a hospital hell , which is full of these twitchy - headed , masked demons who make the scariest dry - shuffling noises I 've ever heard .
Watch if you dare .
A cult movie from the mists of time ( ie , 1975 ) called A Boy and His Dog wins for best scary , underground city long before City of Ember locked us into its spell .
Featuring Don Johnson and a talking , mutant dog who is smarter than he is ( yes , I know that 's believable ) , the post - apocalyptic flick chronicles Don 's foray into an underground city called " Topeka " where everybody wears weird clown makeup and lives a horrifying nightmare of suburban life , complete with enforced church - going and scary , ultra - trimmed lawns .
Unfortunately for poor Don , radiation has made all the men sterile and they want to keep him prisoner and milk him for sperm ( but not in a fun way ) .
Jason Robards does an amazing job as the underground city 's demented mayor .
Actually , this trailer may scare you for reasons other than the underground city .
Laboratories — especially where
They are experimenting on humans — are always frightening .
That 's what made so many scenes from The X - Files compelling .
And it's also what makes us love to fear the lab featured in Resident Evil : Extinction , where Milla Jovovich 's clones kept getting tested and killed over and over again .

But for sheer horror in set design , nothing can beat THX 1138 , George Lucas ' film about a completely sanitized , emotion - free society where everyone wears white ( except the cops ) , every room is white , and everything is lit with insanely bright floodlamps .
Filmed partly in one of San Francisco 's ultra - white subway stations ( the Powell St. BART station , to be exact ) , the whole film is saturated with a freaky fascist feeling created by Lucas ' minimalist but frightening setting .
Language evolves in sudden leaps , according to a statistical study of three major language groups .
The finding challenges the slow - and - steady model held by many linguists and matches evidence that genetic evolution follows a similar path .
Mark Pagel from the University of Reading in the UK and colleagues applied statistical tools commonly used in biology to the analysis of three of the world ’s major language groups : Indo -European , Austronesian , and Bantu .
By comparing commonly used words within each language group , they were able to identify the extent to which languages within a group diverged from the others .
This enabled them to build a family tree , charting the divergence of one “ mother tongue ” into hundreds of daughter languages .
If languages change at a constant rate , the length of any branch back to the root of the language “ tree ” should be of the same length .
But the researchers found that languages that are very different from the common root had longer paths .
This suggests that , each time they split , an abrupt spurt of evolution occurs .

They found that up to a third of all vocabulary changes result from “ punctuational bursts of change ” when one language splits from another .
In 2005 , Pagel performed a similar analysis of genetic variation in species of trees .
He found that 22 % of evolutionary change came during similar periods of rapid development in some species .
“ In one case its words , in the other case its genes , ” Pagel says .
Pagel says languages may diverge suddenly when a subgroup separates from a larger population , to create a unique social identity .
Similarly , genetic change may occur suddenly as genes try to adapt quickly to a new environment .
Pagel ’s colleague Quentin Atkinson adds that , when a small group is isolated from a larger population , any idiosyncrasies in the way they speak may become amplified .
“ The same thing happens in biology where smaller founder populations are able to change more quickly , ” he says .
Salikoko Mufwene a linguist at the University of Chicago , however , says it may be misleading to characterise language evolution as “ abrupt ” .
“ You do n’t go to bed speaking one way and wake up speaking another way , ” he says .
“ Languages may change over centuries , but that is not abrupt , that is gradual . ”

Via Sam Ruby 's post Embrace , Extend then Innovate I found a link to Joe Gregorio 's post entitled How to do RESTful Partial Updates .
Joe 's post is a recommendation of how to extend the Atom Publishing Protocol ( RFC 5023 ) to support updating the properties of an entry without having to replace the entire entry .
Given that Joe works for Google on GData , I have assumed that Joe 's post is Google 's attempt to float a trial balloon before extending AtomPub in this way .
This is a more community centric approach than the company has previously taken with GData , OpenSocial , etc where these protocols simply appeared out of nowhere with proprietary extensions to AtomPub with an FYI to the community after the fact .
The Problem Statement
In the Atom Publishing Protocol , an atom : entry represents an editable resource .
When editing that resource , it is intended that an AtomPub client should download the entire entry , edit the fields it needs to change and then use a conditional PUT request to upload the changed entry .
So what 's the problem ?
Below is an example of the results one could get from invoking the users .
get Info method in the Facebook REST API .
< user >
< uid>8055</uid >
< about_me > This field perpetuates the glorification of the ego .
Also , it has a character limit .</ about_me >

If this user was represented as an atom : entry then each time an application wants to edit the user 's status message it needs to download the entire data for the user with its over two dozen fields , change the status message in an in -memory representation of the XML document and then upload the entire user atom : entry back to the server .
This is a fairly expensive way to change a status message compared to how this is approached in other RESTful protocols ( e.g. PROPPATCH in WebDAV ) .
Previous Discussions on this Topic : When the Shoe is on the Other Foot
A few months ago I brought up this issue as one of the problems encountered when using the Atom Publishing Protocol outside of blog editing contexts in my post Why GData / APP Fails as a General Purpose Editing Protocol for the Web .
In that post I wrote
Lack of support for granular updates to fields of an item :
As mentioned in the previous section editing an entry requires replacing the old entry with a new one .
The expected client interaction with the server is described in section 5.4 of the current APP draft and is excerpted below .
Retrieving a Resource Client Server
| |
| 1. ) GET to Member URI |
|------------------------------------------>|
| |
| 2. ) 200 Ok |
| Member Representation |
|<------------------------------------------|
| |
The client sends a GET request to the URI of a Member Resource to retrieve its representation .
The server responds with the representation of the Member Resource .
Editing a Resource Client Server
| |
| 1. ) PUT to Member URI |
| Member Representation |
|------------------------------------------>|
| |
| 2. ) 200 OK |
|<------------------------------------------|
The client sends a PUT request to store a representation of a Member Resource .
If the request is successful , the server responds with a status code of 200 .
Can anyone spot what 's wrong with this interaction ?
The first problem is a minor one that may prove problematic in certain cases .
The problem is pointed out in the note in the documentation on Updating posts on Google Blogger via GData which states IMPORTANT !
To ensure forward compatibility , be sure that when you POST an updated entry you preserve all the XML that was present when you retrieved the entry from Blogger .
Otherwise , when we implement new stuff and include < new - awesome - feature > elements in the feed , your client wo n't return them and your users will miss out !
The Google data API client libraries all handle this correctly , so if you 're using one of the libraries you 're all set .
Thus each client is responsible for ensuring that it does n't lose any XML that was in the original atom : entry element it downloaded .
The second problem is more serious and should be of concern to anyone who 's read Editing the Web : Detecting the Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout .
The problem is that there is data loss if the entry has changed between the time the client downloaded it and when it tries to PUT its changes .
That post was negatively received by many members of the AtomPub community including Joe Gregorio .
Joe wrote a scathing response to my post entitled
In which we narrowly save Dare from inventing his own publishing protocol where he addressed that particular issue as follows
The second complaint is one of data loss :
The problem is that there is data loss if the entry has changed between the time the client downloaded it and when it tries to PUT its changes .
Fortunately , the only real problem is that Dare seems to have only skimmed the specification .
From Section 9.3 : To avoid unintentional loss of data when editing Member Entries or Media Link Entries , Atom Protocol clients SHOULD preserve all metadata that has not been intentionally modified , including unknown foreign markup as defined in Section 6 of [ RFC4287 ] .
And further , from Section 9.5 : Implementers are advised to pay attention to cache controls , and to make use of the mechanisms available in HTTP when editing Resources , in particular entity - tags as outlined in [ NOTE - detect - lost - update ] .
Clients are not assured to receive the most recent representations of Collection Members using GET if the server is authorizing intermediaries to cache them .
Hey look , we actually reference the lost update paper that specifies how to solve this problem , right there in the spec !
And Section 9.5.1 even shows an example of just such a conditional PUT failing .
Who knew ?
And just to make this crystal clear , you can build a server that is compliant to the APP that accepts only conditional PUTs .
I did , and it performed quite well at the last APP Interop .
The bottom line of Joe 's response is that he did n't think it was a real problem .
My assumption is that his perspective on the problem has broadened now that he has a responsibility to the wide breadth of AtomPub implementations at Google as opposed to when his design decisions were being influenced by a home grown blogging server he wrote in his free time .
The Google Solution : Embrace , Extend then Innovate
Now that Joe thinks supporting granular updates of a resource is a valid scenario , he and the folks at Google have proposed the following solution to the problem .
Joe writes
Now if I wanted to update part of this entry , say the title , using the mechanisms in RFC 5023 then I would change the value of the title element and PUT the whole modified entry back to the the URI http://example.org/edit/first-post.atom .
Now this document is n't large , but we 'll use it to demonstrate the concepts .
The first thing we want to do is add a URI Template that allows us to construct a URI to PUT changes back to : <?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< entry xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom " xmlns:t= " http://blah... " > < t:link_template ref=" sub " href = " http://example.org/edit/first-post/{-listjoin|;|id} "/> < title > Atom - Powered Robots Run Amok </ title > < id>urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a</id > < updated >2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated > < author >< name > John Doe</ name ></author > < content > Some text .</ content > < link rel= " edit " href = " http://example.org/edit/first-post.atom " /> </entry >
Then we need to add id's to each of the pieces of the document we wish to be able to individually update .
For this we 'll use the W3C xml : id specification : <?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< entry xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom " xmlns:t= " http://blah... " > < t:link_template ref=" sub " href = " http://example.org/edit/first-post/{-listjoin|;|id} " /> < title xml:id= " X1 " > Atom - Powered Robots Run Amok < / title > < id>urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a</id > < updated >2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated > < author xml:id= " X2 " >< name > John Doe</ name ></author > < content xml:id= " X3 " > Some text .</ content > < link rel= " edit " href = " http://example.org/edit/first-post.atom " /> </entry >
So if I wanted to update both the content and the title I would construct the partial update URI using the id's of the elements I want to update : http://example.org/edit/first-post/X1;X3
And then I would PUT an entry to the URI with only those child elements : PUT /edit / first - post / X1;X3 Host : example.org < ?xml version = " 1.0 " ?>
< entry xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom " > < title xml:id= " X1 " > False alarm on the Atom - Powered Robots things </ title > < content xml:id= " X3 " > Sorry about that .</ content > </ entry >
The Problems with the Google Solution : Your Shipment of FAIL has Arrived
Ignoring the fact that this spec depends on specifications that are either experimental ( URI Templates ) or not widely supported ( xml:id ) , there are still significant problems with how this approach ( mis ) uses the Atom Publishing Protocol .
Sam Ruby eloquently points out the problems in his post Embrace , Extend then Innovate where he wrote
With HTTP PUT , the the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server .
Having some servers interpret the removal of elements ( such as content ) as a modification , and others interpret the requests in such a way that elided elements are to be left alone is hardly uniform or self - descriptive .
In fact , depending on usage , it is positively stateful .
I ’m fine with a server choosing to interpret the request anyway it sees fit .
As a black box , it could behave as if it updated the resource as requested and then one nanosecond later — and before it processes any other requests — fill in missing data with defaults , historical data , whatever .
My concern is with clients coding with to the assumption as to how the server works .
That ’s called coupling .
The main problem is that it changes the expected semantics of HTTP PUT in a way that not only conflicts with how PUT is typically used in other HTTP - based protocols but also how it is used in AtomPub .
It 's also weird that the existence of xml:id in an Atom document is now used to imply special semantics ( i.e. this field supports direct editing ) .
I especially do n't like that after all is said and done , the server controls which fields can be partially updated or not which seems to imply a tight coupling between clients and servers ( e.g. some servers will support partial updates on all fields , some may only support partial updates on atom: title + atom : category while others will support partial updates on a different set of fields ) .
So the code for editing a title or category changes depending on which AtomPub service you are talking to .
From where I stand Joe has pretty much invented yet another diff + patch protocol for XML documents .
When I worked on the XML team at Microsoft , there were quite a few floating around the company including Diffgram , UpdateGram , and Patchgrams to name three .
So I 've been around the block when it comes to diff + patch formats for XML and this one has its share of issues .
The most eye brow raising issue with the diff + patch protocol is that half the semantics of the update are in the XML document ( which elements to add / edit ) while the other half are in the URL ( if an ID exists in the URL but is not in the document then it is a delete ) .
This means the XML is n't very self describing nor can it really be said that the URL is identifying a resource [ more like it identifies an operation ] .
Actual Solution : Read the Spec
In Joe 's original response to my post his suggestion was that the solution to the " problem " of lack of support for granular updates of entries in AtomPUb is to read the spec .
In retrospect , I agree .
If a field is important enough that it needs to be identifiable and editable then it should be its own resource .
If you want to make it part of another resource then use atom : link to link both resources .
Case closed .
Problem solved .
Ms. Khaddar had been on a diet , partly egged on by her mother , who is trying to improve her marriage prospects from across the country , in Delhi .
On the refrigerator , she had pasted a snarky yellow note to herself : “ Lose Weight , You Fat Pig . ”
In November , Ms. Khaddar gave notice at work , because she could no longer stand the job .
She said she was stressed out at the prospect of finding nothing in Bangalore and having to return to life with her parents in Delhi .
“ I do n’t think I ’m prepared to go home , ” she said .
Both women were trying to stave off their mothers ’ intervention in the marriage department , though not entirely .
Ms. Khaddar had been seeing someone but had yet to tell her parents , nor completely closed the door on her mother ’s plans .
Ms. Maddala , for her part , welcomed the prospect of having a husband chosen for her but not now , and not the overseas Indians for whom her mother has an affinity .
Not long ago , Ms. Maddala showed Ms. Khaddar a photograph of one such prospect , a young man living in the United States .
“ The picture just freaked me out , ” Ms. Khaddar recalled this morning , while getting herself ready for work .
“ I said , ‘ Dude , you ’re not getting married to that . ’ ”
Ms. Maddala laughed at the memory .
She agreed that he was too big and tall for her tastes .
A couple of months later , another marriage prospect fell through because the young man ’s family demanded a hefty dowry that gave Ms. Maddala pause .
More than anything , Ms. Maddala said , she wanted to savor her independence a bit longer .
She moved here from Hyderabad , about 300 miles away , earlier this year .
She described the lessons of freedom this way : “ What is me ?
What is myself ?
How can I manage ?
We come here , we realize we are strong . ”
The NY Times has an interesting story today that 's indicative of an emerging hacking - for - profit trend that just might allow the perpetrator to keep his ill - gotten gains .
In this case , the crime does n't involve hacking databases to steal credit and debit card numbers , but hacking a computer to obtain inside information in order to profit on the stock market .
The case involves a Ukrainian engineering consultant named Oleksandr Dorozhko who is alleged to have hacked into a computer that contained advance information about a negative earnings announcement for IMS Health , a company that provides market research to the pharmaceutical and health care industries .
[** Correction :
An earlier version of this post said that the computer Dorozhko hacked belonged to IMS Health .
Court records show that Dorozhko actually hacked the computer network of Thomson Financial to obtain the earnings information . ]
Dorozhko apparently obtained the information just a few hours before IMS was to make the earnings announcement public on October 17 , 2007 .
He quickly purchased 630 put options for IMS Health , betting that the price of IMS shares , which were then trading at $ 30 each , would drop within three days .
Dorozhko invested about $ 42,000 in the options , an amount that nearly equals his annual income , estimated to be between $ 45,000 and $ 50,000 .
Hours later , IMS Health announced that its earnings had dropped 15 percent from the previous year and 28 percent below analysts ' estimates , causing its stock price to fall to $ 21.20 the next day .
Dorozhko's prescient purchases landed him a tidy profit of $ 286,457 in one day – nearly six times his annual income .
The broker , Interactive Brokers , suspected something was wrong and temporarily froze the money to investigate before Dorozhko could withdraw it .
Now the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to seize the funds , but a federal judge has ruled that the freezing of the money was unlawful because Dorozhko did n't violate the securities law governing insider trading .
Per the Times piece :
A person who legally obtains insider information — as a corporate official or an investment banker , for example — will almost certainly break the securities law if he or she trades on the basis of that information before it is made public .
But it is far less clear that someone who illegally gets their hands on such information will have violated the securities laws by trading on it .
The securities law used to bring insider trading charges — Section 10 ( b ) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act — talks of “ a deceptive device or contrivance , ” and it is not clear that there is any deception involved in simple theft .
“ Dorozhko ’s alleged ‘ stealing and trading ’ or ‘ hacking and trading ’ does not amount to a violation ” of securities laws , Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of United States District Court ruled last month .
Although he may have broken laws by stealing the information , the judge concluded , “ Dorozhko did not breach any fiduciary or similar duty ‘ in connection with ’ the purchase or sale of a security . ”
She ordered the S.E.C. to let him have his profits .
The SEC has appealed the case , arguing that there was deception involved in the trade since Dorozhko deceived IMS 's computer system in gaining unauthorized access to it .
If the appellate judges rule against the SEC and order the funds to be unfrozen , they would set a precedent that would make it hard for the SEC to go after profits obtained through hacking in the future .
The logical question to ask then is why Dorozhko has n't been charged with a computer crime ?
The Times speculates that the Department of Justice has simply deemed the case not worth pursuing – probably due to the difficulties involved in gaining cooperation from local authorities to capture criminals in Ukraine .
I wonder if they 've considered labeling him a terrorist ?

Déjà vu : The Obama to Clinton Exit Poll Shift
Updated : Feb. 6 at 2pm
TruthIsAll http://www.geocities.com...el/SuperTuesdayShift.htm
Was it New Hampshire all over again ?
Once again the preliminary exit polls were forced to match the recorded vote .
But this time , Hillary Clinton , not Bush , was the beneficiary of an unlikely one - sided shift from the exit poll to the vote .
SEVEN states shifted beyond the MoE in Clinton ’s direction : AL , AZ , CA , GA , IL , MA , NJ
The probability is virtually zero that 7 of 16 states would exceed the MoE .
At 7 pm , Obama ’s national exit poll share was 50.9 % ; his actual recorded vote share was 46.8 % .
The probability of the 4.1 % discrepancy is virtually zero .
Obama led in 11 of the 16 exit - polled states .
In Massachusetts , Obama led by 3 % ; he lost by 15 % .
In New Jersey , Obama led by 5 % ; he lost by 10 % .
In Arizona , Obama led by 6 % ; he lost by 6 % .
http://openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3670
The Final CNN Exit Poll , which was forced to match the recorded vote , indicated that 15 states shifted to Clinton .
The exit poll shares flipped : Clinton 49.6 % , Obama 45.4 % .
Obama led in just 7 states .
http://www.cnn.com/ELECT...primaries/results...
Fourteen of the 16 states shifted to Clinton from the 7 pm exit polls to the final recorded vote .
Arkansas and Oklahoma shifted slightly to Obama , but Clinton won them both - by 42 % and 24 % .
The recorded vote shares : Clinton 49.1 % , Obama 46.8 %
Obama won 7 of the 16 states .
He currently leads in NM by 71 votes ( 98 % reported ) .

It is my understanding that San Diego County 's ROV Debra Seiler is a former rep for Diebold / Premier .
It 's also my understanding that there 's a group of ROVs suing CA SoS Debra Bowen because she decertified Premier 's voting machines .
How can we find out how many and which of CAs ROVs are actually " plants " who have infiltrated our ROVs offices ?
If we do n't stop this now , every county in CA will end up like LA County .
Connie McCormick , former Diebold rep and LA County ROV , is likely the reason LA is having the integrity problems it 's experiencing post - Feb .

California switched to paper ballots in some counties --- does anyone know how we go about finding out the vote counts for those counties vs. machine counts in the others ?
It would be interesting to see if we have another NH effect going on .
Again , not crying voter fraud , but as I posted earlier as well , this exit poll shifting ( all in favor of Clinton ) does n't make sense .
People then argue that folks just lie about exit polls , but these are anonymous and they 're writing them down --- not speaking to someone on the phone .
The media still has n't dug at why these polls are so on for other things , but off again in this case favoring the Clintons .
There needs to be some explanation as to why things are so off .

I saw something odd last night while watching the returns come in on the CA SOS page .
The gap between HC and BO was widening slightly from 1:30 AM until it began to hold steady at around 381,000 votes .
Then , at 2;39 AM the gap narrowed by about 10 thousand votes to 371,530 , as if a very strong LA precinct had come in for Obama .
But then at 2:59 AM , Obama 's numbers jumped again while Clinton 's numbers stayed exactly at 1,744,945 .
I could n't help but notice Richardson 's total sat exactly at 15,000 at this time until 3:24 AM .
There are many explanations one could offer for this .
The most obvious seems to be human data entry error or delay in posting portions of the results .
But I felt that I should share , particularly because the gap quickly widened back to about 380,000 votes , where it remained at 11:00 AM today .
Did anyone else notice this ?

Speaking of dodging bullets , Senator Inouye ( D - HI ) cast his 15,000th vote in the Senate a short while ago .
He is a Japanese American , you know , the ones who were put in prison camps by " patriots " during WWII .
He advocated for a Japanese American unit and became a leader in that unit .
It ended up being the most decorated unit in American Military history .
He vote " yes " to sunsetting FISA in 4 years ... if it passes .
He is against the things he fought against ... totalitarianism .
Yet the senate leader Reid , required that there be 60 votes for it to pass .
The vote was 49 - 46 ... so it would have passed but for Reidism .
What is Reid 's f**king problem ?
How many dems are going to become demoCons ?
As goes FISA so goes the nation ... already at the 8 count ... two to go ...

Ang Lee was determined to make his new film about Chinese espionage as frank as he could - but he did have to look away during the sex scenes .
He talks to Geoffrey Macnab
Sometimes people plan their holidays around movies .
Harry Potter obsessives try to track the locations populated by the teenage wizards .
New Zealand sold itself to holidaymakers on the back of The Lord of the Rings .
Hong Kong though , found a burgeoning market in cinematic sex tourism earlier this year , thanks to an arthouse film director .
Ang Lee 's latest movie , Lust , Caution , was released in China in an expurgated print , with its very graphic sex scenes removed .
In Hong Kong , however , they remained , and Chinese film - lovers made the trek to the city to see the film as the director intended .
It was a rapturously received smash in Hong Kong ( and Taiwan ) .
The story of a group of young dissidents in 30s and 40s China hatching a plot to kill a brutal politician , Lust , Caution might have been expected to bowl over audiences in the US , too .
After all , Americans are used to sex on screen , and Lee 's previous film , Brokeback Mountain , had been a critical hit in the States .
This time , though , they 've been lukewarm , and the movie has taken just $ 4.2 m ( £ 2.1 m ) at the US box office .
Lee , though , had foreseen the problems Americans might have with it .
The sex was n't the problem .
If anything , the destructive and violent love affair between student actor Wong Chia Chi ( newcomer Tang Wei ) and the politician Yee ( Tony Leung ) was the movie 's main selling point , even if those scenes attracted the dreaded NC - 17 certificate - a rating that scares off multiplexes .
What American audiences really seemed to struggle with was the slow - burn narrative style , the near three - hour running time , and the probing , painstaking way in which it explored aspects of recent Chinese social and political history .
I meet Lee in the ballroom of an old Venetian hotel .
In late afternoon , the room is dark and shadowy .
It makes a suitable backdrop for a discussion of a film as ambiguous and unsettling as Lust , Caution .
The Taiwanese director is unapologetic about his film .
" The pacing relates to the information that is given , " he says .
" We Chinese need to go back to the world we used to live in .
" It 's a lot of fun for the Chinese to watch the first half , to remind us of our innocence and how things used to be .
Then comes the real deal .
But for non-Chinese , you do n't get that benefit .
I am sure the Chinese viewer will have a blast , but when the western viewer reads subtitles , it is very frustrating .
You have that feeling : what the hell is going on .
But I had to make the movie right for myself and for the Chinese audience . "
A complex espionage thriller set in Shanghai and Hong Kong during the late 1930s and early 40s , Lust , Caution is not - at least to American eyes - a crowdpleaser in the vein of Lee 's Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon .
Instead of gravity - defying martial artistry , it consists mainly of characters talking .
When there is violence - for example , when the students try to assassinate a man who has a Rasputin - like aversion to dying - it is realistic and dismaying .
When they plunge a knife in the man 's stomach , it bounces out .
And , like the violence , the sex is dealt with equally frankly .
" They [ historians ] tell you about the glorious war , the fight .
They do n't tell you that it is very hard to kill someone .
They tell you that the women spies seduced the men and killed them .
They do n't tell you about the sex . "
Lee laughs wearily as he explains his attempts in the film to look behind the official stories about Japanese occupation of Shanghai .
Just as he did in Brokeback Mountain ( when adapting Annie Proulx 's story for the screen ) , Lee has taken a short piece of fiction and has fleshed it out , giving it an epic quality .
Lust , Caution is based on a 28 - page story by Eileen Chang .
" She writes about women 's sexuality and feeling for love during the most macho war we have had .
It is like - how dare she ! "
Lee says .
" It is very gutsy work .
That triggers me to investigate my own upbringing and patriotism . "
It quickly becomes apparent , for Lee himself , how personal and even autobiographical Lust , Caution is .
For example , Yee 's very specific gait is based on that of Lee 's father .
The director admits to a close identification with the spy played by Tang Wei , too .
" When we were doing the movie , I used to joke that I carry the head and purity of the idealistic student Kuang Yu Min , the heart of Wong Chia Chi and the balls of Mr Yee , " Lee says .
He then adds that Tony Leung has projected aspects of Lee 's own character into Yee .
A curious remark , certainly , given that Yee is n't a remotely sympathetic character .
He is a quisling , collaborating with the Japanese and overseeing the torture and killing of Chinese rebels .
Then again , it is Yee 's personal and sexual life that intrigues him .
" I desire it but I can not do it .
I make it into a movie .
He projects a lot of that part of myself .
It is a romance I never really experienced that I was longing for .
It is almost like a dream . "
Like the students , whose high - minded ideals are shaken when they get their hands dirty with plotting and assassination , Lee acknowledges that he has been " shocked by reality , naive in some ways , not really knowing what to do in an adult world , like a big kid " .
As for Wong , he identifies with her because : " it seems that only by pretending , by getting far away from reality , she can reach her true self ... to touch the real you that you try to cover up . "
Meanwhile , Lee relished the chance to recreate his parents ' era and their way of thinking .
His preparation was exhaustive .
For instance , he and his casting directors saw 10,000 actors before finally choosing Tang Wei .
Actor Tony Leung testifies that Lee was a ferociously demanding director : always asking for that little bit more , the different way to do the scene , the extra detail .
The scenes that were the hardest to shoot were , inevitably , the sex scenes .
The director admits that he felt extremely uncomfortable filming them .
He was conscious that he was first engineering some extremely raw and intimate moments , and then intruding on them .
" For this project , I had to strip down and get to the heart of the darkness in some way , " he says .
His instinct , he says , as he filmed Leung and Tang Wei making love was to look the other way .
" I do n't make pornography , so when you get down to that , it is very painful to shoot .
You fight with your moral sense .
You are deeply confused .
It is embarrassing to coach the actors through it - to verbalise and to give indications .
You are revealing your secrets when you are shooting like that . "
The sex scenes were shot on a closed set with only four people present - the couple , the director and the cinematographer .
Lee defends the sex scenes as being utterly integral to the film .
Yes , it is inevitable that the scandal surrounding these scenes will dominate discussion of the movie .
" That bothers me .
It gives me sleepless nights . "
He and his collaborators have done their utmost to make the best film they can and all the journalists want to talk about is the sex .
At a press conference earlier in the day , he had fielded the sex questions patiently enough .
Did they really do it ?
To Lee , that is n't the right question .
What is important is that the audience has to believe in the scenes .
Look at the eyes , not the bodies .
In the end , though , Lee 's real preoccupation is n't the sex .
Nor is it the politics .
Nor is it the chance to bring back to life an era in Chinese history that is in danger of being forgotten .
Like Brokeback Mountain , it is an emotionally charged story of a forbidden love .
Lust , Caution may begin as an espionage thriller in which the politics and social history are foregrounded .
By the final reel , though , it has turned into a full - blown weepie .
At its core , this is a film about romantic obsession - " doomed , impossible romantic love " .
The middle - aged director , who is happily married , grounded and emotionally stable , just can't help but be drawn to tales of amour fou .
" After Brokeback and this one , I do believe deeply inside that I am a romantic , " Lee admits .
" I was never romantic in real life .
That is why I have to make movies about it . "
· Lust , Caution is released on January 4
If you had a house that was going to be demolished , scrapped and completely replaced with something else – what would you do with it ?
Well , a couple of guys thought it would be neat to turn this place into the strangest thing the suburbs have ever seen , before the site would be turned into a new arts center .
Passers by are clearly awestruck by this amazing suburban art installation .
The tunnel house gives an illusion of vertigo , a sense that it is being sucked in upon itself – a compelling visual effect .
The above shot shows both of the artists ( left ) , who clearly have a sense of humor about the entire project .
Amazingly enough , people can even interact with this piece , walking through the middle and coming out the other side !
The tunnel tapers through the center of house , becoming a crawlspace that ‘ drains out the other side .
A surreal experience to be sure , and probably the most typical house would could choose to turn into an amazing piece of suburban installation art !

FEBRUARY 7-- Lawyers for Brian McNamee , the trainer who has accused ex-client Roger Clemens of using performance - enhancing drugs , today released photos purporting to show syringes , blood - specked gauze pads , and drug vials used by the embattled baseball star .
The photos can be found on the following two pages ( it is unclear what the significance is of the Miller Lite can seen in this image ) .
McNamee 's lawyers have said that the items were turned over last month to federal investigators who have been probing the widespread use and distribution of illegal substances by professional athletes .
McNamee has previously charged that he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone on about 16 occasions between 1998 and 2001 .
He reportedly kept the used vials , syringes , and gauze as some kind of insurance policy were he to get caught distributing the drugs .

The Bush Administration issued numerous terror alerts based on scant intelligence in order to rally people around the flag when the administration was suffering in the polls .
Says who ?
Well , how about :
Of course , the administration also cried wolf about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , Iran 's nuclear capabilities , Al - Qaeda 's composition , strength and numbers , and a host of other things .

Phil 's website has received 500,000 hits
He did not just want the facts , figures and symptoms of the disease but to be able to talk to others who had it .
He wanted a website that presented testicular cancer as a disease predominantly affecting young men , talking to them in a language they understood .
So , with the help of a number of pop legends , Phil set up his own website .
Targeted help needed
" There was nobody in my area who I knew had it , " said Phil .
" There was no - one I knew to ask , ' What can I expect from this ?
What can I expect from that ?'
" All the websites I looked at were the same charity websites with the symptoms . "
There was no - one to talk to , no information
Phil Morris
When he first discovered a lump , Phil admits he was blase .
" I was in the shower when I found one of my testicles was a lot bigger than the other and , being an ex-soldier , I just thought , ' Oh it will go away . '
The usual men's thing .
" But after three weeks it just had n't stopped getting bigger and bigger so I went to the doctor .
He said it was just an infection and sent me away .
" About four weeks later I was having my treatment for a kidney stone and I asked another doctor about my testicle , " he said .
The doctor scanned the testicle , discovered cancer and three days later Phil had the tumour removed .
Good prognosis
Phil is good friends with Steve White , Paul Weller 's drummer in the Style Council .
He was invited backstage to meet the band at one of their gigs and told them about his health problems and the lack of information .
They said they wanted to help .
" I told them that there was no - one to talk to , no information .
I said there are loads of breast cancer websites , with forums for survivors but there is nothing for young men and it is a young man 's disease .
Early signs
A hard lump on the front or side of a testicle Swelling or enlargement of a testicle or an increase in firmness of a testicle Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum
An unusual difference between testes A heavy feeling in the scrotum , or a dull ache in the lower stomach , groin or scrotum .
" The average age for this cancer is between 15 and 35 .
I got it when I was 34 .
" I told them there needed to be something more down to earth , more approachable online and they said they would get me some money together if I thought of a website .
" I said we need a proper lads type of website , where as soon as you go on you start relaxing , " he said .
So , four years ago , " Checkemlads.com . " was born and Phil says it is growing in popularity .
" On our website the men grab their ' nuts ' and a speech bubble comes out offering information about where to click for each section .
Phil Morris when he was ill
" There are pictures of me when I was ill and the survivors ' stories are there .
" It is what we needed - a laddish approach , not a ' naughty lads ' approach but something that will appeal to lads .
" I also go to schools to give light - hearted talks .
" I do n't start by saying testicular cancer .
I get them relaxed because as soon as you mention testicles they will look at the ceiling .
So I will say ' bollocks ' and I will say ' knackers ' .
Survivors can have their stories on the ' wonderwall '
" I also do talks for the Army .
I did one in front of Prince Harry , " said Phil .
Now Phil wants to set up a breast cancer website called ' Checkemgirls ' .
Signs and symptoms
Martin Ledwick , head of Cancer Research UK 's information nurses , said getting the warning symptoms across about testicular cancer was crucial for good survival rates .
" Testicular cancer is one of the few cancers that can affect younger men but it is rare - around 2,000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year .
" The good news is that over 98 % of men with testicular cancer are now successfully treated .
" If you notice anything unusual , it 's important to act right away and report any changes to your doctor .
" Early detection and prompt treatment gives the best possible chance of making a full recovery . "
Stress makes us depressed , fat , sick - and we do it to ourselves
Too much pressure can cause autoimmune disorders , depression and other problems - and doctors say we 're doing it to ourselves
We 're so stressed out it 's making us ill .
We 're so stressed out it 's making us ill .

A sensible person might argue that at 74 , Connie Berto should be enjoying the quiet luxuries of retirement , like afternoon naps and baking pies .
But like most Americans , Berto has picked the rush of an active , nonstop lifestyle over peace and quiet .
" I 'm always on the go , go , go , " said Berto , who lives in the Sleepy Hollow community in Marin County .
" My husband and I have a lot of interests and volunteer work and grandchildren - 2 - year - old twins that I babysit all the time .
I have two horses in the backyard , and I do all the cleaning and the cooking myself . "
And do n't get her started on the holidays .
" With five kids and their spouses and trying to get Christmas presents for everybody , well , we 're always on a tight schedule , " she said .
There 's no doubt , Berto said , that Americans are more stressed out than ever before .
Doctors agree .
In fact , they say , Americans are so riddled with stress these days that it 's making them sick .
An office worker develops a strange rash from the daily pressures of dealing with a demanding boss .
A child complains of a stomachache from too much homework or grueling daily soccer practices .
A teenager lives on coffee and energy drinks in order to squeeze in more time for social activities .
Chronic stress has been linked to depression , heart disease , autoimmune disorders , premature cell aging , and obesity and diabetes .
It can cause hives and numbness , gastrointestinal problems and acne .
It can make people more susceptible to the flu .
The really frustrating part for doctors is that much of the stress patients experience is manufactured - the result of an increasingly connected society that has everyone expecting instant gratification , and instant results .
Very few people are making the time to unplug and relax , even for just a few minutes every day .
" Our being connected to everyone all the time is a good thing and a bad thing , " said Dr. David Spiegel , a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine .
" I can be in touch with colleagues around the world , but all that seems to do is enhance expectations for productivity .
We work harder , and we 're never disconnected .
" A long time ago , when it got dark , you ate dinner and went to sleep .
Now we 've turned night into day .
We 're getting a lot less sleep .
It all adds up to a lot of stress , and our minds and bodies are not prepared to deal with it . "
There has been much research into the effects of chronic stress on the body .
Most of it comes down to a hormone called cortisol , which is released by the adrenal gland when people are under stress .
Cortisol stimulates systems that put the body in a " fight or flight " mode , said Dr. Don Mordecai , chief of psychiatry at Kaiser Permanente 's Santa Teresa Medical Center in San Jose .
It diverts blood to critical areas like the heart , lungs and muscles that make people better able to deal with an emergency .
" You breathe more , you get more oxygen to your muscles so if you have to flee your legs are ready .
Your pupils contract so that you 're seeing things more sharply .
Your brain is ready to process things more quickly , " Mordecai said .
That 's great if you 're about to get eaten by a grizzly bear - or rear - end someone on the freeway - but it can be damaging when people experience that kind of stress day in and day out for long periods of time .
Cortisol can weaken the immune system , or , alternatively , send it into overdrive .
People can become more vulnerable to sickness , or autoimmune disorders flare up , leading to stress - related symptoms like skin problems .
Relatively new evidence suggests that cortisol also makes people crave fatty , sugary comfort foods , which can lead to obesity and insulin resistance .
" We think stress plays a large but hidden role in the obesity epidemic , " said Elissa Epel , an assistant professor of psychiatry at UCSF and an expert on the physiological effects of stress .
" We are surrounded by an abundance of this high - caloric food and our brains are hard - wired to eat it .
It 's very hard for people to not become overweight , especially if they 're stressed . "
The point , researchers say , is that there 's no doubt that chronic stress is unhealthy .
The hard part for many people is figuring out how much stress is too much .
Everyone experiences daily frustrations and anxieties - rush - hour traffic , looming deadlines at work , petty office politics .
" We 're so used to it that we do n't even think about stress anymore .
It 's just life , " Spiegel said .
" We think if we 're really tough we 'll work through these limitations .
We 're not very respectful of our bodies and that creates the real problem .
" Listen to your body .
It 's smarter than you are , and it 's telling you you 're taking on too much . "
But with increasing pressure to perform and meet higher and higher expectations - make more money , send the kids to better schools , lose weight , make sure everyone in the family has their best Christmas ever - it 's becoming harder and harder for people to let go .
For many people , just giving themselves a break , literally and figuratively , can make a huge difference in how they handle stress .
That could mean deciding that this year 's Christmas party is a potluck instead of a dinner for mom to slave over .
Doctors also suggest taking a few minutes several times a day to meditate , or finding a quiet spot to sit down and relax .
Exercise helps a lot , doctors say , and taking a brisk walk before or after work can clear the mind .
Judy Moskowitz , an adjunct assistant professor in the department of medicine at UCSF , is doing research into positive thinking , with the deliciously simple premise that focusing on a few good thoughts during a stressful time can make a big difference to a person 's health .
She said she 's studied people with serious and frightening medical diagnoses , and found that those who were able to think positively from time to time were healthier overall .
" It 's this ability to notice and sort of capitalize on positive events that happen in your life , so you do n't get consumed by stress , " Moskowitz said .
" I do n't mean to minimize stress by saying ' just think positive . '
It might sound very Pollyanna , but it really is n't .
It 's the ability to not be totally consumed by the negative , to broaden your perspective and open your eyes . "
Of course , people with chronic stress may need professional help to control .
Psychiatrists say that if people are having a physical reaction to stress , they should at least check in with their primary care doctor .
They might also want to see a psychiatrist or get therapy if relationships are suffering or they 're no longer able to do their job because of stress .
Medication can help for anxiety disorders or depression , which can occur when stress leads people to feel hopeless and out of control .
Behavioral therapy is also available to help people learn coping mechanisms .
Mordecai said he sees many patients who " catastrophize " events in their life - they stress over worst - case scenarios to the point where they can't function .
It can take a lot of work , but learning to think through a stressful situation can alleviate symptoms of stress .
" I see people who say , for instance , that they have a party to go to and they know they 're going to say the wrong thing and embarrass themselves and lose their job , " Mordecai said .
" They are bringing stress upon themselves from a hypothetical situation .
But we can take a look at their thought patterns and replace them . "
For Berto , who can't avoid stress even in retirement in the quiet enclave of Sleepy Hollow , the best solution to stress has been prayer .
It 's partly her faith that helps her put things in perspective , she said , but she also gives herself time every day to step back and take a deep breath .
" Sometimes you wake up at night and the words start rolling around in your brain and you just can't turn them off .
You get the ' what ifs ' and worries about everything , and it robs you of your sleep , " Berto said .
" The Buddhists have their chants , some people meditate .

The lowdown on stress
What happens to the body under stress : --
The adrenal gland produces the hormone cortisol , which puts the body into " fight or flight " mode .
In situations of acute stress - a car accident , for example - the cortisol diverts blood to critical systems such as the heart and lungs .
Some of the problems associated with chronic stress : -- Continual stress often leads to sleep loss , irritation and despondency , causing problems in relationships and an inability to think clearly .
--
A variety of health problems can result , including heart disease , obesity , diabetes , autoimmune disorders and premature cell aging .
Chronic stress also can weaken the immune system and leave people vulnerable to illness .
Ways to deal with daily stress : --
Take regular daily breaks to relax and clear your head .
--
Meditate , even for just a few minutes at a time .
-- Exercise . --
Spend time with close friends after work or make the effort to sit down to a family dinner as often as possible .
Doctors say the holidays - often perceived as a time of extra stress - can actually help people unwind by forcing them to take time off from work and focus on family .
No matter how much you ’ve read about trading , or how much experience you have as a trader , it is difficult to trade profitably in a volatile market environment like the one we are in now .
A rising market is often perceived to reflect optimism and investor faith .
Enthusiasm and rejuvenated interest in the markets rides high .
Many investors have multiplied their money manifolds .
Now , is it time to quit ?
Will the bubble burst ?
The investor has many questions and very few options before him .
Strategies for a rising market are crucial and much depends on the risk appetite of the investor .
Do n’t sell into the panic .
Do n’t buy the greed .
This is of course obvious to say , but harder to execute when it is actually happening .
When you have extreme market conditions , the individual stock movements can be big and rapid , and they are not necessarily , and in fact , usually not at all , related to fundamentals or economics .
Will the upswing continue ?
This is a difficult question and much depends on the factors that contribute to the bull run .
Many perceive the market to be over - heated and fear to set foot in it .
Others view corrections as an opportunity to make quick money .
But this calls for quick decision - making and considerable tolerance to risk .
The unfailing strategy is to buy great companies with long track records of rising stock prices and dividends .
Pick them low and hold on .
Over a long haul , such companies with good fundamentals will not fail you .
It is not unusual to find some stocks faring poorly in a bull market and some doing exceptionally well in a bear market .
A bull run implies a booming economy , low unemployment rate , high production of goods and low inflation .

Do n’t use any meaningful amount of margin .
Additionally , the data shows that with the use of margin , your long term expectancy does go to zero .
Investors must make judicious decisions when it comes to investing their hard earned money in the markets .
Some stocks may become highly overpriced .
An overpriced stock in a heated market is sure to burst when the bull run ends .
Some investors prefer to sell all their shares and make profits .
Another strategy is to sell some of the shares and buy back the stock when the price falls back to reasonably low levels .
The value of equities tends to rise fast in a bull run .
Predictably , the equity investments in your portfolio will become disproportionately higher .
Depending upon your age , objectives and financial obligations , you would have arrived at an asset allocation plan .
Those who feel the country ’s economy is poised for a consistent growth and global factors more biased towards Indian markets , may predict the Sensex moving upwards .
Such investors who can take short - term volatility on their stride can remain invested for some more time .
They can hold on and see more profits .
Turn off “ the noise . ” CNBC , blogs , web sites , the Wall Street Journal Newspaper …. whatever .
The news is filled with superlatives right now , “ biggest ever , ” “ worst ever , ” “ most ever , ” “ going out of business , ” “ recession , ” “ depression , ” this talk just adds to the fear and panic and has the chance to steer you off course from your plan .
For others who have multiplied their money , even though the investment period may be very short , simply book profits and be happy with it .
Some investors feel political uncertainties , oil prices , global economies and events can overturn the joy ride .
Simply book profits and reenter once the market cools down .
Booking partial profits is the best thing to do for the investor who is in puzzled about his next move .
The market ups and downs follow cyclic patterns .
For now , it is the time of rising index and increasing volatility .
Yes , increased investor enthusiasm and optimism keeps the index hovering around the big numbers .
But the possibility for a bubble burst looms large and investors must keep it in mind .
Alarmed by the George W. Bush administration ’s increasing use of the so - called " state secrets privilege " to keep politically embarrassing lawsuits against the government from ever coming before a judge , Congress is stepping in to help ensure that people with grievances can have their cases heard .
A new bill sponsored by Senators Edward M. Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat , and Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , would provide a mechanism for protecting legitimate secrets while also permitting civil litigation to proceed .
Both are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The state secrets privilege is a common law right that lets the government protect sensitive national security information from being disclosed as evidence in litigation .
The privilege was first recognized by the US Supreme Court in 1953 , in a case later shown to have been bogus .
It has been asserted since then by every US administration , Republican and Democratic .
But the Bush administration has increased its use dramatically .
It has invoked the privilege in over 25 percent more cases each year than previous administrations , and has sought dismissal in over 90 percent more cases .
The privilege has been invoked to dismiss claims of unlawful domestic surveillance , detention , torture , and misconduct by government employees , on grounds that adjudicating them would cause unacceptable damage to national security .
" When courts dismiss cases alleging human rights violations on state secrets grounds , and leave no alternative for redress , the US is in violation of its obligation under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to provide a remedy , " Gabor Rona , international legal director of the advocacy group Human Rights First , told IPS .
The proposed new legislation " will ensure that the litigation process will not reveal state secrets , using many of the same safeguards that have proven effective in criminal cases and in litigation under the Freedom of Information Act , " according to Senator Kennedy ’s office .
Steven Aftergood , head of the Government Secrecy Program at the Federation of American Scientists , says the Kennedy - Specter legislation " would go a long way towards restoring confidence that the privilege is being properly used , and would help deter abuse . "
He told IPS , " The government ’s ‘ say - so ’ would not be enough . "
" The state secrets privilege has been used to derail legal challenges to government policies on detention , rendition , and interrogation , among other outstanding issues .
There has to be a better way .
There is no incentive for the executive to regulate itself or to curtail its use of the privilege , " he said .
In 1980 , Congress enacted the Classified Information Procedures Act ( CIPA ) to provide federal courts with clear statutory guidance on handling secret evidence in criminal cases .
But no such guidance has been available in civil cases .
The proposed new law is intended to correct that situation by providing the courts with " clear , fair , and safe rules . "
The proposed new law " clarifies that the courts , not the executive branch , must review the evidence and determine whether information is covered by the state secrets privilege , " Kennedy says .
Legal scholars have long recognized the need for congressional guidance on this issue .
A recent report by the American Bar Association urged Congress to " enact legislation governing federal civil cases implicating the state secrets privilege . "
The bipartisan Constitution Project found that " legislative action is essential to restore and strengthen the basic rights and liberties provided by our constitutional system of government . "
And a group of leading constitutional scholars wrote to Congress emphasizing that there " is a need for new rules designed to protect the system of checks and balances , individual rights , national security , fairness in the courtroom , and the adversary process . "
The absence of such rules has resulted in the dismissal of a number of high - profile lawsuits against the government .
Examples include a German citizen , Khaled el - Masri who complained that he was kidnapped , illegally detained and abused by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in a case of " extraordinary rendition . "
His suit was dismissed because he would not be able to make his case except by using " [ privileged ] evidence that exposes how the CIA organizes , staffs , and supervises its most sensitive intelligence operations "  and the CIA could not defend itself against the allegations " without using privileged evidence . "
In another widely publicized case , the Justice Department asserted the state secrets privilege in successfully seeking to dismiss a lawsuit by Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian citizen who was detained in the US in 2002 and sent against his will to Syria , where he says he was tortured until his release a year later .
A Canadian government commission found after a two - year investigation that Arar had no connection with terrorists and awarded him compensation of 10 million dollars and an apology .
And perhaps the best - known of such cases involved Sibel Edmonds , a former translator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation , who was fired for reporting security breaches and possible espionage within the Bureau .
Edmonds unsuccessfully appealed her case to the US Supreme Court .
At the time , the inspector general of the Justice Department found that Edmonds ’ firing was an act of retaliation .
She has since become the head of a group advocating for greater legal protections for whistleblowers who are involved in national security work .
Legal scholars and legal rights advocates have been outspoken on the Bush administration ’s use of the state secrets as a shield behind which it can conceal virtually any activity .
Prof. David Cole of the Georgetown University Law Center , one of the nation ’s preeminent constitutional lawyers , told IPS , " The administration has argued on the merits that the president has unilateral executive power in the ‘ war on terror ’ to violate even criminal laws , and when it has been challenged on that assertion , it has argued that the courts ca n’t even rule on that assertion of power because the alleged criminal violation is a ‘ state secret ’ . "
Cole ’s view is echoed by Prof. Peter Shane of the Ohio University law school .
He told IPS , " The expansion of executive power for its own sake has been a political priority of the Bush administration since the beginning .
Consistent with this agenda , the administration has been conspicuous in its defense of the executive ’s secret - keeping authorities , even where disclosure of the information sought would not seem to undermine any public interest .
This is true not just for state secret claims , but for the full scope of conceivable executive privilege claims . "
He added , " The current Supreme Court is so solicitous of presidential power that there is absolutely no prospect of real reform initiated by the current judiciary .
If there is to be change , it will have to be at the initiative of Congress . "
Early in January , Ferrari started testing their new F1 car at Fiorano .
I stumbled across this video when looking for information about how the tests went .
Micheal Schumacher was on hand to observe , and judging by the smile on Kimi ’s face near the end , it looks like it is going to be a good year for Scuderia Ferrari .

Six botnets are responsible for 85 per cent of all spam , according to an analysis by net security firm Marshal .
The Srizbi botnet is reckoned to be the largest single source of spam - accounting for 39 per cent of junk mail messages – followed by the Rustock botnet , responsible for 21 per cent of the spam clogging up users ' inboxes .
Spam emanating from the Mega - D botnet , which Marshal reckons was the leading source of junk mail in early February , was temporarily stemmed after control servers were taken out in mid-February .
The estimated 35,000 zombie clients associated with the Mega - D botnet were infected with the Ozdok Trojan .
After 10 days of inactivity , spam from compromised hosts began flowing again earlier this week , after hackers re-established control .
Despite the break in transmission , Spam - D accounted for an estimated 11 per cent of junk mail hitting Marshal 's spam traps during February .
Other active spam botnets include Hacktool .
Spammer ( AKA Spam - Mailer ) and botnets associated with the Pushdo ( AKA Pandex ) family of malware .
The notorious Storm botnet , estimated to include about 85,000 compromised hosts , is thought to be responsible for only three per cent of spam .
" The size of a botnet , measured by how many bots it has , does not necessarily correlate with how much spam it sends .
Our team has observed huge variations in the rate at which different spambots pump out spam , " said Bradley Anstis , VP of products at Marshal .
In many instance , spammers have access to multiple botnets .
In addition to Mega - D , other botnets - including Srizbi , Rustock , Hacktool .
Spammer and Pushdo - have been simultaneously sending spam promoting Express Herbals , a line of male enhancement pills .
According to February statistics from managed security firm Network Box , the US continued to pump out the most spam and spread the most viruses .
The country accounted for 13 per cent of all viruses ; and was the source of 15 per cent of all spam , more than double its closest junk mail rival , Turkey . ®

As time passes , largely against my will , I have become a student of nonsense .
More importantly , I ’ve become interested in why some forms of nonsense can lucratively persist , where others quietly fail .
Brain
Gym continues to produce more email than almost any other subject : usually it is from teachers , eager to defend the practice , but also from children , astonished at the sheer stupidity of what they are being taught .
As you will remember , Brain Gym is a set of perfectly good fun exercise break ideas for kids , which costs a packet and comes attached to a bizarre and entirely bogus pseudoscientific explanatory framework .
They tell you to rub either side of your breast bone , in a special Brain Gym way called Brain Buttons : “ This exercise stimulates the flow of oxygen - carrying blood through the carotid arteries to the brain to awaken it and increase concentration and relaxation .
Brain buttons lie directly over and stimulate the carotid arteries . ”
Through your ribcage .
Without using scissors .
They ’re keen on drinking water .
Fair enough .
But why ?
“ Processed foods , ” says the Brain Gym manual , “ do not contain water . ”
Is there water in soup ?
No .
“ All other liquids are processed in the body as food , and do not serve the body ’s water needs . ”
This ridiculousness comes at very great cost , paid for by you , the taxpayer , in thousands of state schools .
It is peddled directly to your children by their credulous and apparently moronic teachers .
If you like scandals , then this is one .
The very same person who tells your child that blood is pumped around the lungs and then the body by the heart , is also telling them that when they do The Energizer exercise then “ this back and forward movement of the head increases the circulation to the frontal lobe for greater comprehension and rational thinking ” .
Beyond the stupidity of some headteachers , how has Brain Gym survived ?
A clue can be found in a set of experiments from the March 2008 edition of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience , which elegantly show that people will buy into bogus explanations much more readily when they are dressed up with a few technical words from the world of neuroscience .
Subjects were given descriptions of various psychology phenomena , and then randomly offered one of four explanations for them : the explanations either contained neuroscience , or did n’t ; and they were either good explanations or bad ones ( bad ones being , for example , simply circular restatements of the phenomenon itself ) .
Here is one of their scenarios .
Experiments have shown that people are quite bad at estimating the knowledge of others : if we know the answer to a piece of trivia , we overestimate the extent to which other people will know that answer too .
A “ without neuroscience ” explanation for this phenomenon was : “ The researchers claim that this [ overestimation ] happens because subjects have trouble switching their point of view to consider what someone else might know , mistakenly projecting their own knowledge on to others . ”
( This happened to be a “ good ” explanation . )
A “ with neuroscience ” explanation – and a cruddy one too – was this : “ Brain scans indicate that this [ overestimation ] happens because of the frontal lobe brain circuitry known to be involved in self - knowledge .
Subjects make more mistakes when they have to judge the knowledge of others .
People are much better at judging what they themselves know . ”
The neuroscience information is irrelevant to the logic of the explanation .
The subjects were from three groups : everyday people , neuroscience students , and neuroscience academics .
All three groups judged good explanations as more satisfying than bad ones , but the subjects in the two non-expert groups judged that the explanations with logically irrelevant neurosciencey information were more satisfying than the explanations without .
What ’s more , the bogus neuroscience information had a particularly strong effect on peoples ’ judgments of bad explanations .
As quacks are well aware , adding scientific - sounding but conceptually uninformative information makes it harder to spot a dodgy explanation .
An interesting question is why .
The very presence of neuroscience information might be seen as a surrogate marker of a good explanation , regardless of what is actually said .
As the researchers say , “ something about seeing neuroscience information may encourage people to believe they have received a scientific explanation when they have not . ”
More clues can be found in the extensive literature on irrationality .
People tend , for example , to rate longer explanations as being more similar to “ experts ’ explanations ” .
There is also the “ seductive details ” effect : if you present related ( but logically irrelevant ) details to people , as part of an argument , that seems to make it more difficult for them to encode and later recall the main argument of a text , because attention is diverted .
But any meaningless filler , not just scientific jargon , can change behaviour : studies have found , for example , that people respond positively more often to requests with uninformative “ placebo ” information in them : office warriors will be interested to hear that “ Can I use the photocopier ?
I have to make some copies , ” is more successful than the simple “ Can I use the photocopier ? ”
And more than all this , the public – although not scientists – express a rather Victorian fetish for reductionist explanations about the world ( “ expensive fish oil pills solve complex social problem in schools ” being my favourite example ) .
The neurosciencey language in this new “ bogus neuroscience explanations ” experiment – and in the Brain Gym literature – make us feel as if we have been given a physical explanation for a behavioural phenomenon ( “ an exercise break in class is refreshing ” ) : we have made the behavioural phenomena feel somehow connected to a larger explanatory system , the physical sciences , the world of certainty , graphs , and unambiguous data .
Like descriptions of genetic risk factors for violence , this is a partial explanation , but it is not an excuse .
Headteachers are still peddling Brain Gym across the UK .
And I am writing all your names in my naughty book .

The seductive allure of neuroscience explanations
Here is a serious paper looking at the ridiculous neuroscience assumptions behind Brain Gym ( rather gratifyingly they reference me in it , I ’ll have to crowbar that into my RAE ) .

Here is a PhD on the bogusity of the research on Brain Gym :

The number of mentions for Brain Gym on government websites is truly eye watering .

And here are just a few of the thousands of schools in the UK which are using this nonsense :

I had no idea we had so many morons in high places .
Teaching children .
Luckily not all children are falling for it :
Here are two excellently cheeky kids demonstrating what happens when you do the incredibly powerful “ Brain Buttons ” exercise the wrong way around .
You ’ll have to turn the sound up , I like the bit where they say “ yes , mm , and the scientists proved all this in 1985 ” .
.

Meanwhile here are some teachers taking Brain Gym much more seriously .

.
Do you want to know what they ’re doing ?
“ Hook - ups shift electrical energy from the survival centres in the hindbrain to the reasoning centres in the midbrain and neocortex , thus activating hemispheric integration … the tongue pressing into the roof of the mouth stimulates the limbic system for emotional processing in concert with more refined reasoning in the frontal lobes ”
The stupid .
It burns .
The report says brokers are paid for providing recruits
The Burmese army is forcibly recruiting children to cover gaps left by a lack of adult recruits , says a report by a US - based human rights organisation .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) says children as young as 10 are beaten or threatened with arrest to make them enlist .
Both the army and ethnic rebels have been accused of using children before .
But the timing of this report is particularly damaging for the military , which is already under pressure after a crackdown on anti-government protests .
The military insists it is opposed to the use of child soldiers , but HRW says the abuses were extensive and systemic .
It said it had published the report to try to urge the United Nations Security Council to tackle the issue .
False documents
The report , entitled " Sold to be Soldiers : The Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers in Burma " says there are thousands of children in the Burmese military .
It claims that children are approached in public places by military recruiters and civilian brokers who have been promised cash rewards by the military .
The government 's senior generals tolerate the blatant recruitment of children and fail to punish perpetrators
Jo Becker , HRW
The children are often beaten or threatened with arrest to force them to enlist , the report says .
It is claimed that recruiting officers routinely falsify enlistment documents to register children as being 18 , the legal minimum age for recruitment .
One child quoted in the report says he was forced to lie about his age when he was recruited for a second time .
" When I said I was 16 , I was slapped and he said , ' You are 18 , answer 18 . '
" I just wanted to go back and home and I told them , but they refused . "
' Blatant recruitment '
The child recruits are deployed to battalions after an average of 18 weeks training , the report says .
They are often reportedly sent into combat immediately , or forced to take part in activities , such as burning villages , which can be classified as human rights abuses .
Jo Becker , children 's rights advocate for HRW , said Burma is " literally buying and selling children " to fill the ranks .
It is not clear how many people were killed in the protest " The government 's senior generals tolerate the blatant recruitment of children and fail to punish perpetrators , " she said .
" In this environment , army recruiters traffic children at will . "
Ms Becker said that the recent military crackdown had put off many of those potential recruits who were not already deterred by poor conditions and low pay .
" After deploying its soldiers against Buddhist monks and other peaceful demonstrators , the government may find it even harder to find willing volunteers , " she said .
The Burmese ruling junta says it has formed a high - level committee to address the issue of child soldiers .
However , Ms Becker described the committee as " a sham " , saying the government must address the issue head - on and demobilise all children .
The UN Security Council is due to meet soon to discuss the use of child soldiers in Burma .
HRW has accused the Security Council of not taking any action to address the issue , despite stating repeatedly that it would consider targeted sanctions .
The group has urged the UN to impose travel restrictions and arms embargos if the situation does not improve .

CNN : Hawkish Israel supporters concerned about Obama David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday February 26 , 2008

In an effort to shore up his support among Jewish voters , Barack Obama met privately on Sunday with 100 Jewish leaders in Ohio to tamp down concerns about his Middle East views and controversial positions from a few of his supporters .
The Clinton campaign has been actively wooing Jewish voters , in part by questioning Obama 's commitment to the defense of Israel , and the meeting was arranged to enable Obama to address the concerns of the Jewish community .
The Illinois Senator has previously faced concerns from Jewish leaders .
Obama began by telling his audience , " We need to change our priorities .
...
These changes are founded in a view of the world that I believe is deeply imbedded in the Jewish tradition .
...
That repairing the world is a task that each of us is called upon to take up every single day . "
Obama then reaffirmed his " unshakable commitment to the security of Israel and the friendship between the United States and Israel . "
He stated clearly that he is a Christian , not a Muslim , and explained his reluctance to criticize the minister of his church for making favorable comments about Louis Farrakhan , who has been criticized for being anti-Semitic .
" It is true that my Pastor , Jeremiah Wright , who will be retiring this month , is somebody who on occasion can say controversial things , " Obama acknowledged .
" He is like an old uncle who sometimes will say things that I dont agree with .
...
But I have never heard an anti-Semitic [ remark ] made inside of our church .
I have never heard anything that would suggest anti-Semitism on part of the Pastor . "
Obama also addressed concerns about his relationship with Zbigniew Brzezinski , who served as President Jimmy Carter 's National Security Advisor and who recently offended many in the Jewish community when he signed a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking for " genuine dialogue " with Hamas .
Obama stated that he has received advise from Brzezinski on Iraq and Pakistan but emphasized that " hes not one of my key advisors .
Ive had lunch with him once , Ive exchanged emails with him maybe 3 times .
... I do not share his views with respect to Israel .
I have said so clearly and unequivocally . "
That might not be enough reassurance for some .
Shmuel Rosner , chief US correspondent of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , told CNN , " The fact that Barack Obama consulted with such people raises some concern among pro-Israel , mostly hawkish supporters . "
Rosner himself is generally described as right of center and has even been called " a cheerleader for the AIPAC crowd . "
However , Ira Foreman of the National Jewish Democratic Council told CNN that his group , which generally supports Democratic candidates , considers McCain , Clinton , and Obama to all be equally pro-Israel .
A recent poll found that American Jews are less concerned with the defense of Israel than with many other issues .
Only 6 % said that support for Israel would be the most important issue in deciding how to vote in the presidential election .
Far larger numbers named the economy and jobs , health care , the war in Iraq , or terrorism and national security .
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast February 25 , 2008 .
The great 19th - century Tory Prime Minister , Benjamin Disraeli once remarked there were three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics .
It is a dictum the Bush administration has taken to heart when it comes to totaling up the carnage in Iraq :
If you do n’t like the numbers , just change them ; and when in doubt , look ’em in the eye and lie .
For instance , according to the Department of Defense ( DOD ) , the United States does not track civilian casualties .
As former commander General Tommy Franks put it , " We do n’t do body counts . "
But testimony in the recent trial of U.S. Army snipers from the First Battalion of the 501 Infantry regiment indicated the generals indeed do body counts .
In a July hearing at Fort Liberty , Iraq , Sgt. Anthony G. Murphy said he and other snipers felt " an underlying tone " of disappointment from their commanders when they did n’t rack up big body counts .
" It just kind of felt like , ‘ What are you guys doing wrong out there ? ’ " he testified .
When the snipers started setting traps to lure in unsuspecting Iraqis , the kill ratios went up and the commanders , he said , were pleased .
The choreography the Bush administration does around casualties is aimed at creating a dance of lies and disinformation to cover up one of the worst humanitarian crises to strike the Middle East since the Mongols sacked Baghdad .
That is not an overstatement .
A recent poll by the British agency Opinion Research Business ( ORB ) found that the war may have killed more than one million people , a toll that surpasses the 800,000 killed in the Rwandan genocide .
The ORB used " excess mortality " as its measure , that is , deaths over and above mortality figures from the past .
The Grim Numbers
Trying to figure out the butcher bill in Iraq is an uphill task .
For instance , according to the London - based organization Iraq Body Count , by March of this year , civilian deaths stood at 65,160 , although the organization noted that 2007 has seen " the worst violence against civilians in Iraq since the invasion . "
The conservative Brookings Institute ’s Iraq Index posts slightly higher figures , and the United Nations higher still .
The Iraq Interior Ministry is highly critical of the UN ’s conclusion that 34,000 Iraqis died in 2006 , calling the figures " inaccurate " and " unbalanced , " but refuses to release its own figures .
And the only sum the Bush administration has ever come up with is when the president commented to the press in December 2005 that the number of Iraqis killed was " 30,000 , more or less . "
The first serious statistical investigation of the war ’s impact was a survey by Johns Hopkins University published in the British medical magazine , The Lancet .
According to the study , from the March 2003 invasion through September 2006 , the number of deaths due to the war was 654,965 .
Over half of those were women and children .
The Johns Hopkins study also used the " excess mortality " methodology , which measures not only deaths from war , but violent crime and disease .
It found that 91.8 % of the excess mortality was due to violence , 31 % of that inflicted by coalition forces .
President Bush immediately dismissed the study ’s methodology as " pretty well discredited , " and the media either ignored it or accepted the White House ’s characterization .
In fact , there is virtual unanimity among biostaticians and mortality experts that the methodology used in the Johns Hopkins study is accurate .
Following up on an earlier version of the study , Liala Guterman , a senior reporter for the Chronicle of Higher Education , says she contacted 10 experts in the field about the Lancet article , and " not one of them took issue with the study ’s methods or conclusions . "
Indeed , she said , the experts found the conclusions " cautious . "
According to John Zogby of Zogby International , one of the world ’s most respected polling services , " The sampling [ in the Lancet survey ] is solid , the methodology is as good as it gets . "
Ronald Waldman , a Columbia University epidemiologist , said the method was " tried and true , " and British Defense Ministry science advisor , Sir Roy Anderson , said the survey was " close to the best practice . "
Indeed , the Bush administration used exactly the same methodology to determine the number of deaths in Darfur , figures that were used to convince the U.S. Congress to label the current crisis in the Sudan " genocide . "
U.S. Casualties
The administration ’s sleight of hand on deaths and casualties even extends to its own forces .
There are , for instance , no hard figures on the number of private U.S. and British contractors wounded or killed , even though private contractors outnumber the number of coalition troops in Iraq .
And when casualty statistics come out in ways the DOD does n’t like , it just changes how they are counted .
On January 29 , 2007 , the Pentagon listed 47,657 " non-mortal " casualties in Iraq .
One day later this number had fallen to 31,493 by the simple device of dropping any casualty that did not require " medical air transport . "
The DOD also does n’t include vehicle accidents , or soldiers who are taken ill , including those with mental problems .
Other Consequences
No one has systematically collected information on the number of Iraqis wounded by the war , although a ratio of two or three to one wounded to killed in excess of one million people  is considered a good rule - of - thumb figure .
Besides the deaths and injuries , the war had unleashed , according to the Financial Times , " The worst refugee crisis in the Middle East since the mass exodus of Palestinians that was part of the violent birth of the state of Israel in 1948 . "
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , 2.2 million Iraqis have fled their country , mostly to Jordan and Syria , and another 2 million have been turned into internal refugees .
If one adds to that the ORB figures for deaths , it means at least 20 % of Iraq ’s pre-war population of 26 million has been killed , wounded , exiled , or displaced .
The White House has simply ignored the refugee crisis .
In 2006 , the United States budgeted $ 3 million for refugees , although according to Amman - based researcher Noah Merrill , none of the relief organizations , including the UN , has seen any of that money .
And if they had , Merrill points out , it would come to a grand total of $ 3.50 per person .
" Jordan is an expensive country , " he says , " and $ 3.50 will not help anyone  not even for a day . "
Half of Iraq ’s population are children , nearly 20 % of them under the age of five .
Some 25 % are malnourished and 10 % suffer from acute malnutrition .
According to a UNICEF study , 70 % of Iraqi ’s children suffer from traumatic stress syndrome .
Food rationing , a system on which five million Iraqis rely to stay alive , is breaking down , and according to Patrick Cockburn of The Independent , two million can no longer be fed because of security concerns .
Unemployment is at 68 % .
Once the most industrial country in the Arab world , Iraq is devolving into an oil - rich , agrarian backwater .
Some 75 % of the country ’s doctors and pharmacists have fled , bringing its medical system  at one time the best in the Arab world  to the point of collapse .
And finally , like a biblical plague , cholera is working itself down the country ’s river system , from the Kurdish north to Basra in the south .
Over 7,000 cases have been confirmed in northern Iraq , according to the World Health Organization .
In 1258 the Mongol generals Hulagu and Guo Kan besieged and took the city of Baghdad .
They murdered its inhabitants , burned its libraries , and ravished its lands .
The Bush administration has done the same , but hidden it behind a smoke screen of lies and voodoo statistics .
For the average Iraqi , there is little difference between the Mongols and the United States .
Both have laid waste to their country .

There were no alerts , no increased security , no warnings .
An ABCNEWS investigation of the failure of intelligence on Sept. 11 has found a trail of missed signals , missed opportunities , and warnings ignored .
There were warnings about the possibility of an airborne terrorist attack on U.S. targets as early as 1994 , when terrorism expert Marvin Cetron underlined the threat in a report to the Pentagon .
" We saw Osama bin Laden .
We spelled it out and we said the United States was very vulnerable , " Cetron told ABCNEWS .
" You could make a left turn at the Washington Monument and take out the White House .
And you could make a right turn and take out the Pentagon . "
Cetron said he warned the Pentagon that two events earlier that year  the crash - landing of a small airplane at the White House by an apparently unstable man , and French authorities ' storming of a hijacked airliner that Algerian terrorists had planned to fly into the Eiffel Tower  made an airborne terrorist attack on the United States a very real possibility .
" We knew that was going happen and we were scared , " he told ABCNEWS .
But Cetron said Pentagon officials told him to delete the warning from the report .
" I said , ' It 's unclassified , everything is available , ' and they said , ' We do n't want it released because you can't handle a crisis before it becomes a crisis , and no one is going to believe it anyhow , ' " Cetron said .
Even with the warnings of an airborne attack deleted , the report was not released to the public .
Aversion to Risk Four years later , in 1998 , U.S. authorities faced a terrorist crisis with the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
The United States accused bin Laden of involvement , and Congress and the Clinton administration commissioned two new reports on terrorism .
Both of the reports rang alarm bells , but little was done .
The reports noted that the United States had virtually no human intelligence sources inside groups like bin Laden 's al Qaeda .
" We found that over the years both the overseas intelligence community , and at home the FBI had developed a risk aversion , " said Paul Bremer , chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism , which released its report in 2000 .
An aversion to risk meant that the CIA failed to penetrate al Qaeda with a single agent , according to U.S. intelligence sources .
The reports criticized Clinton administration guidelines restricting U.S. intelligence agencies from hiring informants with questionable human rights records .
" You do n't get too many monks or nuns to get information for the CIA , " said former Sen.
Warren Rudman , who co-chaired the U.S. Commission on National Security , which submitted its report to Congress in three parts , beginning in June 2000 .
" There are some pretty rotten people , some of them with pretty bad records .
But if they had the information that would protect our national security , we damn well should have used them . "
Critics say the United States was too dependent on satellites and other high - tech means to gather intelligence on bin Laden 's network , and that there was a shortage of people to translate and analyze the vast amounts of data .
For example , ABCNEWS has learned that shortly before Sept. 11 , NSA intercepts detected multiple phone calls from Abu Zubaida , bin Laden 's chief of operations , to the United States .
The intercepts were never passed on .
" We do have a joint antiterrorism center , and that is a failure of information consolidation and analysis , " said Rudman .
" It obviously ( a ) was n't consolidated and ( b ) was n't analyzed .
I mean , those are serious shortcomings . "
After the Fact All three reports recognized the shortcomings and made recommendations including closer monitoring of student visas , the creation of a homeland security office , the freezing of financial assets that supported terrorism , and more coordination between the CIA and the FBI on intelligence .
But , the reports ' authors say , their recommendations went largely unheeded .
Bremer said that no action was taken on any of his commission 's recommendations  until the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon : " Interestingly , since Sept. 11 almost every one of our recommendations has either been enacted by the executive branch or been put into law by Congress , which suggests that we probably had a pretty good menu of things to do before Sept. 11 .

Children exposed to lead in old paint , Victorian water pipes and unsafe toys could be at risk of Alzheimer 's later in life , scientists have said .
A study shows that even small amounts of the dangerous metal in the first few years can cause changes in the brain associated with the devastating disease .
Although lead has been banned in petrol and paint , it is still present in older buildings .
Scroll down for more ...
Last year , millions of toys imported from China were recalled after tests showed they were made with lead paint .
The Alzheimer 's Society warned , however , against overreacting to the findings , which came from a study of monkeys .
A spokesman said there was no proof that lead exposure caused the disease .
The U.S. researchers behind the study say their work shows that lead has toxic side effects that can appear decades after children are exposed .
" We 're not saying that lead exposure causes Alzheimer 's disease , but it 's a risk factor , " Dr Nasser Zawia of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston told the New Scientist .
His team fed infant formula milk laced with low doses of lead to baby monkeys - and then followed their progress for 23 years .
Although the animals did not show any symptoms of dementia , a post mortem of their brains revealed plaques - harmful deposits of protein normally found in Alzheimer 's patients .
A new thesis from he Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet shows that the brain 's serotonin system differs between men and women .
The scientists who conducted the study think that they have found one of the reasons why depression and chronic anxiety are more common in women than in men .
Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter that is critical to the development and treatment of depression and chronic anxiety , conditions that , for reasons still unknown , are much more common in women than in men .
A research group at Karolinska Institutet has now shown using a PET scanner that women and men differ in terms of the number of binding sites for serotonin in certain parts of the brain .
Their results , which are to be presented in a doctoral thesis by Hristina Jovanovic at the end of February , show that women have a greater number of the most common serotonin receptors than men .
They also show that women have lower levels of the protein that transports serotonin back into the nerve cells that secrete it .
It is this protein that the most common antidepressants ( SSRIs ) block .
" We do n't know exactly what this means , but the results can help us understand why the occurrence of depression differs between the sexes and why men and women sometimes respond differently to treatment with antidepressant drugs , " says associate professor Anna -Lena Nordström , who led the study .
The group has also shown that the serotonin system in healthy women differs from that in women with serious premenstrual mental symptoms .
These results suggest that the serotonin system in such women does not respond as flexibly to the hormone swings of the menstrual cycle as that in symptom - free women .
" These findings indicate that when developing antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs , scientists should evaluate their effect on men and women separately , as well as their effects before and after menopause , " says Ms Nordström .
Thesis : " PET evaluation of central serotonergic neurotransmission in women " , Hristina Jovanovic Department of Clinical Neuroscience .
The public defense will take place at 29 February at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna , Stockholm .

A newly bred fish bares all in the lab , revealing brain , heart and other internal organs in the name of research .
Scientists are breeding zebrafish with see - through bodies in order to make studying disease processes easier , including the spread of cancer .
The transparent fish , described in the Feb. 7 issue of the journal Cell Stem Cell , are allowing researchers at Children 's Hospital Boston to directly view fish 's internal organs and observe processes such as tumor growth in real - time in living organisms .
Scientists previously studied disease in the embryos of zebrafish , which are naturally transparent .
But their clear bodies turn opaque when they grow into adults .
The newly created zebrafish stays transparent throughout its lifetime .
" Everything after four weeks has been invisible to us , " said study team member Richard White , a clinical fellow in the Stem Cell Program at Children 's Hospital Boston .
Zebrafish are genetically similar to humans in many ways and serve as good models for human biology and disease .
Traditionally , researchers have relied on information collected after the diseased animal died to infer anything about human ailments .
But for rapidly changing processes such as cancer , this snapshot method is bound to miss something .
" It 's like taking a photograph when you need a video , " said White , also an instructor of medicine at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
Fish exposed
White created the transparent fish , which he nicknamed Casper , by mating two existing zebrafish breeds , one that lacked a reflective skin pigment and the other without black pigment .
The offspring had only yellow skin pigment , essentially appearing clear .
In one experiment , White and his colleagues inserted a fluorescent melanoma tumor into the abdominal cavity of the transparent fish .
By observing the fish under a microscope , they found that the cancer cells started spreading within five days .
White could actually see individual cells spreading .
" The process by which a tumor goes from being localized to widespread and ultimately fatal is the most vexing problem that oncologists face , " White said .
" We do n't know why cancer cells decide to move away from their primary site to other parts in the body . "
The spreading melanoma cells appeared to flock toward the skin after leaving the abdominal cavity .
" This told us that when tumor cells spread to other parts in the body , they do n't do it randomly , " White said .
" They know where to go . "
Stem cells
White ran a similar experiment in which he transplanted fluorescent blood - forming stem cells from another zebrafish into a transparent one .
By four weeks , the stem cells had visibly moved into the see - through fish 's bone marrow and started growing .
Marrow , the soft fatty tissue inside bones , supports stem cells that each ultimately become a type of blood cell , which gets released into the bloodstream .
Any disease that disrupts the production of mature blood cells or their precursors can cause a bone marrow disorder , such as leukemia .
While transplants of blood - forming stem cells help cancer patients rebuild healthy blood , for unknown reasons some transplants do n't " take . "
If researchers could understand the step - by - step process in which the stem cells embed and build blood in the fish , they could figure out ways to help patients rebuild their blood faster .
COLORADO SPRINGS 
When a caterer working for the United States Olympic Committee went to a supermarket in China last year , he encountered a piece of chicken  half of a breast  that measured 14 inches .
“ Enough to feed a family of eight , ” said Frank Puleo , a caterer from Staten Island who has traveled to China to handle food - related issues .
“ We had it tested and it was so full of steroids that we never could have given it to athletes .
They all would have tested positive . ”
In preparing to take a delegation of more than 600 athletes to the Summer Games in Beijing this year , the U.S.O.C. faces food issues beyond steroid - laced chicken .
In recent years , some foods in China have been found to be tainted with insecticides and illegal veterinary drugs , and the standards applied to meat there are lower than those in the United States , raising fears of food - borne illnesses .
In the past two years , the U.S.O.C. has tried to figure out how to avoid such dangers at the Olympics .
It has made arrangements with sponsors like Kellogg ’s and Tyson Foods , which will ship 25,000 pounds of lean protein to China about two months before the opening ceremony , but will hire local vendors and importers to secure other foods and cooking equipment at the Games .
Verschwindet der Winter als Jahreszeit ?
Florian Rötzer
Britische Botaniker beobachten , dass der Frühling immer früher einsetzt .
Wissenschaftler der britischen Kew Gardens sind der Meinung , dass in Großbritannien allmählich aufgrund des Klimawandels der Winter als eigenständige Jahreszeit verschwindet .
Zwischen Herbst und Frühjahr gebe es , abgesehen von einer kurzen Kälteperiode vor Weihnachten , nur noch einige nasse und relativ milde Monate .
Seit 50 Jahren wird von den Botanikern in Kew Gardens bei 100 Pflanzenarten festgehalten , wann sie zu treiben und zu blühen beginnen .
Die Veränderung könne man nicht nur an den Temperaturen und Niederschlägen feststellen , sondern auch an den Pflanzen , die jetzt schon , eigentlich mitten im Winter , zu treiben und blühen beginnen .
Das geschehe schon Monate früher als gewöhnlich , so Nigel Taylor , der Kurator der Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew .
Gerade bei Pflanzenarten , die sich evolutionsgeschichtlich im britischen Klima entwickelt haben , sei dieses Verhalten bemerkenswert .
Studien des Scottish Natural Heritage haben gezeigt , dass Blumen seit 1900 durchschnittlich alle 10 Jahre 3,2
Tage früher blühen , während Zugvögel 2,6
Tage früher kommen und die Algen 3
Tage früher blühen .
WHAT if a presidential candidate held what she billed as “ the largest , most interactive town hall in political history ” on national television , and no one noticed ?
The untold story in the run-up to Super Tuesday was Hillary Clinton ’s elaborate live prime - time special the night before the vote .
Presiding from a studio in New York , the candidate took questions from audiences in 21 other cities .
She had plugged the event four days earlier in the last gasp of her debate with Barack Obama and paid a small fortune for it : an hour of time on the Hallmark Channel plus satellite TV hookups for the assemblies of supporters stretching from coast to coast .
The same news media that constantly revisited the Oprah - Caroline - Maria rally in California ignored “ Voices Across America : A National Town Hall . ”
The Clinton campaign would no doubt attribute this to press bias , but it scrupulously designed the event to avoid making news .
Like the scripted “ Ask President Bush ” sessions during the 2004 campaign , this town hall seemed to unfold in Stepford .
The anodyne questions ( “ What else would you do to help take care of our veterans ? ” ) merely cued up laundry lists of talking points .
Some in attendance appeared to trance out .
But I ’m glad I watched every minute , right up until Mrs. Clinton was abruptly cut off in midsentence so Hallmark could resume its previously scheduled programming ( a movie promising “ A Season for Miracles , ” aptly enough ) .
However boring , this show was a dramatic encapsulation of how a once - invincible candidate ended up in a dead heat , crippled by poll - tested corporate packaging that markets her as a synthetic product leeched of most human qualities .
What ’s more , it offered a naked preview of how nastily the Clintons will fight , whatever the collateral damage to the Democratic Party , in the endgame to come .
A Russian - educated communist who once described the disintegration of the Soviet Union as " a crime against humanity " became the sixth president of Cyprus last night in an election seen as key to the reunification of the war - divided island .
Supporters waving red flags and Che Guevara banners poured on to the streets after Demetris Christofias , 61 , clinched 53.4 % of the vote in an unprecedented victory for the island 's communist Akel party .
By beating the conservative former foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides , who polled 46.6 % of the vote , he becomes Cyprus 's first communist leader .
The result opens a new chapter in Cypriot politics with a younger generation of politician taking over the reins of government in a country that has remained partitioned since a coup aimed at uniting it with Greece prompted Turkey to invade in 1974 .
For the first time in the post - invasion era , Greek and Turkish communities will both be headed by leaders who are willing to negotiate - a prospect that has raised hopes of a settlement being reached .
In the run-up to the poll , Christofias , like Kasoulides , had repeatedly pledged to overturn the nationalist policies of the outgoing president , Tassos Papadopoulos , whose rejectionist approach to reunification had lead to the international isolation of the Greek Cypriots .
" My priority will be the salvation of this island , to reunify it with Turkish Cypriots under the umbrella of a bizonal , bicommunal federation , " Christofias said before the election .
Yesterday 's result showed that Greek Cypriots wanted a solution , despite voting against a 2004 UN plan outlining a federal union on the island , said Philippos Savvides , a political analyst .
" If there is no serious attempt this year to secure a peace deal , the status quo and partition of the island will be solidified .
It simply will be too late . "
Christofias stands out among Greek Cypriot politicians for enjoying good relations with Turkish Cypriots including Mehmet Ali Talat , the president of the self - declared Turkish republic in the north .
Without resolution of the Cyprus problem , Turkey - which has colonised the breakaway state with Anatolian settlers and maintains up to 40,000 troops there - has been told it will be unable to join the EU , a threat that has further raised the pressure .
The election of Christofias will cause concern in the EU and particularly in the UK , Cyprus 's former colonial overlord .
Although Christofias is a pragmatist keen to wield his pro-European credentials , he advocates a diluted form of Marxist - Leninism , demilitarisation of the entire island and is vehemently against the presence of its British sovereign military bases which he has called a " colonial bloodstain " .
Some Cypriots voiced fears last night that the country 's high standard of living would be endangered by the economic policies of a party that openly admires Cuba .

Structural problems with the I - 35W bridge span
<" Peter G. Neumann " < neumann@csl.sri.com >>
Two reports published since 2001 pointed to structural problems with the Interstate 35 W . ...
The bridge 's deck truss system has not experienced fatigue cracking , but it has many poor fatigue details on the main truss and the floor truss system .
...
In another report two years ago , the U.S. Department of Transportation 's National Bridge Inventory database concluded the bridge was " structurally deficient . "
http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/08/02/bridge.structure/index.html [ noted by Mike Hogsett ]
Bridges are generally built with a high level of redundancy , so that if one part fails the load is distributed through the structure .
The I - 35W bridge did not have a high level of redundancy , and the failure of a single significant component could have led to the collapse of the entire structure .
[ Annotation in A Deadly Collapse , a half - page set of graphics , * The New York Times * , 3 Aug 2007 , National Edition A14 ]
The propagating bridge structure collapse on 1 Aug 2007 in Minneapolis exposes just one more tip of an iceberg among a large collection of icebergs .
Many of our infrastructures such as roads ( some with sink - holes lying in wait ) , bridges , railroad track beds , pipelines , storage tanks ( including fuel and nuclear waste ) , and so on are in serious need of repair , decommissioning , or replacement .
For example , some of road infrastructures have endured loads far in excess of what was expected in their original designs and operating environments , and have been steadily declining .
This is just another example of the old adage , " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " .
In this case , the scales are unbalanced by deaths that cannot be cured and collateral losses .
There is of course a lesson here for information system infrastructures , Removing information security vulnerabilities seems to be a nonstarter in the eyes of government and system developers that might otherwise stimulate remediation .
The short - term costs of preventive maintenance always seem to blind folks to the long - term costs of inaction .
This situation reminds me once again of the importance of farsighted design and continual oversight .

Driver follows GPS when he should not
< Erwan David < erwan@rail.eu.org >>
On 22 Jul 2007 , a Polish bus had a grave accident in Vizille ( France ) .
The bus used a road with a 14 % ( 1/7 ) descending slope , it seems its brakes went too hot and could not stop the bus at the end of the slope .
The inquiry made appear that the driver blindly followed the indications of is GPS receiver , ignoring the 11 signs forbidding him to use this route .
Risk : always relying on technology , even if used a little bit out of spec .

A suspicious looking box found near Lewis - Gale Medical Center [ on 19 Jul 2007 ] was , in fact , a remote weather station that had been affixed to a tree by an employee , and not an explosive device .
Constructed with putty and wires , it was probed by the Virginia State Police Bomb Squad — which blew it up before realizing it was a weather station .
An employee had placed a putty - like substance around the box to make it weather proof .

Hacked passport crashes RFID readers
< Jeff Jonas < jeffj@panix.com >>
The report that voting machines are not trustworthy is joined by this : RFID passports and readers are vulnerable : http://www.boingboing.net/2007/07/31/hacked_passport_cras.html

Hacked passport crashes readers
A hacker has demonstrated an exploit against the RFID tags in the new US passports that allows him to clone a passport and modify the RFID with bad code that will crash the passport readers .
Lukas Grunwald , an RFID expert who has served as an e-passport consultant to the German parliament , says the security flaws allow someone to seize and clone the fingerprint image stored on the biometric e-passport , and to create a specially coded chip that attacks e-passport readers that attempt to scan it .
Grunwald says he 's succeeded in sabotaging two passport readers made by different vendors by cloning a passport chip , then modifying the JPEG2000 image file containing the passport photo .
Reading the modified image crashed the readers , which suggests they could be vulnerable to a code- injection exploit that might , for example , reprogram a reader to approve expired or forged passports .
" If you 're able to crash something you are most likely able to exploit it , " says Grunwald , who 's scheduled to discuss the vulnerabilities this weekend at the annual DefCon hacker conference in Las Vegas .
IRS computer security / privacy problems
<" Peter G. Neumann " < neumann@csl.sri.com >>
The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reports that in a recent test of 102 people with direct access to internal IRS data ( employees and contractors ) , 62 of them complied with a request from a caller posing as a technical support person to provide their user name and temporarily change their password .
Only eight called the IG 's office or IRS security personnel to verify the identity of the caller .
Similar tests in 2001 and 2004 were intended to improve security practices , but apparently were not effective .

User - hostile behavior
< Steve Summit < scs@eskimo.com >>
As an infrequent user of Microsoft Windows , I 'm often belatedly surprised by its various foibles — new ones seemingly every time I use it — that everybody else saw long ago or is used to by now .
Today was no exception .
Out of the blue , a dialog box popped up , saying ( from memory ) : Upgrade of your system is almost complete .
A restart is required to complete this upgrade .
Windows will automatically restart your computer in 3:47 minutes .
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%__________________________________________
Restart now Restart later
The time 3:47 was continually counting down , once per second , and there was a progress bar showing about 25 % complete .
There were several interesting things about this message .
I had initiated no upgrade , and Windows had not even asked me ( as it so often does ) if I wanted it to start an upgrade , nor even notified me that one was available .
And there was no indication whatsoever ( nor any obvious way of investigating to try to find out ) what this imposed upgrade actually was .
Most significantly , if I had done nothing , my computer evidently would have rebooted , all by itself , in less than five minutes .
But of course I had several windows open , containing all sorts of context relevant to the problem I was working on and which I most certainly did not want to log off and lose just then .
And I was turning back and forth between the Windows computer and another one ; I could easily have turned away for more than five minutes , and missed this charming little dialog box entirely .
Naturally I clicked " Restart later " , and the dialog box went away .
But about five minutes later it reappeared , exactly as before .
I clicked " Restart later " again .
About five minutes later it reappeared .
I clicked " Restart later " again .
This went on for the next hour or two .
In what universe is this acceptable behavior ?
I 've got work to do ; I do n't have time for unprovoked restarts ; I 'd really rather not have to keep a weather eye on a machine so as to be able to repeatedly click " Restart later " just to keep the damn thing up and my work intact .
I can't help but wonder what might happen with a machine being used for vital real - time work , or as an unattended server .
I do know the answer to the " In what universe ? " question , of course : in Microsoft 's universe .
And I suspect that the update they were so insistent on applying was one for their benefit , not mine .
I further suspect I know ( although it would n't say so ) what the whether - I - liked - it - or - not upgrade specifically was .
A couple of weeks ago the same machine had been asking me if I wanted to ( voluntarily ) install and activate another update , namely a more - fully - functional version of its " Windows Genuine Advantage " component .
But I had declined that upgrade , because I know that the machine 's software is genuine , and I do n't want the machine " phoning home " all the time or complaining if it can't , and I certainly do n't want it locking me out some day if it ever makes a mistake .
I had n't noticed that it had stopped asking about that earlier upgrade .
Perhaps I ought to have been suspicious .
Like the back - alley con man who is perfectly happy to rob you if you decline the proffered game of three - card monte , I suspect Windows simply decided to fall back on " Plan B " after I declined the " voluntary " upgrade too many times .
That machine is probably now assimilated , and I can feel secure that it is WGA - safe from non-genuine software .
Yippee .
Location - Based Dictionary Attacks
< Diomidis Spinellis < dds@aueb.gr >>
I get daily security reports from the hosts I manage .
Typically these contain invalid user attempts for users like guest , www , and root .
( Although FreeBSD does n't allow remote logins for root , I was surprised to find out that many Linux distributions allow them . )
Today 's log surprised me , because it contained only Greek names .
Here is an excerpt from the log .
Aug 1 00:19:42 istlab sshd [ 22137 ] : Invalid user achaikos from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:19:45 istlab sshd [ 22191 ] : Invalid user achilleus from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:19:48 istlab sshd [ 22218 ] : Invalid user actaeon from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:19:51 istlab sshd [ 22244 ] : Invalid user acteon from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:19:55 istlab sshd [ 22279 ] : Invalid user adelpha from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:19:58 istlab sshd [ 22302 ] : Invalid user adelphe from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:20:01 istlab sshd [ 22321 ] : Invalid user adelphie from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:20:04 istlab sshd [ 22353 ] : Invalid user adonia from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:20:08 istlab sshd [ 22387 ] : Invalid user adonis from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:20:11 istlab sshd [ 22400 ] : Invalid user adrasteia from 210.17.252.20 Aug 1 00:20:14 istlab sshd [ 22417 ] : Invalid user adrastos from 210.17.252.20
The attack to this host ( which is based in Athens , Greece ) came from a Hong - Kong - based machine , and the list contained many exotic Greek names while also missing many common ones .
Therefore , I doubt that this was a local attack .
A Google search revealed that the name list was obtained by merging male Greek names and female Greek names from http://www.20000-names.com.
Most probably an attack tool contains lists of names for specific countries ( the same site also provides , African , Chinese , English , French , German , Hebrew , Irish , Italian , Japanese , Polish , Spanish , and Welsh names ) .
The tool also maps the IP address of the host it attacks to a specific country , for instance , through the geolocation data of the IP - to - Country databases http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/.
Finally , the attack tool uses the country - specific list for trying to log in to those accounts .
Attackers seem to be getting more sophisticated with every passing day .

Amazon chasing 2 - cent Web services bill
<" Martin Redington " < martin@mildmanneredindustries.com >>
I recently signed up for an Amazon Web services account , to try out their S3 service , supplying my credit card number for them to bill me .
I played with the service very briefly , enough to incur $ 0.02 of charges , which appeared in the statement they sent me on Wednesday .
Today I received a notification from Amazon that their attempt to charge my credit card had failed ( presumably because the amount was too low ) , and asking if I could amend my account with valid payment method .
Hopefully sanity checking will prevail before they start seriously chasing me for the money .
Windows Live Messenger blocking even more completely innocuous text
< Cody Boisclair < cody@zone38.net >>
In RISKS - 24.35 , there was an entry I submitted detailing how Microsoft 's Windows Live Messenger service silently filtered out any message containing " .scr " or " .pif " , in a very ham - handed attempt to prevent links to trojans from coming through .

Under the most obvious assumptions about the distribution of " in " vs " out " in disputed calls , that would mean the system was performing worse than chance on its four worst days .
That 's really not good at all .
( There are other plausible distributions , of course .
If players object to any call they think has a reasonable possibility of being reverse to their advantage , including some where their objective judgment agrees with the call , that would mean the system was performing seriously worse than chance .
If players only object to calls that they think were utterly bogus , the system might well be doing better than chance on disputed calls .
Of course , in that case , it might still be doing worse than chance on close shots in general . )
Fraudproof voting protocols from scientists
<" Warren Smith " < warren.wds@gmail.com >>
Simple New Voting Protocols provide Ballot Secrecy AND Fraud Resistance Conventional wisdom says elections with " secret ballots " are protected against vote - buying and coercion , while elections publicizing the list of all voters with their votes are immune to fraud — but you can't have it both ways .
In a paper at EVT 07 ( Boston , 6 August ) mathematicians Ronald L. Rivest and Warren D. Smith refute that conventional wisdom , potentially enabling a new level of voting integrity .
" You can have your cake and eat it too with some very simple new voting protocols , " said Professor Daniel Sleator of Carnegie - Mellon 's computer science department .
" These are explainable to children .
It 's surprising this was n't thought of 50 years ago . "
Previous attempts to create such protocols have " succeeded " in mathematical senses , but only by employing very complicated cryptographic algorithms , challenging even for math PhDs .
Humans can't vote in those systems without computer aid , which means that each voter would have to own a small computer " helper " they trusted to be running correct , unhacked , voting software .
Rivest & Smith 's new protocols , called " VAV , " " Twin , " and " ThreeBallot , " do n't require computers or cryptography , and need only low - tech mechanical voting devices .
In each , voters get take - home " receipts " they can use later to check their vote was correctly counted — or prove fraud — but which nevertheless bear absolutely no relation to that voter 's vote , hence are n't helpful for vote - selling .
How can that be ?
Your take - home receipt in Twin is a copy of a random _other_ person 's vote .
In VAV , each voter casts two votes and one matching " antivote " and gets a copy of one of these three ( she chooses which ) as her receipt .
Either way , the receipt has no logical relation to that voter 's vote .
All three Rivest - Smith protocols allow " mixing in " old - style unsafe ballots with the new safe ones .
That not only permits happy coexistence with voters who do n't want to use the new system , but also " contagiously protects " even the unsafe ballots against fraud .
" I really love this ' easy upgrade ' feature , " said Doug Jones , former chair of Iowa voting systems examiners and computer science professor at University of Iowa .
The Rivest - Smith protocols work with a wide variety of vote - totaling systems , not just the " plurality " system most familiar in the USA .
" Plurality is a very poor voting system , " said Guy Ottewell , an astronomer and author regarded as the inventor of Approval Voting in 1968 .
" We 've known better ones for 200 years . "
" In plurality voting , it 's ' name one candidate then shut up ' , " said Ottewell .
" With Approval , you name _all_ the candidates you ' approve . '
It 's actually simpler because there is no special rule outlawing ' overvoting , ' and it both delivers more information in each vote and allows voters to approve their true favorite without being strategically foolish , so it 's also more honest information . "
But why would voters want dishonestly to vote for someone other than their true favorite ?
" Two words , " said Ottewell .
" Ralph Nader . "
" With approval voting , Nader voters are n't a problem , they 're beneficial . "
But Ottewell and Smith now instead advocate " Range voting , " essentially the system used in the Olympics : as their vote , voters score all the candidates they want to within some fixed score - range ( say 0 to 9 ) ; highest average wins .
( Range becomes the same as Approval if the range is 0 and 1 . )
" Honeybees have been using range voting for millions of years , and my computer simulations indicate it outperforms every other common vote - totaling proposal , " said Smith .

%O Audience i- Tech 1 Writing 1 ( see revfaq.htm for explanation ) %P 489 p. %T " Implementing ITIL " Chapter one notes that there are problems in how information technology ( IT ) works in supporting the enterprise .
Steinberg does mention that there should be better integration of the various parts and functions of IT service , that IT service management ( ITSM ) should be performed better , and that the Information Technology Infrastructure Library ( ITIL ) is a framework for improving ITSM , but does not , at this point , define either ITIL ( and never does explain ITSM ) .
Nine general principles for success are listed in chapter two .
The precepts are sound ( such as targeting the " Pareto " processes that are going to give you the best results for least effort ) , but vague : there are almost no details on how to accomplish this wonderful state .
Chapter three provides a generic and rather terse outline of a general project management cycle , under the heading of a process for implementing ITSM over a period of a year .
Modification of the culture of a corporation is a massive and difficult task : the suggestions in chapter four have some interesting and useful detail in regard to communications , but disregard the challenges involved .
A catalogue of roles for large teams and projects is given in chapter five : this is probably too large for most ITSM ventures .
Chapters six through eleven outline the general stages in a project cycle , albeit with idiosyncratic names for most phases ( and missing a few steps , such as requirements definition , testing , post - implementation assessment , and maintenance ) .
The material is reasonable , although quite terse and vague .
A great deal of space is devoted to forms , checklists , and questionnaires .
These would probably be quite useful as templates for those involved in an ITSM improvement project , but would have to be refined for a specific situation .
" Vision , " in chapter six , is basically the project concept or initiation phase .
" Assessment " is given a separate chapter ( seven ) , but seems to be part of the concept definition .
Planning is in eight , and implementation in nine .
" Initial wins " are described , in chapter ten , as small , quick projects that provide some early " high " returns on the efforts .
The text outlines a management cycle for small projects and so duplicates a good deal of material that was presented earlier .
There is also a list of initial win projects , although the value of most is questionable and they would have to be carefully reviewed for a specific environment .
" Control work , " in chapter eleven , is partly implementation of small projects , partly overall project documentation and management , and lots of workflow model charts : the content is rather a mixed bag .
Chapter twelve finally gets around to some details of ITIL : the text does , rather briefly , present the topical areas ( known , in ITIL parlance , as processes ) of the management of incidents , problems , change , release ( of software ) , configuration , service levels , availability , capacity , continuity , finance , the service desk , and security .
A poorly explained and formatted two - dimensional chart of the information flow between processes makes up chapter thirteen .
Various software utilities and their bare - bones functions are listed in fourteen , while fifteen mentions miscellaneous documents related to the ITIL processes .
Chapter sixteen has a terse catalogue of roles and job descriptions for the processes .
Guiding principles are defined , in chapter seventeen , in a way that is very similar to vision or mission statements , albeit with somewhat more detail .
( ITIL is a decent overview of the provision of IT services , but note that it has gaps .
For example , incident response is seen only in terms of customer service , without any relation to security .
Security management has solid and important directives on management , a holistic approach , policies , and audit , but when it comes to the actual provision of controls , the advice is to have proper ones , without much detail on what those might be . )
The title of the work is somewhat misleading .
The largest part of the book has to do with generic project management .
ITIL does get some presentation , but not until the book is more than half over .
In addition , the work is poorly structured and written .
The end of chapter sixteen , as one example , talks about roles for " ICT , " but ICT is not defined until the end of chapter seventeen ( and then only as " Infrastructure Control " ) .
The material is not complicated , but the writing is frequently unclear , and it is only the simplicity of the basic concepts that prevents the reader from getting lost .
( Sometimes the writing is completely off the wall .
" Fix just one IT service problem per day and within 90 days you will have made 107 service improvements " is clearly self - contradictory . )
For those who have not done much in the way of project management , there are some helpful guides that will get you going ( although you will need to check in other references such as Scott Berkun 's " The Art of Project Management " [ cf. BKARPRMA.RVW ] or " Applied Software Project Management " by Stellman and Greene [ cf. BKAPSWPM.RVW ] in order to deal with the missing bits ) .
For those not familiar with ITIL , chapter twelve is a reasonable introduction .
For those working to improve ITSM within their enterprises you will probably need a bit more help than is provided herein .

Viewers were shocked by the faked images
As seen on TV
The six hackers are accused of tampering with equipment during a live panoramic shot of mountains last June .
A flash of bright light could be seen followed by a fiery mushroom cloud on the horizon .
The group , who last month won an award from Prague 's National Gallery , face charges of spreading false information .
Manipulation
[ It was ] very unsuitable and could have frightened a lot of people
Czech Television
The six , who call themselves " Ztohoven " , claim that the aim of the project - called Media Reality - was to show how reality can be manipulated by the media .
They say they are not political and do not intend to intimidate society .
But Czech Television , which broadcast the hacked Panorama programme , said the stunt was " very unsuitable and could have frightened a lot of people " .
Break -in
In order to hack into the broadcast , the group is said to have climbed up a television tower near the Krkonose ( " Giant Mountains " ) in the northern Czech Republic and connected a computer to the camera and broadcast cable .
Ztohoven are no strangers to publicity stunts .
When President Vaclav Havel stepped down in January 2003 , they covered up part of a neon heart sculpture in his honour at Prague Castle and turned it into a giant question mark .
A state prosecutor in the northern town of Trutnov said that a trial could start this month .
If found guilty , the six could face a heavy fine or a maximum sentence of three years in jail .
( See samples of the voice skins , right ) .
One site even offers Warnie and Kylie voice skins - although they sound more like Kiwis than Australians .
But now genuine celebrity voices are joining the clamour with GPS device maker TomTom offering royalties to personalities such as John Cleese for each customer download of his own brand of voice commands .
The company , which already markets around 55 novelty voices for customers to download , has just announced plans to evolve the market even further with a new content - sharing platform .
This will allow its users to create their own voice skins , warning sounds , and start up images to share with other community members .
----------------------
Do you use novelty / celebrity voices on your GPS ?
Let us know at scoop@smh.com.au .
----------------------
A star rating system will also help members to find useful community content , and enable automatic updates to their selected content , such as another 's list of favourite restaurants .
" Our users tell us all the time how much they enjoy personalising their devices with content they can get from one another .
However , this content has always been spread out and unorganised across the web and on users ' devices , " says Chris Kearney , TomTom 's local marketing manager .
TomTom is the first major supplier to truly embrace this level of personalisation and Mr Kearney says its system architecture allows third - party developers to build voice add - ons much as they did for mobile ringtones many years ago .
" Because our devices are reasonably open , others can easily build content for it .
While we do not endorse these add - ons , I think they do encourage interest in the category over all and help to make people aware of what voices can do , " he says .
None of its main competitors in Australia have announced any plans to follow TomTom , with many choosing to focus on other product developments .
GPS manufacturer Navman says internal company research indicates novelty add - ons are not a high priority for its customer base and Garmin says its development focus is on making " travelling as stress - free as possible " .
Mr Kearney says although the voice skin market does not represent a core source of revenue for TomTom 's business , it does add a little bit of fun for users without compromising safety .
Despite the comic and sometimes irreverent nature of some of the voice skins , Mr Kearney claims they are unlikely to disrupt a driver 's concentration .
" Its no different to when you are talking in the car to people or listening to the radio - the device is really just giving instructions .
It 's the same as the mobile phone story .
You do n't text when you drive and do n't touch the navigation screen when you drive . "
A study jointly commissioned in the Netherlands by TomTom , an insurance company and a car hire company found satellite navigation systems had a positive influence on road safety .
Of the navigation system users surveyed in the report , 62 per cent agreed with the statement that navigation systems made it easier for them to keep their attention on the road .
An independent observation study was also conducted on driving ability and found there were " fewer occasions of unsuitable driving behaviour on the routes chosen when a navigation system was used " .
Anne Morphett , a senior adviser in road safety at NRMA Motoring and Services , says : " Although some of the voices available for people to use might seem a little tacky , the thing in their favour is that it is much safer for people to have instructions in an audible form than looking down at the device or a map .
Anything that keeps focus - and particularly vision - on the road will enhance driving safety . "
It may come as a surprise , but those white - coated chemists beavering away in the university lab are in it for the sex .
Or so claims Terence Kealey , whose new book , Sex , Science and Profits , offers a whole new way of looking at science and scientists .
The book 's key claim is that science is not a public good to be funded through the public purse to ensure its survival , but the evolved product of the competitive , selfish , property - and sex - obsessed instincts that make us human .
It could therefore manage very nicely , says Kealey , without any support from government .
As vice - chancellor of the private Buckingham University , Kealey may be expected to question the need for public subsidies .
But in doing so , he is arguing very much against the current trend .
Since 1997 , the government has boasted of its investment in science , and has put its money where its mouth is , increasing spending on the science base from 0.29 % to 0.37 % of GDP between 1997 and 2005 .
At the same time , business expenditure on research and development fell slightly from 1.18 % to 1.09 % of GDP .
Nick Dusic , director of the pressure group Campaign for Science and Engineering , says : " It is in the interests of the UK to invest in basic science to a higher degree than it would be for any individual or company . "
Not so , argues Kealey , who says there are individuals and companies queueing up to invest in all kinds of science , both applied and basic , for their own ends .
Profit motive
First , the companies .
They recognise the need for constant innovation to drive profits , keep up with the competition , and allow them to trade knowledge .
He argues that they cannot afford to make a distinction between applied and pure science because markets are now so brisk that the entrepreneur who is not investing in pure science , but sitting back and waiting for others to do it first so that they can copy them , is asking for bankruptcy .
Then there are the individual philanthropists and the foundations they set up , such as the Wellcome Trust or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
While these philanthropists are making their money , their motives are primarily profit driven , he suggests .
But once they stop , they go for esteem .
" The biologists know that we humans evolved to seek , above all , the rewards of the social hierarchy , " he writes .
" What people really want is status . "
And they want it for the same reasons as those white - coated chemists who work so hard to make the next breakthrough scientific discovery .
To advertise their sexual fitness .
Business people advertise their potency by making money , says Kealey , philanthropists by giving money away .
Scientists do it through their cleverness in the lab , and by telling everyone else about their work through publication .
There is no need to worry that private funding of science withdraws the incentive to publish - publishing , claims Kealey , is the whole incentive .
But does n't public funding at least ensure that the kind of science funded , and published , is the kind that will most benefit the public ?
Dusic argues that , while private funding helps to create a skilled workforce and develop new technologies , public funding ensures that research is " advancing science in ways we do n't understand the full consequences of " .
To counter this argument , Keaney goes back in time .
In a quick historical tour beginning with the Stone Age , he claims that what has driven innovation is not theoretical musing but need , spurred on by individual property rights and the free market .
Our ancestors invented farming because , having had no incentive to preserve the animals they hunted and did n't own , they had run out of their main food source .
James
Watt , a self - employed technician , made his crucial discoveries about steam because he was trying to mend an engine .
America became the richest country in the world , and a technological power , long before it began significant public funding for science in 1940 .
Indeed , Kealey argues that government subsidy can hinder research by preventing industrial backers from stepping in .
He cites a 2003 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that looked at the economic growth rates of the world 's 21 leading economies between 1971 and 1998 .
According to Kealey , it found that publicly funded research and development actually damaged economic growth by crowding out privately funded research and development .
While he acknowledges that a small amount of government - funded science is an important way of empowering universities against private pressures , he suggests that it can also distract them from their prime purpose , which is to teach .
Ideally , he suggests , universities should be independent centres of teaching and scholarship " fostering scholars who speak truth unto power " .
Teaching and scholarship are cheap enough to survive on fees and endowments , he argues , whereas a research university demands government money , and therefore is inhibited in its criticism of government .
But is n't the fear of producing unpalatable results even greater with privately funded research ?
Closed shop
No , says Kealey because science , however it is funded , is always a closed shop .
In theory , journals are public , but in practice only certain scientists have any idea what they are talking about .
Scientific observations only have validity if others in the same game accept them .
Scientists need to tell each other things because then they will , in turn , be told things .
The scientific conference , he says , is not a forum for giving away information publicly but a trading floor .
In fact , the main advantage of public funding for science is " to ensure we have publicly funded people , answerable to democratic government , whose job it is to tell the rest of us what 's really going on " .
So what are the implications of Kealey 's argument for the way science is taught ?
First , he says , teachers need to scrap the assumption that science is a public good , due a slice of public funding .
Then , they need to make it more exciting .
" The official dogma of science education is that science is a collection of objective facts , disembodied and absolute , " he says .
" But science is actually the product of only certain cultures , and is moulded by the histories of those cultures and by the leading egos of those cultures . "
This means teaching early cosmology and physics by recreating Galileo 's confrontations with the Pope as plays , or early geometry by recreating the experiment in which Eratosthenes calculated the diameter of the earth 2000 years ago .
" The history , philosophy , sociology and economics of science should be an integral part of A - levels , " he says , " So that no scientist emerges , blinking , into the world solely as a technocrat . "

Facebook PHOENIX 
A medical examiner 's report released today says 45 - year - old Carol Anne Gotbaum died from asphyxia by hanging while in police custody at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Sept. 28 .
The report also says Gotbaum was acutely intoxicated on alcohol and prescription drugs when she died in a police holding room at the airport .
Gotbaum belonged to a New York family that has hired a team of experts to probe her death .
The case has drawn national attention to how the Phoenix Police Department handled the case .
The autopsy says she died after accidentally strangling herself while in police custody during the airport layover .
Gotbaum had been arrested on a disorderly conduct charge after she was kept off a connecting flight that was to bring her to Tucson , where she was to enter an alcohol treatment center .
Authorities have said that Gotbaum , who was handcuffed and shackled to a bench in an airport holding room , may have accidentally strangled herself .
Police have said they followed proper procedures when dealing with her .
Last week , police released documents showing that Gotbaum made a grim , emotional flight to Phoenix and may have ordered a Bloody Mary from a flight attendant , according to witness accounts .
Gotbaum broke down several times on her flight from New York and confided to a passenger sitting next to her that she was going to rehab .
" Ms. Gotbaum would break into tears during the flight and while they were speaking with each other , " according to a police statement describing an account by the passenger , Jodi Hall .
According to the account from Hall , " Ms. Gotbaum said that someone would have come with her , but it was her decision to do it on her own . "
The accounts were among more than 200 pages of documents released Wednesday by the Phoenix police homicide unit , which probed the New York woman 's death at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
Gotbaum had a layover at the airport during her trip to enter a 30 - day rehab program in Tucson .
She was arrested for disorderly conduct after she became irate when denied boarding and died later in a holding cell .
The documents also show : • When Noah Gotbaum was told of his wife 's death by phone , he said , " They killed her , they killed her . " • Conflicting reports about whether Gotbaum was drinking before she was arrested .
While a member of the flight crew recalls serving Gotbaum a cocktail in the galley , passenger Hall says she did n't see Gotbaum drink alcohol .
• Gotbaum was taking medications to battle depression , according to police interviews with an investigator hired by the Gotbaum family .
• Betsy Gotbaum , a New York politician and Gotbaum 's mother - in - law , called the day of the death and asked police to use Carol Gotbaum 's maiden name in police reports to shield the Gotbaum family from publicity .
The Gotbaum family 's attorney had not seen the report Wednesday , but many of the witness accounts of Gotbaum 's emotional state make sense , he said .
" This was her first trip to a treatment facility and she was distressed about leaving her kids , " said Michael Manning , who represents Gotbaum 's husband and three young children .
The Gotbaum family , which has been critical of the police , has hired its own team of experts to probe the case .
Manning downplayed the drink Gotbaum may have had on the flight , noting that witnesses disagree about that .
A spokesman for Betsy Gotbaum , the New York public advocate , which is an elected office , declined to comment Wednesday evening .
The homicide unit has wrapped up its probe of the death , and Sgt. Andy Hill says it appears that the police acted appropriately .
" All of the witness accounts say that the police did what they had to do , " Hill said .
An internal investigation into the officers ' conduct has not been completed .

Many Trump supporters do not believe that he can or will lose , and say he would be justified in questioning whether Democrats manipulated the outcome .
But some believe a loss is a loss .
By Jeremy W. Peters and
Like every husband who suddenly turns into an ex , Martin Paul , a pleasant , unassuming 51 - year - old , knows exactly where he was when it happened .
He was sitting on the back porch of his pricey hilltop house in the Boston suburbs one sunny Saturday morning , relaxing over coffee .
Paul is a professional collector , primarily of coins , but of other rare objects as well : Sonny Liston 's ring belt ; a submarine that appeared in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me .
It was n't easy to build up his collecting business , but he had finally got it humming , and he was pulling down close to seven figures a year .
Plus , the oldest of his three sons had suffered a frightening brain injury , but after two years of treatment , he had finally recovered enough to go to college .
For the first time in a very long while , life was good .
And so , that Saturday , he wanted to tell his wife he was thinking about finally easing off a little .
They 'd started going on expensive vacations in Europe and Hawaii , and he figured she'd be pleased at the prospect of taking more trips together , or at least at the prospect of seeing him around the house a little more , and not buried in his basement office .
He had met her in graduate school over a quarter century ago , and they'd had their ups and downs , but he was still crazy about her .
And he thought that , with a little more time together , she'd be crazy about him again too .
But no .
She scarcely listened to any talk of retirement , or of vacations , or of anything he had to say .
She had plans of her own .
" I want a divorce , " she said .
Paul was so stunned that he thought he must have misheard her .
But her face told him otherwise .
" She looked like the enemy , " he says .
He started to think about everything he'd built : the thriving business , the wonderful family , the nice life in the suburbs .
And he thought of her , and how much he still loved her .
And then , right in front of her , he started to cry .
That night , he found a bottle of whiskey , and he did n't stop drinking it until he nearly passed out .
Things turned sh---- [ sic ] very fast .
His wife took out a temporary restraining order , accusing him of attempting to kidnap their youngest son .
The claim was never proved in court .
Then , with the aid of some high - priced lawyers , she extracted from him a whopping $ 50,000 a month — a full 75 percent of his monthly income .
Barred from the house , he was not allowed regular access to the office he used to generate that income .
( On the few times he was permitted inside , his wife did not let him use the bathroom .
She insisted that he go outside in the woods . )
" My lawyer kept telling her lawyers , ' You 're killing the Golden Goose , ' " recalls Paul .
" But they did n't care . "
Crushed by the payments , and unable to work , he soon faced such a severe cash - flow crisis that he had to declare bankruptcy .
His wife still did not relent .
She charged that Paul had been abusive toward one of their sons .
Paul says the charge is absurd , but it did its work , limiting his visitation rights .

Paul says the charge is absurd , but it did its work , limiting his visitation rights .
Paul was sleepless and nerve wracked ; his spirits plunged .
He still missed his old life with his family .
He missed the sound of it — the bustle of all the activity , the life .
" I ca n't stand the silence , " he says .
" I miss hearing my wife breathe as she lay in bed beside me . "
In his desperation , he twice overdosed on prescription medication , but managed to call 911 each time before the drugs took full effect , and medics rushed him to the hospital in time .
" I do n't want to die , " he says wearily .
" I want to live .
But I can't live with this torture . "
He did manage to keep a few mementos of his former life .
Pictures , mostly .
But also the kids ' baby shoes .
" I was always the emotional one , " he says .
" But that 's all I have — the shoes , a few pictures .
That 's all .
I used to be jovial , happy .
But not now .
I 'm a broken man . "
Sudden Divorce Syndrome .
You wo n't find it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , that bible of psychiatric illnesses , but you will find it in life .
In a 2004 poll by the AARP , one in four men who were divorces in the previous year said they " never saw it coming . "
( Only 14 percent of divorced women said they experienced the same unexpected broadside . )
And few events in a man 's life can be as devastating to his physical , mental , and financial health .
" I meet men all the time who are going through breakups , and it 's very common for them to say it caught them by surprise , " says Los Angeles - based sex therapist Lori Buckley , PsyD , host of " On the Minds of Men , " a weekly relationship podcast on iTunes .
The warning signs are usually there , claims Buckley , but the male mind is simply not very adept at recognizing them .
" When women make up their mind that the relationship is over , they stop talking about the relationship , " she says .
" Men interpret a woman 's lack of complaining as satisfaction .
But more often , it 's because she 's simply given up . "
To understand how common this scenario is , consider figures provided by John Guidubaldi , a former member of the U.S. Commission on Child and Family Welfare .
Nationwide , Guidubaldi reports , wives are the ones to file for divorce 66 percent of the time , and , in some years , that figure has soared to nearly 75 percent .
" It is easier to end a marriage than it is to fire an employee , " says Guidubaldi .
If she wants out , it 's over .
" You can get a dissolution of marriage on the basis of nothing . "
Oftentimes , men have a divorce sprung on them in midlife , when their kids are more self - sufficient and they 've finally started to think they were over the hump .
Like Martin Paul , they could start to relax .
But that 's exactly the time of life when the instance of divorce begins to swell ( another occurs shortly after marriage ) .
Joe Cordell , of the law firm Cordell and Cordell , which specializes in representing men in domestic cases , attributes this to wives deciding as they approach age 40 that it 's now or never for getting back into the marriage market .
It 's the same phenomenon as rich guys trading in their long - time partners for trophy wives .
Only it 's the women who are shedding men .
It did n't used to be this way .
While divorce has been legal for nearly two centuries , it was long a topic of such mortification that it was considered a last , desperate resort .
The 1960s changed all that .
The free - love decade both increased the inclination to divorce and dropped the social resistance to it .
The rising financial independence of women began to free them from a need to stay in a stultifying or abusive marriage .
As a result , divorce soared , doubling by most measures .
But the stereotypical divorce story — man marries , starts a family , meets a younger woman , and leaves his wife — just is n't as common as we are led to believe .
" Marriage changes men more pervasively and more profoundly than it changes women , " explains sociologist Steven Nock , author of Marriage in Men 's Lives .
" The best way to put it is , marriage is for men what motherhood is for women . "
Marriage makes men grow up .
Nock observes that many men before marriage are indifferent workers , and , after hours , are likely to be found in bars or zoned out in front of a TV .
After marriage , they are solid wage earners , frequent churchgoers , maybe members of a neighborhood protection association .
But divorce takes that underpinning away , leaving men strangely infantilized and unsure of their place in the world .
They feel like interlopers in the stands at their children 's soccer games or in the auditorium for their school plays .
Compounding this pain , men find the deck is stacked against them .
The divorce system tends to award wives custody of the children , substantial child support , the marital home , half the couple 's assets , and , often , heavy alimony payments .
This may come as startling news to a public that has been led to believe that women are the ones who suffer financially postdivorce , not men .
But the data show otherwise , according to an exhaustive study of the subject by Sanford L. Braver , a professor of psychology at Arizona State University and author of Divorced Dads : Shattering the Myths .
" The man is in a lot poorer condition than the popular media portray , " he says .
" This idea of the swinging , happy - go - lucky , no - worries single guy in a bar ... that 's just not it at all . "
The misconception was fueled by Harvard professor Lenore Weitzman 's widely cited book , The Divorce Revolution : The Unexpected Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children in America .
Weitzman 's 1985 tome claimed that postdivorce women and children suffer on average a 73 percent drop in their standard of living , while the divorced men's standard of living increased by 42 percent .
Years later , Weitzman acknowledged a math error ; the actual difference was 27 percent and 10 percent , respectively .
But Braver says even that figure is based on severely flawed calculations .
Weitzman and other social scientists ignored men's expenses — the tab for replacing everything from the bed to the TV to the house — as well as the routine costs of helping to raise the children , beyond child support .
Even the tax code favors women :
Not only is child support not tax deductible for fathers , but a custodial mother can take a $ 1,000 per child tax credit ; the father cannot , even if he 's paying .
As " head of the household , " the mother gets a lower tax rate and can claim the children as exemptions .
If the ex-wife remarries , she is still entitled to child support , even if she marries a billionaire .
Indeed , every year men are actually thrown in jail for failing to meet their child - support obligations .
In the state of Michigan alone , nearly 3,000 men were locked up for that offense in 2005 .
But for many men , the real pain is n't financial , it 's emotional : " Men depend on women for their social support and connections , " says Buckley .
" When marriages end , men can find themselves far more alone than they ever expected . "
In a large - scale Canadian survey , 19 percent of men reported a significant drop in social support postdivorce .
Women are customarily the keepers of the social calendars , and all that is implied by that , providing for what University of Texas sociologist Norval D. Glenn calls the " intangibles " that can create much of a man 's sense of place in the world .
More often than not , wives send out the Christmas cards ; they stitched that cute Halloween costume their daughter wore in second grade ; they recall the names of the neighbors who used to live two houses down .
The men who bear all these unexpected burdens do so alone , in a strange place , while their ex-wives and children live in the houses that used to be theirs .
For an ex-husband to enter that house can feel like trespassing , even though it was paid for with his own money , or sometimes , built with his own hands .
" What are five of the biggest stressors a human being can face ? " asks Ned Holstein , MD , executive director of Fathers and Families , a Massachusetts - based reform group for divorced dads .
" One : the death of a child .
Two : the loss of a spouse .
Three : the loss of a home .
Four : a serious financial reversal .
And five : losing a relationship with a child .
All of these except the first are combined in a father 's experience of divorce .
People always think the man is a lone wolf and he can take care of himself .
Well , he 's also a human being , and people do n't think through what that means for men . "
As hard as such deprivations are on the psyche , they can be devastating to a man 's health .
Recently divorced men are nearly nine times more likely to commit suicide than their female counterparts , according to a study by sociologist Augustine Kposowa .
" It 's not so much the loss of money , " he says , " but the loss of children that propels men to suicide . "
Or it could be a combination .
Infuriated by his obligation to pay child support for three children he rarely saw , Perry Manley snuck a hand grenade inside a federal courthouse in Seattle last year and was shot to death by security personnel after they spotted it .
The death was termed " suicide by cop . "
Kposowa has also detected an increased incidence of motor - vehicle accidents among divorced men , either due to a lack of concentration , sleeplessness , or , more darkly , suicide " cloaked as an accident , " he says .
Compared with married or single men , divorced men are nine times as likely to be admitted to the hospital , to report difficulties at work , or to suffer significant depression .
According to a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry , they suffer the effects of divorce with the intensity that their wives experience the death of a close friend .
And they suffer physical maladies .
" Their blood pressure goes up , and so does their cholesterol , and that drives up hypertension , heart disease , coronary artery disease , and peripheral vascular disease , " says psychiatrist Arnold Robbins , associate editor of the Journal of Men 's Health & Gender .
Researchers at the Texas Heart Institute have noted that emotional stress can lead to a dangerous ballooning of the left ventricle , which they term " broken heart syndrome . "
Says Dr. Robbins : " A lot of metabolic syndromes kick in too , like borderline and type 2 diabetes .
There 's cirrhosis of the liver from too much drinking .
Even prostate problems .
It 's not a pretty picture . "
Distressed by such facts , men 's groups are springing up around the country .
" Think of it , " says Stephen Baskerville , president of the American Coalition for Fathers and Children , in Washington , D.C. " A father could be sitting in his own home , not agreeing to a divorce , not unfaithful to his marriage vows , and not abusive , and the next thing he knows , the court has taken his house , his children , and a lot of his money , and then forced him to pay his wife 's legal fees and even her psychologist 's fees .
And he can be threatened with jail time if he resists . "
So , how to avoid Sudden Divorce Syndrome ?
One way , of course , is to avoid marriage .
Another way is by working on your marriage when it can still be salvaged .
Statistically , end - stage marriage counseling is rarely effective , despite what the counselors might say .
Instead , husbands might be wise to pay attention to the essential ratio that — according to John Gottman , PhD , a world - renowned researcher of marriage stability — governs marital success or failure : five to one .
That means husbands ( and wives ) should direct at least five positive remarks or actions to their spouses for every negative one .
Any less and the marriage is in trouble .
Or , following the much - admired work of Howard Markman , PhD , who holds couples workshops ( loveyourrelationship.com ) , husbands should attune themselves to their wives ' " bids " — for attention , for affection , for all the things that sustain a relationship — and do their best to provide for them .
In truth , husbands are not built for the demands that wives often place on them ; they are less inclined to talk things out or to display emotion .
But then , marriage is n't easy for either party .
When a wife wants out , it is usually not out of selfishness or senseless cruelty .
Sometimes the love simply runs out .
Husbands should do what they can to keep that love alive .
That way , they might hang on to the many delights that marriage affords and spare themselves the countless horrors that divorce can bring .
Truly , this article is a work of genius ... of a sort .
The article tells us about " Sudden Divorce Syndrome , " a syndrome so non-existent that it does n't even have an entry on Wikipedia , much less the DSM - IV .
It does , of course , have a favorable citation from Dr. Helen , though , so you know it 's going to be awesomely , awesomely misogynistic .
Our story begins as all men's rights fables do , with a rich guy .
He was rich !
Rich !!!
I mean , look at all the stuff he bought !
Only rich guys can afford that !
And yet ... Make a mental note of that last sentence .
We 'll come back to it .
One of the things I love about this article is the deep , deep hatred of women that bubbles up at inopportune times , despite the author 's best attempts at making this even - handed .
This is one of those times .
My ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce over the phone , but it was three days after it was a fait accompli .
We fought , yes , and discussed things at a deep emotional level , yes , and I did , indeed , cry in front of her .
But it was n't a shock , and it was n't a surprise , and she damn sure did n't look like " the enemy . "
And yet that 's exactly how Paul describes his ex-wife -- as the enemy .
This is his description of a woman who he was " crazy about , " and yet here she was , blindsiding him with a divorce .
And yet , by his own admission , she was n't crazy about him .
Their marriage had its ups and downs .
He tacitly admits he was a workaholic , and the fact that crying in front of his spouse during the dissolution of his marriage was important for him to note tells us that he was n't a particularly emotionally open partner in marriage .
And so wherefore the surprise at the divorce ?
If his wife did n't love him , and he did n't show her love , why the surprise at the end of the relationship ?
I 'm not arguing that it should n't hurt him -- but it should n't have blindsided him .
Of course , Paul deals with problems in a good , solid way .
Now , read though those three paragraphs .
Alcohol abuse is evident in the first one .
The second indicates that at the very least , there were custody disputes , and while it was never " proven in court , " you note that there is n't a strong denial .
Also , Paul works from home , and yet he can't find a way to relocate his office -- he instead tanks his business intentionally to keep his wife from getting the support her " high - priced lawyers " got for her , support which was almost certainly related to child support .
Regardless ,
Paul 's complaint here is the standard MRA whine : his wife got too much money , and he could barely subsist on an after - support income of $ 17,000 a month , the equivalent of $ 204,000 a year .
And that 's assuming that he is n't fudging his numbers to make himself look better .
I 'm sorry , I lack sympathy .
He says the charge is absurd , and yet remarkably , the court did n't think so , as his visitation rights were limited .
Perhaps he 's right , and he was actually unable to work .
Perhaps he 's full of crap , and he's an abusive , controlling cobag who responded to his wife 's order for support by deliberately tanking his business and taking his anger out on his son .
It 's hard to say , but I 'd wager on the last one .
Now , I sympathize with him , except I keep waiting to read where Paul got therapy , and he did n't , evidently .
Look , I 've been open that after my divorce , I strongly contemplated suicide .
And I did n't get a handle on my own depression until I actually sought out therapy .
But I did , and lo and behold , I was n't suicidal anymore .
I really do hope our guy Paul finds his way into therapy , and out of depression ; nobody should have to go through that .
But given that I ended my marriage with significantly fewer assets than Paul did , I 'm not going to weep for him ; he 's had every opportunity in life .
It 's his choice whether he stays down or gets back up .
Of course , Paul 's story is n't about Paul .
It 's designed to make us feel sorry for the poor , put - upon husbands , those poor bastards who get kicked out of their houses by their gold - digging ex-wives .
It 's a hard - knock life for us , truly it is .
And this article is happy to tell us just how bad things are .
Okay , first off , let 's look at the numbers : 25 percent of men who get divorced " never saw it coming . " 14 percent of women who get divorced " never saw it coming . "
Now , it may be me , but those numbers are n't that significantly different for me to say for sure that men just do n't see things women do .
Women initiate most divorce proceedings .
It would stand to reason that fewer women than men would not see divorce coming , since in most cases , they 're the ones filing .
And yet the difference is small enough that I would suspect that we 're really talking about similar emotional unawareness in both men and women .
What 's more , 75 percent of men and 86 percent of women did see divorce coming .
Which would seem to argue that most men and women are indeed attuned to their relationships .
Which would seem to argue that the following paragraph is a load of horse manure :
Damn it to the last damn , but if I have to read another article about how the male mind is just too stupid to comprehend emotion , my head 's going to explode .
For one thing , I doubt that women " stop talking about the relationship " once they decide it 's over .
Usually , there 's at least one more talk involved , one that ends it .
Second , I doubt that most women stop talking about the relationship period , regardless of situation .
Third , I 'm sure some women do n't talk about their relationships much when they 're good , and that lack of complaining is indeed due to satisfaction .
And all of that applies to men , and for that matter , all of this applies to heterosexual and homosexual relationships , and transgendered and cisgendered individuals .
Humans are a variable bunch , and there is no singular pattern for how the male mind works and how the female mind works .
If there was , Glenn Sacks and I would be drinkin ' buddies while Jill Stanek and Amanda Marcotte discussed their adorable kids over coffee .
Well ... yeah , I suppose you can , but people rarely do .
As I noted up in the top , divorce is painful .
And not just when your spouse initiates it .
My ex readily tells me that our divorce was the most painful experience of her life .
She did n't get out of the pain because she filed the papers ; indeed , she got to experience the extra burden of being the one who ended it .
As for dissolving the marriage on the basis of nothing -- yes , that 's called no - fault divorce , and it should be easier than terminating an employee .
You see , your spouse is not your employee , he or she is your partner .
Your equal .
An employee deserves special rights to protect him - or herself , because the power relationship between employer and employee is not equal .
But the power relationship between spouses is equal , and both partners have equal say in whether the partnership can continue .
If one partner does not want to continue , even for no easily articulated reason , the partnership cannot continue .
And even if one partner does want to continue the relationship , forcing someone to remain married against their will is the definition of a violation of civil rights .
Or , you know , the husband was abusive .
Or the wife was cheating .
Or the marriage hung together for the kids , and now the kids are grown .
Or any of a thousand different possible scenarios that do n't involve women looking to dump their husbands for some other guy .
As for the " marriage market " -- I love that phrasing , do n't you ?
So mercenary .
So tied in with the story of Martin Paul , the rich guy whose wife had the temerity not to appreciate him for being rich .
Who 's she going to trade up to ?
The nerve .
Is that even the " stereotypical divorce story " anymore ?
I mean , maybe it was back in the fifties , but I do n't really view any particular reason as " the " reason for divorces .
As for the rest of the paragraph , well , basically I read it as a great victory for human rights .
Women do n't have to suffer in abusive relationships or loveless marriages anymore .
Neither , for that matter , do men .
That 's not a bad thing .
With a recent study showing divorced parents tend to parent just like married parents , we 're moving to a point where a divorce need not cast one from society or make one a pariah .
And thank the Ceiling Cat .
What ?
We do ?
You know , I went to my daughter 's white belt test for kung fu a few weeks ago , and while my parents could n't make it , my ex-wife and her mom were there .
I greeted my ex's mom politely , we sat near each other , we took pictures , and generally supported my kid .
A few weeks before that , my ex , her dad , my parents , and I all attended my daughter 's school program .
Everyone got along , and everyone congratulated my daughter afterward .
I 'm not saying there was n't a period where it was strange being around my ex-inlaws , there was , but I got over it , precisely because I value my daughter , and know that she benefits from having as many people who love her in her life as is possible .
And I know that I 'm one of them , and a pretty important one to her .
I 'm her father .
And as long as I 'm treating her the way a parent should treat his or her child -- with love and affection , and an overriding concern for her best interests -- then I will never be an " interloper . "
Nor will her mom , nor will her grandparents or aunts .
Indeed , should my ex ever remarry , if her husband is decent ( and most people are ) , then he would be welcome to support my daughter , too .
If he treats my daughter well , he will not be an interloper , either .
The more support she gets , the better off she is , and the happier I am .
Waaaah !
The bitch took my money !
Waaaah !
I 'm sorry .
My ex-wife got half of our assets ( 1/2 of 0 is 0 ) , the house ( but she still makes the payments ) , and the better car ( because she has physical custody of my daughter ) .
I 'm not complaining ; it still seems equitable to me , and I 'm not worried about it regardless .
As for people " often " getting alimony , who knows ?
The federal government has n't tracked alimony payments for 15 years .
Given that alimony generally accrues in cases where one spouse works and the other does n't , one would expect the percentage of people receiving alimony to drop over time .
Working in reverse : first of all , good .
I 'm glad idiots who do n't support their children get thrown in jail .
They should .
And that goes even if your ex does marry the proverbial billionaire .
My child support money goes to support .
I 've no doubt that my ex spends everything I give her and more on my daughter , and will continue to do so , even if she wins the lottery .
But even if my ex were rich and I was poor , I 'd want to keep making child support payments because damn it , she 's my daughter , and I want to support her financially .
I have a little bit of pride in that .
Second , note that in all the complaining by Braver about how hard men have it , we ultimately get to the point where men's standard of living still increases by 10 percent , while women 's drop 27 percent .
Did n't see that , did you ?
I know , it was buried and poorly - worded , so here it is again , in slow - motion : " Weitzman 's 1985 tome claimed that postdivorce women and children suffer on average a 73 percent drop in their standards of living , while the divorced men 's standards of living increased by 42 percent .
Years later , Weitzman acknowledged a math error ; " See ?
Clear as mud .
Now , I 'll admit that it's not a picnic buying new stuff for the apartment , and yeah , the tax code sucks if you 're an NCP .
I 'd love to see some additional deductions added for child support , and can make a strong public - policy argument for doing so .
But even if we take taxes and the purchase of new couches into account , we 're still left with a situation where men's standards of living are about even with what they had before , while women and children still see a sharp drop - off .
Poor men .
Finally , note the language in those paragraphs above .
I try to be careful to use " NCP " and " custodial parent " when I write , because that 's how the law works .
Men absolutely can get a head of household tax deduction after a divorce -- if they 're their children 's physical custodial parent .
One in six men is , you know .
And as more men take an equal responsibility for caregiving , that number will rise .
Aw , poor men .
So hard , our life is .
My ex did send out the Christmas cards , but there 's nothing stopping me from doing so other than my own laziness ; when we were together , I wrote the letter that went in the card and helped to address envelopes .
My ex arranged for my daughter 's Halloween costume this year , but I had input into it and had my daughter for part of the evening .
I knew a few neighbors in my old neighborhood , and went to the National Night Out barbecue my apartment building hosted .
And my friends stayed my friends after the divorce ; they supported me and let me vent and welcomed me and my daughter when we came by and generally acted like friends .
Why ?
Because I never relied on my ex to " make the social calendar , " and she never relied on me .
We both had friends , we both would arrange things , and I did n't leave the heavy lifting of my personal relationships to her .
Yes , men who abandon jobs that are seen as " women 's responsibility " are going to find themselves in trouble on those fronts should their relationships dissolve , but perhaps they could have avoided that by never pawning their own responsibilities off on their wives .
Certainly , if I 'd left it to my ex to maintain emotional connections with my friends , I 'd be friendless now .
But it would be my own fault .
I'm going to skip over the story of the guy whose wife cheated on him and then wrecked his life , because I 'm just not buying the story in full , and frankly , it 's just getting repetitive .
Instead , we 'll continue with the blathering from experts :
Uh ... no .
The last fourcombined in a father 's experience in divorce , not if fathers do n't want it to be .
Financial impact , as we saw above , is about a wash , but not in all cases , I 'll admit that .
Still , point five , " losing a relationship with a child ? "
That 's on you , dad .
You do n't have to lose your relationship with your child , not if you do n't want to .
I have a strong relationship with my daughter because I make it a priority .
You can do so , too .
Yes , divorce sucks .
But it sucks for men and women alike .
Women report depression after divorce too .
They have maladies , too .
Why ?
Because divorce is insanely stressful .
And stress is really bad for you , physically and emotionally .
Yes , think of it .
And that man 's wife may disagree that he has n't been unfaithful , disagree that he has n't been abusive .
You see , his is not the only perspective that matters here , and yet that 's how Baskerville treats the situation .
Can the court " take his children " from him ?
No .
They can grant their mother physical custody based on her being the primary caregiver , and that 's precisely what they should do , because awarding custody is based on what 's best for the children , not who 's to blame for the end of the marriage .
And that 's as it should be .
But " take his children ? "
If an NCP has n't been abusive , he or she is going to have access to his or her kids .
If he or she puts his or her kids at the forefront of his or her mind , he or she will have access aplenty -- because he or she will tell his or her ex , all right , I want to be very involved with the kids , I want them as much as possible , I 'll pay a fair amount for support if you treat me fairly with regard to visitation .
If you are abusive , of course , that becomes tougher -- but then , if you are abusive , you should n't be surprised by anything that happens to you .
Ha !
That 's not really funny .
Or , maybe , spouses could treat each other like actual adult human beings , and instead of playing cutesy games , they could talk frankly and openly about their feelings without fear of dismissal by their partners .
But of course , that can't happen :
We 're idiots , with boy brains that can do math but do n't understand human emotion .
And women are too damn demanding .
Shut up , and get me a beer !
Wait , why are you divorcing me ?
I 'll agree , men are n't built for " demands " being placed on them by a spouse , any more than women are built for " demands " being placed on them .
But if you value a relationship , you agree to do the work required to keep it going smoothly .
Those are n't demands placed on you by your partner -- those are demands you agreed to when you said " I do . "
If you do n't like it , then you should welcome divorce .
It will put an end to those difficult demands .
Duh .
I 'll spare you the last paragraph , which continues in this platitudinous vein , talking of how perhaps out of pain comes wisdom , yadda yadda , women are whores .
Seriously , this article breaks my heart .
It breaks my heart because there are husbands in failing relationships who will read this and think , not that they might have to do more work or open up emotionally , but that they 'd better protect themselves from that bitch and her needs .
It breaks my heart because there are divorced men who will read this garbage and think that their anger is just , is righteous , is helpful , instead of realizing that their anger is only keeping them from moving on with their lives , building relationships with their children , and creating fair and cordial relationships with their exes .
It breaks my heart because like so much men's rights garbage , slavish devotion to these ideals will lead , not to empowerment for men , but further impotence and anger .
And it breaks my heart because , in doing so , it will not just harm those men , but the women that they share an eternal bond with , even if that bond is not matrimony , and the children that they still parent , even if they do so from a different location .
The Beginning of the End

And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
– Revelations 8:1 , King James Bible
George W. Bush ’s State of the Union ( SOTU ) speeches have been the basis for a new kind of drinking game for several years now , basically because the things have always needed some kind of actual substance from somewhere , and because it was a good way to dull the pain of it all .
The rules : 1 . When he says the word “ terra ” or “ terra-ists , ” take a drink .
2 . When he says “ tax cuts , ” take a drink .
3 . When he says “ Iraq , ” take a drink .
4 . When he says “ nook - yuh - lerr , ” take a drink and a shot and a good swift kick to the head .
Et cetera .
But that ’s just one night out of the year .
Reality has proven to be far more alcoholic in nature .
For seven years now , the whole phenomenon of this government has been one long drinking game played out each and every day .
The rules of this game ?
1 . Say the words , “ George W. Bush is in charge of the country . ”
2 . Turn off the TV .
3 . Just drink .
Sounds familiar , right ?
Just about everyone has played that game a time or two by now .
We have endured seven Bush SOTU speeches as of last night .
Seven years worth of lies , carnage , greed , disgrace , failure , ignominy , calamity heaped upon calamity heaped upon calamity for more than two thousand five hundred days now , with three hundred and fifty seven more days still to go .
Seven speeches .
Seven years .
No more .
The final deal went down in DC last night , wreathed in all the pomp and circumstance of political theater and media spectacle .
The first tangible evidence this long national and planetary nightmare is actually beginning to come to an end was served up live on network television , for the viewing pleasure of a thoroughly disgusted and entirely disinterested American public .
If Bush ’s lips are moving , it means he must be lying ; so it has been for all those days , and so it was again on Monday evening .
Some 75 percent of the citizenry believe this country to be “ on the wrong track , ” and since the gomer giving the speech last night is seen as being largely responsible for putting us all on this “ wrong track ” to begin with , a vast American majority pretty much did n’t give a fig about what he had to say .
All that most people cared about was the historic significance of the night itself .
It was The Last Bush SOTU Speech Ever .
Seven speeches .
Seven years .
No more .
Remember Bush ’s SOTU speech from January 20 of 2003 ?
That was the one when he told America Iraq was in possession of 6,000 liters of anthrax , 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin , 500 tons of sarin , mustard and VX nerve agent – for those without calculators , 500 tons equals 1,000,000 pounds – plus around 30,000 munitions to deliver these agents , mobile biological weapons labs and uranium from Niger for use in a robust nook - yuh - lerr weapons program .
Take your drink .
Take your shot .
Do n’t forget your kick to the head : Each and every single one of those comprehensively - debunked claims can still be found on the White House web site .
Five American soldiers died in Iraq during the afternoon preceding Bush ’s SOTU speech on Monday .
They were patrolling the city of Mosul and were struck by a roadside bomb that was followed up with lethal gunfire .
There have now been 36 American soldiers killed in Iraq during the month of January , and 3,940 killed in total since Bush gave that January 2003 SOTU address and thus signed the death warrants for our fallen troops .
We do n’t do body counts , so there ’s no accurate way to assess how many tens or hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have been killed and maimed since that 2003 speech .
Last Wednesday , 60 Iraqis were killed and 280 others were wounded when a huge bomb exploded in Mosul .
The casualties , according to a New York Times report , were “ mostly children , women and the elderly . ”
“ Americans are still dying at the rate of one every day , ” wrote Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Chapman last week .
“ And violent civilian Iraqi deaths , according to the independent web site Iraq Body Count ( iraqbodycount.org ) , have averaged about 1,000 a month since September .
That ’s far lower than last January , but it ’s no better than in 2005 , and it ’s well above the levels of 2004 – when Iraq was already in the grip of bloody chaos .
To pronounce that reduction a success is like driving your car into a lake and then bragging when you pull it halfway out . ”
Bush managed all this with just the one 2003 SOTU speech .
He ’s given seven of the things now , so adjust the body - count mathematics accordingly .
Seven speeches .
Seven years .
No more .
Monday night ’s speech was almost breathtaking in its lack of substance .
He promised to bring the 9/11 perpetrators to justice , again .
He promised to bring democracy to the Middle East , again .
He talked up tax cuts for the financially solvent , again .
He threatened Iran , again .
He massaged the debacle known as “ No Child Left Behind , ” again .
He mispronounced “ nuclear ” at least three times , again .
Basically , Bush could have just as easily been replaced by one of those high - school - chemistry - class projection screens showing some random video snippets from his other six SOTU addresses .
Nobody would have noticed the difference .
There was no there , there .
Again .
We have to put up with this man and his people for less than a year , or so most people believe .
A story on today ’s Washington Post front page by Michael Abramowitz , however , reeled off a laundry list of pre-speech challenges for Bush that was capped by this line : “ That is the problem Bush faces as he prepares to deliver his seventh and probably final State of the Union address tonight . ”
“ Probably final ” ?
“ Probably final ” ?!
Drink .

The launch pad was swept by wind and rain on Friday morning
The Skynet 5B platform will ride into orbit atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport , in French Guiana .
It will join the 5A satellite lofted successfully in March and which is already handling secure traffic for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The £ 3.6 bn Skynet project represents the UK 's single biggest space venture .
The investment includes replacing and updating control centres , and the major antennas and terminals used by military ships , land vehicles and planes to communicate through the satellites .
The 5B spacecraft is waiting on the launch pad in Kourou for a flight timed to start at 1904 local time ( 2204 GMT ) .
" We 've had an incredibly smooth launch campaign so far , and now we 're in the final stages , " said Patrick Wood , who has led the development of both spacecraft for manufacturer EADS Astrium .
" There are a series of umbilical connections and we communicate with 5B night and day .
We 're doing final battery charging , making sure it is optimised for launch , " he told BBC News .
Laser protected
Skynet 5 will allow the Army , Royal Navy and RAF to pass much more data , faster between command centres .
The bandwidth capacity is two - and - a - half times that of the previous satellite constellation , Skynet 4 .
Although they look much like any of the other modern commercial telecommunications spacecraft launched from Kourou , the 5s incorporate new technologies specially prepared for military use .
Skynet 5B will be put in a position over the Indian Ocean

The spacecraft have also been " hardened " to withstand any interference - attempts to disable or take control of the satellites - and any efforts to eavesdrop on their sensitive communications .
They each have advanced receive antennas that enable the spacecraft to selectively listen to signals and filter out attempts to " jam " them .
They will also resist attempts to disrupt them with high - powered lasers .
" Hardened does n't mean armour - plated , because the cost of launching a spacecraft like that would be phenomenal and the amount of useable payload in it would be very small , " explained Mr Wood .
" But Skynet 5 does incorporate electronic - and some physical - protection that will help the spacecraft in some types of adverse environment . "
Information battle
The benefits of the upgrade should become evident when the UK starts using Predator unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) to support troops in Afghanistan .
These aircraft will stream real - time video of Taleban activity and , with the capacity of Skynet 5 , those pictures can be fed back to the UK quickly for further analysis , if necessary .
The Skynet system brings an increase in power and bandwidth

The UK military increasingly talks about NEC - Network Enabled Capability .
It describes modern commanders taking rapid decisions based on superior information - enabling them to deploy equipment and personnel far more effectively than has been possible in the past .
The abundance of information has to be managed , however .
Tony Skinner , from Jane 's Defence Weekly , said British commanders had admitted they were still learning how best to handle what is becoming a flood of information .
" As some of these new systems are coming online , and the communication bearers increase capacity , the armed forces have to work out the human processes , standards and protocols needed to use the information efficiently , " Mr Skinner explained .
" Also , your systems have to be interoperable , especially working in a coalition environment .
It 's all very well taking a video stream from a drone but can you share that with friendly forces , other bases and even back to the UK ? "
Complex deal
The cost of the Skynet project has raised eyebrows , not least because it has been financed through a private company with City money .
Paradigm Secure Communications won a contract with the Ministry of Defence to supply satellite services to UK forces .
The contract called for two new spacecraft and , because of the way the financing deal was put together , will allow for an in - orbit spare , Skynet 5C to be launched next year .
The MoD is currently struggling to tie down the details of another major PFI ( Private Finance Initiative ) to overhaul the RAF 's mid-air re-fuelling tankers , but Paradigm managing director , Malcolm Peto , is in no doubt the novel procurement route is good value .
" This is the way to do it , " he said .
" Other European militaries and procurement agencies have been sceptical that we could put this satcom network and services together .
" But with one satellite already in orbit , people are starting to take notice .
With two in orbit we will have nothing left to prove . "
Skynet 5A looks over the Atlantic Ocean .
5B will occupy a position above the Indian Ocean .
Together , they will provide coverage from the eastern US seaboard to east of China .
Friday 's Ariane rocket will also loft a Brazilian telecommunications spacecraft .

Three weeks before the Iowa caucuses , Republicans voters across the country appear uninspired by their field of presidential candidates , with a vast majority saying they have not made a final decision about who to support , according to the latest New York Times / CBS News Poll .
None of the Republican candidates is viewed favorably by even half of the Republican electorate , the poll found .
In a sign of the fluidity of the race , one candidate who had barely registered in early polls several months ago , Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas , is now locked in a tight contest nationally with Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts .
By contrast , Democrats are happier with their field and more settled in their decisions .
For all the problems Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York appears to be having holding off her rivals Iowa and New Hampshire , she remains strong nationally , the poll found .
Even after what her aides acknowledge has been two of the roughest months of her candidacy , she is viewed by Democrats as a far more electable candidate in the general election than either Senator Barack Obama of Illinois or John Edwards of North Carolina .
Not only did substantially more Democratic voters judge her to be ready for the presidency than those who believed Mr. Obama is prepared for the job , the poll found , but more Democrats said Mrs. Clinton could bring the country together than those who said Mr. Obama was someone who could unite different groups .

They 're an odd couple in every sense but a monkey and a pigeon have become inseparable at an animal sanctuary in China .
The 12 - week - old macaque - who was abandoned by his mother - was close to death when it was rescued on Neilingding Island , in Goangdong Province .
After being taken to an animal hospital his health began to improve but he seemed spiritless - until he developed a friendship with a white pigeon .
Scroll down for more ...
The blossoming relationship helped to revive the macaque who has developed a new lease of life , say staff at the sanctuary .
Now the unlikely duo are never far from each other 's side , but they are n't the only ones to strike up an unusual friendship .
Earlier this year a pig adopted a tiger cub and raised him along with her piglets because his mother could n't feed him .
And in 2005 a baby deer named Mi-Lu befriended lurcher Geoffrey at the Knowsley Animal Park in Merseyside after she was rejected by her mother .

Nature PL
POLITICIANS seem drawn to danger — as a rhetorical device , that is .
George Bush justified last year 's troop surge in Iraq by saying that otherwise the world would become “ a more dangerous place ” .
Gordon Brown , Britain 's prime minister , said this would be “ a dangerous year ” for his country .
Vladimir Putin told a NATO meeting that the world had become “ more dangerous ” because of the Bush administration .
This sense of impending doom is not confined to politicians .
Public attitudes generally seem to have become more pessimistic and inward - looking .
The proportion of Americans who think their country should be active in the world ( 42 % ) is the lowest it has been since the early 1990s .
Support for international trade and multinational companies is falling .
Opposition to immigration is growing .
Large minorities in most countries say globalisation is bad for them personally .
Although the main perceived threat varies by time and place — from climate change to economic recession — the general mood is a bit despondent .
And the outside world tends to be viewed as a source of trouble .
Indeed , for a great many people the way things are is pretty rotten : Burmese monks , for instance , or the Luo in Kenya .
Life is not too bright for investors at the moment , either .
But is the broader proposition true ?
Is the world really becoming worse for the majority of mankind ?
We argue that it is not .
To some extent , our qualified optimism is borne out by impartial data .
In this article we look at three pieces of evidence : the underlying social conditions in poor countries ; poverty alleviation over the past decade ; and the incidence of wars and political violence .
By those measures the world seems to be in rather better shape than most people realise .
Miracles behind the turmoil
In China 25 years ago , over 600 m people — two - thirds of the population — were living in extreme poverty ( on $ 1 a day or less ) .
Now , the number on $ 1 a day is below 180 m .
In the world as a whole , a stunning 135 m people escaped dire poverty between 1999 and 2004 .
This is more than the population of Japan or Russia — and more people , more quickly than at any other time in history .
Poverty alleviation has gone hand in hand with improvements in basic services .
Digging canals and building water - treatment plants has increased the number of people with access to safe water : in South Asia , for instance , the number of those without clean water has been nearly halved since 1990 .
Thanks to this , and to better public - health provision , the rate at which people die from infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis is falling in most poor countries , Africa excepted .
That in turn has cut child mortality .
In 2007 Unicef , the United Nations child - welfare body , said that for the first time in modern history fewer than 10 m children were dying each year before the age of five .
That is still an awful lot but it represents a fall of a quarter since 1990 .
Life expectancy has increased a bit in low - and middle - income countries .
The long march to literacy is nearing an end : three - quarters of people aged 15 - 25 were literate in 1975 ; now the rate is nearly nine - tenths .
All these things are the results of patient work over many years .
But perhaps the biggest change affecting people 's lives has little to do , at least directly , with development policy or public spending .
People in poor countries are now able to exert more control over their own fertility , and hence over the size of their families .
A generation ago the biggest worry about poor countries was over - population .
Books such as “ The Population Bomb ” ( 1968 ) and “ The Limits to Growth ” ( 1972 ) predicted Malthusian crises in countries where women were having five children or more .
Since then the fertility rate ( the average number of children a woman can expect during her lifetime ) in low - and middle - income countries has crashed .
In East Asia and the Pacific , the rate was 5.4 in 1970 .
Now it is 2.1 .
In South Asia , the fertility rate halved ( from 6.0 to 3.1 ) .
In the world as a whole , fertility has fallen from 4.8 to 2.6 in a generation ( 25 years ) .
The biggest decline is in those countries that are most involved with globalisation ( especially in East Asia , though China is a special case because of its one - child policy ) .
The most important exception to the rule of declining fertility is sub-Saharan Africa .
All the countries with fertility rates over 5.0 are in Africa ( with the one exception of Yemen ) .
Globalisation , it seems , leads to a shift in the direction of “ replacement fertility ” : the rate at which the size of a population eventually stabilises .
This is a remarkable development .
In closed agrarian societies , families need a lot of children as insurance against disaster .
But in countries that have opened themselves up , families can rely on other sorts of protection , such as urban jobs or trade .
These demographic changes help to create a virtuous circle of growth .
When fertility rises then falls , you get a bulge of people at and just after the inflection point .
The baby boomers were one such bulge .
Between 1960 and 1990 Europe and America had relatively few old people ( because mortality rates had earlier been high ) , relatively few children ( because fertility had fallen ) and a disproportionately big number of economically active adults .
These 30 boom years were ( to borrow the French phrase ) “ les trente glorieuses ” .
Developing countries are seeing a similar confluence now .
Eventually , of course , the demographic bonus turns into a demographic onus , as is happening in parts of Europe .
But that is a difficult story for a later generation .
In the next one , low - and middle - income countries will have a demographic advantage to reinforce their economic gains .
Up and up and up
These social achievements have not come about by accident .
They are , at least in part , attributable to growth .
A World Bank study of 19 poor countries concluded that every 1 % increase in national income per head translates into a 1.3 point fall in extreme poverty .
Hence the importance of the second broad indicator : the state of the world economy .
Last year the global economy entered its fifth year of over 4 % annual growth — the longest period of such strong expansion since the early 1970s .
Despite financial turmoil and soaring oil and commodity prices , world growth barely dipped in 2007 and trade grew at 9 % , even though trade talks fell apart .
Unlike previous expansions , inflation remained more or less under control .
Moreover , growth was spread around fairly evenly .
According to the World Bank , national income in the European Union rose slightly more than in America for the first time in a decade .
Growth in East Asia was 10 % , in South Asia over 8 % , in eastern Europe almost 7 % and in Africa , thanks to the commodity boom , over 6 % .
This was unprecedented .
In earlier booms , fast growth seemed to have been the preserve of a few miracle countries , such as the Asian tigers .
No longer .
Almost half of humanity , spread over more than 40 nations , lives in countries growing at 7 % a year or more , a rate that doubles the size of an economy in a decade .
This is twice the number of fast growers that existed in the years between 1980 and 2000 .
As a result , the world 's economic balance is tilting from rich industrialised countries to emerging markets .
Their share of world output in 2006 was just below half , and rising .
The International Monetary Fund reckons that in 2008 China and India will be the largest contributors to worldwide growth for the first time .
This does not mean that the world will be able to make light of a slowdown in industrialised countries .
Nor will developing countries be unaffected by problems hitting America and Europe .
Nevertheless , so far they have been hit less hard by the credit crunch than rich nations were .
Yields on high - risk corporate bonds rose over 300 basis points after August 2007 , an indication of the scale of damage to companies in rich nations .
By contrast , emerging - market bond yields rose less than 100 points , peanuts compared with what happened after the Asian and Russian crises of 1995 and 1998 .
Equity markets in emerging markets , unlike those in America and Japan , shrugged off their losses last August .
The view from the bond and equity markets seems to be that emerging markets are in a better position to cope with a credit crunch than rich countries are — and have grown better than they were at coping ( see article ) .
There is a problem , however .
Many people argue that the pattern of world growth over the past 20 years has not been beneficial .
They point out that globalisation - driven growth has gone hand in hand with a growth in inequality .
This inequality is a worry in its own right ( communities get broken up ; the poor get left behind ) and also a missed opportunity ( emerging markets might have done better still if only their extra wealth had been distributed more fairly ) .
Is this charge against globalisation true ?
And , if it is , does it follow that globalisation has been a failure because its benefits have been pinched by the rich ?
The evidence that the rich have done best is certainly compelling .
Inequality has risen in both rich and poor countries .
It is thus a sharp break from the pattern established between 1950 and 1990 , when there was a general decline in inequality , notably in East Asia , where the tigers managed to combine fast growth with relatively equal incomes .
But it is not so clear that globalisation — in the sense of opening up to trade and foreign investment — is to blame .
Ukraine and Poland both opened themselves in the 1990s .
Yet inequality rose in Poland and fell in Ukraine .
Globalisation , it seems , sometimes increases inequality , sometimes reduces it .
The educational ladder
A more plausible culprit for rising inequality seems to be technological progress ( see chart below ) .
This is associated with inequality in poor countries because in emerging markets the people best able to take advantage of new technology are those who already have an education and who are usually among the richest in society .
The more technological progress , therefore , the better the well - off do .
But to limit technology to reduce inequality would be a cure worse than the disease .
Technology in its broadest sense — the flow of new ideas — is the only way of getting growth rates up to 5 - 10 % a year , the rate which enables poor countries to catch up with the West .
Without it , growth would be dependent on labour and capital inputs , and growth would be just a few percent .
To reduce technological progress — even supposing one could do it — would be to condemn poor countries to stay poor .
In fact , since the mid-1990s , the incomes of the poorest fifth have risen everywhere except , marginally , in Latin America , where they have been affected by the after - shocks of debt crises .
In Asia , the real incomes of the poorest fifth rose 4 % a year ; in Africa , by 2 % a year , faster than the rise for other income groups .
The result is that the number of very poor people in the world is falling fast — even though many critics continue to believe that the poor have not really benefited from growth .
In 1990 those on $ 1 a day accounted for more than a quarter of the population of developing countries .
By 2015 , on current rates , the proportion of very poor people should have shrunk to 10 % .
Moreover , these monetary measures probably understate the real gains from things such as lower child mortality , safer water , literacy and other social achievements .
A rich man appreciates his extra cash but this does not compare with what a poor family gains from seeing an infant survive childhood or learn to write .
The general reduction in the numbers of the very poor weakens the perceived link between globalisation and inequality .
Across the world , if not within nations , globalisation can be claimed to be making people more equal , not less .
This is mainly because China and India , with their 2.5 billion people , are growing fast and narrowing the gap with rich countries .
Fading trumpets of war
Economic growth improves lives unobtrusively .
The more dramatic explanation for improved living standards is the decline in the number of wars , and in deaths from violence and genocide .
This explanation for prosperity will seem far - fetched to many .
International opinion has long held that the end of the cold war unlocked a Pandora 's box of ethnic violence that superpower rivalry had kept contained ( the splitting of Yugoslavia being the classic example ) .
Most people believe that the number of wars has increased ; that conflicts have become deadlier ( Iraq is typical ) ; and that there are more acts of genocide ( Darfur being just the most recent ) .
Yet there is surprisingly little evidence to back up this impression .
The number of conflicts ( both international and civil ) fell from over 50 at the start of the 1990s to just over 30 in 2005 ( definitions are obviously fluid ; these are the ones used by scholars at the universities of Uppsala and British Columbia for a project called the “ Human Security Report ” ) .
On their definitions , the number of international wars peaked during the 1970s and has been falling slowly since .
The number of civil wars continued to rise until about 1990 and then fell precipitately .
In total , the death toll in battle fell from over 200,000 a year in the mid-1980s to below 20,000 in the mid-2000s .
Such numbers are subject to error and dispute .
Figures from the World Health Organisation , for example , are much higher .
Still , the direction of change does look plausible .
In general , the number of new wars , and new episodes in old wars , seems to be falling .
More recently , 2006 saw a war in Lebanon , violence in Congo and conflict in Nepal , Somalia and Timor - Leste .
By 2007 those struggles had simmered down , somewhat .
You see a similar pattern with the worst of crimes , genocide .
At the moment , Darfur is a stain on mankind .
But in a quantitative sense , the late 1980s and early 1990s were worse : that period saw ten cases of the mass slaughter of civilians , says Barbara Harff , of the US Naval Academy , including Bosnia , Rwanda and Burundi .
The cold war itself was not all that frigid .
The protagonists fought their wars by proxy : about a third of conflicts from 1950 to 1990 were connected to cold - war rivalry .
In addition , during the early years of that period , there were many wars between retreating colonial powers and independence movements , a source of violence that has almost disappeared .
All this is hard to square with the notion that wars have become more frequent and deadlier since the end of the cold war .
On the other hand , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of conflicts resolved .
During this decade civil wars have come to an end or have been restrained in Aceh , Angola , Burundi , Congo , Liberia , Nepal , Timor - Leste and Sierra Leone .
These places then drop out of the news .
As Sherlock Holmes remarked of the curious incident of the dog at night ( “ The dog did nothing in the night - time ... That was the curious incident ” ) , events that do not happen can be as revealing as those that do .
A big exception to the rule of declining political violence is the rise of terrorism .
Despite claims to the contrary by the Bush administration , the number of international terrorist incidents has risen since September 11th 2001 , after a decade of decline .
The number of deaths from terrorist acts has climbed almost everywhere .
Yet this picture of worldwide growth is misleading .
While it is true that Asia , Latin America and Europe have all experienced more terrorist attacks than before , they are still rare .
Since 2001 , the Middle East has suffered more violence and fatalities than the rest of the world put together .
Violence in the Middle East is a reminder , as if one were needed , of the many ills — climate change , greenhouse gases , chronic diseases in poor countries and much , much more — that need to be set against the achievements of the past few years .
But the successes provide some perspective , both to the extent of the world 's persistent problems , and to their setting .
Fragile : do not drop
An extraordinary concentration of misfortunes is to be found in a group of countries which the World Bank labels “ fragile ” .
This is a slightly larger category than the so - called failed states , such as Somalia , where the central government has ceased to exist .
It includes countries where the government has partial control of territory ( Sudan ) , where it cannot deliver basic services ( Zimbabwe ) and places with high levels of political conflict ( Nigeria ) .
Fragile states contain roughly half the developing world 's childhood deaths .
About a third of their people are undernourished and more than that do not have access to drinking water .
They usually have extremely high fertility rates : most of the countries with fertility rates over 5.0 are fragile .
In one way or another , they are much more likely to be affected by wars , refugees and every sort of political crisis .
Bad government and lack of growth often , though far from always , go together .
Whatever the problems of globalisation , they are dwarfed by the penalties of being untouched by it .
The World Social Forum , a gathering of self - proclaimed progressives who want to turn back trade , growth and globalisation has adopted as its slogan the motto “ Another world is possible ” .
In reality , another and better world is painfully and fitfully coming into being .
If you ’re ever in Zimbabwe , do n’t miss the chance to take a swim in The Devil ’s Pool , a small lagoon , enclosed by rocks , on the edge of one of the biggest , most beautiful waterfalls in the world , Victoria Falls .
Set on Livingstone Island , at a height of 103 meters , Devil ’s Pool is definitely one of the most surreal locations on Earth .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The State Department 's chief of diplomatic security has resigned amid scrutiny of the use of private military contractors to guard the department 's staff in Iraq , a spokesman said Wednesday .
Richard Griffin testifies before a House committee looking into private security contractors earlier this month .
Richard Griffin , a 36 - year career official , gave no explanation for his decision in his resignation letter to President Bush .
" I am grateful that I had the opportunity to serve as the assistant secretary for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , whose brave men and women serve on the front lines of the Global War on Terror , " he wrote in his resignation letter , a copy of which was obtained by CNN .
" Without their courage and commitment , the State Department could not possibly carry out its foreign policy mission . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accepted Griffin 's resignation , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
Griffin 's decision to step down follows weeks of investigations into the September 16 killings of Iraqi civilians by Blackwater USA , a North Carolina - based firm hired by the State Department to protect American diplomats in Baghdad .
Meanwhile , a survivor of the September 16 incident told CNN on Wednesday that he and a number of other victims were summoned to a meeting with U.S. Embassy officials and were offered money .
Mohammed Abdul Razzaq , whose 9 - year - old son died , said the embassy offered him $ 12,500 -- which he said he refused because " they did n't acknowledge their crime . "
" Do n't they need to acknowledge my son 's blood first so I can forgive them ?
Now I can't .
How can I take compensation and they never acknowledge the crime ? " he said .
The father is demanding a formal apology from Blackwater CEO Erik Prince , prosecution of those responsible for his son's death and political asylum in the United States so he can pursue the case in American courts .
Another survivor , taxi driver Sami Hawas , told CNN he received $ 7,500 from the embassy , a payment he described as " aid . "
Hawas was shot a number of times in the back and leg .
He said he is unable to work now and complained about the high cost of medication .
He took the money , he said , because he needs help paying for medical treatment and supporting his family .
" Even if they compensate me with millions , it will not make up for the lost blood and the pain I live every day , " he told CNN .
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Natango said the payments were " part of a standard procedure " and would continue .
She described them as " short - term and speedy aid and support " but said they were not an admission of guilt .
She said those receiving the money do not waive any right to future compensation .
The State Department and the FBI are conducting their own investigation into the killings , and a joint U.S. - Iraqi commission is reviewing the results of both probes .
Prince has said that Blackwater guards came under fire while protecting a State Department convoy and acted properly in self - defense .

But Iraqi authorities have called the killings " premeditated murder " and demanded Blackwater leave Iraq .
A State Department report of its own operations , released Tuesday , found lax oversight of security contractors , who are under the supervision of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security .
It recommended tightening the rules of engagement for contractors to bring them in line with those used by the U.S. military , and Rice appointed a top U.S. diplomat to oversee all security operations in Iraq .
Blackwater is the most prominent of the military contractors working in Iraq , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors guard diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
Company officials urged subscribers to its e-mailed newsletter Wednesday to help fight its public - relations battle .
" In this tumultuous political climate , Blackwater Worldwide has taken center stage , our services and ethics aggressively challenged with misinformation and fabrications .
Letters , e-mails and calls to your elected congressional representatives can and will create a positive impact by influencing the manner in which they gather and present information , " the company wrote .
The message , titled " A Request for Your Support , " urged readers to contact members of Congress " and tell them to stand by the truth . "
It recommended that constituents emphasize that the company hires U.S. military veterans and the fact that no one under Blackwater 's protection has been killed in Iraq .
It also asked that supporters stress what the company termed the " cost efficiency " of its services , for which the State Department has paid more than $ 800 million since 2004 .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said the company had received " hundreds of positive responses " to its appeal by Wednesday afternoon .
The contractors are immune from prosecution under Iraqi law , under an order issued by the American - led occupation government in 2004 .
Iraq 's government has agreed to ask the country 's parliament to consider changing that directive , an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki told CNN on Wednesday .

All About Blackwater USA • U.S. Department of State
Bush comfortable with the rich avoiding taxes
Following up on an earlier item , the president ’s appearance on “ Fox News Sunday ” covered a fair amount of ground , but this exchange helped highlight so many of Bush ’s flaws .
WALLACE : [ In November , the Republican nominee ] would be weighed down by a faltering economy , an unpopular war , at least according to the polls , and — forgive me — according to polls , an unpopular president .
How does he overcome all of that and beat the Democrats ?
BUSH : Because there are two big issues .
One is who ’s going to keep your taxes low .
Most Americans feel overtaxed .
And I promise you the Democrat [ sic ]
Party is going to field a candidate that says , “ I ’m going to raise your taxes . ”
They ’re going to say , “ Oh , we ’re only going to tax the rich people . ”
But most people in America understand that , you know , rich people hire good accountants and figure out how not to , you know , necessarily pay all the taxes , and the middle class gets stuck .
I ca n’t help but wonder if the president appreciates how foolish this is .
On the one hand , Bush is conceding that he ’s content to allow the very wealthy to “ hire good accountants , ” shirk their legal responsibilities , and pass along the tax burden to the middle class .
If the president is convinced that the rich are able to “ figure out ” how not to pay their tax bill , should n’t he , you know , care about fixing a system in which , by his own explanation , middle - class families are getting screwed ?
On the other hand , if the very wealthy are , in fact , successfully avoiding taxes , why is it the Bush administration has gone to great lengths to cut their taxes even more ?
In other words , as far as the president is concerned , to spur economic growth , we should cut taxes for the rich , allow them to spend more , and wait for prosperity to trickle down to everyone else .
Except , to hear Bush explain it on Fox News , these people have already figured out how to beat the system .
Why , then , give tax cuts to rich people who are n’t paying their taxes to begin with ?
Indeed , why make that the centerpiece of the administration ’s entire economic policy for more than seven years ?
Keep in mind , this was n’t just some dumb , random remark that the president uttered without forethought .
On the contrary , he ’s been making this exact same argument for years .
* October 2004 : “ [ John Kerry ] says , ‘ Oh , I ’m just going to tax the rich . ’
Well , the rich hire lawyers and accountants for a reason — that ’s to stick you with the tab . ”
* August 2004 : “ [ Y ] ou know how the tax code works .
When they say , ‘ tax the rich , ’ those are the folks who have got the accountants to see to it they do n’t pay tax , so guess who gets stuck with the bill ?
You ’re going to get stuck with the bill .
The worst thing for job creation is to be running up the taxes on the working people of this country .
And we ’re not going to let [ John Kerry ] have a chance to do so . ”
As for the Fox News interview , Chris Wallace , not surprisingly , did n’t follow up on the president ’s remarks , but I have a question for Bush , and maybe some enterprising reporter could bring it up at the next White House press briefing : if the president is convinced that the rich are violating tax law , and that the middle class is getting stuck with the bill , why has n’t he proposed doing anything about it ?
Like Ms. Ware , more women are forgoing scent altogether .
Last year , about 15 percent of women said they did not wear fragrance , up from 13 percent in 2003 , according to a survey of 9,800 women conducted by NPD .
“ That may sound like a small number , but nationally that translates into two million more women who are saying ‘ I do n’t wear fragrance , ’ ” said Karen Grant , the senior beauty industry analyst at NPD .
“ Eighty - five percent of women are still buying fragrance , but an increasing number tell us they are wearing fewer scents , less frequently or not at all . ”
Fragrance fatigue is probably inevitable , with heavily fruited scents wafting out of everything from dishwashing liquids to hotel linens to candle displays at the mall .
But perfume aversion seems to be tapping into a larger societal phenomenon that may have its origins in bans on cellphones and cigarettes : the idea that the collective demands of the public space trump one ’s personal space .
“ People are shying away from fragrances not for the traditional reasons that you ’d expect , that it is too expensive or that they are wearing alternative products like body sprays or lotions , ” Ms. Grant said .
“ Many people said it bothers them that fragrance has an effect on other people , that they are trying to be considerate by not overcoming others with scent . ”

Indeed , Rochelle R. Bloom , the president of the Fragrance Foundation , an industry trade group , said that people who worry that their fragrance may offend others simply may be wearing perfume improperly .
Warning , couch potatoes : resting on your laurels may be hazardous to your health , not to mention make you old before your time .
" A sedentary lifestyle increases the propensity to aging - related disease and premature death , " researchers at King 's College London report today in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine .
" Inactivity may diminish life expectancy not only by predisposing to aging - related diseases but also because it may influence the aging process itself . "
Researcher Lynn Cherkas and colleagues reached their conclusions by examining the genetic material extracted from blood samples of some 2,400 twins .
They specifically studied the length of telomeres ( repeated DNA sequences ) on the ends of chromosomes in leukocytes ( white blood cells ) ; the protective caps are believed to be markers of biological aging , because they shrink over time .
Their findings : the telomeres of subjects who exercised the most ( an average of 199 minutes weekly ) were longer than those of volunteers who worked out the least ( a mere 16 minutes or less a week ) .
The discrepancy was enough , researchers wrote , to suggest that the exercise mavens were on average as much as a decade biologically younger than the slackers .
" Such a relationship between leukocyte telomere length and physical activity level remained significant after adjustment for body mass index , smoking , socioeconomic status and physical activity at work , " the authors report .
" The mean difference in leukocyte telomere length between the most active and least active subjects was 200 nucleotides ( chemical structural units of DNA and RNA ) , which means that the most active subjects had telomeres the same length as sedentary individuals up to 10 years younger , on average . "
The scientists speculate that stress , inflammation and oxidative stress ( cell damage caused by oxygen exposure ) may be responsible for shortened telomeres in physically inactive people .
Exercise is among the factors found to help alleviate stress .
Previous research has linked regular workouts to lower rates of cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes , cancer , high blood pressure , obesity and osteoporosis .
The researchers note that their findings support U.S. guidelines calling for individuals to exercise moderately for 30 minutes at least five days a week .
" Our results . . . show that adults who partake in regular physical activity are biologically younger than sedentary individuals , " they say .
" This conclusion provides a powerful message that could be used by clinicians to promote the potential anti-aging effect of regular exercise . "
Of course , the word " interactive " is regularly wheeled out to make any old bullshit sound exciting and modern .
Hey , it 's not a humiliating infringement of civil liberties - it 's interactive !
You , know - a bit of democratic fun , just like The X Factor or MySpace !
Woo hoo !
Now put that in the bin or I 'll blow your head off .
There are two major problems with justifying the bellowing CCTV cameras on the grounds that they 're " interactive " .
Firstly , just because something 's " interactive " , that does n't automatically make it right .
Coprophilia is interactive , and that does n't belong in the street either .
Secondly , they 're not interactive at all .
They 're faceless electronic scrutinisers that scream when you break the rules .
What John Reid has done here is confuse the word " interactive " with the word " nightmarish " .
And wait , it gets worse .
As if the scheme was n't already unsettling enough , according to news reports , " children 's voices are to be used initially to make the encounter less confrontational " .
This would be a brilliantly disturbing twist in a dystopian sci- fi movie in which the traditional adult - child relationship has been thrown into reverse , and misbehaving grownups are publicly scolded by eerie , disembodied infant voices , but unfortunately it 's not happening in a dystopian sci - fi movie at all , but in Middlesborough .
And , later this year , in Southwark , Barking and Dagenham , Reading , Harlow , Norwich , Ipswich , Plymouth , Gloucester , Derby , Northampton , Mansfield , Nottingham , Coventry , Sandwell , Wirral , Blackpool , Salford , South Tyneside and Darlington .
Incidentally , it 's not yet clear whether the children 's voices will address miscreants using formal language ( " Attention , citizen : you are committing a felony ; you have 20 seconds to desist " ) or in " kid speak " ( " You 're a bad man and I 'm telling on you and my dad 's going to tear your head off " ) .
Perhaps they could also allow kids to control the cameras and decide what constitutes a crime .
And , rather than mounting the cameras on poles , why not make them mobile and more kid-friendly by placing them inside full - size , remote - controlled Daleks , which can patrol the streets dishing out near - fatal electric shocks to those who disobey ?
Actually , using the Daleks would be a masterstroke .
Everyone loves Doctor
Who - who would n't be thrilled by the sight of a real - life Dalek squadron rolling down the high street , glinting in the sun ?
The sheer excitement would genuinely make the accompanying loss of liberty seem worthwhile .
To liven things up even more , our rasping pepperpot overlords could be colour - coded .
Blue Daleks would deal with minor infractions , and would spend most of their time issuing warnings and administering minor shocks - but they 'd also be chummy and approachable , and willing to pose for photographs with your nephew .
Red Daleks , on the other hand , would be emotionless killing machines .
Imagine the atmosphere outside a pub on a hot summer 's day : a Red Dalek trundles past , and the convivial hubbub suddenly fades to a whisper .
Everyone stiffens .
And then he turns the corner and a communal sigh of relief goes up , and the drinking continues and the jukebox plays louder and louder ... community spirit lives again .
Admit it : it'd be fantastic .
Of course , to maximise the psychological impact of the Red Daleks , they 'd have to be fewer in number than the Blues .
Ten per citizen , tops .
If anyone from the Home Office is reading this , incidentally , it 's absolutely imperative that you license the actual , 100 % official , BBC Daleks , as seen on TV .
Do n't just try to create some sort of rip - off close - as - dammit lookalike and hope we 'll start calling them " Daleks " .
We 're not idiots .
And if you draw a blank with Terry Nation 's estate , do n't bother negotiating for the rights to the Cybermen instead .
It wo n't be the same .
Daleks or nothing .
Pull that off and I guarantee we 'll willingly accept it .
Even Shami Chakrabarti , denouncing the plan on Question Time , would have to start her complaint by saying , " Obviously I love the idea of Daleks as much as anyone , but ... "
So come on , Reid .
Stop pissing about with twittering cameras on sticks .
The technology for an army of wirelessly controlled mobile CCTV spybots already exists - and it 's interactive .
There 's nothing stopping you .
Show some balls for once in your poxy life .
Give us the Daleks .
Living past 90 , and living well , may be more than a matter of good genes and good luck .
Five behaviors in elderly men are associated not only with living into extreme old age , a new study has found , but also with good health and independent functioning .
The behaviors are abstaining from smoking , weight management , blood pressure control , regular exercise and avoiding diabetes .
The study reports that all are significantly correlated with healthy survival after 90 .
While it is hardly astonishing that choices like not smoking are associated with longer life , it is significant that these behaviors in the early elderly years  all of them modifiable  so strongly predict survival into extreme old age .
“ The take - home message , ” said Dr. Laurel B. Yates , a geriatric specialist at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston who was the lead author of the study , “ is that an individual does have some control over his destiny in terms of what he can do to improve the probability that not only might he live a long time , but also have good health and good function in those older years . ”
Researchers with Princeton University and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have found a flaw that renders disk encryption systems useless if an intruder has physical access to your computer – say in the case of a stolen laptop or when a computer is left unattended on a desktop in sleep mode or while displaying a password prompt screen .
The attack takes only a few minutes to conduct and uses the disk encryption key that 's stored in the computer 's RAM .
The attack works because content as well as encryption keys stored in RAM linger in the system , even after the machine is powered off , enabling an attacker to use the key to collect any content still in RAM after reapplying power to the machine .
" We 've broken disk encryption products in exactly the case when they seem to be most important these days : laptops that contain sensitive corporate data or personal information about business customers , " said J. Alex Halderman , one of the researchers , in a press release .
" Unlike many security problems , this is n't a minor flaw ; it is a fundamental limitation in the way these systems were designed . "
The researchers successfully performed the attack on several disk encryption systems – Apple 's FileVault , Microsoft 's BitLocker , as well as TrueCrypt and dm- crypt – but said they have no reason to believe it wo n't work on other disk encryption systems as well , since they all share similar architectures .
They released a paper about their work as well as a video demonstration of the attack ( below ) .

In the United States , we have freedom of speech , in the sense that the government wo n’t arrest you for speaking your mind .
Yay for freedom !
But your fellow citizens will happily ruin your economic life if you say something unpopular in public .
Some might say that has nothing to do with the right of free speech .
It ’s an example of free people acting in a free way .
But to me , it looks like cutting out the middle man .
There ’s no point in electing a government to punish unpopular speakers when the citizens can do it themselves , and cheaper .
It might look we have freedom of speech to you , but to me it looks like we just found the most efficient system for limiting it .
[ Interesting side note :
For this post I made a list of opinions you are not allowed to express in this country , and realized I ca n’t even publish the list without a social and economic penalty that would n’t be worth the benefit . ]
We also have freedom of religion in the United States , unless your religion conflicts with the religious majority in any non-symbolic way .
In other words , you can wear a funny hat , but you ca n’t ask your neighbor to fellate you in return for setting up her wireless network .
Polygamy gets a bad rap because cult leaders keep forcing 14 - year old girls to marry 60 - year old men .
Clearly there ’s a victim in those cases .
But why ca n’t Warren Buffet have multiple wives of legal age if they all agree to the arrangement ?
Thanks to religious restrictions on freedom in the United States , we have a long list of things you ca n’t do ( at least whenever you want ) : prostitution , marijuana , euthanasia , gambling , polygamy , and on and on .
You might argue that the law is just trying to protect people from harm .
But if that were the case , bicycles would be illegal .
I keep wondering why I do n’t get mad about the government chipping away at my freedoms in the alleged interest of fighting terrorism .
I used to think it was because I thought the tradeoff was worth it .
But I suspect the real reason is that losing a few more freedoms would just get lost in the rounding .
Comcast 's traffic management practices have landed the cable giant in court .
Yesterday , a California resident filed a lawsuit in state court accusing Comcast of breach of contract , breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing , and violating the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act .
John
Hart describes himself as a Comcast customer who has seen performance hits when using " Blocked Applications " targeted by Comcast 's traffic management application , Sandvine .
In his complaint , Hart says that Comcast severely limits " the speed of certain internet applications such as peer - to - peer file sharing and lotus notes [ sic ] . "
Comcast accomplishes this by " transmitting unauthorized hidden messages " to the PCs of those using the applications .
Hart also takes issue with some of Comcast 's high - speed advertising .
He upgraded his service to the Performance Plus package in order to get faster uploads and downloads , and also to use the " Blocked Applications " referenced in the lawsuit .
Comcast , he says , did not adequately disclose its traffic management practices when he signed up for High Speed Internet or when he upgraded .
Some Comcast customers have suspected that the ISP blocks some P2P traffic , but it was n't until last month that the company was caught in the act .
Testing performed by the Associated Press showed conclusively that Comcast was using forged TCP reset packets to block BitTorrent traffic .
It then emerged that Comcast 's traffic management practices were causing problems for other applications , including groupware client Lotus Notes .
Comcast has steadfastly denied blocking traffic , but its explanations of what exactly it is that the company is doing have been unconvincing .
The ISP says that it sometimes " delays " traffic , but that the " delayed " traffic will always eventually make it to its destination .
A Comcast spokesperson told me today that , while the company does engage in network management like any other ISP , " we 're not blocking anything . "
As was the case with Threat Level , he referred me to the company 's FAQ for more information on what the company does and does not do with P2P traffic .
At the beginning of November , a few public interest groups filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission , accusing Comcast of running afoul of the FCC's Internet Policy Statement , and asking the Commission to prevent Comcast from engaging in any future traffic blocking .
Hart 's complaint also accuses Comcast of violating FCC policy by " impairing " the use of some applications while permitting other applications to operate without hindrance .
Hart is seeking class - action status for the lawsuit , damages , a change in the company 's advertising to reflect its traffic - shaping practices , and an injunction barring Comcast from further interference with the " Blocked Applications . "
A Comcast spokesperson told Ars that the company has not yet been served with the complaint , and therefore had no comment on the lawsuit .
Ever stiffed a waiter on his tip or worse still waived it around like you were the superior man ?
If so , you need some tipping etiquette lessons , pronto !
Proper tipping etiquette is still a trait rarely found in modern men yet , when perfected , it can actually become quite enjoyable .
It ’s a selfless act of giving to others based on the level of service you ’ve received .
A lot of these people get a pitiful wage and the tips they get go a long way to supplement their income .
Make them happy and you ’ll be looked after .
Annoy them and you ’d be best advised to eat your meal with caution !
Tipping like a Gentleman
Tipping really is an art form and when you ’re giving your tip you want to be as discrete and gentlemanly as possible .
Hand over the tip with your palm facing down and shake hands with the person you are tipping , simultaneously placing the money in their hand .
What you want to avoid doing is waving the money around and making a big deal of it .
You ’ll look like an idiot for starts and if that is n’t enough , you ’re going to make the person receiving the tip feel uncomfortable because , believe it or not , you ’re coming across like a condescending jerk .
You ’re not throwing a treat for Fido here .
So how do you figure out how much to tip ?
Well the truth is there are no tipping rules per se , however there are guidelines which suggest how much is appropriate to give .
Let ’s investigate .
The restaurant waiter / waitress
This is the one that causes most debate because there is no hard and fast rule .
It is also made even more difficult by waiting staff who have lost sight of the fact that a tip is a gratuity and is not actually required .
As a guideline though , I ’d say you can safely use the following without a disgruntled waiter spitting in your salad :
Self - serve / Buffet restaurant – 10 - 12 % .
If the service was fantastic , you could up this to 15 % .
– 10 - 12 % .
If the service was fantastic , you could up this to 15 % .
Local restaurant – 15 % .
Again , you could up this by a few percent if the server worked particularly hard or went out of their way to help you .
– 15 % .
Again , you could up this by a few percent if the server worked particularly hard or went out of their way to help you .
A 4 - star restaurant – You ’ll want to tip the maitre d’ as you ’re being seated , particularly if you ’re a regular and he / she goes out of their way to reserve you a table or get a table when the restaurant is busy .
The standard tip here is anywhere from $ 20 - 100 .
For the service of the meal itself I ’d recommend a tip of around 20 - 22 % .
Do n’t forget to tip the wine steward ( a few dollars per bottle of wine ) and / or the coat check attendant ( $ 1 for a couple of coats ) .
Taxi driver
Unless you want to annoy the Travis Bickle - esque taxi driver by stiffing him on a tip you ’d better go ahead and give 15 % of the fare .
Hair salon
You want to make sure your hair looks as good as possible and tipping will ensure that your hair stylist gives a polished cut .
They ’ll also be more likely to look after you next time you visit too ( I ’ve been given a free colour before simply for tipping well ) .
An acceptable amount is somewhere in the region of 10 - 15 % of the cost .
Hotel staff
There are a number of staff members at the hotel that can make your stay very pleasant or a living nightmare depending on how you tip them .
Here ’s who you should tip and how much to give them :
Chambermaid – $ 5 per night you stay .
That is , if you want clean sheets , towels and plenty of toilet roll .
– $ 5 per night you stay .
That is , if you want clean sheets , towels and plenty of toilet roll .
Room service waiter – Again this is the standard 15 % .
– Again this is the standard 15 % .
Bellhop –
If you let the bellhop carry your bags up to your room and show you around said room without giving them a tip then you ’re going to hell .
Tip them around $ 10 - 15 for their efforts .
The casino
If you ’re going for a night out at the casino , you better be prepared to tip .
Of course if you ’re a professional gambler ( or just extremely lucky ) you ’ll be able to tip from your winnings .
Blackjack dealer – $ 5 chip ( or more ) per session .
It ’s also common place in casinos for the players to place a small side bet for the dealers .
You can agree the amount with other players but a $ 1 chip is usually sufficient .
– $ 5 chip ( or more ) per session .
It ’s also common place in casinos for the players to place a small side bet for the dealers .
You can agree the amount with other players but a $ 1 chip is usually sufficient .
Craps dealer –
Those craps dealers love the action as much as you .
It ’s common to place up to a 10 % side bet for the dealer .
– Those craps dealers love the action as much as you .
It ’s common to place up to a 10 % side bet for the dealer .
Poker dealer – $ 5 per session .
Winners usually tip at least $ 10 and sometimes as much as 10 % on bigger wins .
– $ 5 per session .
Winners usually tip at least $ 10 and sometimes as much as 10 % on bigger wins .
Drink waitresses – $ 1 chip per drink .
Parking attendant
You do n’t want some juvenile attendant ruining your prized Bentley Continental because you did n’t tip the lad , do you ?
On second thoughts , why would you let a juvenile attendant park your prized Bentley Continental unless you ’re asking for trouble ?
You should tip , at the very least $ 1 ( $ 5 if they help with your luggage ) but I would tip a little extra to get a better level of service .
Perhaps $ 10 - 15 to make sure they do n’t take it for a joy - ride ?
la Ferris Bueller .
Oh , that reminds me , always check the mileage of the car before handing it over to a parking attendant !
But what if I do n’t want to give a tip ?
There are some occasions where you feel unjustified to give out a tip , but let me tell you why you should .
The food was terrible .
If the food was terrible , then complain to the manager ( you might get a discount on the bill ) but do n’t take away the tip from the waiting staff because you ’re punishing them for someone else ’s mistake .
Chances are they worked very hard for you and to not reward them would be unfavourable .

The service was below par .
If the service was below par then you should tip at a lower rate than normal .
Usually , I ’d speak to the waiter I ’m tipping and politely explain the reasons for the lower tip .
Just make sure you ’ve eaten all your food before you tell them !

You are a stingy and grumpy old man .
So you do n’t want to tip .
Why not ?
You ’re rewarding someone for doing good work .
How would you feel if your boss decided to not give you the pay raise you ’ve been asking for or taking your bonus away from you just because he felt like it ?
As the old saying goes , “ Treat other people the way you expect to be treated yourself . ”
Oh and for those of you wondering how to deal with people who flat out ask you for a tip .
I like to go with the following :
Yeah , I ’ve got a tip for you .
Never eat yellow snow .
What ’s your etiquette for tipping ?
Is it more or less than I ’ve suggested ?
Also , if you ’ve got a great tipping story from a restaurant for example , let us know in the comments .
Supreme Commander Benchmarking Guide
Like Crysis , Supreme Commander is also a very tough benchmark .
Unlike Crysis though , Supreme Commander is more strenous on the CPU , rather than the graphics card .
However , this does not mean that Supreme Commander is a worthless benchmark for graphics cards .
It is a good way to test how much effect a graphics card has on the performance of a CPU - limited game .
Of course , it is great for benchmarking CPUs .
Benchmarking using Supreme Commander is very easy .
The creator , Gas Powered Games , has conveniently included a built - in benchmark that allows you to run a time demo with four opponents battling it out .
At the end of the time demo , you will be given a SupComMark composite score as well as a large bunch of benchmark data , the most important of which is the average frame rate .
Let 's take a look at how you can benchmark your CPU and GPU using Supreme Commander .
Setting Up Supreme Commander
The first thing you should do before benchmarking Supreme Commander is ensure that you have Supreme Commander fully patched to the latest version .
You can get it here - http://info.thq.com/support/.
You should also ensure you are using the latest driver for your graphics card .
If you are testing multiple CPUs , do not change your graphics card or its driver when you swap to a different CPU .
Changing either the graphics card or its driver will skew your results and render them useless for accurate comparisons .
If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card , you can download the latest driver here - http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html.
If you are using an ATI - AMD graphics card , you can download the latest driver here - http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html.
Before we start benchmarking , we will also need to set up Supreme Commander 's display settings .
To do that , load Supreme Commander and head over to Options -> Video .
Here , you can change various display settings .
The most important settings are Primary Adapter , Anti-Aliasing and Vertical Sync .
Primary Adapter allows you to set the resolution you wish to run at .
For graphics card tests , it should be set at the highest resolution your monitor supports .
For CPU tests , it would be better to use a lower resolution like 1024x768 or 1280x1024 .
Anti-Aliasing is useful if you are testing graphics cards , but should be disabled for CPU tests .
Vertical Sync must be disabled in all benchmark tests , whether you are testing the CPU or the graphics card .
As far as the other settings are concerned , you can leave them at default or you can change them .
But once you start testing , you must not change them .
For CPU tests , it may be a good idea to reduce the graphics rendering quality and features .
For tests that involve graphics cards , the reverse is true - you should turn everything to the maximum .
Once all this is done , you are ready to benchmark Supreme Commander !
So HStringTemplate was built around a simple notion : Everything takes an environment , which is a data structure holding attributes and some other good stuff , and eventually returns a string .
This was abstracted later on , but we ’ll come back to that .
Plan text ?
That returns a string .
A reference to an attribute ?
It returns a string .
A nested template ?
It returns a string .
So when we parse / interpret any template , we end up with a list of functions of type Env ->
String .
Simple enough to get going with .
So how do we execute this template ?
We need a function of type [ Env -> String ] -> Env ->
String .
If we were n’t thinking functionally , we ’d have to write a loop .
Create an empty string , and for each function in the list , apply it to our environment , append it to the string , and repeat :
function render ( template , env ) { str = " " ; foreach ( func in template ) { str += func ( env ) ; } return str ; }
In functional terms we can write ( ignoring stack and efficiency issues ) a fold :
render tmp env = foldr ( flip ( ++ ) . ( $ env ) ) [ ] tmp
If we think about it a bit , this is actually concat $ map ( $env ) tmp , or simpler still concatMap ( $env ) tmp
Step back from the function signature again , and think of it one type at a time and we get an additional abstraction .
Instead of ( [ Env -> String ] , Env ) ->
String .
we can view it as [ Env -> String ] -> ( Env -> String ) .
But our code does n’t really represent this , as it explicitly asks for the env parameter .
But then again , we could rewrite it as render tmp = \env -> concatMap ( $env ) tmp , and then pointfreeing the lambda expression we get ( tmp >>= ) . flip ( $ ) or ( concatMap tmp ) . flip ( $ ) depending if we want the in this case useless obfuscation of using the list monad .
Good enough , right ?
Well , imagine that we ’ve got our perfect - abstractionometer turned really high for some reason today .
There ’s a flip and a ( $ ) .
It looks a bit ugly .
It looks a bit obscure .
We ’ve got compression sure , but not necessarily any more clarity than when we started with .
Well , instead of starting from the imperative mindset of how we want this function to work , let ’s look at the type signature again and start thinking about what could produce what we ’re describing .
First , let ’s desugar String back to its underlying type , [ Char ] .
That gives us [ Env -> [ Char ] ] -> Env -> [ Char ] .
Now since we ’re thinking of Env and Char here as abstract atomic types , we can ask , what gives us [ a -> [ b ] ] -> a -> [ b ] ?
Well , this might be a job for the unwrapped reader monad , since the sequence operation ( Monad m = > [ m a ] -> m [ a ] ) resembles what we want .
Substitute in ( e-> ) for the m , and we get [ e -> a ] -> e -> [ a ] , which in our case becomes [ Env -> [ Char ] ] -> Env -> [ [ Char ] ] .
Almost there !
Throw in a concat and we get : ( concat . ) . sequence of type [ a -> [ b ] ] -> a -> [ b ] .
And now , not only is our code short , pointfree , and elegant , but it expresses what we wanted all along more clearly than any previous construct .
And yet .. and yet … some nagging bit of our brain says that this is n’t a compound operation , but an elementary one , for a proper algebra .
The only question is what that algebra is .
Enter monoids .
The Data .
Monoid library is n’t extensively documented , but the types almost explain themselves .
A monoid is about the simplest algebraic structure that one can imagine .
In category theory , a monoid can be viewed as a category with one object .
Ok yeah , but what is it ?
A monoid is a set of elements , an associative binary operator between them , and an identity element .
So , you might have a monoid ( Integers , +,0 ) because + is associative between all integers , and X + 0 = X . Integers also give rise to another monoid : ( Integers , * , 1 ) .
And indeed the Sum and Product monoids are both defined in Data .
Monoid .
We also get other simple ones for booleans .
And , of course , we get , for all a , ( [ a ] , ++ , [ ] ) .
In fact , the list monoid is also known as the free monoid , essentially because , as best I ( sorta ) understand it , it comes without any constraints .
I.e. if for the integers we have [ 1,4,2,3 ] we have “ 1423 ” ( from the monoid on integers derived by turning them to strings and appending them ) and we have 24 from the product monoid and we have 10 from the sum monoid and etc .
Thus , the free monoid keeps all information that goes into it , and therefore , so to speak freely arises ( without constraints ) for any set of objects .
What does all this get us ?
Well , it gets us generality , especially when we throw higher - order functions back in the mix .
In particular , we can now notice that Data .
Monoid gives us , for instance the monoid of endomorphisms .
So we can conceptually “ add ” ( or rather , mappend ) , for example , a whole set of functions of type “ String -> String ” into one big “ String -> String ” function .
Well , that looks helpful , but it ’s not exactly what we want .
There is , however , an even cooler Monoid :
The reader monoid .
Monoid b => Monoid ( a -> b ) .
Conceptually , there ’s only one way its mappend function can work : feed the value a into two functions , yielding two bs .
Now , given that these bs are , by definition , Monoids as well , we mappend their results .
Along with mappend , which is the associative element , we of course got mconcat for free , which is defined by default as foldr mappend mempty , and as such is the obvious generalization of concat .
So now we can look at the type of mconcat specialized to the reader monoid : Monoid b => [ a -> b ] -> a -> b .
And that , ladies and gentlemen , is what we ’ve been looking for all along .
( concat . ) .
sequence becomes simply mconcat !
Without a lick of coding on our part .
Oh yeah , here ’s the icing : we get an even more general type signature .
The function as we initially defined it worked for Strings , and by extension , other lists .
But it did n’t work for values of , for example , type ShowS ( i.e. String ->
String , which is a common hack to avoid stack issues with concatenation by encoding strings as functions ) .
But look !
Even if ShowS is n’t a list , it is , after all , an endomorphism !
And we know by our discussion above endomorphisms are monoids too .
And you know what else is a monoid ?
Oh yeah , a bytestring !
And soforth .
I eventually took this idea even further in the HStringTemplate library , and also found another nice use of monoids that I ’ll blog about later .
The lesson I got out of this though : sometimes , it turns out the simplest abstractions are the most powerful .
Well folks , it appears congress is about to fail us once again .
Word on the street has it they are going to offer up a $ 300 rebate check for you to stimulate the economy .
Hurry up and fill up your gas tank before the price of gas goes up , and they give more of the money they stole from you to the big oil companies so they can raise the price of gas .
I mean dont spend it all in one place .
Oh wait , for the truckers out there that wont even fill your tank will it , Hmmm .
Now I am sure you are asking your self who the he** are these people working for , well you guess it , there not , we are working for them .
I personally e-mailed Nancy Pellosi a plan I thought was a good start but she must not read e-mail .
I am finding it extremely hard to write this because I want to be very sarcastic about the package they are about to announce this morning , but since I dint have anything nice to say , I wont say anything at all .
It appears that our congress no longer adheres to the constitution .
Well any way this plan it appears , will not only not stimulate the economy , it 's not going to help create jobs , its not going to help the market place , but put your money where your mouth is because you can bet on who it is going to help , and its not us .
In case you are interested in what the plan I e-mail to her was , here it is word for word .
First , put money in the hands of the poor people by stop collecting there FED tax from their paychecks .
this will put money in their hands that they will spend , and keep spending all year round .
That , combine with their tax return will give a great stimulation , which will also start almost immediate job growth .
Second ,
Let the market correct itself , no bailouts , they got us into this mess they can get themselves out .
Otherwise you can expect a new rendition of 1929 .
Third , give a tax break to smaller corporations , the large ones do n't need it , and the ones that do , are the ones that got us here , just as they did in 1929 .
Prosecute the ones who got us here .
A bail out with tax checks , is not a good idea because it will force to fed to create more money that weakens the dollar increases the Federal Debt , on top of that is it will come to little , to late .
Last but not least , another half a point rate cut , but only if the fed is going to stop printing money for now .
If they do n't stop printing money they are just putting a band - aid on a bleeding wound , and sooner than later that band - aid will need to be changed to stop the bleeding .
If they do stop it will give value back to the dollar .
I am not going to say my plan is great by any means but I think it is a good start that will put money in the hands or the people that need it now , like home owners that are losing there homes , and it will start immediate job growth .
If there is not a better time then now to stand up for our rights , then there will be no better time .
The plan to execute the NAU is for 2010 .
So do your self a favor this year , find canidates that will work for you , and not the administration , dump the ones that dont , and when your picking out you canidate , ask him or her if they are willing to fight for the constitution .
Remember WE THE PEOPLE own this country , not the Corporation of the united states .
Last but not least , Repulicans and Democrats are only names we have given people to seperate them from their views .
It 's not whether they are democrat or republican its whether or not they truly believe in the constitution , calling them democrats an republicans just gives them and us something to fight over , and now more than ever is not the time for that , it 's time we all join hands as AMERICANS , and show them the power is the hands of the people , not the government .

Alongside the MacBook Pro update today , Apple has beefed up the internals of the MacBook .
Now available with Intel Core2 Duo chips clocked at 2.1 and 2.4 Ghz , the new MacBooks also sport larger hard drives ( 120 GB and 160GB ) and the 2.4GHz models come with 2GB RAM as standard .
These differences make the $ 200 between the two white MacBooks seem a lot smaller .
If you want a black one , though , you 'll still be paying a premium for the color .
At $ 1500 , the BlackBook is $ 200 more than the high - end white model .
For that cash you 'll get nothing more than a bigger , 250 GB hard drive .

Officials fear Leeds magistrates court could have allowed suspected criminals to walk free by failing to issue warrants for their arrest when they did not show up in court .
As a result , it is alleged , many of the cases were simply written off .
Today , Straw announced an investigation by the chief inspector of courts administration in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service .
In a written statement , he said : " The investigations will verify the number of cases involved , the breakdown of offences and the position regarding the police national computer .
" We have started investigating the national process and practice for withdrawing warrants , involving courts , the police and the Crown Prosecution Service .
" This has identified differing practices across magistrates courts which will require further local investigation and may require us to clarify the procedures .
The issue over the withdrawal of warrants , which was reported to ministers last week , is of particular concern . "
Opposition MPs fear similar failures involving arrest warrants may mean that other courts across the UK have also allowed offenders to go free .
Greg Mulholland , the Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds , said : " This is an appalling example of systematic , institutional incompetence .
" An urgent and thorough investigation is needed to unearth how long this has been known about , who knew , and whether we have been given a true and complete picture of this fiasco . "
The news came as yet another blow to an increasingly beleaguered government still reeling from a series of continuing scandals .
This week , further revelations concerning party donations have rocked Gordon Brown 's self - styled " open and trustworthy " administration .
The alleged court blunders came to light following a national review of " the effectiveness of processes " for the 2.2 million cases dealt with in UK magistrate courts each year .
Researchers then identified " further problems " with arrest warrants agreed by Leeds magistrates dating back to 2003 .
Leeds magistrates court today refused to comment on the allegations , referring all enquiries to the Ministry of Justice .
A spokeswoman from the Ministry of Justice said an inquiry into the affair " was ongoing " .
Military Brief in DC v. Heller :
A group of retired military officers , mostly Generals or Admirals , has filed an amicus brief in District of Columbia v. Heller .
Part I of the brief looks at framing of the Second Amendment , and importance of federal control of the militia for national defense .
The brief argues that DC 's theory allows the states ( including DC acting in a state - type role ) to destroy the effectiveness of the militia by preventing citizens from having arms .
The brief suggests that DC 's argument is contrary to the constitutional plan for federal militia supremacy .
Part II argues that the widespread citizen gun ownership is essential to the national defense , because soldiers who have prior experience with gun use as civilians make much better marksmen .
Because handguns are common in military use , handgun experience is highly relevant .
This is similar to the police training argument that I made , on behalf of law enforcement firearms training associations , in my own brief , although the military argument is much more extensive .
Finally , the brief explains how citizens , even those not serving in the standing army , contribute to the national defense .
Examples are the American Revolution , the Battle of New Orleans , and the defense of Alaska and Hawaii after Pearl Harbor .
There is also a good discussion of Switzerland during WWII .
The Appendix includes letters to the National Rifle Association by Presidents Roosevelt , Truman , Eisenhower , and Kennedy , and by several FDR officials , thanking the NRA for its role in promoting civilian marksmanship as a means of aiding national security .
No brief filed by Petitioner or its amici addresses these issues .
Below the fold : Maryland Governor Herbert O'Connor 's March 10 , 1942 radio address , asking for volunteers from , inter alia , the " membership rolls of Rifle Clubs , Trap Shooting Associations , Skeet Clubs and sportsmen 's groups of every type " to help defend Maryland against potential German incursions , such as saboteurs .
" [ T ] he volunteers , for the most part , will be expected to furnish their own weapons .... The Maryland Minute Men , armed with weapons with which they are thoroughly familiar from long use , operating in a community in which they are accustomed to every road and trail and stream , and aroused to fighting pitch by the knowledge that they are serving to protect their own homes , their family and all that they hold dear in life , will prove a staunch defense against any enemy activity . "
Archives of Maryland Online , Volume 409 , Page 616State Papers and Addresses of Governor Herbert L. O'ConorMARYLAND MINUTE MENRADIO STATION WFBR AND MARYLAND COVERAGE NETWORKMarch 10 , 1942 BaltimoreTHE sincere hope of every person in Maryland is that our State may never experience invasion or attack .
That we should consider such a thing as possible is in itself a terrible shock to the American state of mind .
Nevertheless , with so much of the world overrun by the enemies of Democracy , and with the invasion of Java and New Guinea as well as other points in the Australian Archipelago fresh in our minds , we would be foolish , indeed , not to be prepared , as completely as possible , for any such happening , even here in Maryland .
Our people did n't want this war and , prior to the dastardly and cowardly attack on Pearl Harbor , the thought of sending American troops to fight in far - away lands was abhorrent to the minds of every American .
Recent developments of the most threatening nature , however , have completely changed America 's attitude toward the present conflict .
The unexpected and continuing success of the Japanese forces , who have swept everything before them except General MacArthur 's heroic band in the Philippines , have impressed on our minds most forcibly that new tactics are demanded .
That is why , in the recent past , there has become evident a tremendous demand on the part of Americans everywhere , that our leaders forsake a defensive policy and pursue this war in typical American fashion by carrying the offensive to the enemy at every possible point .
But this plan , if adopted , will make necessary additional protective forces in the states of our Country , particularly those like Maryland , situated along the coastlines .
It is about this matter of necessity that I desire to speak to the people of Maryland tonight .
Let us review briefly the various steps , and then consider why and to what extent Maryland confronted with danger and what we must do at once to protect our citizens .
The Federal Government faces the tremendous task of training the largest military and naval establishment in our Nation 's history .
After the hundreds of thousands , and even millions , of our men are trained and equipped , they must be transported , far and wide , over the seven seas to overcome the enemy outside continental United States .
Every available man in the combat forces will be needed in this far - flung offensive .
This means that if any number of soldiers , trained for military operations , would be retained within the United States for guard duty , or for any other routine defense purpose , that would entail a loss to our Country 's striking power .
The Federal Government , of course , is the one which assumes the responsibility for the conduct of war .
But the State Government has its obligation , also , to its citizens .
That obligation includes protection to our people .
It was for this reason that more than a year ago I asked the Maryland General Assembly to authorize the creation of the State Guard , the primary purpose of which was to have a mobile protective force ready to move in any direction to maintain the safety and security of our people and their property .
It is with pleasure that I can report to our people that the State Guard is completely drilling .
The State Guard numbers approximately 2 , 700 officers and men .
Supplementing it is a Special Military Police Force , the members of which are on continuous duty and assigned exclusively to the guarding of our State 's bridges , important water supplies , and other vital points , described by the War Department as having important bearing on the war effort .
The number of this force is approximately 300 .
To the credit of the members of our present Guard , it can be said that they have responded to every requirement since our Nation entered the war , despite unexpected difficulties under which they have at times been required to perform their duties .
The public will understand that up until now the State 's defensive efforts have consisted mainly in protecting those installations and locations which the War Department consider as vitally important .
Now , however , a greater possible danger must be faced by our people .
Situated as we are and exposed as our State is , we must be prepared for the worst .
Since the outbreak of hostilities at Pearl Harbor , I have been in touch , at regular intervals , with United States officials who have imparted information revealing the danger that besets us .
I owe it to the people of the State to report that we are in jeopardy , and that we must be prepared for trouble both from without and from within our State .
Only today , for instance , have I been advised by the Commanding General of the First Army , in New York , that the presence and increasing activity of enemy submarines off the Maryland Coast require additional drastic measures .
With the prospect that the regular Army units will be engaged in more important operations elsewhere , and with our State Guard and Military Police assigned to particular functions , it is felt absolutely necessary to have an additional protective force - : as a home guard - for the protection of our various communities .
Competent military officers , one of whom , our capable and experienced Major General Milton A. Reckord , will speak to you in a few minutes , advise that there is need of this further , wide - spread , alert defense organization to cope with and to be available instantly for any sudden attack by parachute troops , by forces landed from the sea by enemy sympathizers within our State .
I propose to meet this need by the organization in every part of the State of a Reserve Militia .
The completed plan has just been approved by General Reckord , as Commander of the Third Army Corps .
It offers the opportunity for every able - bodied man to assist in protecting his home and his community against enemy activities .
The militia will be organized under our State Law , and the men who enlist at this time of our grave emergency will be known as the " Maryland Minute Men .
"
The mission of the Maryland Minute Men is to furnish immediately , local protection against parachute troops , saboteurs , or organized raiding parties .
It is planned that the units be confined to their own communities so that there will be assurance at all times that every residential section of Maryland will have protection .
No prescribed complete uniform will be required .
Distinctive arm bands and caps or other items may be furnished by the State , the County , or by the men themselves .
For the present the hard - pressed Ordinance Department of the United States Army cannot be expected to furnish sufficient arms , ammunition , or equipment .
Hence , the volunteers , for the most part , will be expected to furnish their own weapons .
For this reason , gunners ( of whom there are 60 , 000 licensed in Maryland ) , members of Rod and Gun Clubs , of Trap Shooting and similar organizations , will be expected to constitute a part of this new military organization .
Officers will be drawn from the immediate area in which they are to serve .
As Army officers have pointed out to me , the familiarity of the members with their particular locality , with the terrain and road not in the respective communities , will be of great value in resisting any hostile efforts against residential areas and important public necessities .
No intensive training program will be adopted .
While sufficient preparatory work must be undertaken by the Minute Men , care will be taken to avoid unnecessary demands upon their time .
No guard duty is to be included as a regular part of the program for the new force .
Retired officers of the regular Army , Marine Corps or State Guard will be sought to supervise the training .
The program will embrace basic field training and basic small arms instruction .
The field training will include the study of terrain from the military viewpoint , establishment and maintenance of communications , practice assemblies in daylight and in dark , and other courses .
Arms instructions will cover teaching how to load and unload weapons , examination of weapons as to working order ; effective firing positions , special instructions in sighting and aiming , rapid firing technique , and other duties .
Military officials , in emphasizing the value of such an organization point out that the familiarity which the members will enjoy with the faces , customs and habits of their neighbors in the community , makes them most valuable in combating sabotage efforts .
They will detect , even more quickly than a secret service man from the outside , any strange faces in the community , or any unusual activities on the part of local inhabitants .
The Maryland Minute Men , armed with weapons with which they are thoroughly familiar from long use , operating in a community in which they are accustomed to every road and trail and stream , and aroused to fighting pitch by the knowledge that they are serving to protect their own homes , their family and all that they hold dear in life , will prove a staunch defense against any enemy activity .
Through conferences among the Military , Naval , State Guard and Minute Men officials , operation plans for each area will be carefully prepared , I am assured by the Third Corps Headquarters .
Surveys will be made to determine the importance of facilities and installations which might be subjected to sabotage and raids ; the availability of Military and Naval police and State Guard forces ; and the quality and type of communications which are available for notification for additional protective forces when necessary .
Based on these surveys , definite missions will be assigned each of the organizations concerned ; and the proper liaison will be arranged .
All available firearms will be reported and those individuals to be armed with rifles will be assigned to tasks where the long - range and accurate fire of rifles will be necessarily employed .
Those to be armed with shot guns will be assigned tasks where the short range , spreading fire of shot guns will be most effective .
As I attempted to outline before , no unnecessary discipline and training will be required .
However , as this is serious business there will be exacted from all members obedience to orders , sobriety , and self - sacrifice .
Military advisors suggest that time need not be spent on close - order or other military drill .
It is not intended that this be a parade organization .
But officers and men must be willing to cooperate and to devote time and work to meet any local situation .
I should also point out another cardinal rule of the new organization .
We all know that an enemy raiding party does not stop to give considerations to a victim 's social background , or to his political affiliation , or to class distinction .
Therefore , I give assurance that such considerations will completely absent from the organization , training and discipline of the Maryland Minute Men from top to bottom .
I now issue a call for volunteers to serve as Maryland Minute Men .
Arrangements have been made to accept enlistments at once .
State headquarters for the new organization will be the Office of the Adjutant General of Maryland , Fifth Regiment Armory , Baltimore .
However , persons can make known their readiness to serve at any of the State Armories , one of which is located in all the counties of Maryland except five .
In these five counties ; where no armories exists , namely , Garrett , Howard , St. Mary's , Calvert and Charles Counties , other headquarters will be established , the location of which will be made known through the local press .
Already arrangements are made to receive group enlistments from the membership rolls of Rifle Clubs , Trap Shooting Associations , Skeet Clubs and sportsmen 's groups of every type .
The number of units to be formed in different sections of the State will depend upon the size and population of the area and also upon the important public facilities and military objectives , which are designated by the War Department in different sections of our State .
I wish to repeat that in every move , with respect to this organization , the advice and direction of Army officials will be sought , as has been the practice in connection with the organization and functioning of the Maryland State Guard .
And so , my fellow - Marylanders , I ask your support and assistance in this new undertaking which will be maintained at a minimum of expense .
It will however , represent a maximum of protection by civilian soldiers , whose first duty it will be to stand in defense of their home , in protection of plants and facilities which are essential to life .
To these men , many of whom will be veterans of the last war , who incidentally may have " chafed at the bit " when they have observed their sons and younger men marching away recently to the Country 's defense , let me say that here is an opportunity that will make them truly an important part of the public defense forces .
Here is a function of military organizations to which they can address themselves with enthusiasm , because it will be of utmost importance and will thereby release a number of regular Army forces for combat service abroad .
Inconvenient , yes ; overtime work , yes .
But let us remember that hardships and privations are now being suffered for us by General MacArthur and his valiant men in Bataan .
Those who do not leave United States as a part of the armed forces to avenge the wrong done to Americans and to the United States flag abroad , will be untrue to these American boys if we do not protect their homes and their communities while they are away fighting for us .
Let us preserve the communities and their firesides , so that there will be a familiar place to which they will be welcomed on their return after victory has , been won .
The flower of America 's young manhood now being sent to distant parts of the world will face the period of hardship and discouragement .
But like the Crusaders of old , they are privileged to fare forth to free a land of civilization from the Barbarians .
America 's Crusade today is to wipe the scourge of slavery from a world of Hitler and the Japanese war lords , and to establish once and for all time the freedom of man and his dignity as an individual , and this should awaken a responsive chord in every heart .
No , we did n't want this war .
We went to all lengths to avoid it .
And in so doing we laid ourselves open to just the very reverses that lack of preparedness has occasioned .
Now that we are in this war , however , now that we know how necessary it is to fight as we have never fought before , not only to defend our Democracy , our own freedom , but to bring back freedom to all the enslaved people of the earth , we know America shall not fail .
Maryland today , as in every other crisis in our Nation 's history , pledges itself to stop short of nothing to preserve American ideals and American privileges for generations to come .
A full - time medical test subject , Nick F. has earned $ 80,000 participating in some two dozen studies .
Photograph by Michael Lewis
Every year , millions of volunteers participate in clinical trials in return for quick cash .
A few turn pro. Welcome to the guinea pig underground .
Nick F. was driving a delivery truck in Milwaukee when his life hit a rough patch .
He was living in a converted barn and putting every spare penny into paying off a $ 12,000 debt he had accrued in college .
The future looked bleak .
So , for a change of scenery , he moved to Richmond , Virginia , where an acquaintance told him there was money to be made as a test subject in medical studies .
Feeling desperate , he applied to join a drug trial in Baltimore .
The promise : $ 6,500 for four 12 - day stints of blood draws , echo cardiograms , and physical checkups .
That was three years ago .
Since then , Nick , 36 , has become a full - time guinea pig .
He has participated in some two dozen studies , shuttling between test labs in Baltimore ; Boston ; Fargo , North Dakota ; and Trenton , New Jersey .
He has earned a total of $ 80,000 swigging chemically enhanced sport shakes , popping pills laced with radioactive carbon 14 , submitting to 36 blood draws over a four - day stretch , and pooping in a box .
" I used to practically faint at the sight of a needle , " he says .
" Now I give the phlebotomist pointers like , ' My veins roll , so make sure you hold them still . ' "
Nick is part of a growing subculture of human lab rats .
Each year , US scientists require a total of at least 10 million healthy test subjects , says Adil Shamoo , chair of Circare , a human research watchdog organization .
Depending on duration , rigor , and risk , medical studies can pay as much as $ 10,000 each .
The work is n't demanding , but it can be dangerous .
In March 2006 , eight male volunteers checked into London 's Northwick Park Hospital for a weeklong study of TGN1412 , an experimental treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and leukemia to be manufactured by Boehringer - Ingelheim .
Within minutes of receiving the first dose , six of them began to writhe in pain , vomit , and lose consciousness , according to news reports .
Nurses rushed them to the hospital 's trauma unit , where doctors treated them for multiple organ failure .
The test subjects lived , but all suffered permanent damage to their immune systems and internal organs .
One lost fingers and toes .
Another developed signs of cancer possibly triggered by the drug .
Given the risks , most test subjects go in for a one - time score to pay off a debt or finance a vacation .
Some stay on the testing circuit for a few months after college or between jobs , until they find a career path .
For a few , though , clinical trials are a career path .
These individuals endure uncomfortable side effects , lackluster food , and endless poking and prodding in return for a flexible work schedule and minimal responsibility .
With diligence , luck , and a willingness to fudge their age and other details to match researchers ' requirements , professional guinea pigs can earn $ 50,000 a year or more .
Nick requested anonymity because researchers are wary of serial test subjects — compounds from past experiments lingering in the blood could compromise their results .
" To really make a living at this , you need four things , " he says .
" A laptop with a Net connection to find studies , a cell phone to call other clinics while you 're doing a study , a credit card to book the travel , and an ATM card with a major national bank to deposit your money as soon as you get out . "
During a particularly busy four - day stretch in 2004 , Nick covered more than 2,000 miles , going from Milwaukee to Trenton to apply for a trial at Bristol - Meyers Squibb , to Waukegan , Illinois , for another screening at Abbott Labs , and then , having passed the test at Bristol - Meyers , back to Trenton for more lab work .
Guys like Nick — smart , organized , restless — are typical of a new wave of guinea pigs .
" Back in the day , the world of the lab rat was grifters , losers , and hustlers , " Nick says .
" But even in the three years since I started , it has become more socially acceptable .
We 're in a culture that 's a little more devil - may - care , a little foolhardy . "
And , hey , if you can't make a living behind the wheel , why not try your luck at the other end of an IV ?
Ex-union organizer Robert Helms created the zine Guinea Pig Zero and incited fellow lab rats to demand more compensation during a Merck drug trial .
Photograph by Michael Lewis __Eager to experience __the guinea pig life firsthand , I decide to enroll in a study near my home in San Francisco .
I start by searching GPGP.
net , a site that lists upcoming studies in the US , Canada , and Europe .
( The name stands for Guinea Pigs Get Paid . )
Then I stop by BioTrax for online information about the screening process .
I learn that signing the required consent form could mean I have to sue to collect additional compensation should something go horribly wrong .
However , it would n't obligate me to complete a study .
I could forgo part of the fee and withdraw at any time .
I 'm thrilled to come across a notice on craigslist looking for subjects to demonstrate the impact of the club drug GHB on driving ability ; I imagine myself going to raves and then speeding home , a clinician riding shotgun .
But the trial is over subscribed .
So I settle for a study observing the effects of Stone Age nutrition — the so - called Paleolithic diet — on modern - day Americans of average physical condition .
The pay is commensurate with the risk : $ 200 plus free food for three weeks .
Not long afterward , I find myself marching on a steeply inclined treadmill at the UC San Francisco hospital .
A blood - tapping device called a heparin lock protrudes from a vein in my arm , and electrodes are attached to 10 freshly shaved spots on my chest .
I huff and puff into a gas mask - like apparatus .
Four tubes extend from the mouthpiece , one of which pumps a mixture of acetylene , helium , oxygen , and nitrogen into my lungs .
Every two minutes , the study 's head researcher drains a few drops of my blood .
After 15 minutes , I 'm drenched in sweat and gasping for breath .
The exercise physiologist takes a reading .
She turns to me with a smile and declares : " Good news !
You 're unfit enough to be in this study ! "
Few test subjects have as much experience as Scott , who , like Nick , requested anonymity to protect his earning power .
A 10 - year veteran , he has participated in more than 60 studies .
Among the highlights : testing a cream designed to numb the penis and spending a week gloriously high on morphine pills .
When he's not crisscrossing the country in pursuit of a paycheck , he lives near Miami in a two - bedroom , two - bathroom home .
In his spare time — and he has a lot of it — he works on his four - car fleet : a Buick Electra , a Pontiac Fiero GT , a Honda Civic , and the crown jewel , a Lambor ghini Countache ( sans engine ) .
He enjoys scuba diving in the Florida Keys and makes sure his schedule is clear during the nation 's biggest parties : Mardi Gras in New Orleans , Fantasy Fest in Key West , and occasionally Burning Man in Nevada .
Scott is philosophical about the risk of a TGN1412 - style disaster .
" I 've worked in construction and hit my thumb with a framing hammer , " he says .
" I 've worked as an electrician and seen guys get electrocuted .
Being a lab rat is the only work situation where you 've got around - the - clock medical attention .
It 's the safest job I 've ever been in . "
Finding the next gig is a constant priority .
Scott brings his laptop to work and , taking care not to tangle its power cord with the IV tubes dripping experimental meds into his bloodstream , he spends his inpatient hours scouring the Web for trial notices , air fares , and car rentals .
He checks out opportunities suggested by fellow test subjects and research recruiters he has gotten to know over the years .
He tries to stay away from tests involving radioactive tracers , extensive x-rays , catheters , or tubes in his airways — unless the price is right .
When he finds a study worth traveling for , he secures a pre- and post - trial place to stay through the bedroom co-op CouchSurfing.com , a popular site for lining up free lodging .
Scott , 47 , wo n't reveal his income , but a lab - rat colleague estimates he pulls down $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 annually .
That 's little better than a Starbucks barista , but doctor visits are thrown in and the vacation policy is quite liberal .
One of his biggest single scores : $ 9,000 for a three - week study of an asthma medication .
He earned every penny .
" I had a tube going up my nose , down my throat , and into my lung , " he says .
" It 's hard to have a tube in your lung for 24 hours a day . "
Scott prepares for screening sessions , where researchers determine his fitness for a particular study , the way an athlete gets ready for a big game .
In the week leading up to the event , he abstains from alcohol , drugs , and poppy seed bagels ( the seeds show up as an opiate in blood tests ) , as well as salt and saturated fats .
He cuts calories until his weight falls to within 10 percent of ideal , but he does n't exercise — that leaves enzymes in the blood that could disqualify him .
And while researchers typically require subjects to wait 30 , 60 , or 90 days between studies , Scott makes it a point to find out how fast the substance being tested breaks down so he can calculate exactly when his blood will be clean enough for his next engagement .
Until then , though , it 's off to California 's Lake Tahoe for a few days on the ski slopes .
__My own stint __as a lab rat gets off to a rocky start .
At the UCSF hospital , a twentysomething research nurse wearing black - framed cat - eye glasses and a lab coat introduces herself and tells me to sit in an armchair and roll up my sleeve .
Unwrapping a hypodermic needle , Christina asks if I tend to black out easily .
I 'm not a huge fan of needles , I reply , but I 've never passed out while having blood drawn .
" That 's good , " she says breezily , " because there are a lot of blood draws in your study . "
She presses the needle into my left inner forearm just below the elbow .
I grimace at the pinch .
A mild prickling sensation runs across my scalp .
" That 's funny , " Christina says .
" I got a great initial spurt , and then your vein just sort of closed up . "
She tries my right arm , and I can tell by the satisfied noise escaping her lips that she hit the mother lode .
I make the mistake of looking ; crimson fluid wells into the collection vial .
The room tilts , and I mumble something about going down .
The next thing I know , the study 's principal investigator , Lynda Frassetto , is peering at me with a concerned look .
I apologize for passing out .
" You did n't pass out , you just got a little woozy , " she assures me .
" Now that we 've got the IV in " — I glance over and , sure enough , a tube protrudes from my arm — " that 's it for needles today .
Do you think you 're feeling up to some exercise ? "
__Guinea pigging tends __to be a lonely occupation .
The inpatient tests favored by professionals — " somewhere between prison and sleepaway camp , " as Nick puts it — create bonds of shared hardship , but those relationships rarely outlive the experience .
It took Robert Helms to bring the community together .
A house painter and armchair historian with a special interest in anarchism , Helms was working as a union organizer in Philadelphia during the early 1990s when friends in the local anarchist scene started earning extra cash by renting their bodies to universities and drug companies .
He signed up for a couple of studies and eventually concluded that , with a few thrifty lifestyle choices , he could shift to the slow lane of the rat race .
Which is not to say that he quit organizing .
An inveterate rabble - rouser , Helms considered what it would take to unionize the other test subjects at his first few trials .
But he realized that the community was much too fragmented .
To build solidarity , he started a news letter .
In 1996 , with help from a friend who worked at Kinko's and ran off free copies after hours , he launched Guinea Pig Zero , a zine inspired by the amateur workplace tell - alls Temp Slave ! and Dishwasher .
GPZ featured first - person horror stories of clinical trials gone wrong , histori cal accounts of early human experiments , and tips on where easy money and gentle research nurses could be found .
Cartoon guinea pigs decorated the pages — munching pills , manning machine guns , and declaring , " Work is for saps . "
Letters and subscription requests trickled in from hundreds of volunteer test subjects across the US .
Doctors and medical libraries signed on .
Booksellers as far away as Paris and London requested copies to sell on consignment .
Helms continued to publish GPZ until 2000 and kept guinea pigging for three more years .
At that point , he turned 46 — a year older than the cutoff age for many clinical trials — and retired from active duty .
He played the role of labor leader right to the end .
During one of his last trials , he incited his fellow lab rats to flex their collective muscle against Merck , which was investigating the effects of an antianxiety drug .
" The guys were n't allowed to drink during the Christmas holidays , " he says .
" Also , it involved a lot of fecal collection .
Then Merck tried to hurry the study into a smaller period of time . "
Helms drew up a petition listing the ways in which the trial had deviated from its description on the consent form .
The lab rats hinted that the entire group would walk out unless Merck paid each subject $ 1,500 more than the $ 3,200 originally agreed upon .
He passed the document around for signatures , taking care to put his own name in the middle of the list to avoid being pegged as a troublemaker .
The gambit worked .
" At the eleventh hour , " he says , " they gave us an $ 800 raise . "
__I keep Helms ' victory __in mind as I suffer the indignities of research into Paleolithic gastronomy .
The study 's prehistoric regimen is sort of like Super Size Me in reverse : a bland , unvarying menu of grain - free , virtually dairy - free , unprocessed food for 17 days .
Each morning , I drop by the hospital for a breakfast of broiled pork loin and pineapple .
Afterward , a staffer drags out a cooler on wheels , packed with five more Paleolithic meals , to be hauled around and eaten by the end of the day .
I subsist on carrot juice , tomato juice , whole tomatoes , large lettuce leaves , shredded tuna , more lettuce , chicken and broccoli , and parsnips .
No salt .
But the food is n't the worst of it .
The study demands several days of frequent blood draws and around - the - clock urine collection .
During those times , I carry a 1 - gallon plastic container of pee with me everywhere I go .
On the third day of testing , I 'm seated in a waiting room watching blood seep through a band - aid from a puncture in the back of my hand .
The wound is the result of the latest of five consecutive unsuccessful attempts to draw a vial of oxygen - rich arterial blood . ** I decide to quit the study .
I can't endure any more needles .
Frassetto , the principal investigator , enters the room .
" Something terrible has happened , " she sighs .
My pulse quickens .
Contaminated syringes ?
Parasites in my blood ?
No , her calamity turns out to be my good fortune .
Federal approval for the research has expired , and Frassetto needs to reapply .
The study will stop immediately and resume when approval comes through — a reprieve of three weeks .
I use the time to catch up on my reading .
In a Guinea Pig Zero anthology published in 2002 by Garrett County Press , I come across a glowing account of a drug trial , written by a female lab rat who happily describes her experiences with needles .
For some reason this helps , and a few weeks later I return to the study determined to regard the blood draws not as an imposition but as part of a process I have undertaken willingly — simply part of the job .
I come up with a phrase that I use to steel myself before every session : " Let 's get that blood out ! "
It works .
The nurses have much more success keeping my veins open , and I stop feeling faint .
Ten days into the resurrected study , on day five of the diet itself , I 'm seated in a conference room sipping my once - daily cup of coffee and watching SportsCenter .
For the 10th morning in a row , I 've left my wife at home to feed , change , and dress our infant son and get herself off to work .
And it hits me :
The stress and strain of life has fallen away .
It 's peaceful here , away from the hustle - bustle of home and work .
This is guinea pig life at its finest .
Toward the end of the trial , I show up early for work .
There 's a lot to do : the usual blood draws , a rerun of the treadmill test , an ultrasound of my blood vessels , and , finally , a body composition test .
The diet has been a ringing success in personal terms .
I 've lost 15 pounds ( officially 6 , but I sneaked extra clothes onto the scale to avoid having to lug around the growing portions of pork and pineapple they heaped on my plate as my weight fell ) , my cholesterol has dropped by 72 points , and my blood pressure is significantly lower .
The final session is uneventful , just one last pork - and - pineapple breakfast in front of the TV for old times ' sake .
There 's no exit interview , no farewell party .
Frassetto hands me my $ 200 .
I sign my name in the clinic 's logbook .
Christina barely glances up from her desk as I say good - bye .
I stuff the money in my pocket and step out into the street .
Contributing editor Josh McHugh ( www.joshmchugh.net) wrote about prosthetic legs in issue 15.03 .
* Correction , Thurs May 10 12:00:00 EST 2007
The wound on McHugh 's hand was not caused by multiple failed blood - draw attempts by the UCSF clinical nurse named Christina , as originally reported ; it was the result of other nurses ' attempts .

AUSTRALIAN scientists have made a biofuels breakthrough , turning waste products like paper and wood trimmings , crop residue and garden clippings into a stable " bio-crude " .
If successfully commercialised , the process could massively reduce the amount of waste going into landfills and help the biofuels industry steer clear of the controversial food versus fuel debate .
Most of the world 's biofuel is made from food crops such as corn and sugar .
Many oppose biofuels because they believe they will lead to higher food prices and hunger among the poor .
The great hope is second - generation technology that enables fuel to be made from waste material like the stalks and leaves of food crops .

Decency Manual Now Available !
Buy the book and be as decent as Sarah Palin , the next Vice President of the Homeland !!
The Department of Homeland Decency Decency Rules and Regulations Manual Barnes and Noble , Borders , Powells ,
Now available at decent book stores in decent neighborhoods everywhere , as well as at Amazon , Majers and Quinn , and Three Rivers Press .
Five reasons the Department of Homeland Decency supports Sarah 1 .
At last : the Patriotic Feminist !
The old types of feminists were wordy , intellectual , hairy and hated men , not to mention plain looking and frumpy or worse .
But Patriotic Feminists like Sarah hunt moose , and can field dress it , butcher it , carry it home , clean house , set the table , put on makeup , shave their legs , and cook all those moose steaks so dinner is ready by the time her husband and children sit down to dinner .
That 's Patriotic Feminism and it empowers women everywhere .
Patriotic Feminism is decent and wholesome and can be taught to all the next generations of Homelanders !
2 . She is married to a man from the rugged frontier of Alaska who understands hard work and real values .
He 's not going to waste time getting in touch with his feelings or trying to be sensitive .
He 'll just go out and get things done .
And when she needs help , he 'll be there to help .
Because that 's what decent Homeland men do : help out and make sure their women understand things .
And when that time of the month comes around and her hormones get a little whacky , he will be there to stabilize things .
He 's a man the Homeland can trust .
3 . She took on the powerful Library Lobby in Wasilla and did n't back down .
Librarians tend to obstruct and interfere with decency by buying books about indecent subjects written by those who live indecent lifestyles , which makes libraries very dangerous places for children .
Especially the reference Department , where a child can be exposed to âit , â experimental theater , and vegetarianism .
But Sarah took that on and risked her political future .
That 's the kind of guts the Homeland needs now .
4 . She 's not Hillary .
With Sarah in Washington , Hillary wo n't ever get near the White House again .
5 . She is a reformer .
She fought corruption and reformed everything in Alaska .
She did n't take earmarks and worked hard to bring gas and oil to everyone , which forward - thinking patriots always do .
So while everything is falling apart in the lower 48 , things are holding together in Alaska .
Only the indecent would refuse to accept this as truth !
THE DEPARTMENT'S MOTTO
" You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide .

THE DEPARTMENT'S TIP OF THE DAY " If it looks like a duck , talks like a duck , walks like a duck , does ' it ' like a duck , votes Green Party , likes Jon Stewart , buys free - range eggs , is childless by choice , and uses a push mower , it is a duck and must be reported . "

Decent news for Decent folks !
Fox wins Rapture rights !
Stock rises on news
It 's now official : God hates the liberal media .
That 's because Fox won the right to broadcast the Rapture .
In a surprise to everyone except decent folk everywhere , Fox now has exclusive rights to the Rapture , including the name , book rights , movie rights , and product tie-ins .
Other networks can't even use the word Rapture without mentioning that Fox News .
" We went after this because we know Fox is filled with decent , upright , liberal - bashing , true believers and the other networks are n't , " a FOX spokesman said .
" We want decency to return to the Homeland and to televisions everywhere .
That 's why Fox has to be the one to broadcast the Rapture .
Who wants Anderson Cooper or Keith Olbermann to broadcast it ?
Maybe a secular humanist pinko Homeland hating college professor ! "
No one at Fox has explained , however , who might want to watch a telecast of The Rapture if the world truly ends then .
Or who would want to read the books , watch the movies , or buy T - shirts and coffee cups with something like " The Rapture brought to you by Fox " written on them .
Despite that inherent contradiction , Fox executives are very upbeat , as are Fox stockholders .
Fox stock went up 50 percent on news of this upcoming telecast .
" We are proud to show this event because we expect it to surpass the combined popularity of the Super Bowl , World Series , Masters Golf Tournament , and Florida 2000 vote count , " a Fox spokesman said .
" Viewers should be extremely excited about this .
Nothing like this has ever been on TV before .
Not even The O'Reilly Factor , as important as that show is , could hope to be this big . "
Exactly when this will be on TV is uncertain .
Whether this deal is legal is another stumbling block .
Regardless of that , however , Fox wants to broadcast at least one more run of American Idol , so if The Rapture comes a little earlier than TV programming would allow , the the Rapture wo n't be shown live .
Meanwhile , recession worries continue to grow -- even among Fed officials themselves .
The problem , analysts , say , is that the rate cuts have n't encouraged banks to start lending again .
After billions of dollars of losses from subprime debt , banks are still reluctant to put money into the cash - starved economy .
As a result , doubts are growing that the Fed can do much of anything to get the economy -- and the markets -- back on solid footing .
" This particular recession may be somewhat immune to monetary stimulus , " says Barry James , president of Cincinnati - based James Advantage Funds .
" It 's almost like pushing on a string . "
Banks are essentially caught in a Catch 22 .
They 're being encouraged to tighten lending standards because of the subprime collapse , but those stricter policies are countering the effects of the Fed 's aggressive rate cuts .
Analysts acknowledge that there 's not much the Fed really can do to jump - start the economy beyond rate cuts .
Some suggest , though , that working closely with the Treasury to encourage banks to start lending again might help .
" We 're looking to the Fed for some intervention to help unlock the frozen CDO marketplace , " says Alan Rosenbaum , president of GuardHill Financial in New York , a mortgage brokerage that does not deal in subprime loans .
" Until that happens , banks are not going to lend . "
" It 's very difficult for banks to be in the lending business without access to long - term unsecured money , " says Bill Isaac , managing director at LECG in Vienna , Va .
" Bringing rates down at the short end I do n't believe would be as effective as trying to find ways to make more lending available to banks .
I do n't have the answers .
I 'm sure that would have to be worked out by the Fed and the Treasury . "
One such effort -- special auctions allowing banks to borrow money cheaply from the Fed - - has been only modestly successful so far .
Though they attracted a lot of interest when they began in December , Thursday 's auction was poorly received , with weak foreign demand sending prices on 30 - year Treasury bonds plunging .
Perhaps the only solution to the credit crunch , analysts suggest , is time and patience .

Eve Curie Labouisse dies
At the age of 102 Eve Curie Labouisse , the daughter of the Nobel Prize - winning scientist Marie Curie , has died .
She was a humanitarian and journalist who wrote a best - selling biography of her mother .
Eve Curie Labouisse dies
Labouisse died Monday in her Manhattan apartment , her stepdaughter , Anne L. Peretz , said Thursday .
Her book , " Madame Curie , " published in 1937 , chronicled the life of Labouisse 's mother from her birth in Poland and education in France to her discovery - with her husband Pierre Curie - of the radioactive elements radium and polonium .
Marie Curie was awarded two Nobel prizes : in physics , which she shared with her husband in 1903 , and in chemistry in 1911 .
The book , published three years after her mother 's death , is considered a classic among scientific biographies .
However , it has been criticized by some for leaving out an affair Curie had with a married man after the death of her husband .
The book was made into a film starring Greer Garson as Marie Curie and Walter Pidgeon as her husband .
Labouisse was a war correspondent during World War II , covering fronts in Libya , Russia , Burma ( now Myanmar ) and China .
She chronicled her wartime experience in a 1943 book , " Journal Among Warriors . "
Born in Paris , Labouisse served with the women 's division of Gen. Charles de Gaulle 's Fighting French .
She became a staunch advocate of the Free French cause after the Nazis occupied France and later was publisher of the French newspaper Paris - Press .
She came to the United States after the Vichy government revoked her French citizenship .
In the 1950s , she was a special adviser to the secretary general of NATO .
She married Henry R. Labouisse , a United Nations diplomat , in 1954 , becoming an advocate for underprivileged children around the world during her husband 's 15 - year tenure as executive director of UNICEF .
In 1935 , Labouisse 's only sibling , Irene Joliot - Curie , and her brother - in - law , Frederic Joliot , shared a Nobel Prize in chemistry .
Her sister died in 1956 of the same cause as their mother : leukemia , believed to have been caused by prolonged exposure to radioactive material .
Labouisse also was a trained concert pianist , and as a young woman performed throughout Europe .
In addition to her stepdaughter , Labouisse , a former resident of Wainscott , on Long Island , is survived by four stepgrandchildren and seven stepgreat - grandchildren .
Her husband died in 1987 .
A private graveside service is planned for Monday at the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans .
The family asked that in lieu of flowers , donations be made to the Center for Family Life in Brooklyn .
Ant researcher Deborah Gordon packs an incredible amount of science into her twenty - minute TED talk from 2003 .
Discussed : what happens when you dump toothpicks outside the colony ; the four jobs worker ants can have ; why half of the ants in the colony are just hanging out ; what happens when you stick a fiber - optic camera into the colony ; how the colony 's behavior emerges from a series of simple rules ; how colony size changes as a function of colony age ( and how you have to dig up all the ants and count them to figure this out ) .

“ So many good things have happened to me because of how unhealthy I ’ve been mentally . ”
The photo shows Judd Apatow directing his wife , Leslie Mann , on the set of “ Knocked Up , ” which he also produced and wrote .
Other credits include “ The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , ” “ Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story , ” and the acclaimed “ Freaks and Geeks ” TV series .
In an article , the prolific filmmaker admits :
“ Throughout my life I have used work as an emotional crutch .
I used to always feel inadequate in every area except my ability to work hard enough to succeed in comedy . ”
[ Judd Apatow ’s Family Values , By Stephen Rodrick , New York Times , May 27 , 2007 ]
But , he added , “ The thing about comedy is that there ’s something really great about making a room of people laugh .
But there ’s also something really sick about needing to make strangers laugh . ”
He said making “ Knocked Up ” was “ all about trying to send a valentine to my family , ” and he has eight more films in development .
“ So many good things have happened to me because of how unhealthy I ’ve been mentally , ” Apatow said .
“ It ’s unfair to [ my family ] that this thing I do that is a result of me being in pain is now going so well it ’s trying to pull me away from them . ”
Many other artists report this kind of ambivalence toward their work , while acknowledging the power of creative expression to heal or at least help encourage mental health .
Susan Borkin , in her book When Your Heart Speaks , Take Good Notes : The Healing Power of Writing , says , “ When we use writing as a tool for awareness and healing , we find the outcome , the written word , to be useful , but frequently not as useful as the process of writing itself .
“ Personal writing of this nature is intentional writing .
Its deepest intention is to heal .
Like water flowing , effortlessly finding its way around and through obstacles , the healing power of writing uses words effortlessly to to transform pain , confusion and internal chaos . ”
~~~~~
Clinical and forensic psychologist , Stephen A. Diamond , Ph.D. thinks “ Creativity is one of humankind ’s healthiest inclinations , one of our greatest attributes . ”
As he explains in his book , “ Anger , Madness , and the Daimonic : The Psychological Genesis of Violence , Evil , and Creativity , ” our impulse to be creative “ can be understood to some degree as the subjective struggle to give form , structure and constructive expression to inner and outer chaos and conflict .
“ It can also be one of the most dynamic methods of meeting and redeeming one ’s devils and demons . ”
Read more in my interview with him :
The Psychology of Creativity : redeeming our inner demons .
Using art to access and express our complex inner lives can help us be more aware and alive – and help others understand more about their own depths as well .
Psychologist James Hillman says “ Active imagination aims not at silence but at speech , not at stillness but at story or theatre or conversation .
“ It emphasizes the importance of the word , and thus the word becomes a way of ‘ relating , ’ an instrument of feeling . ”
[ From his book Healing Fiction . ]
Our “ inner chaos ” takes many forms , and has different sources and levels of impact for each of us .

Hippocrates endorsed its use and it ’s the world ’s second oldest surgical procedure following circumcision .
It ’s called trepanation and it literally means drilling a hole in your head .
And if you think it ’s a bygone practice , think again .
The practice of making a hole in the skull has been around since the Stone Age ⁠— archaeologists have found trepanned skulls dating back to 3000 B.C. Hippocrates , in his classic medical text “ On Injuries of the Head , ” endorsed trepanation for the treatment of head wounds .
During the middle ages it was thought the procedure was able to liberate demons from the heads of the possessed and , later on , “ enlightened ” Europeans did it to cure maladies ranging from meningitis to epilepsy .
An instrument called a trepan is used to make the hole .
The trepan goes into your skull and a chunk of your skull is extracted .
Eventually the skin heals over the hole and you ’re left with a small bump .
Trepans have evolved from crude sharpened stones in the Neolithic age to hand cranked augers in the dark ages to electric drills used today .
That ’s right , today in the 21st Century .
Currently there are doctors in the world who perform trepanation and will perform one on anyone 18 years or older who consents .
They even have their own organization , The International Trepanation Advocacy Group , complete with web site .
The following explanation comes from ITAC ’s site and explains the trepanation ’s rationale ;
“ Within the brain there are two fluid volumes , blood and water ( cerebrospinal fluid ) .
Blood supplies the brain cells with energy , water does not .
The ratio between the two can and does vary , but total volume remains constant .
When the skull seals at the end of growth ( Ages 8 - 21 ) the brain can no longer pulsate on the heartbeat , since expansion possibility of the brain membranes is suppressed .
The arteries and capillaries can no longer expand with each new surge of blood that comes from the heart .
Hence a certain amount of blood falls from the brain and is replaced with water .
At this point the energy and spontaneity associated with youth diminishes .
Trepanation , making a hole in the skull , restores the pulse pressure to the brain .
The arteries and capillaries can expand again , filling with an increased amout of blood and displacing the same volume of water .
A significant amount of energy , lost with adulthood , returns . ”
Trepanation is somewhat akin to the practice of blood letting .
The founder of modern trepanation is a Dutch man by the name of Dr Bart Hughes .
In 1962 he became convinced that the volume of blood in the brain controls ones degree and state of consciousness .
Dr Hughes believed humans have been robbed of a high range of consciousness because we began to walk upright , putting the heart below the brain .
This state of affairs could be corrected by standing on ones head , jumping from hot water into cold water , or taking various drugs .
He noted that when we are born , our heads are unsealed .
We have all heard of the “ soft spot ” on top of a baby ‘s head .
He became convinced that the way to gain back the state of imagination and perception that one experiences as a child was to open a hole in the now - sealed adult skull .
In 1965 , after years of experimentation , Dr. Hughes bored a hole in his skull using an electric drill , a scalpel , and a hypodermic needle ( to administer a local anesthetic ) .
This must have been the first intentional trepanation in hundreds of years .
He immediately began preaching the benefits of his new state of consciousness achieved . .
People having been trepanned report an increased ability to concentrate and stay in focus with the added benefit of feeling good all the while .
They also cite an improved ability to listen .
There is also a feeling of increased “ consciousness ” that they find difficult to describe .
Today ’s neurosurgeons are more than naturally skeptical .
Brain function decreases with age and even if it were possible , an increased blood flow ⁠ — which many scientists think is more related to brain function than blood volume⁠ — would not reverse the process occurring in an older brain .
But all neurosurgeons readily agree on one point : a hole is the starting point for all neurosurgical procedures .
Clinical trepanation is performed , for example , to evacuate hemorrhages and to relieve pressure in the cranial cavity caused by cerebral ulcers .
But , for neurosurgeons , the hole is a means to an end , and they put the bone back in place .
Additionally surgeons point out that the risks of blood clots , brain injuries from drilling too deep , and infections outweigh the unproven benefits of trepanation .
It is estimated that between 40 to 60 Americans have been through the trepanation procedure .
A professor at Columbia University ’s Teachers College who was propelled into the national spotlight when a noose was found on her office door last fall has been found to have plagiarized the work of a former colleague and two former students , the college has announced .
The college , in statements to the faculty and the news media , said an 18 - month investigation into charges against the professor , Madonna G. Constantine , had determined there were “ numerous instances in which she used others ’ work without attribution in papers she published in academic journals over the past five years . ”
Susan H. Fuhrman , the college ’s president , and Thomas James , the provost , informed the faculty of the case , and said that Dr. Constantine had the right to appeal .
The college said Dr. Constantine was being penalized , but did not say what the penalty was .
A spokeswoman for the college , Marcia Horowitz , said Teachers College did not have set rules governing plagiarism or how it should be punished .

4 Scientific Breakthroughs Happening Right Now
by Cassandra Galante
1 . When hypothermia is a good thing
The scenario : Kick - off returns are a coach 's nightmare " “ they are the most dangerous play in football , with both teams running head - on at full speed .
It 's rare if these plays do n't end in some seriously painful tackles .
Usually the players get up and keep hitting each other , but just a few months ago , Buffalo Bill Kevin Everett 's tackle drove his helmet straight into another player 's shoulder , crushing his spine and paralyzing him from the neck down .
Football injuries can be nasty , so team doctors and trainers are ready on the sidelines , prepared to perform some serious medicine at any given moment .
It was the Buffalo Bills ' orthopedic surgeon who had Everett in the ambulance within 15 minutes and injected cold saline into Everett 's femoral artery to induce " moderate hypothermia "  and reduce swelling .
The breakthrough : Everett 's diagnosis went from life - threatening to miracle when he started walking again just two months later , possibly due to his spine being chilled .
It prevented the damage from spreading from the injured area .
This has sparked a lot of interest and discussion in the medical community " “ if induced hypothermia can help minimize spinal cord injuries , a serious medical breakthrough may be in reach .
2. Medical breakthrough or musical breakthrough ?
The scenario : Roadside bombs in war - torn areas are unfortunately pretty commonplace .
Military - issue body armor can protect the torso , but bulky arm and leg guards can bog a soldier down and be just as deadly .
The trade - off is when a humvee rolls over one of these hidden mines , this new protection allows soldiers to survive , but they still lose entire arms or legs .
The breakthrough : Science has developed increasingly high - tech prosthetics .
Those made of silicone and PVC are incredibly lifelike .
Researchers are also working on a process called targeted muscle re-innervation , which reroutes the nerves previously connected to the missing limb to a different muscle on the body ( i.e. the chest ) and then uses that motion as a trigger for moving the prosthetic a certain way .
Pretty impressive " “ but there 's also a $ 55 million dollar project to develop a prosthetic arm with goals so ambitious that they claim a person could play the piano with their " mind - controlled "  arm .
Which gives new meaning to the old joke :
" Doctor , doctor , will I be able to play the violin after the operation ? "
" Yes , of course ... "
" Funny !
I never could before ! "
3. ... How about this global warming ?
The scenario :
The climate controversy has spawned the " hockey stick "  graph , the glitterati's new obsession with living green , and the tendency for every socially awkward person to joke " how about this global warming ? "  whenever it 's unseasonably hot outside .
It 's why you 're constantly seeing the words " carbon offset "  in advertisements lately , and why people can't stop talking about hybrids .
Environmentalism has always been a common political concern , but it did n't become the epitome of cool to be green until the release of Al Gore 's documentary An Inconvenient Truth .
The breakthrough :
One scientist has invented a synthetic " tree "  that looks nothing like a tree but does its most valuable job — that of cleaning the air of carbon dioxide .
The creator claims that it could even be improved to do the job of 1,000 trees , which would go a long way towards getting rid of the 22 billion tons of carbon dioxide humans produce every year .
4. Outsmarting Mother Nature
The scenario : Humans may be damaging the earth , but she returns the punch every now and then .
The 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami ( AKA the Asian Tsunami , AKA the Great Sumatra - Andaman Tsunami ) hit land early in the morning on December 26 , reaching up to 100 feet high and killing 225,000 people , making it the deadliest tsunami ever recorded .
There was quite a bit of outcry at the lack of any sort of tsunami warning system .
Only those who recognized the receding bubbly water as a sign of an approaching tsunami would know to run immediately .
Other methods exist , but none effective enough to give enough warning time for an evacuation .
The breakthrough : At a U.N. conference months later , an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was created , with intentions of expansion into an International system in the future .
But until then , those who live where tsunamis hit will have to live in constant worry , unless they pick up on some other way to detect the killer waves .

[ digg - reddit - me ] I ’ve been talking with one of my friends about what this election means recently .
He ’s in favor of Senator Hillary Clinton – and I , obviously , favor Senator Barack Obama .
His argument is essentially that Mr. Obama is too “ green ” ( although my friend believes Mr. Obama would be exceptional in eight years or so ) and that Ms. Clinton would provide competent if uninspired leadership making her the better choice for today .
There are a lot of grounds to dispute this on – whether Ms. Clinton ’s “ experience ” means much ; whether she would be a competent manager – her campaign planning suggesting otherwise ; whether she could accomplish anything , as divisive as she is ; whether or not she will win ; whether Mr. Obama lacks sufficient experience when compared with Ms. Clinton ; whether Mr. Obama is “ green ” .
I think all of these raise legitimate points .
But the argument I choose is the one that convinced me in the end to support Mr. Obama over Ms. Clinton , Senator John McCain , former Senator John Edwards , and the rest of the field .
Simply , the American experiment is in bad shape .
We have an executive today who does not respect the rule of law , who has acted imperiously ( only slightly more so than President Bill Clinton ) ; we have a corrupt culture in Washington that refuses to take action to reign the executive branch in , or even to protect their own prerogatives ; we have a media environment that rarely focuses on hard - hitting news and often reports on important topics as a matter of “ he said , she said ” without resolving factual conflicts between the diverging accounts ; we have an increasingly partisan politics that divides Americans into two teams despite great consensus on major issues ; our foreign policy is increasingly imperial , if well - meaning ; the bubbling conflicts around the world have been exacerbated in the past decade – and a “ return to normalcy ” that Ms. Clinton promises will not be sufficient to quell them .
What we need is a president who will be willing to return some of the powers Mr. Clinton and President George W. Bush have taken unto their office ; a president who will be able to start a serious discussion of the long - term issues facing America and then unite the citizenry to try to take steps to deal with these issues .
It ’s unlikely any individual could accomplish all of these things – but Ms. Clinton does not seem inclined to even try .
Her campaign is not about where America is headed – but about micro-initiatives to make segments of the population a bit better off .
There ’s a time for that approach to politics , but that time is not now .
My friend agreed with virtually everything I said above .
Yet somehow , he does n’t see America as in a fundamental crisis – and because of this , he sees Ms. Clinton as the more “ safe ” choice .
Andrew Sullivan , Glenn Greenwald , Charlie Savage , and Lawrence Lessig ( and former Governor Mario Cuomo ) have all helped convince me of the urgency of this crisis with their constant clear - sighted analyses – and thus moved me to support Mr. Obama as the only candidate with the potential to begin to tackle these issues .
But somehow , despite the relatively widespread knowledge of the state of our government and our politics , something is missing ; some urgency .
People tend to think : it ca n’t happen here .
Glenn Greenwald , reflecting perhaps a similar frustration to mine , tried to explain part of the issue by way of comparison :
Imagine if , say , Vladimir Putin was accused by his own top officials of systematically spying on Russian citizens for years in ways that were patently illegal , but he then manipulated the courts to ensure he was never accountable , and had his political allies in parliament block any investigations , so that the activities remained concealed forever and he was never made to answer for what he did .
Think about the grave denunciations that Fred Hiatt , Charles Krauthammer and the State Department would be issuing over such authoritarian and lawless maneuvering .
That ’s exactly how our country operates now .
When high political officials here are accused of breaking the law , they need not defend themselves .
Congress acts to protect and immunize them .
The courts refuse even to hear the lawsuits .
And executive branch officials are completely shielded from the most basic mechanics of the rule of law .
No hyperbole is necessary to sustain the Putin comparison .
It ’s demonstrated by the facts themselves , by how our system of government works now .
None of the “ great controversies ” of the Bush years , involving multiple accusations of lawbreaking , war crimes and other forms of serious corruption , has resulted in any legal process or investigations or ajudications because our government officials have been vested with omnipotent instruments to shield themselves from accountability , or even investigation , of any kind .
In a minimally functioning Republic , when our political leaders are accused of concealing wrongdoing , Congress investigates , uncovers what happens , and informs the American people .
When political leaders are accused of breaking the law , courts decide whether that occurred .
None of the branches of government do that any longer .
They do the opposite : they not only fail to perform those functions , but they affirmatively act to block investigations , help the conduct remain concealed , and ensure that there is no adjudication .
When it comes to ensuring that the NSA spying scandal specifically remains forever uninvestigated , secret , and unexamined , telecom amnesty will be the final nail in this coffin , but it is merely illustrative of how our political culture now functions .
The failure of many Americans to realize how close we are to losing the essence of the American experiment has many causes .
But at root , it is a failure of imagination .

American advocates of imperialism have been few and far between , and we have to go all the way back to the latter years of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th to unearth the most explicit .
Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps the best known , but there were others : notably , Capt .
Alfred T. Mahan , who advocated a big American Navy with island possessions to serve as bases , and Commodore Matthew C. Perry , who forced Japan to submit to Western intrusion , a turn of events that both sides would later have good reason to regret .
Other champions of Empire included Henry Adams , Brooks Adams , Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge , Charles A. Conant , and Jeremiah W. Jenks .
These influential men , some associated with or directly employed by the Morgan financial interests , argued that American capitalism could not sustain itself without forcibly opening up foreign markets .
They argued that America must become , like the monarchies of Europe , an imperial power on a world scale : it was either that or economic ruination .
This , of course , is the Leninist theory of imperialism : since capitalist markets must either expand or collapse completely , the system requires an imperialistic foreign policy .
The ruling class , having commandeered the state , uses its armed fist to smash overseas competition , bust open foreign markets , and loot conquered lands .
Instead of condemning this policy , however , as predatory and immoral , the “ right - wing Leninists , ” as Joe Stromberg dubbed them in a perceptive piece on this site , advocated it as the only right and proper course .
Yet the “ right - wing Leninists ” turned out to be wrong .
The costs of imperialism , as the war in the Philippines made clear , far outweighed the benefits  which were narrowly distributed , at any rate .
The major American critics of Rooseveltian imperialism , who advocated an international division of labor and free trade between nations  the doctrine of economic liberalism  were disdained equally by the House of Morgan and the Leninists .
Yet their analysis of the probable course of empire  that it would end in bankruptcy , tyranny , and the end of the old republic  has been confirmed by events .
If our leaders should ever trade in their republican cloth coats for the imperial purple , the leaders of the Anti-Imperialist League such as Edward Atkinson averred , it would signal the decline and fall of our civilization .
If bankruptcy is the first symptom of that decline , then the looming prospect of economic catastrophe that seems to hang over us these days augurs ill : they ’re already calling it the “ Iraq recession , ” and , indeed , MoveOn.org and allied groups are mounting a campaign around this theme .
They might as well call it the Imperial Depression , because it ’s all about the tremendous drain on otherwise productive resources down the rat - hole of “ nation - building . ”
The Bush administration is boasting about how many schools they ’ve built  in Iraq !
Yet our own schools are overcrowded , under - funded , and downright dangerous .
America ’s road to empire has taken quite a different turn than that imagined by the early advocates of American imperialism .
It turns out that imperialism benefits the imperialists ( i.e. , the citizens of the aggressor state ) not at all : it is the undeveloped nations , competing with the “ dominant ”
West , that now have the advantage .
Without Chinese investors buying into our debt , the U.S. economy would sink like a stone .
Chinese workers are increasingly the source of a wide range of products we no longer have the capacity to make : as the industrial core of the U.S. is hollowed out , China grows fat with massive capital investments .
In this context , it is instructive to recall the words of Roosevelt before an audience in Chicago , in praise of what he called “ the strenuous life “ :
“ We cannot , if we would , play the part of China , and be content to rot by inches in ignoble ease within our borders , taking no interest in what goes on beyond them , sunk in a scrambling commercialism ; heedless of the higher life , the life of aspiration , of toil and risk , busying ourselves only with the wants of our bodies for the day , until suddenly we should find , beyond a shadow of question , what China has already found , that in this world the nation that has trained itself to a career of unwarlike and isolated ease is bound , in the end , to go down before other nations which have not lost the manly and adventurous qualities . ”
If ever a stance has been discredited by history , then surely it is the Rooseveltian disdain for China ’s alleged “ scrambling commercialism . ”
If Beijing decided to cut our purse - strings tomorrow , the mighty American Empire would fall quicker than its Soviet counterpart , albeit with a much louder crash .
The strenuous life leads to exhaustion .
In the life of a nation , this means economic exhaustion , otherwise known as bankruptcy .
Yet “ the strenuous life ” has its contemporary advocates in the “ national greatness ” school of neoconservatism , and specifically in the person of John McCain , Teddy Roosevelt ’s modern incarnation .
In a 2002 speech at the University of Southern California , McCain specifically invoked Roosevelt ’s strenuous imperialism as his political credo :
“ Theodore Roosevelt is one of my greatest political heroes .
The ‘ strenuous life ’ was T.R. ’s definition of Americanism , a celebration of America ’s pioneer ethos , the virtues that had won the West and inspired our belief in ourselves as the New Jerusalem , bound by sacred duty to suffer hardship and risk danger to protect the values of our civilization and impart them to humanity .
‘ We can not sit huddled within our borders , ’ he warned , ‘ and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well - to - do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond . ' ”
Putting the phrases McCain cites in context , let us see what else T.R. brayed that day :
“ We can not sit huddled within our own borders and avow ourselves merely an assemblage of well - to - do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond .
Such a policy would defeat even its own end ; for as the nations grow to have ever wider and wider interests , and are brought into closer and closer contact , if we are to hold our own in the struggle for naval and commercial supremacy , we must build up our power without our own borders .
We must build the isthmian canal , and we must grasp the points of vantage which will enable us to have our say in deciding the destiny of the oceans of the East and the West .
“ So much for the commercial side .
From the standpoint of international honor the argument is even stronger . ”
The ideology of T.R. and his academic and political acolytes was crude mercantilism : “ grasp ” those markets , boys !
This “ grasp and grab ” foreign policy was carried out by the U.S. military , from Panama to Nicaragua and outward to Cuba , Puerto Rico , Hawaii , and even the distant Philippines  where the dream of empire expired , albeit only temporarily , in a paroxysm of bloody resistance .
The policy of imperialism , far from being the cause of riches descending on the nation , was an expensive and divisive “ solution ” to the alleged crisis of American capitalism , one that could not be sustained then any more than it can not be sustained now .
As underscored by the costs involved in setting up and defending our newly conquered Iraqi province , our empire is not a gain , economically , but a drain  although a new , rising class of war profiteers , colonial administrators , and investment bankers underwriting the whole imperial project directly benefits from our policies .
McCain is their voice and their champion .
Republican critics of McCain ’s immigration stance will see in his 2002 speech the origins of his peculiar indifference to the concept of American sovereignty  peculiar , that is , in an apparent American nationalist .
Yet McCain ’s nationalism is not the inward - looking sort but an aggressively extroverted variety that seeks to impose itself and its will as far as the eye can see .
As McCain puts it in his 2002 paean to Roosevelt :
“ His Americanism was not fidelity to a tribal identity .
Nor was it limited to a sentimental attachment to our ‘ amber waves of grain ’ or ‘ purple mountains majesty . ’
Roosevelt ’s Americanism exalted the political values of a nation where the people were sovereign , recognizing not only the inherent justice of self - determination , not only that freedom empowered individuals to decide their destiny for themselves , but that it empowered them to choose a common destiny .
And for Roosevelt that common destiny surpassed material gain and self - interest .
Our freedom and our industry must aspire to more than acquisition and luxury .
We must live out the true meaning of freedom , and accept ‘ that we have duties to others and duties to ourselves ; and we can shirk neither . ' ”
Those who would shirk their “ duty ” to uplift the world  the enemies of the strenuous life  were excoriated by Roosevelt in thunderous tones , a heavy fusillade of self - righteous fury that only McCain , in our own day , could match :
“ The timid man , the lazy man , the man who distrusts his country , the over - civilized man , who has lost the great fighting , masterful virtues , the ignorant man , and the man of dull mind , whose soul is incapable of feeling the mighty lift that thrills ‘ stern men with empires in their brains ’  all these , of course , shrink from seeing the nation undertake its new duties ; shrink from seeing us build a navy and an army adequate to our needs ; shrink from seeing us do our share of the world ’s work , by bringing order out of chaos in the great , fair tropic islands from which the valor of our soldiers and sailors has driven the Spanish flag .
These are the men who fear the strenuous life . ”
The bluster , the boasting , the volcanic anger barely suppressed , the stern admonition to “ bring order out of chaos ”  as if he were a god , or God Himself !
The megalomania , the posturing , the call to empire  it all sounds like McCain .
As The Atlantic ‘s Matthew Yglesias put it in his commentary on McCain channeling Roosevelt , the putative GOP presidential nominee “ is , among practical politicians , perhaps the single most committed advocate of an imperial vision of American foreign policy out there . ”
Yglesias very smartly points out that
“ To McCain , a commitment to universalism requires American expansionism .
Indeed , to McCain it is precisely commitment to this imperial vision that makes American patriotism superior to other brands of nationalism .
Our own patriotism would become compromised by stinginess and selfishness were we to show more restraint in world affairs . ”
The economic argument for expansionism having been long ago discredited , McCain must lean on what T.R. deemed “ the standpoint of international honor ” :
“ Some critics , in his day and ours , saw in Roosevelt ’s patriotism only flag - waving chauvinism , not all that dissimilar to Old World ancestral allegiances that incited one people to subjugate another and plunged whole continents into war .
But they did not see the universality of the ideals that formed his creed . ”
Republicans are not rallying around McCain ’s ascetic militarism , as they were expected to , and conservatives distrust him on a wide range of issues .
This distrust is rooted in the very universalism so beloved by McCain : it accounts for his de facto open borders position , as well as his foreign policy .
After all , if America is to be the center of a world empire , then we can hardly deny entry to our foreign subjects , who will be linked to us in myriad legal , social , political , and administrative networks  all this , in addition to the normal commercial ties .
The policy of imperialism , carried to its end , means the de facto abolition of borders .
This same militant universalism means the creation of a warrior caste as its priesthood , and McCain is the living symbol of this type .
The differences with the traditional bourgeois Republican were underscored by McCain during the Republican debates , where the candidate ’s disdain for Mitt Romney ’s career as a successful entrepreneur was all too plain .
This made a large part of the Republican base distinctly uncomfortable : after all , what ’s wrong with being a businessman , anyway ?
Romney ’s career trajectory is held in contempt by McCain because it violates the precepts of the warrior ethic he brings to public life .
It is selfish , self - serving , and has nothing to do with “ national greatness , ” that concept so beloved by T.R. and his current imitator .
Tax cuts ?
Why , the very idea is wedded to  as Teddy put it  “ that base spirit of gain and greed which recognizes in commercialism the be-all and end - all of national life , instead of realizing that , though an indispensable element , it is , after all , but one of the many elements that go to make up true national greatness . ”
This is going to be a very interesting presidential election year .
For the first time , a presidential candidate is going to campaign on a platform of open , out - of - the - closet imperialism .
A war - weary nation will be hectored endlessly by McCain , and exhorted to “ sacrifice ”  when their homes are being foreclosed .
The Republicans ’ only hope , it seems to me , is copying the Clintons ‘ smear campaign against Barack Obama and hoping that America will never elect a black man with a middle name like “ Hussein ” and a last name that rhymes with “ Osama . ”
That photo of Obama in what one Clintonite referred to as “ his native garb ” will come in handy , I ’m sure .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I see on Amazon that the official publication date of Reclaiming the American Right : The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement is May 30 .
You can pre-order , though , either through Amazon or through the Web site recently set up by the publisher , the Intercollegiate Studies Institute .
I wrote Reclaiming in 1992 , and it was published the next year by the Center for Libertarian Studies , went through two editions , and then went out of print .
It is an alternative , and admittedly polemical , history of conservatism in America , seen through the prism of changing foreign policy perspectives , from the “ isolationism ” of the Old Right to the openly imperialistic doctrines of neoconservatism .
ISI is bringing it back , with a new introduction by George W. Carey and commentaries by Scott Richert and David Gordon , as well as the original introduction by Pat Buchanan .
The book ’s reissue could not be more timely .
Certainly the rise of the neoconservatives  predicted in the book  along with the rise of the Ron Paul movement , have confirmed the book ’s thesis and its relevance for today .
I see that word is already getting out , so get your copies while they last .
Having spent the weekend at an event organized by a major bank for its hyper - wealthy clients -- do n't get the wrong idea , I was just part of the entertainment -- I came away with much greater awareness of two important dividing lines in the world economy today .
The first is between the entrepreneur and the financier .
The super - rich get that way by one of two routes .
They either inherit their wealth from their parents , or they build a business from scratch and then sell it off to a larger entity .
In either case , the financiers play an important supporting role : they help maintain and grow the wealth generated by the family business and they arrange the deals that allow the multi-billion dollar takeovers .
But it was evident at the meeting that they get no respect from the entrepreneurs .
Entrepreneurs view financiers as people with no understanding of business , who are as likely to ruin them as help them grow .
We generate the jobs , the wealth , and take all the risk , they say .
If we fail , no - one bails us out .
Financiers , on the other hand ...
The second dividing line today is between the pessimism that pervades the U.S. and Europe and the pervasive optimism of entrepreneurs from emerging ( emerged ? ) nations .
The financial crisis that is still growing has left business people from the advanced nations in a very dark mood .
Whether a recession is around the corner , or has already arrived , no - one in the first world thinks 2008 is going to be a good year .
It is all shades of pessimism .
But if you talk to businessmen ( alas they were all men ) from India , Russia , China , Turkey or the Gulf States , you would hardly know that we have just experienced a credit market freeze - out in the West .
They are all ho - hum about it .
Yeah , we could shave a point or two off our growth estimates , they say , if the U.S. goes into a deep recession , but it 's no big deal -- and can you pass the wine please .
Indians are saying we do n't rely that much on exports anyhow ; the Chinese are relying on their growing middle class ; and others have their own stories .
Is this the famous " decoupling " at work ?
Will this be the beginning of a new era of the world economy , with several key developing countries , the BRICs and the N - 11 ( using the faddish terms that attach to them ) , gaining real ascendancy over their Western counterparts ?
Probably not .
But something interesting is going on .
Hopes of a political compromise in Kenya rose today after the president , Mwai Kibaki , invited his chief rival to talks and the opposition cancelled another rally .
Amid claims that violence triggered by Kibaki 's disputed re-election has claimed up to 1,000 lives , Raila Odinga , the opposition leader , said he wanted to give mediation a chance .
Kibaki responded by inviting Odinga to talks on Friday and called for the new parliament , which is dominated by Odinga 's supporters , to meet on January 15 .
Earlier , Odinga had said at a press conference : " We are now assured the mediation process is about to start .
We are therefore informing our supporters countrywide that there will be no public rallies .
" We want the mediation to take place in a peaceful environment , which is why the rallies have been cancelled . "
Odinga said African Union mediation to end the post-election turmoil could start on Wednesday .
He told Reuters the union 's chairman , John Kufuor , the president of Ghana , had received an invitation from Kibaki to chair mediation talks and would arrive tomorrow night .
" He will be ready to begin chairing the talks on Wednesday , " said Odinga , who described the development as a " major , major breakthrough " .
The opposition candidate said that " close to a thousand " people may have died in the violence since the disputed election .
Kufuor had been due to arrive in Nairobi last week but stayed away after Odinga said he was not willing to talk to Kibaki unless he acknowledged he had lost the election .
Yesterday he said he was willing to drop that demand but also proposed that an interim government be set up to hold new elections .
Kibaki has said he is willing to form a government of national unity , but that only the courts can overturn his election victory .
Today , the ministry of special programmes announced that , after more than a week of violence , 486 people had been killed and 255,000 displaced .
The toll was compiled by a special committee of humanitarian services set up by the government that toured areas most affected by riots and protests .
But Kenyan police claim that at least 600 people had died , according to AFP .
" We have at least 600 dead ... some bodies are still in the bushes where fighting occurred , " an unnamed police official told the agency .
Until today the official death toll had stood at 350 .
An anti-Kibaki rally had been scheduled for tomorrow , after plans for a similar protest were postponed last Thursday when demonstrators were dispersed with teargas and water cannon .
The government had claimed that a rally would ignite " tension and hooliganism " .
Odinga and his supporters claim the election was stolen .
European monitors say the poll was " flawed " .
Anger at Kibaki 's victory sparked tribal rivalry and claims and counterclaims from both main parties that their opponents are to blame for ethnic cleansing .
The UN - backed International Conference on the Great Lakes Region said the killings were " akin to ethnic cleansing and genocide " .
Human rights groups accused the police of excessive force and unjustified killings in the crisis , but the police claim they have not shot anyone .
In the western Rift valley , Odinga 's stronghold , thousands of Kikuyus , Kibaki 's tribe , have been fleeing their homes .
The British foreign secretary , David Miliband , said Kufuor 's mission had the government 's full support .
In a statement to the Commons this afternoon he said Kenyan people and the international community were demanding Kenyan leaders reach a compromise .

In a Senate floor speech , Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - West Virginia ) inadvertently made plain that the proposed changes to the nation ’s spying laws radically expand how the government wiretaps inside the United States .
Rockefeller was decrying an amendment that would require the government to discard non-emergency evidence if a court later finds that the spying methods violate the law .
Rockefeller makes clear that the impending changes to the law are n’t about making it easier for the National Security Agency to listen in on a particular terrorism suspect ’s phone calls .
Instead , the changes are about letting the nation ’s spooks secretly and unilaterally install filters inside America ’s phone and internet infrastructure .

High energy collisions by the nearly - completed Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) may be able to generate particles that are sensitive to dimensions beyond our four dimensional space - time .
These exotic particles , called Kaluza - Klein gravitons , would be highly sensitive to the geometry of extra-dimensions , giving scientists an idea about what lies beyond our universe .
If these particles are detected , and if their characteristics can be measured , then perhaps the extra dimensions predicted by string theoryÂ may be proven to exist …
How can you measure the size of a room without actually measuring it ?
Forget measuring the room , you ca n’t even see it !
The room is invisible ; it is outside your observational ability .
But what if you could bounce sound off the walls ?
Even better , what if the walls of the invisible room were made up of resonant particles , producing their own sound ?
If the sound from these resonant particles could then be analyzed , the shape of the invisible room would be known .
According to string theory , there are many “ invisible rooms ” that we , as observers , cannot experience .
We are confined to our three dimensions of space and one dimension of time ( although this may not always be the case ) , otherwise known as four dimensional space - time .
Elemental vibrating strings thread through our universe and predict that there may be six or seven extra dimensions coexisting .
Although we cannot directly experience the dimensions beyond the normal four , can we measure the characteristics of string vibrations travelling from these extra dimensions into our observable universe ?
In new research published by Gary Shiu , Bret Underwood , Kathryn Zurek at UW - Madison and Devin Walker at UC - Berkeley , quantum particles have been theorized to have the ability to resonate with dimensions beyond our universe ; beyond the 4th dimension , considered to be time .
From this resonance , signatures from extra-dimensions could pass through our four dimensional space - time to be measured .
From this analysis , the “ shape ” of the extra dimensions may then be understood .
This is not purely out of curiosity , according to string theory the shape of extra dimensions influences everything in our universe :
“ The shape of the dimensions is crucial because , in string theory , the way the string vibrates determines the pattern of particle masses and the forces that we feel . ” – UW - Madison physics professor , Gary Shiu .
The team predict particles carrying extra-dimensional signatures could be generated by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN ( nr. Geneva , Switzerland ) .
At very high energies , Kaluza - Klein ( KK ) gravitons may be created for a brief moment , carrying the signatures with them .
Unfortunately KK gravitons will decay very quickly , but from this decay a shower of lower energy , detectable particles will be created .
By analyzing the resulting shower , a fingerprint of the KK particle ’s signature may be constructed .
Any slight changes in the geometry of the detected particles may indicate a particular dimension , and many signatures may be mixed , so complex computer simulations are required to understand the results coming from the LHC .

Back to the Basics of Functional Programming
I have been accused of taking the long way around to obvious conclusions .
Fair enough .
But to me it's not the conclusion so much as tracking the path that leads there , so perhaps I need to be more verbose and not go for a minimalist writing style .
We shall see .
The modern functional programming world can be a daunting place .
All this talk of the lambda calculus .
Monads .
A peculiar obsession with currying , even though it is really little more than a special case shortcut that saves a bit of finger typing at the expense of being hard to explain .
And type systems .
I 'm going to remain neutral on the static vs. dynamic typing argument , but there 's no denying that papers on type systems tend to be hardcore reading .
Functional programming is actually a whole lot simpler than any of this lets on .
It 's as if the theoreticians figured out functional programming long ago , and needed to come up with new twists to keep themselves amused and to keep the field challenging and mysterious .
So where did functional programming come from ?
I wo n't even try to give a definitive history , but I can see the path that led to it looking like a good idea .
When I first learned Pascal ( the only languages I knew previously were BASIC and 6502 assembly ) , there was a fixation with parameter passing in the textbooks I read and classes I took .
In a procedure heading like this :
function max ( a : integer ; b : integer ) : integer ;
" a " and " b " are formal parameters .
If called with max ( 1,2 ) , then 1 and 2 are the actual parameters .
All very silly , and one of those cases where the trouble of additional terminology takes something mindlessly simple and makes it cumbersome .
Half of my high school programming class was hung up on this for a good two weeks .
But then there 's more : parameters can be passed by value or by reference .
As in C , you can pass a structure by value , even if that structure is 10 K in size , and the entire structure will be copied to the stack .
And that 's usually not a good idea , so by reference is the preferred method in this case ... except that data passed by reference might be changed behind the scenes by any function you pass it to .
Later languages , such as Ada , got all fancy with multiple types of " by reference " parameters : parameters that were read - only , parameters that were write - only ( that is , were assumed to be overwritten by a function ) , and parameters that could be both read from and written to .
All that extra syntax just to reduce the number of cases where a parameter could be stomped all over by a function , causing a global side effect .
One thing Wirth got completely right in Pascal is that " by reference " parameters do n't turn into pointers at the language level .
They 're the same as the references that eventually made it into C++.
Introduce full pointers into a language , especially with pointer arithmetic , and now things are really scary .
Not only can data structures be modified by any function via reference parameters , but any piece of code can potentially reach out into random data space and tromp other variables in the system .
And data structures can contain pointers into other data structures and all bets are off at that point .
Any small snippet of code involving pointers can completely change the state of the program , and there 's no compile - time analysis that can keep things under control .
There 's a simple way out of the situation :
Do n't allow functions to modify data at all .
With that rule in place , it makes no difference if parameters are passed by value or by reference , so the compiler can use whatever is most efficient ( usually by value for atomic , primitive types and by reference for structured types ) .
Rather shockingly , this works .
It 's theoretically possible to write any program without modifying data .
The problem here is how to program in a purely functional manner , and this has gotten surprisingly short shrift in the functional programming community .
Yes , types provide more information about intent and can be used to catch a certain class of errors at compile time .
Higher - order functions are convenient .
Currying is a neat trick .
Monads allow I/O and other real - world nastiness to fit into a functional framework .
Oh does mergesort look pretty in Haskell .
I shudder to think of how tedious it was operating on binary trees in Pascal , yet the Erlang version is breathtakingly trivial .
But ask someone how to write Pac - Man - - to choose a hopelessly dated video game -- in a purely functional manner .
Pac - Man affects the ghosts and the ghosts affect Pac - Man ; can most newcomers to FP puzzle out how to do this without destructive updates ?
Or take just about any large , complex C++ program for that matter .
It 's doable , but requires techniques that are n't well documented , and it's not like there are many large functional programs that can be used as examples ( especially if you remove compilers for functional programming languages from consideration ) .
Monads , types , currying ... they 're useful , but , in a way , dodges .
The most basic principle of writing code without destructive updates is the tricky part .

What did the famous British parliamentarian and political philosopher Edmund Burke ( 1729 - 1797 ) have to say about the internet and our current political circumstances ?
Quite a bit , it turns out .
Burke is beloved by conservative intellectuals .
George Will , for instance , mentions him all the time .
Quoting Burke gives their pronouncements a nice glossy sheen .
Yet their Burke - worship is genuinely bizarre .
Few people understand this , since few people ( including conservative intellectuals ) bother to read what Burke wrote .
Anyone who does , though , will immediately understand how strongly Burke would have opposed today ’s conservative movement , since he strongly opposed their 18th century equivalents .
This is particularly clear in Burke ’s 1770 pamphlet , “ Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents . ”
It ’s not merely that Burke was writing during a time of uprisings in overseas colonies , and in opposition to a monarch named George who was trying to expand executive power and neuter the legislative branch .
Almost every sentence Burke wrote applies precisely to today .
For instance , in one passage Burke sounds like he ’s describing current efforts by MoveOn and blogs to prevent Congress from granting telecom companies immunity for violating FISA :
Whilst men are linked together , they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of any evil design .
They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel , and to oppose it with united strength .
Whereas , when they lie dispersed , without concert , order , or discipline , communication is uncertain , counsel difficult , and resistance impracticable .
Where men are not acquainted with each other ’s principles , nor experienced in each other ’s talents , nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business ; no personal confidence , no friendship , no common interest , subsisting among them ; it is evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity , perseverance , or efficacy .
In a connection , the most inconsiderable man , by adding to the weight of the whole , has his value , and his use ; out of it , the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public .
No man , who is not inflamed by vain - glory into enthusiasm , can flatter himself that his single , unsupported , desultory , unsystematic endeavours , are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens .
When bad men combine , the good must associate ; else they will fall , one by one , an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle .
Burke also covers George ’s insistence on appointing incompetent hacks to positions of power , to habituate Parliament to impotence ; the way the King ’s cabal is mired in the “ deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption ” yet purports to be motivated by the “ most astonishing prudery , both moral and political ” ; and the “ futility , the weakness , the rashness , the perpetual contradiction , in the management of our affairs ” in colonies across the sea .
Then there ’s his description of a corrupted , weak legislature , which could have been written yesterday :
A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy ; an anxious care of public money , an openness , approaching towards facility , to public complaint : these seem to be the true characteristics of an House of Commons .
But an addressing House of Commons , and a petitioning nation ; an House of Commons full of confidence , when the nation is plunged in despair ; in the utmost harmony with Ministers , whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence ; who vote thanks , when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments ; who are eager to grant , when the general voice demands account ; who , in all disputes between the people and Administration , presume against the people ; who punish their disorders , but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them ; this is an unnatural , a monstrous state of things in this constitution .
Parliament cannot with any great propriety punish others , for things in which they themselves have been accomplices .
Thus the controul of Parliament upon the executory power is lost ; because Parliament is made to partake in every considerable act of Government .
Impeachment , that great guardian of the purity of the Constitution , is in danger of being lost , even to the idea of it .
[ Italics in original ]
So if we truly want to remember the past , rather than repeat it , Burke ’s pamphlet is a good place to start .
As another old dead guy , Thomas Jefferson , said :

Time travel could be a reality within just three months , Russian mathematicians have claimed .
They believe an experiment nuclear scientists plan to carry out in underground tunnels in Geneva in May could create a rift in the fabric of the universe .
Scroll down for more ...
The European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) hopes its " atom - smashing " tests - which aim to recreate the conditions in the first billionth of a second after the " Big Bang ' " created everything - will shed invaluable light on the origins of the universe .
But Irina Aref'eva and Igor Volovich , of Moscow 's Steklov Mathematical Institute , say the energy produced by forcing tiny particles to collide at close to the speed of light could open the door to visitors from the future .
According to Einstein 's general theory of relativity , any large amounts of matter or energy will distort the space and time that surrounds it .
If the energy or mass is large enough , it is claimed that time can be distorted so much that it folds back on itself - creating a wormhole , or time tunnel , between the present and the future .
But Dr Brian
Cox , a member of CERN and one of Britain 's leading experts in particle physics , is highly sceptical about the Russian claims , calling them " nothing more than a good science fiction story " .
He said : " Cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere are far more energetic than anything we can produce .
" They have been occurring for five billion years , and no time travellers have appeared .
" Stephen Hawking has suggested that any future theory of quantum gravity will probably close this possibility off , not least because the universe usually proceeds in a sane way , and time travel into the past is n't sane . "
Cynics often point out that if time travel was really possible , we would have been visited by people from the future .
However , Einstein 's laws of physics suggest that time travel is only possible into the past as far as the point when the first time machine was invented .
A Microsoft executive sent workers an upbeat email outlining a vision of how the software giant expects to take over Yahoo and merge the companies ' cultures and resources .
Yahoo spurned Microsoft 's $ US44.6 billion bid for the veteran Internet firm on February 11 .
Microsoft is reportedly planning a hostile takeover bid if Yahoo's board of directors does not change its mind .
In a message to employees , Microsoft platform and services division president Kevin Johnson shared " a perspective of the process going forward " .
" We look forward to a constructive dialogue with Yahoo 's board , management , shareholders , and employees on the value of this combination and its strategic and financial merits , " he said .
" Once Yahoo and Microsoft agree on a transaction , we can begin the integration planning process in parallel with the regulatory review . "
If Yahoo capitulates , the transaction would likely close in the second half of this year , Mr Johnson says .
Microsoft said it plans to keep Yahoo in Silicon Valley and hold onto engineering and business talent at the company .

Interviews Attorney of Alabama 's Former , Now - Jailed , Democratic Governor , and a Former Republican Attorney General Who is Calling for a Special Prosecutor ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/28/2008 , 9:32 pm PT
MSNBC's Dan Abrams continued , for the third day in a row , on the Don Siegelman beat today .
The former Democratic Alabama Governor , who still sits in jail pending an appeal for his non-violent crime , is alleged to have been railroaded by Karl Rove and political operatives in the state while running for re-election in 2006 .
In 2002 he had won his election , according to the announced results on Election Night , only to wake up the next morning to find that a Republican election director claimed to have discovered a " glitch " ( sound familiar , regular BRAD BLOG readers ? ) in the electronic vote counts overnight , resulting in Siegelman 's loss .
He was never allowed a recount after the vote tallies somehow changed on the electronic voting machines due to the " glitch , " as it was described officially , by court probate officers .
In this rarely seen , 2004 video interview with Siegelman ( see approx .
half - way through that linked article ) , he alleges : " Somebody electronically manipulated the election results … This election was stolen … There is no other kind , or sugar - coated way to say it . "
Neither the 60 Minutes report on Siegelman from Sunday , nor any of Abrams ' reports so far this week ( here 's Tuesday 's and Wednesday 's ) including today's , as posted at the end of this article , have yet delved , with any depth , into that aspect of what seems clearly to have been a well - run political frame - up --- or , yes , a conspiracy --- to do away with the one Democrat who had been able to win statewide elections in an otherwise very Republican - leaning state .
We hope to have more on that aspect of the case soon .
On today 's MSNBC " Bush League Justice " report , Abrams spoke with both Siegelman 's attorney , Vince Kilborn , as well as Grant Woods , the former Republican Attorney General from Arizona who has been among the most outspoken of the 52 former Republican and Democratic Attorneys General who have called on Congress for an investigation and a special prosecutor to be named in the case .
Abrams repeated his call , from yesterday , for the immediate release of Siegelman from prison , pending appeal of his case , as would be customary in other similar , non-violent cases .
Abrams enumerated his chief concerns about the prosecution and the trial as run by federal judge Mark Fuller , as follows ...
Excessive Sentence :
Siegelman was acquitted of 25 of 32 counts , yet he got seven years and four months .
Much more than the norm .
Immediately Led Away in Shackles :
After the trial , the former Governor was manacled and taken to jail , like a violent offender .
Did n't get the usual 45 days to report to prison that would be the norm .
No Bail Pending Appeal :
No bail was allowed , even though an appeal for the non-violent crime is pending .
Transcript Delay :
The appeal is delayed because the court has yet to produce a trial transcript even though the trial was held more than a year and a half ago .
Near the end of the interview with Woods , the former AZ Attorney General notes pointedly :
I hope everybody , Republican or Democrat , will just rally around the principle that we gotta do the right thing in this country , and not allow this thing to happen .
So , if it did happen , it needs to be uncovered .
If it did n't , then let 's investigate it , and call it off .
The video of today 's " Bush League Justice " segment on Siegelman , follows below ...
( Hat - tip BRAD BLOG 's video muckraker , and new best friend of Karl Rove , Alan Breslauer for the video . )
CORRECTION : We had originally described Grant Woods as the former Republican Attorney General from Alabama .
He is , in fact , the former Republican Attorney General from Arizona .
The BRAD BLOG regrets the error .
Nov. 22 , 2007  --
The town where an Internet hoax apparently led to a teenage girl 's suicide unanimously voted to make online harassment a crime today , according to The Associated Press .
The vote makes Internet harassment a misdemeanor and punishable by up to a $ 500 fine and 90 days in jail , according to the report .
The ruling is a result of an incident that occured last year , where 13 - year - old Megan Meier hanged herself inside her parents ' home in Dardenne Prairie , Ill .
The apparent cause of her suicide , her parents have said , was the sudden decline of her online relationship with a 16 - year - old boy they thought was named Josh Evans .
But , soon after their daughter 's death , Tina and Ron Meier discovered that there was no Josh Evans .
They say the boy who pretended to be Megan 's friend and then sent her nasty messages was the creation of an adult neighbor who still lives down the street from Ron Meier .
Though police and prosecutors have investigated , a year later , no criminal charges have been filed against the woman who allegedly created the online profile , and it 's unclear whether any will be brought .
Tonight , the town 's board of Aldermen will vote on a proposal to make online harassment a misdemeanor , said Mayor Pam Fogarty .
" It 's not much , but at least it 's something , " Fogarty said of the proposed ordinance .
" I think it 's absolutely horrible that an adult can do this to a child , much less the mother of a friend and there is nothing to charge her with . "
Though it appears the woman who created the online profile will not be criminally charged , that has n't stopped an outpouring of hostility against her , both online and in the real world .
In a police report filed last November , the woman complains that her neighbors have become " hostile toward her and her family " since learning of her role in Megan 's suicide .
That antipathy has only increased since the story hit the national media late last week , with Megan 's parents appearing on " Good Morning America " and the " Today " show .
Though the newspapers and networks declined to identify the real - life " Josh Evans , " bloggers quickly outed her and posted her family 's name , address and phone number online .
Since then , messages threatening the family have been posted online .
Photos of the woman 's husband have been posted on the Internet .
In the last year , since neighbors learned of what happened , a brick was thrown through their window .
Someone drove a truck over their front lawn , according to police .
A paint - ball was shot against the house .
The woman , who also has a young daughter , has received threatening phone calls ; people have screamed obscenities as they drive by the house , a neighbor said .
Police descended on the house in the middle of the night last week , police and neighbors said , after a fake 911 call was made .
Police are concerned that the harassment , first reported by the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , may escalate .
" We believe that all the publicity about this situation has led to an air of vigilantism , " said Lt. Craig McGuire of the St. Charles County Sheriff 's Department .
" We 're concerned people will take things into their own hands . "
Megan , who sometimes suffered from low self - esteem and depression , was elated when she got an e-mail on the social networking site MySpace from a cute boy named " Josh Evans , " her parents said .
Josh claimed to be a 16 - year - old boy who lived nearby .
He said he was home - schooled and did n't yet have a phone .
The two developed a virtual friendship that lasted more than a month before things inexplicably took a downward turn .
" Megan gets an e-mail , or a message from Josh on her MySpace on Oct. 15 , 2006 , saying , ' I do n't know if I want to be friends with you any longer because I hear you 're not nice to your friends , ' " Tina Meier said on " GMA . "
Insulting messages calling Megan " fat " and a " slut " were being posted , according to The Associated Press .
Tina Meier discovered her daughter 's body in a bedroom closet the next day .
She had hanged herself .
Six weeks after Megan 's death , a neighbor told the Meiers that there was no Josh Evans .
He was a fictitious creation of woman whose daughter knew Megan and lived down the street .
According to the police report , the woman created the profile to find out what Megan was saying online about her daughter .
The Meiers knew the woman who allegedly created the profile .
Her family had asked the Meiers whether they could store their foosball table .
The woman attended Megan 's funeral , according to the police report .
Once they learned of the family 's involvement , the Meiers allegedly destroyed the table , placed it in the woman 's yard and encouraged the family to move , according to the AP .
The Meiers said they do n't think the woman wanted Megan to commit suicide .
But they still hold her responsible for their daughter 's death .
" I believe they are the ones who took her to the edge of the cliff and forced her to go over , " Ron Meier said .
" Everything that we found out so far — it was the sole idea of the mother . "
No charges have been filed in the case and the local prosecutor has said it appears no laws were broken .
McGuire said the sheriff 's department and local and federal prosecutors investigated the case and concluded that they could not file criminal charges .
With the publicity , county prosecutor Jack Banas has said he will re-examine the case .
But , it appears that the Josh Evans profile and messages could have violated a federal cyberstalking law , which prevents people from sending abusive or threatening messages , said Perry Aftab , a cyberlaw expert .
Aftab , who runs WiredSafety , which helps victims of so - called cyberabuse , said this was one of the few instances she could recall of adults harassing children online .
The involvement of an adult set Megan 's story apart from traditional cyberbullying , she said .
" This is particularly heinous , " she added .
Some neighbors of the family accused of setting up the profile agreed .
" I do think it 's criminal , and I think they should be held responsible for it , " said Terri Hutchinson .
Fake or Not
When I began work ten years ago on a book about white sharks , I had no idea that this project would yield my most well - known image to date .
For more than ten months I worked together with Michael Scholl and scientists at the White Shark Trust to create novel images of white sharks in South Africa that would illustrate current scientific research .
The team observed large numbers of white sharks venturing into extremely shallow water during the summer months .
In order to figure out why , the researchers tracked and observed the sharks ’ movements , but were regularly thwarted for two reasons .
First , the inshore realm was treacherous , humped by rocky reefs and sandbanks , which heaved the research boat precariously during an onslaught of large swells .
Secondly , the boat engine 's electrical field seemed to affect the sharks ' behavior .
I suggested using a kayak as less obtrusive photographic platform to track white sharks .
I was met withcautious enthusiasm , so I was voted to be the one to test the waters .
Even though we repeatedly tested the sharks ’ reactions to an empty kayak , the first few attempts at a manned kayak were nerve - wracking .
As I sat in the “ yum - yum ” yellow sea kayak , a 15 - foot ( 4.5 m ) great white shark ambled towards me .
However , white sharks are much more cautious and inquisitive than aggressive and unpredictable .
And this proved true with our experiment ; at no time did the sharks show any aggression toward us or our little yellow craft .
The story of this particular photograph began on a perfectly calm and glassy sea .
I tied myself to the tower of the White Shark Trust research boat and leaned into the void , precariously hanging over the ocean while waiting patiently .
The first shark came across our sea kayak , dove to the seabed , and inspected it from below .
I trained my camera on the nebulous shadow as it slowly transformed into the sleek silhouette of a large great white .
When the shark ’s dorsal fin emerged , I thought I had the shot but hesitated a fraction of a second .
In that moment , the research assistant in the kayak , Trey Snow , turned to look behind him , and I took the shot .
Throughout the day I shot many more similar images , but all lacked the connection of first image .
I knew the image was iconic , but I was not prepared for the public response .
When the photograph was first published , it attracted more than 100,000 visitors to my website in 24 hours .
Many thought the photo was a digital fake , and to date there are still hundreds of websites that debate its authenticity .
Not only is the image real , it was one of the last images I took using slide film before transitioning to digital .
All magazines and prints were taken from a high - resolution scan of the slide with no post - production work .
Over the years the image continued to sell and just when I thought it had run its course , the image resurfaced on April 1 , 2006 .
The French magazine , Le Magazine des Voyages de Peche ( The Magazine of Fishing Voyages ) published an April Fool ’s Day article that told the story of professional fishermen Arnold Pointer from south Australia who accidentally caught a large female white shark in one of his fishing nets .
Instead of killing her , he set her free and named her Cindy .
From that day forward , the shark followed Arnold every time he set out to sea .
In the article , he states , “ It ’s been two years and she does n’t leave me alone .
She follows me everywhere I go , and her presence scares all the fishes . ”
Two years later this hoax was immortalized in a YouTube slideshow , which used my photograph , purportedly showing Cindy the white shark following Arnold in his yellow kayak .
The video received nearly 1.6 million hits and introduced the white shark kayak to a new audience , albeit in an inaccurate if humorous context .
On August 21 , 2011 , Hurricane Irene battered the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico and flooded many streets .
I could never have imagined that my photograph would make an appearance in this context , except this time it was only the shark , minus the kayak .
On August 24 the shark appeared on a social news website in the form of a photograph taken from the open window of a car driving along a flooded street .
Next to the car was “ my ” white shark swimming through the flooded streets of Puerto Rico .
The image was then picked up and used in a TV bulletin on Channel 7 News Miami .
A closer examination of the shark revealed that it was identical to the shark following the kayak in my photograph .
It appears that a crafty Photoshop artist superimposed the shark into a scene of a flooded street .
The composite resurfaced again in June of 2012 , when a shark tank supposedly burst in a popular mall in Kuwait .
The photo depicted two sharks ( one of which was mine ) swimming at the bottom of a submerged escalator .
The most recent incarnation appeared in the wake of Hurricane Sandy , which devastated the eastern coast of the U.S.
This time , the shark made the same appearance outside a car window in the flooded streets of New Jersey .
I always look forward to receiving e-mails from friends and family who have spotted the same white shark in a different context .
While I will probably never become a legend in my own right , at least my white shark is well on her way .

Fragile X is linked to over - activity in the brain
There is currently no treatment for fragile X syndrome , also linked to epilepsy and abnormal body growth , but the new work raises hopes of progress .
A Massachusetts team were able to trigger big improvements in mice by tweaking just one gene .
The results of the study are published in the journal Neuron .
These findings have major therapeutic implications for fragile X syndrome and autism
Dr Mark Bear
Picower Institute for Learning and Memory
Fragile X is caused by the loss of a gene called FMRP which produces a protein which acts as a brake on protein synthesis in specific areas of brain circuitry .
The theory is that this allows another protein - mGluR5 - which stimulates this process to function unchecked , resulting in over - activity in the brain .
The researchers , from the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , examined mice which lack the FMRP gene , and show many of the symptoms associated with fragile X .
They also created mice that not only lacked FMRP , but also had a 50 % reduction in mGluR5 .
Fewer abnormalities
This second group of mice showed fewer symptoms of fragile X , fewer signs of abnormalities in the brain , and fewer signs of abnormal body growth .
FRAGILE X SYNDROME
Boys usually more severely affected Main problem is mental impairment Other symptoms include hyperactivity , attention deficit disorder , emotional and behavioural problems , anxiety and mood swings
There may also be characteristic facial features , such as a long face and large ears
Other physical features include flat feet and hyperextensible joints
For example , loss of the FMRP gene produces overgrowth of connections between nerve cells called dendritic spines .
However , when coupled with a 50 % reduction in mGluR5 , spine density was completely normal .
The ' double mutant ' mice also showed substantial reduction in epileptic seizures .
Lead researcher Dr Mark Bear said : " These findings have major therapeutic implications for fragile X syndrome and autism . "
Dr Mark Hirst , scientific adviser to UK Fragile X Society , said : " Whilst we know that many proteins are regulated by the fragile X protein , and are therefore disrupted in fragile X individuals , mGluR5 seems to be one of the most important . "
However , he stressed that the mice in the study had benefited from reduced levels of mGluR5 throughout their development - something it would be not be able to replicate in a human drug treatment .
He added : " We must not take our eye off the other proteins that are mis-regulated , as the basis of fragile X syndrome is likely to be more complex and involve other pathways . "
The NBA does n't have an image problem .
It has young guys who have young ideas .
Maturity comes later , and sometimes too late to realize you should 've done this or you should 've done that .
Kids should n't come out of school as early as they do .
A year in college is n't enough .
They should n't be allowed to come out until they are adults — 21 years old .
Now , why should n't a black kid who is n't wealthy have a chance to provide for his family ?
That is an issue ; I 'm not walking away from that .
The problem is some kids are mature and ready to deal with the whole NBA atmosphere , but many more kids are not .
I was a mature guy coming out of North Carolina , so when a negative thing happened — someone misinterprets what gambling means to me — it did n't stick .
I stepped forward and said , " This is what I did , this is not jeopardizing anything , this is not an addiction , " and the public listened .
But I was a lot more mature when it happened .
If I 'd been in that position and had been asked that question at 18 or 19 , I may have had a very different way of handling it .
When I turned pro , the league was looking for a change .
I had the personality and the game and a style of play , and all that came together at the same time .
All the stars lined up and catapulted everything that came after — 23 different shoes , Jordan Brand , everything .
It 's a phenomenon .
How do you explain a phenomenon ?
You can't .
The only advice I can give to someone in the league now is to be original .
The consumer is n't dumb .
He or she can sense things being knocked off .
Originality is what lasts .
David Stern hates when I say this , but in some ways he created his own problem .
Look at the way the league markets its players .
When I came in , they marketed the athletes themselves , how they performed , what they accomplished .
To reinvent someone is very difficult .
When you say a player is today 's Michael Jordan or today 's Magic Johnson , the first thing the public will do is compare him to the real Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson .
When the public does n't see the same degree of success , you 've just dug yourself a deeper hole .
You have to show the consumers something they have n't seen before , someone about whom they can say , " Hey , that guy is pretty cool . "
Magic , Larry Bird , Charles Barkley , myself — we did n't start out as the league 's partners .
We evolved , then the league made us its partners .
That 's what the league has to do now — find guys who can grow up to be partners .
Do n't take guys and force them into our mold .
One thing to learn from me is that everything I 've ever done has been me , not something that someone calculated me to be .
It goes to my upbringing , my parents .
I did n't grow up in the inner city .
I grew up in a rural area , where values were magnified .
You were taught how to operate in society , to be articulate , honest .
Kids growing up in the city , they 're more materialistic .
My kids are going through that now .
I can wear a suit today and jeans with holes tomorrow , and yet people know they are seeing the real me in either outfit .
I had cornrows when I was a kid , but it was before anyone knew who I was ; would the public or corporate America accept me if I had them today ?
If I was willing to say , " This is who I am , I 'm not trying to be so - and - so , " maybe , but even then I 'm not sure .
When you see Michael Jordan today , you see Michael Jordan as a totally honest person , and when I say honest I mean real , genuine .
I am who I am , and that 's comprehensible to the masses and in many languages .
It 's a tough task for the league to create a similar image for itself .
It has to find the right mix between corporate and street , believe in what it 's doing and live with whatever the response may be .
Too many of the league 's decisions are made based on the bottom line .
People pick up on that .
You can't be afraid to fail .
The stars you have now might not live up to the icon of a Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson , but maybe they will create an image that delivers an impact for you 10 , 15 years from now .
All I know is — for the league and its players — do n't try to duplicate something that has been done before .
Do it your own way , and see where it goes .
It might not hit the way you want it to .
You may not make as much money as you want to .
But there 's value in remaining true to yourself .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new campaign finance report filed with the Senate shows Sen. Larry Craig spent about $ 23,000 in campaign money on lawyers in his ethics investigation .
Sen .
Larry Craig faces an investigation of his actions after his June arrest in a sex sting in a public restroom .
The Idaho Republican faces a Senate Ethics Committee investigation of his actions after his June arrest in a sex sting in a public restroom at Minneapolis International Airport in Minnesota .
He pleaded guilty in writing two months later to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge , and a soliciting charge was dropped .
Craig wants the Minnesota Court of Appeals to overturn a judge 's decision refusing to let him withdraw his guilty plea .
The campaign finance report did not indicate money spent from his campaign coffers on his criminal defense , but Craig spokesman Dan Whiting said Friday the three - term Republican would use that money on various aspects of his criminal defense .
Campaign finance laws generally ban using such funds on items not directly related to one 's official duties as an officeholder or candidate , but Whiting said the senator 's spending was legal .
" There is well - established case law at the FEC demonstrating it is allowable , " he said , referring to the Federal Election Commission .
One election law expert disagreed to some extent .
" It 's pretty clear he can use his campaign funds for his defense in the ethics committee probe since it is related to his being an officeholder , " said Larry Noble , former general counsel for the FEC .
" The criminal proceeding is a closer call .
The alleged act in question was not related to his official duties , so there is an argument it is a personal expense and he cannot use campaign funds . "
Noble is now an election law attorney with the Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom law firm in Washington .
The Senate Ethics Committee wants to determine whether Craig violated Senate ethics rules by engaging in behavior that reflects poorly on the institution .
It will also examine the arresting officer 's allegation that Craig showed his Senate business card and said , " What do you think of that ? " in a presumed effort to use his position to avoid prosecution .
In the criminal case , Craig 's lawyers will argue that a state law related to his misdemeanor conviction is unconstitutional and that it would be " manifest injustice " not to allow the lawmaker to withdraw his guilty plea .
The legal strategy was revealed Friday in a filing with the Minnesota Court of Appeals , which is expected to hear his case sometime next year .
Craig 's lawyers last week announced their intention to appeal after a state judge refused on October 4 to allow the senator to withdraw his earlier plea .
Judge Charles Porter said the plea " was accurate , voluntary and intelligent , and ... supported by the evidence . "
Craig had earlier promised to resign if the judge ruled against his motion , but he changed his mind and vowed to stay in office until his term expires in early 2009 .
He is not seeking re-election .
In his most recent filing , Craig 's lawyers claimed " the plea was not supported by the evidence " and " was defective because it was not accepted by the sentencing judge . "
They also said the facts of the case make the disorderly conduct charge unconstitutional .
Porter had earlier dismissed all those arguments .
The state appeals court has not said when or whether it would hold oral arguments , but Craig 's attorneys in their motion made no request for an expedited hearing , meaning the case may not be heard for months .
The court will not retry the case , only focus on whether the state trial judge made legal errors .
Three of the court 's 16 judges will either sit for arguments or review the facts of the case in private .
They then will have 90 days to make a ruling .
Craig was not allowed to appeal directly to the Minnesota Supreme Court , which could eventually be the final arbiter of the case .
Depending on the outcome of the latest appeals , the state 's high court has the option of accepting or rejecting any further consideration of the case .
The state Supreme Court accepts only about 5 percent of appeals for further review , according to court officials .
The case is Craig v. Minnesota ( A07-1949 ) .

Former Presidential Candidate Who Advocated Peace and Impeachment Facing Well - Financed Challenge at Home
On the Hill some call it being McKinney ’d – the treatment Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney received when she was in Congress .
Twice , rather than protecting the incumbent , the Democrats put up well funded challengers against her .
Now , it looks like Dennis Kucinich may be facing the same treatment in Cleveland .
There is a report circulating the web that before the Nevada primary Kucinich was visited by representatives of Nancy Pelosi and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the right wing Israeli lobby .
They told him that if he would drop his campaigns to impeach Cheney and Bush , they would guarantee his re-election to the House of Representatives .
Kucinich threw them out of his office .
See , http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2008/02/371899.shtml .
Kucinich has aggressively challenged the Democratic Party leadership in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail on the issues of war , civil liberties , impeachment and big business control of government .
He ’s even refused to pledge to endorse the party ’s presidential nominee .
The Democratic leadership has insisted that impeachment was off the table since taking control of the House in 2006 .
Congressman Conyers , Chair of the Judiciary Committee , has even refused to investigate whether President Bush and Vice President Cheney have violated the law .
But Kucinich pushed the issue .
He introduced articles of impeachment against Cheney , then against Bush and he brought the issue up on the House floor .
He pushed and pushed to try to make sure the president and vice president were not above the law .
On the campaign trail he did n’t let Senator Clinton or Obama get away with campaign peace rhetoric in the Democratic primary while they voted war funding with no strings attached in the senate .
He pointed out that their rhetoric was not consistent with their actions .
He pushed the issue of all troops being removed ; while Obama and Clinton parse their words carefully making it clear they will withdraw only some of the troops and neither promising a complete troop withdrawal even by 2012 .
And he pierced the veil of campaign rhetoric of Democrats who call for “ universal health care ” but put forward plans that will enrich their donors in the private health insurance industry .
On issue after issue Kucinich pushed against the Democratic Party leadership – now , it seems he is paying a price .
I n Cleveland , Kucinich is being challenged by several candidates .
The one that is getting the most attention and funding is City Councilman Joe Cimperman .
He ’s served on the council for ten years and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from real estate interests to challenge Kucinich .
He ’s been saying that Kucinich focuses too much on campaigning for president and not on the district .
The Mayor of Cleveland and the Cleveland Plain Dealer has endorsed Cimperman .
Kucinich , who has been focused on the presidential campaign , has very little money in the bank ( reportedly only about $ 30,000 ) .
He ’s been putting out fundraising appeals ( see , e.g. , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LehCxhHPXQ8 ) and has a fundraiser planned with Sean Penn .
Back home the issue of right wing Israeli lobby funding is becoming an issue .
Cimperman put out a press release that urges Kucinich to refute a report in the People ’s Weekly World Newspaper that said the “ Kucinich campaign charged ” that Cimperman ’s effort to unseat Kucinich was financed in large part from “ a right - wing pro-Israel group . ”
Cimperman has been somewhat theatrical in his campaign .
He ’s been putting up signs “ Where ’s Dennis ? ” and describing him as a “ Missing Congressman . ”
Cimperman took the poster to Kucinch ’s office and delivered a copy on videotape .
See http://youtube.com/watch?v=Pd-8nwj7GWY
.
Kucinich responded by asking Homeland Security to investigate the filming of government property .
Cimperman responded with another video calling Kucinch a hypocrite for violating his privacy while railing against government intrusion into people ’s lives .
See http://youtube.com/watch?v=lJsC99FDdeQ&feature=user .
No doubt if Kucinch had kow - towed to Nancy Pelosi , been less aggressive in his comments in the presidential debates and agreed to endorse the Democratic presidential nominee , the Democratic Party would be discouraging opponents and coming to the aid of an incumbent who has been in the House since 1996 .
But elected officials like McKinney and Kucinch who challenge the Democratic Party line – who think for themselves and feel a responsibility to fight for their constituents and challenge corporate power – are a hindrance to the party leadership .
They get in the way and let the public know what is really going on .
So , they must be either tamed or made an example of .
If Kucinich gets McKinney ’d you can be sure the message will be received .
Those , like Congressman Conyers , who ’ve been around for awhile ( Conyers has been in the House since 1965 ) know better than to step too far out of line .
So , Conyers has remained silent on Bush ’s law breaking – protecting his committee chairmanship by being afraid to use it .
Conyers has been tamed but Kucinich has n’t .
So , Kucinich needs to be taught a lesson that other members will learn from .
The growing revolt of the “ Out of Iraq Caucus ” needs to be kept impotent .
Knocking out Kucinich will prevent others from too loudly disobeying leadership .
Kucinich has faced tough battles in Cleveland before .
When he was mayor he stood up to corporate interests that wanted to take over Cleveland ’s public utility and survived a recall election .
And , Cimperman is not the only challenger , there are several , so the anti-Kucinich vote may be sufficiently divided for the congressman to retain his seat .
Steve Jobs has received a New Year nastygram from a woman who is upset that iPods wo n't play Microsoft DRM - crippled songs as well as Apple DRM - crippled songs .
Lawyers representing Stacie Somers filed a federal anti-trust complaint in Northern California District Court in San Jose on New Year 's eve .
The suit alleges that : " Apple has engaged in tying and monopolising behaviour , placing unneeded and unjustifiable technological restrictions on its most popular products in an effort to restrict consumer choice , and to restrain what little remains of its competition in the digital music markets . "
Somers ' legal beagles point to Apple 's use of PortalPlayer media chips in iPods .
They 're commodity parts that decode MP3s and WMA files .
Apple disables the WMA capability because it does not pay Microsoft 's Windows Media licensing fees .
According to the complaint , this means " Apple 's crippleware operating system software prevents the iPod Shuffle from playing WMA files " .
" Apple 's iPod is alone among mass - market Digital Music Players in not supporting the WMA format , " it continues .
Apple is abusing its huge share of the music player market by supporting only its inhouse Fairplay DRM , they reckon .
Somers is n't the first to make the claim by a long chalk .
This time , the claims are predicated on the increasingly outmoded view that rights owners " are generally unwilling to license their music for online sale except in protected formats " .
Amazon now carries unlocked MP3s from three of the four major labels , along with hundreds of independents .
It 's worth highlighting the irony of attacking one alleged monopolists ' media lock - in system by complaining that it does n't support another , convicted monopolists ' media lock - in .
Somers ' lawyers call on European investigations of iTunes to back up their anti-trust allegations .
The links seem weak , however : the EU is investigating how Apple forces consumers to use the iTunes store for their own country , not probing anti-trust concerns .
Norway , meanwhile , has taken a pop at Apple 's own Fairplay DRM system , not its lack of WMA support .
El Jobso himself has called for DRM to be dropped across the board by record labels .
For what it 's worth , Somers ' court filing is here .
Apple told Information
Week it does n't comment on pending litigation . ®

President Bush and the Republicans have been doing their best to scare the pants off the American people by lying through their teeth about the current FISA legislation and the fact - challenged pundits on Fox News Sunday did their best to perpetuate those lies this morning .
The perception they 're trying to give is that if the FISA legislation is n't passed , our intelligence community will have to shut down operations and will no longer be able to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists -- which is absurd .
William Kristol is dumbfounded as to why the Democrats do n't believe the president and his appointees ( who cares that they have been lying to us for years ? ) , when they say we 'll all die if this legislation is n't passed .
Luckily , Juan Williams steps in with the reality the GOP is n't telling the public - the U.S. government can STILL do surveillance on suspected terrorists without telecom immunity .
Government reports confirm that half of the working poor , elderly and disabled who lived in New Orleans before Katrina have not returned .
Because of critical shortages in low cost housing , few now expect tens of thousands of poor and working people to ever be able to return home .
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals ( DHH ) reports Medicaid , medical assistance for aged , blind , disabled and low - wage working families , is down 46 % from pre-Katrina levels .
DHH reports before Katrina there were 134,249 people in New Orleans on Medicaid .
February 2008 reports show participation down to 72,211 ( a loss of 62,038 since Katrina ) .
Medicaid is down dramatically in every category : by 50 % for the aged , 53 % for blind , 48 % for the disabled and 52 % for children .
The Social Security Administration documents that fewer than half the elderly are back .
New Orleans was home to 37,805 retired workers who received Social Security before Katrina , now there are 18,940 — a 50 % reduction .
Before Katrina , there were 12,870 disabled workers receiving Social Security Disability in New Orleans , now there are 5350 — 59 % less .
Before there were 9425 widowers in New Orleans receiving Social Security survivor ’s benefits , now there are less than half , 4140 .
Children of working class families have not returned .
Public school enrollment in New Orleans was 66,372 before Katrina .
Latest figures are 32,149 — a 52 % reduction .
Public transit numbers are down 75 % since Katrina .
Prior to Katrina there were frequently over 3 million rides per month .
In January 2008 , there were 732,000 rides .
The Regional Transit Authority says the reduction reflects that New Orleans has far fewer poorer , transit dependent residents .
Figures from the Louisiana Department of Social Services show the number of families receiving food stamps in New Orleans has dropped from 46,551 in June of 2005 to 22,768 in January 2008 .
Welfare numbers are also down .
The Louisiana Families Independence Temporary Assistance Program was down from 5764 recipients ( mostly children ) in July 2005 to 1412 in the latest report .
While there are no precise figures on the racial breakdown of the poor and working people still displaced , indications strongly suggest they are overwhelmingly African American .
The black population of New Orleans has plummeted by 57 percent , while white population fell 36 percent , according to census data .
The areas which are fully recovering are more affluent and predominately white .
New Orleans , which was 67 percent black before Katrina , is estimated to be no higher than 58 percent black now .
The reduction in poor and low - wage workers in New Orleans is no surprise to social workers .
Don Everard , director of social service agency Hope House , says New Orleans is a much tougher town for poor people than before Katrina .
“ Housing costs a lot more and there is much less of it , ” says Everard .
“ The job market is also very unstable .
The rise in wages after Katrina has mostly fallen backwards and people are not getting enough hours of work on a regular basis . ”
The displacement of tens of thousands of people is now expected to be permanent because there is both a current shortage of affordable housing and no plan to create affordable rental housing for tens of thousands of the displaced .
In the most blatant sign of government action to reduce the numbers of poor people in New Orleans , the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) is demolishing thousands of intact public housing apartments .
HUD is spending nearly a billion dollars with questionable developers to end up with much less affordable housing .
Right after Katrina , HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson predicted New Orleans was “ not going to be as black as it was for a long time , if ever again . ”
He then worked to make that prediction true .
According to Policy Link , a national research institute , the crisis in affordable housing means barely 2 in 5 renters in Louisiana can return to affordable homes .
In New Orleans , all the funds currently approved by HUD and other government agencies ( not spent , only approved ) for housing for low - income renters will only rebuild one - third of the pre-Katrina affordable rental housing stock .
Hope House sees four to five hundred needy people a month .
“ Most of the people we see are working people facing eviction , utility cutoffs , or they are already homeless ” reports Everard .
The New Orleans homeless population has already doubled from pre-Katrina numbers to approximately 12,000 people .
Everard noted that because of FEMA ’s recent announcement that it was closing 35,000 still occupied trailers across the gulf , homelessness is likely to get a lot worse .
United Nations officials recently called for an immediate halt to the demolitions of public housing in New Orleans saying demolition is a violation of human rights and will force predominately black residents into homelessness .
“ The spiraling costs of private housing and rental units , and in particular the demolition of public housing , puts these communities in further distress , increasing poverty and homelessness , ” said a joint statement by UN experts in housing and minority issues .
“ We therefore call on the Federal Government and State and local authorities to immediately halt the demolitions of public housing in New Orleans . ”
Similar calls have been made by Senators Clinton and Obama .
Despite these calls , the demolitions continue .
The rebuilding has gone as many planned .
Right after Katrina , one wealthy businessman told the Wall Street Journal , “ Those who want to see this city rebuilt want to see it done in a completely different way : demographically , geographically and politically . ”
Elected officials , from national officials like President Bush and HUD Secretary Jackson to local city council members , who are presumably sleeping in their own beds , apparently concur .
Policies put in place so far do not appear overly concerned about the tens of thousands of working poor , the elderly and the disabled who are not able to come home .
The political implications of a dramatic reduction in poor and working mostly African American people in New Orleans are straightforward .
The reduction directly helps Republicans who have fought for years to reduce the impact of the overwhelmingly Democratic New Orleans on state - wide politics in Louisiana .
In the jargon of political experts , Louisiana , before Katrina , was a “ pink state . ”
The state went for Clinton twice and then for Bush twice , with U.S. Senators from each party .
The forced relocation of hundreds of thousands , mostly lower income and African - American , could alter the balance between the two major parties in Louisiana and the opportunities for black elected officials in New Orleans .
Given the political and governmental officials and policies in place now , one of the major casualties of Katrina will be the permanent displacement of tens of thousands of African Americans , the working poor , their children , the elderly , and the disabled .
Those who wanted a different New Orleans rebuilt probably see the concentrated displacement as a success .
However , if the test of a society is how it treats its weakest and most vulnerable members , the aftermath of Katrina earns all of us a failing grade .

Imagine that I , in full view of live television cameras , raised my hands and chanted abracadabra and caused a brilliant light to be born , flaring in empty space beyond my outstretched hands .
Imagine that I committed this act of blatant , unmistakeable sorcery under the full supervision of James Randi and all skeptical armies .
Most people , I think , would be fairly curious as to what was going on .
But now suppose instead that I do n’t go on television .
I do not wish to share the power , nor the truth behind it .
I want to keep my sorcery secret .
And yet I also want to cast my spells whenever and wherever I please .
I want to cast my brilliant flare of light so that I can read a book on the train — without anyone becoming curious .
Is there a spell that stops curiosity ?
Yes indeed !
Whenever anyone asks “ How did you do that ? ” I just say “ Science ! ”
It ’s not a real explanation , so much as a curiosity - stopper .
It does n’t tell you whether the light will brighten or fade , change color in hue or saturation , and it certainly does n’t tell you how to make a similar light yourself .
You do n’t actually know anything more than you knew before I said the magic word .
But you turn away , satisfied that nothing unusual is going on .
Better yet , the same trick works with a standard light switch .
Flip a switch and a light bulb turns on .
Why ?
In school , one is taught that the password to the light bulb is “ Electricity ! ”
By now , I hope , you ’re wary of marking the light bulb “ understood ” on such a basis .
Does saying “ Electricity ! ” let you do calculations that will control your anticipation of experience ?
There is , at the least , a great deal more to learn .
1
If you thought the light bulb was scientifically inexplicable , it would seize the entirety of your attention .
You would drop whatever else you were doing , and focus on that light bulb .
But what does the phrase “ scientifically explicable ” mean ?
It means that someone else knows how the light bulb works .
When you are told the light bulb is “ scientifically explicable , ” you do n’t know more than you knew earlier ; you do n’t know whether the light bulb will brighten or fade .
But because someone else knows , it devalues the knowledge in your eyes .
You become less curious .
Someone is bound to say , “ If the light bulb were unknown to science , you could gain fame and fortune by investigating it . ”
But I ’m not talking about greed .
I ’m not talking about career ambition .
I ’m talking about the raw emotion of curiosity — the feeling of being intrigued .
Why should your curiosity be diminished because someone else , not you , knows how the light bulb works ?
Is this not spite ?
It ’s not enough for you to know ; other people must also be ignorant , or you wo n’t be happy ?
There are goods that knowledge may serve besides curiosity , such as the social utility of technology .
For these instrumental goods , it matters whether some other entity in local space already knows .
But for my own curiosity , why should it matter ?
Besides , consider the consequences if you permit “ Someone else knows the answer ” to function as a curiosity - stopper .
One day you walk into your living room and see a giant green elephant , seemingly hovering in midair , surrounded by an aura of silver light .
“ What the heck ? ” you say .
And a voice comes from above the elephant , saying ,
“ Oh , ” you say , “ in that case , never mind , ” and walk on to the kitchen .
I do n’t know the grand unified theory for this universe ’s laws of physics .
I also do n’t know much about human anatomy with the exception of the brain .
I could n’t point out on my body where my kidneys are , and I ca n’t recall offhand what my liver does .
2
Should I , so far as curiosity is concerned , be more intrigued by my ignorance of the ultimate laws of physics , than the fact that I do n’t know much about what goes on inside my own body ?
If I raised my hands and cast a light spell , you would be intrigued .
Should you be any less intrigued by the very fact that I raised my hands ?
When you raise your arm and wave a hand around , this act of will is coordinated by ( among other brain areas ) your cerebellum .
I bet you do n’t know how the cerebellum works .
I know a little — though only the gross details , not enough to perform calculations . . . but so what ?
What does that matter , if you do n’t know ?
Why should there be a double standard of curiosity for sorcery and hand motions ?
Look at yourself in the mirror .
Do you know what you ’re looking at ?
Do you know what looks out from behind your eyes ?
Do you know what you are ?
Some of that answer Science knows , and some of it Science does not .
But why should that distinction matter to your curiosity , if you do n’t know ?
Do you know how your knees work ?
Do you know how your shoes were made ?
Do you know why your computer monitor glows ?
Do you know why water is wet ?
The world around you is full of puzzles .
Prioritize , if you must .
But do not complain that cruel Science has emptied the world of mystery .
With reasoning such as that , I could get you to overlook an elephant in your living room .
Air Traffic Controller --
" Avianca 052 heavy roger what is your alternate ?
" Avianca 052 -- “
It is Boston but we ca n’t do it now we , we will run out of fuel now .
“ That was a radio exchange between Avianca Airlines flight 052 and an air traffic controller , 47 minutes before the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed .
The flight was trying to land at New York ’s John F. Kennedy ( JFK ) airport .
Avianca 052 had been placed into different holding patterns on three separate occasions during its flight .
It was repeatedly placed in holding for one simple reason -- the number of airplanes scheduled to land at JFK exceeded the capacity of the airport .
That was a fact in 1990 when this accident occurred and it is still a fact today .
The press runs a story about air traffic control ( ATC ) virtually every day now .
The stories cover a variety of issues .
The Bush Administration wants funding for a new ATC system called “ NextGen ” , various groups are suing the FAA for redesigning the departure and arrival routes into New York ( thereby increasing the noise in their neighborhoods ) and it seems as if everyone is upset by the FAA ’s proposal to impose limitations on the number of flights into JFK .
It appears as if all have forgotten the lessons of Avianca 052 .
Various entities in aviation are using the complexities found in air traffic control to obscure the basic facts in order to further their agendas .
The basic fact I would like to clarify is the finite capacity of a runway .
I too have an agenda .
My agenda is safety .
Any runway has a finite capacity .
The key to understanding this is in understanding time .
Only one aircraft is allowed to use the runway at any time .
It takes a certain amount of time for a departing aircraft to taxi onto a runway , accelerate to flying speed and lift off .
Likewise , it takes a certain amount of time for an arriving aircraft to touch down , slow down and taxi off the runway .
The time it takes the typical airliner to do either one -- land or takeoff -- is roughly one minute .
The math is as simple as it is inescapable .
Roughly 60 airliners can use a runway in one hour if conditions are absolutely perfect .
It is physically impossible to improve that number .
However , it can get a lot worse .
It helps in understanding all this if you ’ll focus on the simple , physical acts required in aviation instead of dwelling on the confusing complexities .
Imagine it is foggy at the airport .
An aircraft landing on the runway has to find a taxiway to get off the runway just as you must find the entrance to the parking lot when you ’re driving down a foggy street .
In good visibility , you can see the entrance from a distance and slow down at the last second .
In poor visibility ( rain , fog , snow ) you must slow down to ensure you have enough time to spot the entrance and then make the turn .
Every extra second an aircraft spends on the runway -- searching for the taxiway -- decreases the capacity of the runway .
There is another aircraft flying towards the same runway and air traffic controllers cannot allow it to land until the first aircraft is clear of the runway .
For air traffic controllers , time equates to distance .
If an aircraft is over the threshold of the runway and about to touch down , we know that it will take approximately one minute for that aircraft to touch down , slow down and taxi off the runway .
That means that the next aircraft to land must be at least one minute behind the one about to land .
To keep matters simple , I ’ll use an average aircraft approach speed of 180 mph -- or 3 miles per minute .
If you could visualize an air traffic controllers ’s radar scope in these optimal conditions you would see a string of aircraft aligned with the runway and spaced out at 3 mile intervals .
Not so coincidentally , the legal separation controllers must use in this situation -- the distance required between each aircraft -- is 3 miles .
Let ’s take this optimal situation one step further .
If you could line up an hour ’s worth of arrivals , one minute apart -- 3 miles -- then you would have 60 aircraft in a straight line .
That line would stretch out 180 miles from the airport .
Furthermore , the last aircraft in that line would be limited to flying no faster than 180 mph lest it catch the aircraft in front of it .
Again , the important concept to grasp is that the distance and the speed puts the airplane one hour away from the airport .
For aircraft landing at JFK , the line would stretch past Philadelphia , almost to Baltimore .
Aircraft flying from either city to JFK would be waiting in line before they even left the ground .
Pilot --“... you happy with that distance ?
” Co-pilot -- ” aah , he's .... we 'll be all right once we get rollin ' .
he 's supposed to be five miles by the time we 're airborne , that 's the idea .
” That was the conversation between the pilot and co-pilot of an airliner about to depart JFK airport .
They ’re discussing the distance between their aircraft and the Boeing 747 that had just departed in front of them .
The pilots are concerned about wake turbulence -- the violently disturbed air found behind large aircraft .
Just two minutes later , their aircraft did indeed encounter wake turbulence .
When the pilot tried to compensate for the turbulence , the tail of the airplane snapped off .
All 260 people aboard American Airlines flight 587 -- and 5 people on the ground in Belle Harbor , NY -- perished that day .
It all started with wake turbulence .
What the accident investigations , the cockpit voice recorders and the air traffic control tapes do n’t reveal to you is the enormous pressure the people in aviation work under .
Pilots , air traffic controllers and even airline CEOs are under constant pressure to make the airplanes fly and to make sure they fly on time .
The pressure to fly in poor weather , to tighten up the spacing between aircraft and to wring every last drop of efficiency out of the system is incredible .
The aviation industry can’t afford to let these economic pressures erase the memory of the expensive safety lessons we ’ve learned in the past .
The cost in lives and money is simply too high .
The media have devoted many stories to the FAA ’s future air traffic control system called NextGen -- Next Generation Air Transportation System .
It is the “ satellite - based ” air traffic control system that is touted as the cure - all for the current airline delays .
One of the basic premises of the system is that -- because of its greater accuracy -- it will allow airplanes to fly closer to each other .
Admittedly , there are some ( very limited ) instances in air traffic control where this would be desirable .
But it wo n’t solve the core problem -- runway capacity .
Remembering the lessons above , you still need a minimum of three miles ( or one minute ) between landing airliners .
Controllers are capable of running airplanes closer together now -- with the current radar - based system -- but safety wo n’t allow them to do it .
Until the safety - mandated rule that only allows one airplane on the runway at a time changes , a system that allows controllers to run aircraft closer together wo n’t increase the runway ’s capacity .
While we are on this subject , I need to call your attention to another point about wake turbulence .
Wake turbulence exists behind departing and landing airliners .
Behind the largest aircraft -- classified as “ heavy ” aircraft -- the spacing requirements increase to 5 miles .
Remember that theoretical line of aircraft stretching out 180 miles from JFK airport ?
Throw in a couple of “ heavy ” airliners and the line will stretch past Washington , D.C.
In that these “ heavy ” type aircraft are typically the ones used on overseas routes , a large number of them use JFK .
All three aircraft involved in the accident scenarios noted above were indeed “ heavies . ” “ Air Traffic Controller -- Avianca 052roger what is your alternate ?
” These basic facts should give you some insight as to the complexities involved in air traffic control and airport capacity .
If you see a comparison in the press between traffic at Kennedy ( JFK ) and LaGuardia ( LGA ) , for instance , armed with the knowledge that JFK has many , many more “ heavy ” aircraft than LGA , you will understand that LGA can handle more airplanes per runway than JFK can .
Most of LGA ’s arrivals only need three miles of spacing while many of JFK ’s will have to be spaced five miles apart .
The most complex issue in determining runway capacity is weather .
Under the best weather conditions , JFK airport can handle 68 arrivals per hour -- using 3 of its 4 runways simultaneously .
If low clouds or visibility -- or even unfavorable winds -- force the controllers to use different runways , the arrival rate drops dramatically .
Even in relatively good weather the rate can drop to 51 arrivals per hour .
During typical bad weather the rate can drop to 38 .
And as we all know , during a thunderstorm or an ice storm , the rate can drop to virtually zero .
This brings us to the heart of the problem .
How do we determine a realistic capacity number for an airport when something as unpredictable as weather is the major variable ?
I propose the we use safety as the determining criteria .
First and foremost , as I hope I have shown you , there is an absolute limit to the number of airplanes any runway can handle , per hour , even in perfect weather .
At an absolute minimum that limit should be enforced -- by rule and regulation -- for every commercial airport in the country .
Currently it is not and -- unbelievably -- airlines are allowed to schedule more flights than the runways can handle in even perfect weather .
It is madness .
Let me use our theoretical runway capacity of 60 planes per hour once again .
Imagine if we could schedule it perfectly .
Imagine if we had 60 airplanes per hour scheduled for every hour of the day .
Then imagine if there was just one tiny glitch -- weather , a flat tire or an airport vehicle mistakenly wanders onto the runway .
An arrival has to go around and make another attempt to land .
Where do you find the extra slot for that aircraft ?
Every slot is taken for every minute of the day .
But the airplane must land or it will run out of fuel just like Avianca 052 .
That makes the decision easy for air traffic controllers .
An arrival takes priority over a departure .
They will use a departure slot for the arrival .
Now the departures will be delayed for the rest of the day -- or in this theoretical case -- for eternity .
The runway -- the system -- must have some “ give ” to it .
It must have some unused capacity in order to ensure safety .
In reality it does .
That unused capacity is after midnight .
That is the reason you see flights arriving at 1 or 2 AM after a day of bad weather .
There is no “ give ” -- during normal hours -- in the system when there is adverse weather .
This leads to the massive flight delays Americans suffered through this summer .
The reason is as old as it is simple -- greed .
Airlines can make more money selling 70 airplanes worth of tickets per hour than they could if they limited themselves to the 60 airplanes per hour that the runway can handle .
In fairness to the airlines , it ’s not in their interest to limit themselves .
It is easier to sell the tickets and blame the delays on the weather or the “ antiquated ” air traffic control system .
Especially if the flying public does n’t understand runway capacity limits and therefore fails to notice that the “ antiquated ” air traffic control system is delivering more airplanes to the runways than the runways can handle .
The government has abdicated its responsibility in this area .
The economic portion of the aviation industry was deregulated in 1978 .
The safety portion -- supposedly -- was not .
The Federal Aviation Administration has the legal authority to limit the number of flights into Kennedy , Newark , LaGuardia , Chicago O’Hare and Washington ( D.C. ) National airports .
The FAA should be given the same authority for all commercial airports .
And Congress should compel them to use that authority .
Currently they do not .
The FAA was forced into lifting the slots restrictions at JFK and the result was predictable -- massive delays .
The FAA reimposed slot restrictions at Chicago O’Hare ( after the last public outcry about delays ) and delays went down .
They are currently being pressured to relax or lift those restrictions at O’Hare .
If they do , you can be assured that increased delays at O’Hare will return .
Congress should pass legislation mandating that each commercial airport ’s maximum hourly capacity be established and published .
Furthermore , the FAA should impose limitations on the number of flights that can be scheduled at each commercial airport .
That number should be less than the maximum capacity , taking into account such factors as typical weather patterns for the airport , routine maintenance and any other factor that typically limits capacity .
It is time to recognize the inherent limits imposed upon the National Airspace System by runway capacity .
It is time to put safety ahead of economic considerations before we relearn the lessons of Avianca 052 .
It is time to put safety back in it ’s rightful place -- First .

Rush hour Death Valley : Hottest , Driest , Lowest
Distance driven : 447 miles
Heat : Bearable
Chance of rain : approx .
0 %
Tap water flavor : Not bad
Arrival
When we arrived at Death Valley 's Furnace Creek Ranch , we had been driving on dark , empty roads for hours .
It was great to see buildings with lights on .
We were starving , but the place we wanted to eat was closing soon and there was a dress code .
We checked into our room , threw on our nicer clothes , and rushed to dinner at the nearby Furnace Creek Inn just in time for the last seating of the night .
The Inn is actually a fancy resort , and the restaurant was surprisingly good given its remote location .
We thoroughly enjoyed dinner , including a fried cactus appetizer served with tomatillo salsa and prickly pear jam .
It was n't all prarie cuisine , though — the house specialty is a tasty duck a l'orange .
We went to bed looking forward to seeing Death Valley in the daylight .
Morning
We woke up early ( for us ) and took a look around the ranch .
Apart from one cheesy souvenir area , the scenery was beautiful .
The mountains are majestic , the valley is barren , and the Furnace Creek area maintains an oasis of greenery .
It 's just like Kid Nation !
It 's all St. Andrew 's fault .
Science Korner
In case you have n't noticed yet , Death Valley is hot and dry .
In fact , it 's both the hottest place and the driest place in all of North America .
This is all due to the surrounding mountains .
Here 's how it works .
Why it 's dry Wet air is generally heavier than dry air , so it sits like a blanket close to the ground .
This is why airplanes can take off in a rainstorm , break through the clouds , and fly above the weather .
When a mass of wet air is blown toward a mountain range , the wettest air ( closest to the ground ) smacks into the side of the mountain and has nowhere to go but up .
However , air gets colder at higher altitudes , which makes the wet air turn into rain .
All the moisture gets dumped out on the mountain , and the air that reaches the other side is significantly drier .
This is known as the rainshadow effect .
Death Valley is separated from the Pacific Ocean by five mountain ranges .
Places like the Sierra Nevada are so lush and snowy because they steal Death Valley 's rain .
Why it 's hot The mountains surrounding Death Valley form a basin which prevents the air from circulating to and from other regions .
As the sun causes the local temperature to rise , the hot air can't escape .
It just sits there and bakes .
Temperatures reach the 120's in the summer — which is why we came in the winter .
Why it 's low In addition to being hot and dry , Death Valley is also the lowest point of land in North America .
Usually such places get filled in as millions of years ' worth of rainwater carry in sediment , but when it hardly ever rains , the process is inhibited .
Badwater
It does rain a little , though — around two inches a year — and that moisture ends up a puddle in the lowest part of Death Valley .
It 's undrinkably salty , and thus that part of the park is known as Badwater .
It 's a big tourist spot — not so much for the puddle as for the sign marking 282 feet below sea level .
This is as low as I can get without my scuba gear or passport .
Click to zoom in and look for the " SEA LEVEL " sign .
The bad part about visiting the salt flats
Internet !
There are two motels and a hotel in Death Valley , but none of them have Internet access .
In fact , the Visitor 's Center is the only place in the whole park that does .
We stopped by with our laptops when we were done sightseeing .
They did indeed have a hotspot , though it seemed to be hooked to a dialup account .
Also it was 4:45 when we showed up , and they close at 5 .
However , one of the rangers told us they keep it on all night and that he knows from experience that it reaches the parking lot .
So after they closed , we sat outside in the cold and waited for our mail to go through .
While our data was transferring , Mike took a few long - exposure photos :

It ended in the pool .
The whole tragic cartoon .
That morning , it was last Labor Day , Seth and Phyllis Tobias woke up together in the master bedroom of their not - quite - finished dream home .
The $ 5 million , 6,700 - square - foot mansion is located in the Bear ’s Club , a gated community built on a golf course in Jupiter , Florida , twenty minutes north of Palm Beach .
Designed in the style of Addison Mizner , the house is very big and very faux — faux Spanish architectural themes , faux this and faux that .
There ’s a Ritz - Carlton condo complex in the development , too .
Phyllis liked to work out there , get massages , and have her hair blown out .
Seth had bought the house for Phyllis in late 2006 from an upscale Palm Beach broker named Linda Olsson .
It was a gesture of reconciliation after the couple had almost divorced .
There was a lot of that — reconciliation — but that ’s because there was also a lot of fighting .
You get the picture .
The home included a state - of - the - art office for Tobias , the founder and chief executive of Circle T , a quarter - billion - dollar Manhattan - based hedge fund .
The pool was in the backyard .
The day before , the couple had invited friends over for a barbecue .
The party broke up with Seth and Phyllis at each other ’s throat .
But by the next day , the couple had made up , and now they ’d decided to have lunch at the Breakers , the tony Palm Beach resort .
At about 5:30 p.m. , Seth and Phyllis left the hotel .
Over the course of the afternoon , they ’d rung up a $ 323 bill .
Phyllis went home to Jupiter .
Seth met up with this guy he ’d known since he was a kid , Brett Borgerson .
The two of them drove to a bar called E.R. Bradley’s .
Over the next two hours , Seth and Borgerson had a few more rounds .
Seth called his wife nineteen times , but she did n’t call him back .
It was getting dark , and Seth drove home .
He passed through the gates of the Bear ’s Club and pulled into their brick driveway .
At 8:08 p.m. , Tobias texted Borgerson to let him know he ’d gotten home safely .
Seth and Phyllis had dinner together and then , according to Phyllis , tried to have sex in the pool .
They eventually gave up , Phyllis says .
Seth was too drunk .
Phyllis went inside and began her nighttime beauty regimen .
After a shower , she walked downstairs and squinted through the gloaming .
She thought she caught a glimpse of Seth swimming naked in the pool .
Then she went back upstairs and got ready for bed .
But shortly after midnight , Phyllis called Brett Borgerson ’s wife and left a voice - mail that said , “ Please call me back , Seth is acting weird .
I do n’t know if he ’s passed out . ”
About half an hour later , she called 911 .
“ I do n’t know if my husband has passed out or what . ”
Her accent was thick , New Jersey .
The dispatcher asked if her husband was breathing .
“ I do n’t know , he ’s turned over ! ” Phyllis screamed .
“ Please just send me somebody .
He ’s outside [ in ] the pool . ”
She could then be heard shouting at her floating husband , “ Seth , do n’t play with me . ”
About fifteen minutes later , a Jupiter Police Department squad car arrived , and two officers shone their flashlights into the pool .
The lights eventually settled on Phyllis .
She was holding Seth in the shallow end .
Paramedics arrived and began CPR .
Geysers of water shot out of Seth ’s lungs ; rigor mortis had already set in .
At 1:08 a.m. , Seth Tobias was pronounced dead .
He was 44 .
Before Seth Tobias wound up dead in his pool ; before the accusations surfaced that his wife was a thrice - divorced pill - popper and cocaine user who drugged Seth and killed him for his money ; before the claims that Seth had led a secret life in which he drank too much , snorted a boatload of coke , and liked to pick up male hustlers and strippers , including one named Tiger ; before Seth ’s brothers filed suit in Palm Beach to block Phyllis from getting her hands on Seth ’s estimated $ 25 million estate ; and certainly before I found myself face - to - face with the main source of all the dirt — a 300 - pound gay con man and Internet psychic with a long criminal history named Billy Ash who claims to have been the couple ’s personal assistant and may well have fabricated all or part of his claims regarding Seth and Phyllis because he ’s a proven liar and self - serving attention seeker …
Before all of that , Seth Tobias was known to the world , to the extent he was known at all , as an upright cable - TV talking head and multimillionaire hedge - fund manager .
But that ’s getting ahead of the story .
Let ’s just start at the beginning .
Seth Tobias was raised in Plymouth Meeting , a well - to - do suburb of Philadelphia .
His father was a doctor , his parents got divorced .
It was a common story .
After high school , Tobias went to Boston University , where he was an indifferent student majoring in finance .
In his early twenties , Tobias commuted from Philadelphia to New York on the 5:55 “ Triple Nickel ” train to a series of jobs on Wall Street .
Some of the jobs worked out , some did n’t .
At 24 , he got his first break .
That ’s when Tobias began processing trades for a then - unknown portfolio manager named Jim Cramer .
Tobias impressed Cramer , but the job did n’t last long .
Tobias traded up to a position with the much larger JRO Associates hedge fund .
Five years later , Tobias headed out on his own .
Tobias founded Circle T in 1996 , at age 32 .
He named the company after the first letter of his last name , which he had tattooed on his left shoulder just after college .
He started the firm with just one other employee , Steve Schwartz , a 25 - year - old protégé of Tobias ’s from JRO .
He ’d sit there in the middle of the room , taking in all the data and chatter , and then bark a buy or sell order .
He seemed to have a gift for making the right call .
“ Seth could just tell when to get in and get out of a stock , ” says Schwartz .
“ Seconds matter .
He could see a movement in the cost of steel and figure out how that was going to impact companies that did business with GM and make a snap decision two , three moves ahead of other people . ”
Tobias lived for what he called “ the game , ” and to him it was a game — who could analyze a company ’s quarterly report or process a bit of information fastest and make the first move .
He had a pet ritual after the market ’s closing bell rang .
He ’d exhale , check his numbers , then call his friends at other hedge funds and ask them a simple question : “ Are you up or are you down ? ” Simple .
In the early days of Circle T , Tobias was mostly up .
By 2002 , the firm was valued at almost $ 500 million , and Tobias was personally worth tens of millions of dollars .
He bought homes — in suburban Philadelphia , on the Jersey shore , and in midtown Manhattan .
He bought a luxury box at Veterans Stadium , where the Philadelphia Eagles played .
A JRO colleague introduced Tobias to some pals at CNBC , and Tobias became a regular on the network ’s Squawk Box program .
Tobias also liked to party .
His longtime friend Patrick Bransome said in a recent deposition that there were many nights when Tobias would get so loaded he had to drive him home .
Bransome would drop his friend on his couch and leave once Tobias passed out .
“ Look , Seth was a little crazy , ” a former colleague told me .
“ But we all are .
You have to have a screw loose to be in this business and take the risks .
You have to blow off steam , or you ’ll combust .
He liked to blow off steam , too ; we ’d go to strip clubs and go out drinking .
He just blew off steam a little harder than most . ”
It ’s shortly after New Year ’s , and I ’m in the West Palm Beach office of Jay Jacknin .
Jacknin , Phyllis Tobias ’s third husband , is serving as counsel to his ex-wife in the death of Seth Tobias .
He ’s a short , jolly man with hearing aids in both ears .
At one point , he reaches into a file and brings out a picture of Seth and Phyllis on a beach .
He starts to make a point about the case but then offers an aside .
“ She had a great body , ” he says .
“ Women love her .
Men find her fascinating .
I just could n’t afford her . ”
Phyllis Tobias was born Filomena Manente in 1966 and was raised in Union City , New Jersey .
She was brought up by a strict Italian family , and went to Catholic schools .
Now and then , she worked as a waitress .
Her nickname , a nod to her personality , was Sunny .
Just after she graduated from high school , in 1984 , she married Vince Racanati .
She was 18 , he was 24 .
They had a daughter but got divorced after a year .
Phyllis took a job as a secretary on Wall Street , where she met and married a twice - divorced stockbroker named Arthur Tolendini .
That was 1987 .
They lasted just three years .
Phyllis moved to Palm Beach and was selling insurance when she met Jacknin , a divorce attorney .
They got married in 1993 and had two children .
But in October 2002 Jacknin filed for divorce , claiming Phyllis had gotten numerous credit cards without his consent and run the balance to the maximum .
Jacknin did n’t move out of the couple ’s home after they separated .
He was worried about his two children .
Phyllis was furious about that .
The police were summoned three times in 2003 , and each time , Jay Jacknin said his wife was the aggressor .
He said she struck him , threw a phone , and pulled his hair .
In July 2003 , Phyllis got a restraining order against Jacknin , accusing him of assault .
Jacknin denied it and retaliated with his own statement .
He said Phyllis ’s violent moods had reduced him to barricading himself in the nanny ’s room .
He said that “ she will kill ” if he tries to gain custody of the kids .
Jacknin also said that Phyllis was on a cocktail of Xanax , Vicodin , and Ritalin and kept coke in the house .
He finished by saying that Phyllis had abandoned the children one weekend in July so she could spend time with her boyfriend at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach .
The boyfriend was Seth Tobias .
Seth and Phyllis met while they were both in San Diego for the 2003 Super Bowl .
The twist is , Jay Jacknin introduced them .
Jacknin actually knew Seth first .
The two men had met through a mutual friend , Daniel Borislow , an entrepreneur and racehorse owner from Philadelphia who spends part of the year in Palm Beach .
At the time , Tobias was separated from his first wife , Tricia White , a South Jersey native .
Phyllis was married to Jacknin , but they were fighting all the time and got divorced later that year .
Seth fell for Phyllis right away .
Why not ?
She was blonde , fit , and sexy .
Sure enough , Tobias told his brothers and Circle T partners that he was moving down to West Palm in pursuit of Phyllis .
“ I can run Circle T from down there , ” he said .
He and Phyllis could often be seen around town at the Breakers or black - tie charity events .
Seth and Phyllis ’s relationship was insane , even in the early days .
Phyllis blasted Seth about his coke habit , but they both were heavy drinkers , especially of Champagne .
A former Circle T employee says he personally saw Phyllis give Seth coke and use the drug herself on many occasions .
( Jacknin denies those claims . )
Seth questioned Phyllis ’s emotional stability .
They each accused one another of infidelity .
It went back and forth like that .
Seth and Phyllis split up for a while , with Seth returning to New York .
The former Circle T employee says that Seth told him that Sam Tobias was concerned , warning his brother , “ That woman is going to kill you or bankrupt you . ”
Tobias did n’t listen .
“ He was addicted , ” says the former Circle T employee , “ to Phyllis ’s ups and downs . ”
After another breakup , Seth was moping around New York and called Phyllis .
By the time he hung up , the two were engaged .
Knowing that Seth ’s friends and family disapproved , the couple eloped on March 4 , 2005 .
“ Seth just did n’t show up for work , and we did n’t know where the hell he was , ” says the former Circle T staffer .
“ That afternoon , he called in all sheepish and said , ‘ I ’m in Belize .
I just got married . ’”
That summer , Circle T took a big financial hit .
Seth ’s Palm Beach pal Doug Kass had a son , Ethan , who was looking to break into the business , and Seth took him on .
In July 2005 , Google went public .
The question at the time was whether the $ 85 initial offering price was a good deal .
Ethan bet it was n’t .
Circle T lost $ 12 million when he shorted the stock .
The trades were n’t just wrong .
Seth had n’t signed off on them .
The firms ’ investments , almost half a billion dollars in 2003 , sank to $ 220 million after the Google screwup .
Many hedge funds booked monster years in 2005 , but Circle T was down 5.3 percent .
There were whispers that Seth was distracted by Phyllis .
Tobias ’s marriage was also tanking .
Phyllis would often appear at the office and demand cash .
“ Give me 15,000 fucking dollars .
Give me 15,000 fucking dollars , ” she hissed on one visit , according to the former Circle T staffer .
Tobias had promised Phyllis that he would stop using cocaine , but she did n’t believe him .
In the fall of 2005 , the couple was having dinner at Bice , a Palm Beach restaurant , with six other people .
Just after sitting down , Phyllis jumped from her seat and placed her lips over Tobias ’s nose and began sucking .
She was searching for cocaine residue .
A few weeks later , the couple returned to their West Palm Beach home after a night of drinking , and Tobias ripped down a set of drapes that Phyllis had purchased without his knowledge .
The police were called , and Phyllis claimed Tobias threw a jar at her .
He was arrested for assault , a charge eventually expunged from his record when Phyllis declined to press charges .
There were more fights , more police visits .
The following February , one night when she had n’t returned home from dinner by 2 a.m. , Tobias drove to Cucina , a West Palm Beach restaurant , and confronted Phyllis , who was having drinks with a male friend .

“ You ’re a whore ! ” Tobias screamed , according to police reports .
A passing officer witnessed the rest : “ F. Tobias immediately responded by striking S. Tobias across the left side of his face with an open hand .
The force of the slap turned S. Tobias ’ head and made a loud popping sound … it became clear she was intoxicated .
I had to grab F. Tobias so she could not get close enough to strike S. Tobias again .
I placed F. Tobias in handcuffs . ”
Phyllis spent a night a jail , but the charges were dropped .
On it went .
The West Palm Beach police answered a number of calls to the couple ’s home in their first year of marriage .
Just before the couple ’s first anniversary , Phyllis confronted her husband with evidence of an affair .
Tobias responded by filing for divorce on March 10 .
Three days later , the two engaged in an instant - message exchange :
Phyllis : YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF STOPPING TO DRINK , OR DOING YOUR COKE OR BEING HONEST …
Seth : I am sad about this .
Phyllis : I HOPE YOU GET AIDS WIT ALL THE WHORES YOU FUK TOO .
Seth : I am sorry … take a breather .
Phyllis : NOW IT ’S WAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ”
Phyllis cited her husband ’s infidelities , gambling losses , and unspecified “ illicit activity ” in her request for spousal support .
She asked for nearly $ 47,000 a month , including $ 9,429 for vacations , $ 1,000 for makeup , $ 4,400 for clothing , and $ 3,000 for unreimbursed counseling fees .
Her lawyer at the time argued that Tobias had promised a lifestyle grander than the one she could afford on Jay Jacknin ’s alimony .
Tobias responded by accusing his wife of forging his signature on expensive purchases , including a $ 74,000 Porsche .
The couple was on the verge of finalizing their divorce .
But within minutes of meeting with their lawyers Seth and Phyllis were apologizing , professing their love , and kissing at the conference table .
That ’s when Tobias promised to move Phyllis from their $ 1.75 million West Palm Beach home to the Bear ’s Club .
Phyllis was unsure .
The reason , she told Tobias , was that she was now running all her decisions past her online psychic .
This is where Billy comes in .
Billy Ash had a Website called askbilly.com , where he advertised himself as the winner of “ many titles ” including Best Psychic at the Las Vegas Psychic Convention .
Others had a less charitable view .
One rival displayed a picture of the 300 - pound Ash with the words “ Worst . Psychic . Ever . ”
Phyllis started e-mailing Billy through keen.com , an online psychic service , paying the standard $ 3.99 - a - minute rate .
Then the two started e-mailing directly .
According to Jay Jacknin , Ash told Phyllis that his clients included Sarah Jessica Parker and Nancy Reagan .
Jacknin also says that Ash once mailed Phyllis a necklace that Ash claimed the former First Lady had given him .
( Ash denies those claims . )
Phyllis began talking to Ash regularly , paying him as much as $ 2,500 a month , Jacknin says .
Not only did Phyllis consult Ash on all decisions .
Now she urged Seth to make use of his powers , too .
Tobias would roll his eyes , but on a few occasions he called Ash .
( Ash says he spoke to Seth “ all the time . ” )
Maybe he could help him understand his wife .
One day in the summer of 2006 , Seth Tobias was back in Circle T’s New York office .
According to a deposition Tobias ’s longtime secretary has given , she got a call from someone whose name she had never heard before .
Billy Ash .
Tobias said he would take the call .
A few minutes later , he walked out of his office .
He looked out of sorts .
“ This man is totally crazy , ” Tobias said .
“ He says I owe him $ 156,000 . ”
According to one of Tobias ’s lawyers deposed in the estate case , Ash told Tobias he was billing him for services rendered during their chats .
Tobias called his lawyer , who sent Ash an e-mail urging him to cease contacting his client .
Ash responded by suggesting that , if he was n’t paid , he would have no choice but to publicly announce what he ’d learned about Seth from their conversations .
Ash , Tobias ’s lawyer alleged , suggested that the disclosures would not sit well with Circle T ’s investors .
( Ash denies pressuring Tobias . )
Phyllis continued to consult with Ash , and Tobias was furious about it .
On November 18 , 2006 , Tobias wrote Phyllis an e-mail .
He said he thought their marriage was permanently broken .
He saved his harshest words for Ash and for Phyllis ’s relationship with him .
“ In the end , if I threatened your livelihood with lies and extortion ; if I manufactured the craziness that he did to me you would have gone nuts .
I still have some pride .
You promised me you were finished with him .
I believed you .
I lost . ”
On April 2 , 2007 , the West Palm Beach police logged a report from the Tobias home at 4:19 p.m. : “ Male is calling .
States his wife is throwing bottle of wine and food at him .
Female is in the background yelling . ”
Tobias was done .
Then he was n’t .
Phyllis continued consulting with Ash , who advised her not to give up on their marriage .
She thanked Ash by FedExing him a $ 10,000 watch .
Over the last weeks of Tobias ’s life , the couple fought over home renovations , over Tobias ’s cocaine use , and , of course , over Ash .
Seth again threatened to leave her .
“ This divorce is going to cost me a lot less than the last one , ” Tobias told his driver in August .
“ I ’ve lost a lot of money since then . ”
The next month , Tobias was dead .
Jupiter police officers examined Tobias ’s body shortly after he died .
They noted scrapes on his nose and forehead .
His glasses had floated to the bottom of the pool .
Phyllis Tobias told Officer Elizabeth Juric that she believed her husband had been snorting cocaine at Bradley ’s that evening with Brett Borgerson .
Juric then called Borgerson , who admitted it was possible Seth had been doing coke earlier in the day .
Phyllis gathered up McGee , the couple ’s dog , and left the house a few minutes later .
The police got a search warrant and found in the house two small plastic bags , one containing a white powder , the other a bluish substance .
Tobias was laid to rest in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , on September 7 .
All his Wall Street friends were there .
Phyllis sat silent mostly , occasionally letting out a sob .
Phone records show that Phyllis spoke to Billy Ash eighteen times in the week following her husband ’s death , including for 81 minutes on the day after his drowning .
After one of the talks , Ash made a call of his own .
It was to Sam Tobias , the brother closest to Seth and Seth ’s heir apparent at Circle T. Ash told Sam that he had served as the couple ’s assistant , which Sam thought was odd since he never remembered meeting him .
Ash then told him that Phyllis had crushed Ambien tablets into a pasta sauce that she ’d served his brother the night he died .
The following day , Sam Tobias called Ash with his lawyer present .
Ash repeated his story , and told Sam that he had been paid for his work for the Tobiases through both a PayPal account and with cash FedExed to his San Diego apartment .
Sam passed the information to the Jupiter Police Department .
About two weeks after Seth ’s death , the department sent two officers to San Diego , where they took Ash ’s statement and then flew back to Florida .
The police wo n’t say what Ash told them , but they were apparently not too impressed with his story .
An investigation is still going on , but the cops have yet to classify Tobias ’s death as suspicious .
One night at dinner , says a former colleague of Seth ’s , Phyllis jumped from her seat and placed her lips over Seth ’s nose and began sucking .
She was searching for cocaine residue .
In late September , Tobias ’s will was read .
The will , signed on May 12 , 2004 , divided Tobias ’s estimated $ 25 million fortune between his brothers , parents , and friends .
Strangely , he had made no adjustment to the document after his 2005 marriage .
Under Florida law , this nullified the will and left his wife as sole inheritor of her fourth husband ’s assets .
In a panic , and armed with Ash ’s claims , the Tobias brothers filed a motion in Palm Beach County probate court seeking to block Phyllis from inheriting the money , citing Florida ’s “ slayer statute , ” a law that prevents a spouse from profiting from the murder of his or her partner .
Phyllis hired four lawyers of her own , including Jay Jacknin .
Billy Ash , meanwhile , began carpet - bombing reporters with his claim that Phyllis had confessed to him that she had killed Seth .
He also added this little tidbit .
Seems
Seth had led a secret gay life .
A brief gossip item appeared in the Palm Beach Post on October 17 publicizing Ash ’s claims , but almost no one read it outside the area .
On December 4 , however , the New York Times published a story on the front - page of the “ Business ” section about Tobias ’s death .
The paper retailed Ash ’s more lurid allegations , including his claim that Phyllis had lured Seth into the pool with promises she would arrange a sexual liaison with a gay porn star–exotic dancer who went by the name Tiger because of the tiger stripes he had tattooed on his body .
Ash alleged that Tobias met Tiger at Cupids , a West Palm Beach gay bar .
The Times story included a confirmation of sorts from Adiel Hemmingway , the manager of Cupids , who said , “ Seth used to come in here back when it was crazy . ”
Everyone read that .
Seth ’s family was silent .
Ash , meanwhile , hired Debra Opri , an attorney best known for repping Larry Birkhead in his successful quest to prove his paternity of Anna Nicole Smith ’s child .
Opri had parlayed Birkhead ’s celebrity , through book deals and other projects , into more than $ 1 million .
Billy
Ash ’s ground - level apartment in the predominantly gay Hillcrest neighborhood of San Diego would just about fit in the foyer of Seth and Phyllis ’s Jupiter mansion .
It ’s the morning after Christmas , and Ash , wearing a blue baseball cap and a red- striped Tommy Hilfiger polo shirt , is supervising two movers as they pack up an artificial tree and a fake wreath .
“ I ca n’t talk to you , ” Ash tells me .
“ You need to call my lawyer , Debra . ”
I was starting to leave when Ash said , “ Well , I can give you just some basic information . ”
Ash told me that he met Seth Tobias in San Diego , about five and a half years earlier .
“ I was shopping in La Jolla , and he came up to me .
I ’m obviously gay , and he asked me , ‘ Do you know where the good gay clubs are ? ’
We became fast friends , and I went to work for him after that , doing travel , making sure his television appearances happened on time , introducing him to guys . ”
When I asked Ash if he had slept with Seth , he took on a scolding tone .
“ That ’s way , way too personal , ” he said .
I said I was sorry and asked him when he first met Phyllis Tobias .
“ Oh , I never met her , ” Ash said .
“ Our whole relationship was over the phone .
But you really need to call Debra .
I ’m super - busy . ”
We said good - bye , but as I started to walk to my car , Ash ’s words hit me .
He had never met Phyllis Tobias ?
The man driving a murder investigation that was the subject of a major New York Times story , the man who claims to have firsthand knowledge of the alleged killer ’s thoughts , had never met the woman ?
I rang the doorbell again .
I asked Ash if I ’d understood him correctly .
“ Yes , ” he said matter - of - factly .
“ We talked and texted ten times a day .
We were really close .
I knew everything about her . ”
Then Ash talked for another hour .
He said that Seth and Phyllis had met at a suburban San Diego sex party in 2003 , and that their 2005 marriage was one of mutual convenience .
“ He needed a trophy wife for his investors , and she needed someone with lots of cash .
I think they had sex maybe twice . ”
According to Ash , he was bombarded with calls from Phyllis over Labor Day weekend .
“ That Sunday , they were having a housewarming barbecue for a few friends and she got pissed because Seth was checking out a cute guy who was there .
She ’d just had enough . ”
Then he told me how Phyllis killed Seth .
His version , that is .
“ That Monday , they went to the bar at the Breakers and Seth was doing coke and drinking , but Phyllis was n’t .
Seth called me [ later ] , and I told him he needed to go home to his wife and make nice .
He was pissed because she had spent $ 16,000 on drapes , and I told him , ‘ You ca n’t take them back , they ’re custom made .
But take them down and put them in the office so she knows no means no .
But she thought he ’d taken them back , so she was extra-pissed .
In their new bedroom they both have these big walk - in closets , and she had put a Baggie filled with crushed Ambien in the safe in her closet .
Seth needed the Ambien to balance off the coke .
So she tells him that she wants to start new , and she ’s going to cook him dinner and make him pasta à la vodka .
She mashed the pills into the sauce , but the problem was it turned the sauce purple and Seth said , ‘ This tastes like shit , I ’m not gonna eat it . ’ ”
Ash paused , and glared at one of the movers .
“ Hey , the lights are part of the tree , it ’s the tree that comes apart .
“ Now , where was I ?
Then Phyllis said , ‘ Eat it , you ’ll feel better , and then I ’ll call Tiger over , and I ’ll watch you two have sex in the pool . ’
But first she took these pictures of him looking all fucked up .
Then Seth walked into the pool , and the Ambien started having its effect .
She went back inside , did the dishes , took the dog for a walk , came back , and went out to the pool .
The only problem was , he was still alive ; he was passed out but floating on his back .
She rolled him over , and that ’s how he died . ”
Um , how did he know all of this ?
“ Phyllis told me , ” he said .
“ I was coming back from Penn State with a friend that day , and I had turned off my phone because I just could not deal with them anymore .
When I turned my phone back on , I had a message from Phyllis saying , ‘ Seth ’s dead . ’ ”
Ash says at that point he called the lawyer Gloria Allred , of Laci Peterson fame .
“ I knew her because of the Peterson case , and I lived around where Laci did .
She told me I had to go to the police . ”
Ash stopped to direct the movers again , then delivered this doozy .
This past September , he said , he was sitting at home speaking to the Jupiter detectives when he got a FedEx box from Phyllis .
“ A while back , she had me track down two cases of Krug Champagne that went for $ 2,000 a bottle .
So I get this box before Seth ’s funeral , and I was like , ‘ Oh my God .
Is Seth ’s head in that box ? ’
But it was a bottle of Krug with a note that said , ‘ The scumbag is dead . ’ ”
At one point , Ash had said that Phyllis had explicitly fessed up and that he had her confession on tape .
But now he retreated a bit .
Now he told me she had only implied on the tape that she ’d poisoned her husband .
Still , he insisted that she had , in fact , confessed to him — just not when the tape was running .
I asked Ash if he could provide a snapshot or any other evidence to back up his claim that he and Seth Tobias had ever met .
I asked him if I could see the photos of Tobias taken the day he died .
He tugged at his cap and shifted his weight .
“ You really need to call Debra and make a proposal . ”
He wanted money before speaking to me further .
“ I ’m only telling you one percent of it .
Make a good proposal , and I ’ll tell you more . ”
The next day , I started checking out Ash ’s story .
Phone records confirm that he talked to Phyllis more than a dozen times in the days after Tobias ’s death .
At one point , Ash had told me that he had been “ deputized ” by the San Diego Police Department to tape Phyllis , but the department says it did n’t happen .
The Jupiter detectives wo n’t say if Ash received a FedEx package from Phyllis while they were interviewing him at his home , but really , how likely is that ?
Under oath , Lucille Schiavone , Tobias ’s secretary , maintained that she had heard of Ash only in relation to his attempted shakedown of Seth .
And Schiavone said she was the one who handled Tobias ’s travel arrangements .
Most reporters covering
Ash ’s stories have included a quick disclaimer saying Ash had been arrested multiple times for prostitution before quoting him extensively .
None of them , however , have gone into any detail about Ash ’s criminal history .
When I Googled “ William Ash , ” the search led me to a 2001 cover story in the Broward - Palm Beach New Times , a free weekly .
The story documented more than a dozen cons that an overweight man by that name perpetrated on the South Florida gay community .
There was a picture :
It was the same guy .
The swindles listed in the New Times included stealing the client list of a company that sold goods manufactured by the disabled and setting up a rival company ; a stint working at Fort Lauderdale ’s CenterOne , an AIDS - counseling center , that ended when Ash was fingered for lying to a tabloid and telling them Tina Turner was a patient ; and chartering a boat for his 31st birthday and spending thousands of dollars on flowers and balloons by telling vendors he was throwing a party for Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga and that the Miami businessman would be footing the bill .
In 1997 , Ash spent six months in jail on a combination of those charges and for running a prostitution ring .
At the time , Ash was billing himself as Mr. Madam and boasted he had an offer to write a book about his days as a Heidi Fleiss–like pimp .
The book never happened .
Ash headed out for San Diego shortly after the New Times story appeared .
David Forest , a prominent agent in the gay - stripper business , gave me Tiger ’s phone number .
I reached him at his parents ’ home outside of Spokane .
Now married , Tiger has a baby daughter who could be heard screaming in the background .
After the New York Times story broke , Tiger , a.k.a.
Christopher Dauenhauer , at first offered a denial of sorts .
He did n’t recall meeting Tobias , he told reporters .
“ I meet a lot of people , I do n’t always remember names , ” he told me when I asked him to explain .
But once Ash ’s story gained momentum , Tiger changed his mind .
“ When I thought about it more , I did remember Seth , ” he says .
Then he told me that he hooked up with Tobias six or seven times , including on more than one occasion in Las Vegas .
“ Seth was a nice guy , ” he said .
“ He was very good to me . ”
As with Ash , I asked him if there was any tangible evidence that he knew Tobias .
Tiger said there was none .
Next came a story that might have made Billy Ash blush .
In fact , it ’s a story that seems flat - out loony .
As Tiger tells it , he was living in Los Angeles a few years ago when he went to get his hair cut in West Hollywood .
Out front were two attractive women .
Tiger , who says he is bisexual , chatted them up .
He said the girls were interested in rough sex , and the trio headed back to his RV in Orange County .
“ We were tying each other up , ” says Tiger .
“ When it was my turn , they handcuffed me and threw a blanket over my head .
Then they let in a guy who starting beating the shit out of me and forced drugs in my mouth .
I woke up in prison .
Then when I heard about Seth , I listened to the 911 tapes and heard Phyllis ’s voice .
She was one of the women .
She must have heard about my affair with Seth . ”
What Tiger was saying , in other words , is that a jealous Phyllis Tobias traveled all the way across the country , deliberately hunted him down , lured him into a lurid sexual tryst , and assaulted him .
Jacknin emphatically denies it .
“ That story is such bullshit , I ca n’t even believe I ’m answering it . ”
I asked Tiger for the name of the hospital he was treated at , specific dates of the assault , or any other corroborating details .
“ I do n’t know , ” he told me .
“ My memory is n’t so good . ”
On January 9 , Billy Ash added yet another wild twist to the story .
He told the New York Daily News ’s “ Rush & Molloy ” that Phyllis had paid $ 100,000 to Madam Simbi M’Arue , a voodoo artist who sometimes goes by the name Mama , to place a hex on her husband while he was still alive .
Two days later , he told the same column that Tobias liked to have his genitals sheared by another gay porn star named Angel .
Ash claimed Phyllis had even FedExed him a lock of Tobias ’s pubic hair .
No Mama or Angel ever came forward .
That same week , I received an e-mail from Ash asking me if I wanted to come to his deposition .
January 31 and February 1 , in Beverly Hills .
For the estate case .
Ash told me this was my formal invitation , and no RSVP was required .
He signed the e-mail , “ Hugs , Billy . ” I flew back to California .
An hour before the deposition was set to start , Debra Opri ’s conference room was being prepped for television .
A crew of four vacuumed up debris and installed a stylish new tabletop .
An ugly hole in the wall was covered with a blue - sky backdrop .
A curtain was removed so that reporters could watch through a glass wall .
Ash was dressed in a black suit and white shirt , with a yellow tie .
His face was covered in pancake makeup .
Despite Ash ’s best efforts , the media turnout was disappointing , just a CNBC crew and me .
Every now and then , Opri would get out of her seat for a cup of coffee and wink at me and the CNBC cameraman on the other side of the glass .
Ash worked the phones on his lunch break .
“ Call ‘ Page Six ’ and tell them what ’s going on , ” he told someone on the other end of his cell phone .
He clicked off and then told me , “ I ’m glad to get this over with .
This is a fight about money .
I did n’t want to have anything to do with it .
I wish she had never told me she killed Seth .
I ’ve already cried twice today .
I did n’t know I ’d feel this emotional . ”
Phyllis ’s lawyers spent much of the first day poking holes in Ash ’s story .
By the end of the day , Ash looked exhausted as he headed toward a car and driver who would take him back to his Hollywood hotel .
“ Her lawyers are not nice people , ” Ash said .
“ How many ways can they tell me I ’m a fat pimp ? ”
Once again , Ash ’s story continued to evolve .
I asked him again when was the last time he had seen Seth .
“ In Las Vegas , over two years ago , ” he answered .
When we first talked , he had told me San Diego .
I mentioned in passing his role as Phyllis ’s online psychic , and he vigorously shook his head .
“ No , I was never her psychic , I was always their assistant . ”
I then asked him if he had brought the Krug Champagne bottle as evidence .
He just laughed .
“ Oh no , I re-gifted that and gave it to someone who was very nice to me . ”
If he had never met Phyllis in person , I asked him , if he had not seen Seth in the two years prior to his death , why would they confide the intimate details of their life to him ?
“ They knew I had a dark past , ” Ash said .
“ They knew I did n’t want that to come out , so I ’d keep their secrets , too . ”
The next morning , Ash and Opri got their makeup done together .
“ God , my hair is so flat , ” said Opri .
“ How can I pouf it up ? ” Meanwhile , her client crowed over a new rumor .
“ Did you hear the toxicology report is back ? ”
Ash said .
“ He had cocaine and Ambien in his system .
It proves everything I ’ve been saying has been the truth . ”
The second - day interrogation was even nastier than the first .
Around noon ,
Ash could be heard shouting “ You will respect me ” at Gary Dunkel , one of Phyllis ’s attorneys .
“ I do n’t respect you , ” Dunkel responded .
“ You ’re a liar . ”
Ash stormed out of the room and summoned me to Opri ’s office again .
“ I am not going to put up with this much longer , ” he said .
“ I ’ve learned two important things :
One , do n’t murder your husband and tell a fat fag with a big mouth .
Two , the fat fag should n’t talk to the press . ”
A whole lot about the Tobias case remains unknown .
Billy Ash was right about the toxicology report .
It showed Tobias had cocaine and a lethal amount of Ambien in his bloodstream .
But it reached no conclusions about how the drugs got there .
Maybe Seth took the pills himself , in a drunken accidental overdose .
Maybe Phyllis secretly fed the pills to him .
Maybe Seth took the pills himself , and Phyllis , finding him in the pool in his addled state , took the opportunity to let him drown .
Without an eyewitness or some new smoking gun , and given Ash ’s — well , given Ash — it ’s hard to imagine the truth will ever really be known .
Police wo n’t comment on where their investigation stands or what they know .
Did Seth Tobias have a secret gay sex life ?
All I know is there are serious holes in Billy Ash ’s and Tiger ’s stories , close friends and colleagues insist they never saw any evidence of gay relationships or trysts , nor did they ever suspect Seth was gay , and no one else has come forward with other claims .
Remember Adiel Hemmingway , the Cupids manager who told the New York Times that Tobias was a frequent visitor to his club ?
It turns out he had given a deposition in the Tobias - estate lawsuit a month earlier that flatly contradicts what he told the newspaper .
In the deposition , he said that he had never met Seth or Phyllis Tobias , and , as far as he knew , Tiger had never performed at Cupids .
What about the fight over Tobias ’s estate ?
The Tobias brothers ’ lawyers filed a motion for summary judgment against Phyllis Tobias earlier in the month that lays out key parts of their case .
The motion quotes Seth ’s personal secretary and driver saying that their boss was getting ready to divorce Phyllis in the weeks before his death .
The Tobias brothers say that Phyllis knew the papers were imminent and that forced her hand .
The motion also contains copies of a bill that shows that Phyllis had the couple ’s pool resurfaced nine days after her husband ’s death .
Tobias ’s secretary told attorneys in the case that Seth told her that Phyllis “ had fed him ‘ discolored eggs and he felt drugged ’ ” shortly before his death .
The Tobias brothers also say that the paramedics ’ ruling that rigor mortis had set in by the time they arrived suggests that Seth was dead long before Phyllis ’s 12:08 a.m. call to Brett Borgerson and the subsequent 12:45 a.m. 911 call .
Jay Jacknin , of course , sees things differently .
“ Their side tells a pretty story , ” he says .
“ But where ’s the proof ?
Where ’s the witness ?
They do n’t have any , because their case is all bullshit .
This is a story based on the allegations of a convicted felon who ’s just not credible . ”
And the Ambien in Tobias ’s system ?
Tobias , Phyllis ’s lawyers say , was a drug addict .
He snorted everything , Ambien included .
The clincher , Phyllis ’s legal team says , is that a day or two before Ash contacted the Tobias brothers , Ash sent an e-mail to JoAnn Kotzen , Seth and Phyllis ’s family lawyer , saying , “ The bottom line is Seth lived a lot longer by being with Phyllis . ”
In the e-mail , Phyllis ’s lawyers say , Ash asked Kotzen for $ 35,000 in legal fees .
She wrote back that as a witness , Ash should n’t have legal fees , and no payment would be coming .
It was only after that , Phyllis ’s lawyers say , that Ash called the Tobias brothers and claimed that Phyllis had told him that she killed Seth .
( Ash denies asking for legal fees from Kotzen . )
Jacknin then floats a possible defense for Phyllis Tobias that wo n’t win her wife of the year but might get her off the legal hook .
“ Look , the law is n’t did she not call 911 quick enough or did she not pull him out of the water quick enough .
The law asks whether she caused his death , and that is not provable . ”
The request for summary judgment was recently continued by the judge .
Who knows , in the end , who ’ll get what ?
I never saw Phyllis Tobias .
She would n’t talk to me .
She still has n’t been accused of any crimes .
Seth Tobias ’s brothers would n’t talk to me , either .
Billy Ash ?
I e-mailed with him just the other day .
He sent me a picture of himself .
He said he was at Mardi Gras .
He wore a mask , a string of baubles around his neck , and a fortune - teller ’s turban .
He looked like he was having an excellent time .
Editor ’s note : On Monday , February 11 , the Palm Beach County State Attorney ’s office decided that Phyllis Tobias will not face criminal charges in the death of her husband , Seth Tobias .
“ Based upon the evidence available at this time , including the autopsy and toxicology reports , there is no indication of criminality in the death of Mr. Tobias , ” Assistant State Attorney Mary Ann Duggan wrote in a letter to the Jupiter Police Department .
The Tobias brothers ’ lawsuit seeking to prevent Phyllis Tobias from inheriting Seth ’s $ 25 million estate is ongoing .
To my surprise , the TED conference organizers has swiftly uploaded the presentation recording from Microsoft ’s announcement of their WorldWide Telescope technology showcased no more than 12 hours ago , when in contrast , videos are usually only made available online after a year or two of exclusivity .
Remembering , attendees pay several thousands of dollars to go to this conference – one of , if not the best conference in the world , so to make an exception for this particular presentation is really something .

The World Wide Web uses relatively simple technologies with sufficient scalability , efficiency and utility that they have resulted in a remarkable information space of interrelated resources , growing across languages , cultures , and media .
In an effort to preserve these properties of the information space as the technologies evolve , this architecture document discusses the core design components of the Web .
They are identification of resources , representation of resource state , and the protocols that support the interaction between agents and resources in the space .
We relate core design components , constraints , and good practices to the principles and properties they support .
This is the 15 December 2004 Recommendation of “ Architecture of the World Wide Web , Volume One . ”
This document has been reviewed by W3C Members , by software developers , and by other W3C groups and interested parties , and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation .
It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document .
W3 C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment .
This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web .
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication .
Other documents may supersede this document .
A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.
The following principles , constraints , and good practice notes are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience .
There is also a free - standing summary .
Many of the examples in this document that involve human activity suppose the familiar Web interaction model ( illustrated at the beginning of the Introduction ) where a person follows a link via a user agent , the user agent retrieves and presents data , the user follows another link , etc .
This document does not discuss in any detail other interaction models such as voice browsing ( see , for example , [ VOICEXML2 ] ) .
The choice of interaction model may have an impact on expected agent behavior .
For instance , when a graphical user agent running on a laptop computer or hand - held device encounters an error , the user agent can report errors directly to the user through visual and audio cues , and present the user with options for resolving the errors .
On the other hand , when someone is browsing the Web through voice input and audio - only output , stopping the dialog to wait for user input may reduce usability since it is so easy to " lose one 's place " when browsing with only audio - output .
This document does not discuss how the principles , constraints , and good practices identified here apply in all interaction contexts .
This document strives for a balance between brevity and precision while including illustrative examples .
TAG findings are informational documents that complement the current document by providing more detail about selected topics .
This document includes some excerpts from the findings .
Since the findings evolve independently , this document includes references to approved TAG findings .
For other TAG issues covered by this document but without an approved finding , references are to entries in the TAG issues list .
This document presents the general architecture of the Web .
Other groups inside and outside W3C also address specialized aspects of Web architecture , including accessibility , quality assurance , internationalization , device independence , and Web Services .
The section on Architectural Specifications ( §7.1 ) includes references to these related specifications .
Note :
This document does not distinguish in any formal way the terms " language " and " format . "
Context determines which term is used .
The phrase " specification designer " encompasses language , format , and protocol designers .
This document is intended to inform discussions about issues of Web architecture .
The intended audience for this document includes :
The terms MUST , MUST NOT , SHOULD , SHOULD NOT , and MAY are used in the principles , constraints , and good practice notes in accordance with RFC 2119 [ RFC2119 ] .
This document describes the properties we desire of the Web and the design choices that have been made to achieve them .
It promotes the reuse of existing standards when suitable , and gives guidance on how to innovate in a manner consistent with Web architecture .
In the remainder of this document , we highlight important architectural points regarding Web identifiers , protocols , and formats .
We also discuss some important general architectural principles ( §5 ) and how they apply to the Web .
Nadia 's browser is configured and programmed to interpret the receipt of an " application / xhtml+xml " typed representation as an instruction to render the content of that representation according to the XHTML rendering model , including any subsidiary interactions ( such as requests for external style sheets or in - line images ) called for by the representation .
In the scenario , the XHTML representation data received from the initial request instructs Nadia 's browser to also retrieve and render in - line the weather maps , each identified by a URI and thus causing an additional retrieval action , resulting in additional representations that are processed by the browser according to their own data formats ( e.g. , " application / svg+xml " indicates the SVG data format ) , and this process continues until all of the data formats have been rendered .
The result of all of this processing , once the browser has reached an application steady - state that completes Nadia 's initial requested action , is commonly referred to as a " Web page " .
Formats ( §4 ) .
Most protocols used for representation retrieval and / or submission make use of a sequence of one or more messages , which taken together contain a payload of representation data and metadata , to transfer the representation between agents .
The choice of interaction protocol places limits on the formats of representation data and metadata that can be transmitted .
HTTP , for example , typically transmits a single octet stream plus metadata , and uses the " Content - Type " and " Content - Encoding " header fields to further identify the format of the representation .
In this scenario , the representation transferred is in XHTML , as identified by the " Content - type " HTTP header field containing the registered Internet media type name , " application / xhtml+xml " .
That Internet media type name indicates that the representation data can be processed according to the XHTML specification .
Interaction ( §3 ) .
Web agents communicate using standardized protocols that enable interaction through the exchange of messages which adhere to a defined syntax and semantics .
By entering a URI into a retrieval dialog or selecting a hypertext link , Nadia tells her browser to perform a retrieval action for the resource identified by the URI .
In this example , the browser sends an HTTP GET request ( part of the HTTP protocol ) to the server at " weather.example.com " , via TCP / IP port 80 , and the server sends back a message containing what it determines to be a representation of the resource as of the time that representation was generated .
Note that this example is specific to hypertext browsing of information — other kinds of interaction are possible , both within browsers and through the use of other types of Web agent ; our example is intended to illustrate one common interaction , not define the range of possible interactions or limit the ways in which agents might use the Web .
Identification ( §2 ) .
URIs are used to identify resources .
In this travel scenario , the resource is a periodically updated report on the weather in Oaxaca , and the URI is “ http://weather.example.com/oaxaca”.
This scenario illustrates the three architectural bases of the Web that are discussed in this document :
While planning a trip to Mexico , Nadia reads “ Oaxaca weather information : ' http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'” in a glossy travel magazine .
Nadia has enough experience with the Web to recognize that " http://weather.example.com/oaxaca " is a URI and that she is likely to be able to retrieve associated information with her Web browser .
When Nadia enters the URI into her browser :
Examples such as the following travel scenario are used throughout this document to illustrate typical behavior of Web agents — people or software acting on this information space .
A user agent acts on behalf of a user .
Software agents include servers , proxies , spiders , browsers , and multimedia players .
The World Wide Web ( WWW , or simply Web ) is an information space in which the items of interest , referred to as resources , are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) .
In order to communicate internally , a community agrees ( to a reasonable extent ) on a set of terms and their meanings .
One goal of the Web , since its inception , has been to build a global community in which any party can share information with any other party .
To achieve this goal , the Web makes use of a single global identification system : the URI .
URIs are a cornerstone of Web architecture , providing identification that is common across the Web .
The global scope of URIs promotes large - scale " network effects " : the value of an identifier increases the more it is used consistently ( for example , the more it is used in hypertext links ( § 4.4 ) ) .
Principle : Global Identifiers Global naming leads to global network effects .
This principle dates back at least as far as Douglas Engelbart 's seminal work on open hypertext systems ; see section Every Object Addressable in [ Eng90 ] .
2.1 . Benefits of URIs
The choice of syntax for global identifiers is somewhat arbitrary ; it is their global scope that is important .
The Uniform Resource Identifier , [ URI ] , has been successfully deployed since the creation of the Web .
There are substantial benefits to participating in the existing network of URIs , including linking , bookmarking , caching , and indexing by search engines , and there are substantial costs to creating a new identification system that has the same properties as URIs .
Good practice : Identify with URIs
To benefit from and increase the value of the World Wide Web , agents should provide URIs as identifiers for resources .
A resource should have an associated URI if another party might reasonably want to create a hypertext link to it , make or refute assertions about it , retrieve or cache a representation of it , include all or part of it by reference into another representation , annotate it , or perform other operations on it .
Software developers should expect that sharing URIs across applications will be useful , even if that utility is not initially evident .
The TAG finding " URIs , Addressability , and the use of HTTP GET and POST " discusses additional benefits and considerations of URI addressability .
Note : Some URI schemes ( such as the " ftp " URI scheme specification ) use the term " designate " where this document uses " identify . "
2.3 . URI Comparisons URIs that are identical , character - by - character , refer to the same resource .
Since Web Architecture allows the association of multiple URIs with a given resource , two URIs that are not character - by - character identical may still refer to the same resource .
Different URIs do not necessarily refer to different resources but there is generally a higher computational cost to determine that different URIs refer to the same resource .
To reduce the risk of a false negative ( i.e. , an incorrect conclusion that two URIs do not refer to the same resource ) or a false positive ( i.e. , an incorrect conclusion that two URIs do refer to the same resource ) , some specifications describe equivalence tests in addition to character - by - character comparison .
Agents that reach conclusions based on comparisons that are not licensed by the relevant specifications take responsibility for any problems that result ; see the section on error handling ( § 5.3 ) for more information about responsible behavior when reaching unlicensed conclusions .
Section 6 of [ URI ] provides more information about comparing URIs and reducing the risk of false negatives and positives .
See also the assertion that two URIs identify the same resource ( § 2.7.2 ) .
2.3.1 . URI aliases
Although there are benefits ( such as naming flexibility ) to URI aliases , there are also costs .
URI aliases are harmful when they divide the Web of related resources .
A corollary of Metcalfe 's Principle ( the " network effect " ) is that the value of a given resource can be measured by the number and value of other resources in its network neighborhood , that is , the resources that link to it .
The problem with aliases is that if half of the neighborhood points to one URI for a given resource , and the other half points to a second , different URI for that same resource , the neighborhood is divided .
Not only is the aliased resource undervalued because of this split , the entire neighborhood of resources loses value because of the missing second - order relationships that should have existed among the referring resources by virtue of their references to the aliased resource .
Good practice : Avoiding URI aliases A URI owner SHOULD NOT associate arbitrarily different URIs with the same resource .
URI consumers also have a role in ensuring URI consistency .
For instance , when transcribing a URI , agents should not gratuitously percent - encode characters .
The term " character " refers to URI characters as defined in section 2 of [ URI ] ; percent - encoding is discussed in section 2.1 of that specification .
Good practice : Consistent URI usage
An agent that receives a URI SHOULD refer to the associated resource using the same URI , character - by - character .
When a URI alias does become common currency , the URI owner should use protocol techniques such as server - side redirects to relate the two resources .
The community benefits when the URI owner supports redirection of an aliased URI to the corresponding " official " URI .
For more information on redirection , see section 10.3 , Redirection , in [ RFC2616 ] .
See also [ CHIPS ] for a discussion of some best practices for server administrators .
2.3.2 . Representation reuse URI aliasing only occurs when more than one URI is used to identify the same resource .
The fact that different resources sometimes have the same representation does not make the URIs for those resources aliases .
Story Dirk would like to add a link from his Web site to the Oaxaca weather site .
He uses the URI http://weather.example.com/oaxaca and labels his link “ report on weather in Oaxaca on 1 August 2004 ” .
Nadia points out to Dirk that he is setting misleading expectations for the URI he has used .
The Oaxaca weather site policy is that the URI in question identifies a report on the current weather in Oaxaca — on any given day — and not the weather on 1 August .
Of course , on the first of August in 2004 , Dirk 's link will be correct , but the rest of the time he will be misleading readers .
Nadia points out to Dirk that the managers of the Oaxaca weather site do make available a different URI permanently assigned to a resource reporting on the weather on 1 August 2004 .
In this story , there are two resources : “ a report on the current weather in Oaxaca ” and “ a report on the weather in Oaxaca on 1 August 2004 ” .
The managers of the Oaxaca weather site assign two URIs to these two different resources .
On 1 August 2004 , the representations for these resources are identical .
That fact that dereferencing two different URIs produces identical representations does not imply that the two URIs are aliases .
2.4 . URI Schemes
In the URI " http://weather.example.com/ " , the " http " that appears before the colon ( " : " ) names a URI scheme .
Each URI scheme has a specification that explains the scheme - specific details of how scheme identifiers are allocated and become associated with a resource .
The URI syntax is thus a federated and extensible naming system wherein each scheme 's specification may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers within that scheme .
Examples of URIs from various schemes include : mailto:joe@example.org
ftp://example.org/aDirectory/aFile
news:comp.infosystems.www
tel :+1-816-555-1212
ldap://ldap.example.org/c=GB?objectClass?one
urn:oasis: names :tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog
While Web architecture allows the definition of new schemes , introducing a new scheme is costly .
Many aspects of URI processing are scheme - dependent , and a large amount of deployed software already processes URIs of well - known schemes .
Introducing a new URI scheme requires the development and deployment not only of client software to handle the scheme , but also of ancillary agents such as gateways , proxies , and caches .
See [ RFC2718 ] for other considerations and costs related to URI scheme design .
Because of these costs , if a URI scheme exists that meets the needs of an application , designers should use it rather than invent one .
Good practice : Reuse URI schemes
A specification SHOULD reuse an existing URI scheme ( rather than create a new one ) when it provides the desired properties of identifiers and their relation to resources .
Consider our travel scenario : should the agent providing information about the weather in Oaxaca register a new URI scheme " weather " for the identification of resources related to the weather ?
They might then publish URIs such as " weather://travel.example.com/oaxaca " .
When a software agent dereferences such a URI , if what really happens is that HTTP GET is invoked to retrieve a representation of the resource , then an " http " URI would have sufficed .
2.4.1 . URI Scheme Registration The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) maintains a registry [ IANASchemes ] of mappings between URI scheme names and scheme specifications .
For instance , the IANA registry indicates that the " http " scheme is defined in [ RFC2616 ] .
The process for registering a new URI scheme is defined in [ RFC2717 ] .
Unregistered URI schemes SHOULD NOT be used for a number of reasons :
There is no generally accepted way to locate the scheme specification .
Someone else may be using the scheme for other purposes .
One should not expect that general - purpose software will do anything useful with URIs of this scheme beyond URI comparison .
One misguided motivation for registering a new URI scheme is to allow a software agent to launch a particular application when retrieving a representation .
The same thing can be accomplished at lower expense by dispatching instead on the type of the representation , thereby allowing use of existing transfer protocols and implementations .
Even if an agent cannot process representation data in an unknown format , it can at least retrieve it .
The data may contain enough information to allow a user or user agent to make some use of it .
When an agent does not handle a new URI scheme , it cannot retrieve a representation .
When designing a new data format , the preferred mechanism to promote its deployment on the Web is the Internet media type ( see Representation Types and Internet Media Types ( § 3.2 ) ) .
Media types also provide a means for building new information applications , as described in future directions for data formats ( § 4.6 ) .
2.5 . URI Opacity
It is tempting to guess the nature of a resource by inspection of a URI that identifies it .
However , the Web is designed so that agents communicate resource information state through representations , not identifiers .
In general , one cannot determine the type of a resource representation by inspecting a URI for that resource .
For example , the " .html " at the end of " http://example.com/page.html " provides no guarantee that representations of the identified resource will be served with the Internet media type " text / html " .
The publisher is free to allocate identifiers and define how they are served .
The HTTP protocol does not constrain the Internet media type based on the path component of the URI ; the URI owner is free to configure the server to return a representation using PNG or any other data format .
Resource state may evolve over time .
Requiring a URI owner to publish a new URI for each change in resource state would lead to a significant number of broken references .
For robustness , Web architecture promotes independence between an identifier and the state of the identified resource .
Good practice : URI opacity Agents making use of URIs SHOULD NOT attempt to infer properties of the referenced resource .
In practice , a small number of inferences can be made because they are explicitly licensed by the relevant specifications .
Some of these inferences are discussed in the details of retrieving a representation ( §3.1.1 ) .
The example URI used in the travel scenario ( " http://weather.example.com/oaxaca " ) suggests to a human reader that the identified resource has something to do with the weather in Oaxaca .
A site reporting the weather in Oaxaca could just as easily be identified by the URI " http://vjc.example.com/315 " .
And the URI " http://weather.example.com/vancouver " might identify the resource " my photo album . "
On the other hand , the URI " mailto:joe@example.com " indicates that the URI refers to a mailbox .
The " mailto " URI scheme specification authorizes agents to infer that URIs of this form identify Internet mailboxes .
Some URI assignment authorities document and publish their URI assignment policies .

NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- Protests against a City Council plan to tear down low - income New Orleans housing turned ugly Thursday , with police using pepper spray and stun guns to clear a crowd angry they were n't allowed into City Hall for the vote .
The City Council voted unanimously to greenlight the demolition of the city 's four largest public housing developments , saying they are too damaged by Hurricane Katrina to allow residents back into them .
But many in New Orleans , including former residents of the developments , say they fear the local and federal governments will not guarantee similarly affordable housing be built in their place -- calling the demolition an effort to move poor people out of the city .
At about 11 a.m. , several protesters were dragged out of council chambers after scuffles broke out among people who packed the room , and members of the crowd booed council members and shouted insults at them .
Watch protesters grapple with police »
About 30 minutes later , hundreds more protesters angry that they were n't allowed into the meeting began rattling an iron gate outside City Hall .
" They were pulling the gate open , trying to come in , " said Superintendent Warren J. Riley of the New Orleans Police Department .
" They were allowed to stand there and protest peacefully .
Then they began to try and tear the gate down .
They punched a couple of civil sheriffs in the face .
They broke the gate open .
So , some of those officers did use Mace to defend themselves and also to regain control of the gate and close the gate . "
Riley said that after the council chamber 's maximum capacity of 278 was reached , no one else was allowed inside .
Video , shot by New Orleans television station WDSU , shows at least one law enforcement officer shooting a liquid spray at the crowd as police struggled with protesters for control of the gate .
Moments later , a woman could be seen crying and screaming on the ground before several other protesters picked her up and carried her away .
Peter O'Connell , who described himself as a student living in New Orleans , told the station he was hit by pepper spray and narrowly avoided being shocked by a police stun gun , which hit his jacket but not his body .
" We were just trying to gain access to the City Council meeting , which we all feel and know that we have a right to attend , " he said .
" We were denied access and , in the process , brutalized by the police . "
Riley said the use of force was justified .
" It was clear that there were people there that had one goal in mind and that was to be disruptive , be disobedient and in some cases to actually start a physical confrontation , " he said .
The department said 15 people were arrested .
Most were charged with disturbing the peace , and all had been released from jail by Thursday evening , police said .
Authorities said there were no serious injuries .
After the vote , New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin commended the council for the decision .
" Could the federal government have done better ?
Sure .
Could [ federal housing officials ] have opened more units quicker ?
Sure , " he said .
" But we are where we are today , and today , we had a unified decision to move forward with accountability , honoring our overriding premise that every citizen has a right to return to the city . "
The city has promised to replace the developments with mixed - use family housing that will provide plenty of low - income units .
Some at Thursday 's meeting said that saving the existing developments would not have been a favor to the city 's poor .
Howard Robertson , a retired major with New Orleans police , said the units already were in bad shape before Katrina -- with many of them boarded up and vacant havens for crack dealers .
" Since the storm , they are even in worse condition -- windows are broken , more than a fourth of all the buildings are boarded up where you can't even go in , " he said .
" All the city 's trying to do is actually improve the living conditions . "

Gosh , thanks .
While I appreciate the public arguing between Federal Reserve governors on the subject of whether to focus on inflation or Wall Street , it ’s discouraging to hear Bernanke so willingly point towards another Wall Street gift .
During the Bush years , the middle class has been shafted and has not enjoyed the economic benefits that mostly helped the wealthiest Americans .
There was no trickle down and they did n’t even try to hide behind such false stories as they did during the Reagan years .
They simply did n’t give a damn .
Now all of the excesses of the Wall Street wet dream , where they were given full authority by Republicans do to pretty much any damned thing they liked , are crashing down .
Suddenly , we ’re all supposed to jump and give Wall Street more free money so we can help them bounce back .
Money is n’t falling from the sky , it ’s leaving your wallet to bail these bums out .
The same middle class who has footed the bill for Iraq , footed the tax cuts for the rich , more expensive health care , fewer benefits and payed the price for lack of traditional regulation , is being asked to sacrifice – again – so that Bernanke can help Wall Street dig out of the hole they put us in .
We ’re in for a bumpy ride one way or another so let Wall Street fend for themselves and think about the middle class .
Inflation and sagging wages are taking their toll , but do n’t tell that to Bernanke .
He does n’t give a damn unless you are Wall Street .

What would it mean if -- as I have previously argued -- continuity of government measures implemented on 9/11 were still in effect ?
Well , Congress would be more or less disbanded , and the president could become a sole figurehead , implementing the orders of the real president under the COG regime ( someone like Cheney , for example ) .
And there would be so such thing as a " two - party system " .
The COG could be run entirely by a single party ( and methodical researcher Paul Thompson claims that the COG implemented on 9/11 was made up entirely of Republicans ) .
Basically , the government , the law , and the power structure would be whatever those in charge of the COG said they were .
There would be no constitutional mandates , no judicial process , no congressional input .
Do you get it yet ?
Do you understand how serious this would be ?
Other likely effects of a COG government would be :
The media is ordered - under penalty of treason – to only promote stories authorized by the COG government ( executive orders prohibiting stories discussing the Homegrown Terrorism bill or impeachment , or questioning 9/11 , fake intelligence , or the Bush administration 's unconstitutional actions could be issued )
A law could be passed stating that anyone who revealed the existence of the COG could be punished for treason ; the law could also say that anyone who blew the whistle on the fact that " our elected leaders " had no power in the COG government , and that the show was really being run by unelected people could also be hung
Laws could be passed saying that Constitutional processes such as impeachment are repealed forever ( is this why John Conyers keeps saying he knows things that other people do n't ? ) .
They could also suspend elections
Do you see that COG is a very important issue ?
See this short talk by UC Berkeley professor Peter Dale Scott .
Your numbers may be growing among the millions of people wearing some kind of badge in the United States , but your days are numbered .
Not because of any direct threat from people like me ; no what I 'm talking about here is the threat that you are creating all by yourselves .
If you had been paying attention you would have seen this coming on your own .
What the military and the mercenaries are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan each of you is now doing here , in your own tiny little world so full of arrogance and basic brutality .
Every time you beat a man senseless , or shame a woman to tears in front of her loved ones , or randomly kill someone either by accident or by design it happens just because you can - so you make more than enemies - you plant the seeds of your own violent end .
Have you ever seen children tear a well - trained combat soldier to pieces , I have .
It happened in a relatively good neighborhood in LA , and the dead man was one of the most decorated marines we had .
It happened a block and a half from my apartment .
It was a very long time ago , but I never got over the shock of seeing what looked like The Lord of the Flies coming to life .
Before the Decider , police forces were relatively small in comparison to the size of the populations they were charged with " Protecting and Serving . "
But after it became clear that the entire upper echelon of government had become nothing more than glorified street bandits : the gloves came off all the way down the food chain .
So when the demonstrations against the wars began , your departments began to behave as if US citizens were the real Enemies of the State .
Way back in 1992 the behavior patterns for you were in play in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew .
And you did oh such a job then of disposing of all those bodies - the Owners loved it , but that had to remain a secret because of " national security . "
( 1 ) Then came Katrina and the mercenaries helped you out with your own campaign of terror against the survivors of New Orleans that had the temerity not to die .
But from that point forward your ranks began to swell , as officers began to catch the drift of what would lead to their next promotion in the newly criminal world of ' law - enforcement . '(2 ) This was followed by Blackwater that was armed with new and secret contracts to retrain the sheriffs , the marshals , and the police of all stripes to convert them into the heavily armored combat troops that would very soon begin to patrol the streets and byways of America .
Since then you have become brazenly bold and unflinching in your treatment of the people that you were supposed to protect - the same people that actually pay your inflated salaries .
Contrary to what you might believe you are not a law unto yourselves - you 're supposed to be peace officers .
( 3 ) That 's what can be tracked about the current situation , and that 's what most of you see as your current job : the brutalizing , the Tasering and or the killing of US citizens that fail in some small way to obey your every command - no matter how unreasonable .
It seems no one knows exactly how many you have killed , as your departments fail to keep such records - but when one is too many - then a hundred or more amounts to a mutiny against the very people you are sworn to serve .
Here 's a rough history of your recent activities , in part .
( 4 ) What you do n't seem to realize is that when you take off the Kevlar , and unstrap both your weapons , you need a shower , possibly a shave if you 're male , and you 'll need to grab something to eat .
If you live in the Burbs which most cops do , you probably have " friends " and maybe you might want to go to a game or just get together with " friends . "
In brief you do what other people do unless you 're a robot living in a barrack somewhere dark and semi-distant .
If you have a family they have their lives to live as well , grocery shopping , school etc. just like other people - except that you are not like other people !
You have become a secret enforcer , the muscle and bullets of the fascist state incarnate .
And that makes you and yours into targets for those that you have wronged .
What used to protect you was the good will of the people you served , but with that out - of - the - way now , because you 've put yourself beyond the law and above the people that once cared whether you lived or died - your world has changed almost as much as ours :
Only you still have no clue about the consequences that are coming !
When you do what you do to ordinary people your actions affect the lives of a great many people beyond the targets of your brutality - and those people whether adults or children will not forget .
Meanwhile you have forgotten that you are not Supermen or Superwomen , you 're just flesh and blood like all the rest of us : and with every day that passes the numbers of your enemies continue to increase by the hundreds , until that figure reaches into the thousands , and you are beginning to close in on that magic number now .
When my old man was murdered I lived with rage for a very long time - but it was a very different era then and reason won out - his killer had to live with perpetual uncertainty , but he got to live .
This is a very different world today .
But the laws of consequence and responsibility are still in tact in this jungle that passes for life - in - Occupied - America today .
Just thought you 'd like to know that while the public has not yet decided to act , that day will not remain at bay forever .
How long will it be before you need to look over your shoulder , or check you squad car before getting in , not once in awhile , but each and every time .
How well do you know your ' friends ' and how 's your life these days , maybe a little more tension , a lot less patience because at some level you have to know we 're watching .
This is so because you have become unnatural , and with each passing day you grow more distant from the people that you brutalize so easily !
By the way this Open Letter is also meant for those thugs that serve the god of TSA .
They might not get your perks but too many of them are all too eager to attack the innocent instead of simply asking civil questions .
Events like this are growing in their frequency , every hour of every day .
( 5 ) I came up the hard way and I carried a gun for a few years - so I 'm not blind to what you 're trying to do .
Early on I lived in Paint Hotels among the drifters and the night - moths , but even then there were too many of your kind .
I 've had my share of pistol - whippings in the back of a patrol car , I survived the petty interrogations and the insults then - but I fought back with lawyers and with real cops to make it right .
Today everything is different and the Bad Guys wear the uniform and are praised for what they do to us .
You might want to think about it boys and girls , because no one leaves this life alive .
One of the first things that basic training taught to every military draftee , back in the fifties , was that there is always someone bigger , someone stronger , someone meaner than you might think you really are .
That was a major life - lesson , too bad you guys missed out on that .
Your behavior towards the public is teaching them that " selling out is futile " and that anyone alone is always easy prey ; maybe that 's why you roam in packs ?
Soon the public may begin to emulate your tactics , and then where will you be when you find yourself outnumbered by an angry mob that no longer fears your uniform , but instead is energized because of what you do NOT stand for !
You might want to think about these things , because they are not secret anymore : and millions of people have begun to watch your every move - so why not begin to do the right thing , while you can .

Plants have become more likely to drop seeds into their home patch of ground .
This weed 's relatives wo n't travel far from home .
Gilles Przetak
Urbanization is forcing plants to evolve quickly , but their form of evolution could ultimately put them in danger of dying out .
The daisy - like annual weed Crepis sancta has two types of seed — big , heavy ones that tend to drop straight down , and light , floaty ones that can be caught on the wind and spread farther afield .
Weeds growing in patches of soil around trees in the French city of Montpellier have evolved over a period of just 12 years to produce more of the big seeds than the flighty far - reaching ones , says Pierre - Olivier Cheptou from the CNRS in Montpellier who publishes his research team ’s findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1 .
Cheptou first noticed the trend in the ' field ' of a real urban environment .
To find out whether it was due to a genetic change , rather than environmental cues , Cheptou took seeds from both rural and urban environments and grew them in a greenhouse .
The two plant types were allowed to be pollinated only by similar plants , and once they flowered , the different types of seeds were collected and counted .
The researchers found that the plants grown from urban seeds produced about 14 % heavy seeds , compared with 10 % heavy seeds produced by the plants from the countryside .
Using a mathematical model , Cheptou worked out that the change had happened over about 10 generations of the plant .
This is not the fastest evolution seen in plants , but is a remarkably quick period in which to change , Cheptou says : “ it ’s very short . ”
Concrete jungle
Some seeds are built to drop ; others to fly .
Eric Imbert
In cities , plants become fragmented — they grow only in certain isolated areas .
Cheptou measured the likelihood of seeds landing in an inhospitable site when dispersed in this kind of urban environment .
He found that small , light seeds had a 55 % lower chance of settling and growing than the heavy seeds that fall straight down into the same patch of ground as the parent .
Light seeds were liable to hit a Montpellier parking - lot rather than a patch of soil : habitable ground not covered over with concrete accounts for just 1 % of the city .
So having heavy seeds sounds like a good adaptation for a city plant .
But the strategy comes with a higher risk of genetic isolation .
“ It ’s clear that after colonization in a fragmented habitat , that fragmentation will prevent gene flow , " says Cheptou .
And that can put plants at risk of not keeping up with the times .

“ This evolutionary scenario has a potential danger , ” says Karl Niklas , a plant biologist at Cornell University in New York .
“ If the environment changes rapidly , locally well - adapted populations may go to local extinction and disappear . ”
“ The downside is that the population fragment is vulnerable if the environment changes there ; it will not be able , ever , to reach new and fertile ground if it gives up the potential for long - distance dispersal , ” agrees Martin Cody , a plant biologist from the University of California , Los Angeles .
Cody has seen a similar effect on isolated ocean islands , where seeds usually carried by the wind have evolved to become bigger and so less likely to be blown out to sea .
INDIAN WELLS , California ( Reuters ) - Google Inc is prepared to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in big commercial alternative - energy projects that traditionally have had trouble getting financing , the executive in charge of its green - energy push said on Wednesday .

The Internet search giant , which has said it will invest in researching green technologies and renewable - energy companies , is eager to help promising technologies amass scale to help drive the cost of alternative energy below the cost of coal .
“ There are a lot of technologies that get to the pilot scale and look promising , but the first few large commercial projects deploying those technologies , financing those can be extremely difficult , ” Dan Reicher said in an interview at the Clean - tech Investor Summit in Indian Wells , California .
“ Often the usual equity and debt players will say come back to us when you ’ve demonstrated this at scale , ” said Reicher , director of climate and energy initiatives for Google ’s philanthropic arm , Google.org .
The stage between successfully developing a new technology and amassing scale is often referred in the industry as the “ Valley of Death , ” Reicher said .
Venture capital firms typically pour tens of millions into developing new technologies , Reicher said .
But that ’s not nearly enough to build a utility - scale solar thermal plant , for instance , and that ’s where Google thinks it can be helpful , he added .
“ When you get to building a commercial - scale project in the energy world , you can be looking easily at hundreds of millions or even across the billion dollar threshold , ” Reicher said .
“ Over years we ’ll be looking at hundreds of millions of dollars .
So we ’re very mindful of the Valley of Death . ”
In addition to considering project finance , Google has already committed $ 20 million to funding start - up firms researching solar - thermal and high - altitude wind power .
It is also looking closely at several companies with enhanced geothermal systems , Reicher said .
Enhanced geothermal systems , or EGS , create power by pumping water into hot rocks in the ground rather than harvesting hot water already there .
“ We arrived at these three technologies because we think they have real promise to move down the cost curve and to be competitive with coal and to get to very large scale , ” Reicher said .
Google said in November it planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to help drive the cost of electricity made from renewable sources below the price of power generated from dirty coal - fired plants .
The company has pledged $ 10 million to Pasadena , California - based eSolar Inc to support research and development on solar thermal power , which concentrates heat from the sun to create steam and spin turbines .
It has invested $ 10 million in Alameda , California - based Makani Power Inc , which is developing high - altitude wind technologies .

Announcement
Date : Wed , 27 Feb 2008 17:19:52 - 0500
From : Ken Smith < kensmith@FreeBSD.org >
To : freebsd - announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject : [ FreeBSD - Announce ] FreeBSD 7.0- RELEASE
Available
The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 7.0 - RELEASE .
This is the first release from the 7 - STABLE branch which introduces many new features along with many improvements to functionality present in the earlier branches .
Some of the highlights :
Dramatic improvements in performance and SMP scalability shown by various database and other benchmarks , in some cases showing peak performance improvements as high as 350 % over FreeBSD 6.X under normal loads and 1500 % at high loads .
When compared with the best performing Linux kernel ( 2.6.22 or 2.6.24 ) performance is 15 % better .
Results are from benchmarks used to analyze and improve system performance , results with your specific work load may vary .
Some of the changes that contribute to this improvement are :
The 1:1 libthr threading model is now the default .
Finer - grained IPC , networking , and scheduler locking .
A major focus on optimizing the SMP architecture that was put in place during the 5.x and 6.x branches .
Some benchmarks show linear scaling up to 8 CPUs .
Many workloads see a significant performance improvement with multicore systems .
The ULE scheduler is vastly improved , providing improved performance and interactive response ( the 4BSD scheduler is still the default for 7.0 but ULE may become the default for 7.1 ) .
Experimental support for Sun's ZFS filesystem .
gjournal can be used to set up journaled filesystems , gvirstor can be used as a virtualized storage provider .
Read - only support for the XFS filesystem .
The unionfs filesystem has been fixed .
iSCSI initiator .
TSO and LRO support for some network drivers .
Experimental SCTP ( Stream Control Transmission Protocol ) support ( FreeBSD 's being the reference implementation ) .
Much improved wireless ( 802.11 ) support .
Network link aggregation / trunking ( lagg ( 4 ) ) imported from OpenBSD .
JIT compilation to turn BPF into native code , improving packet capture performance .
Much improved support for embedded system development for boards based on the ARM architecture .
jemalloc , a new and highly scalable user - level memory allocator .
freebsd - update ( 8 ) provides officially supported binary upgrades to new releases in addition to security fixes and errata patches .
X.Org 7.3 , KDE 3.5.8 , GNOME 2.20.2 .
GNU C compiler 4.2.1 .
BIND 9.4.2 .
For a complete list of new features and known problems , please see the online release notes and errata list , available at :
http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/7.0R/relnotes.html
http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/7.0R/errata.html

Availability
FreeBSD 7.0 - RELEASE is now available for the amd64 , i386 , ia64 , pc98 , and powerpc architectures .
The version for the sparc64 architecture will become available in a few days .
Some of the package builds are still in progress .
FreeBSD 7.0 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network ; the required files can be downloaded via FTP or BitTorrent as described in the sections below .
While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures , they will all generally contain the more common ones , such as i386 and amd64 .
MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO images are included at the bottom of this message .
The contents of the ISO images provided as part of the release has changed for most of the architectures .
Using the i386 architecture as an example , there are ISO images named ``bootonly '' , ``disc1 ' ' , ``disc2 '' , ``disc3 '' , ``livefs '' , and ``docs ' ' .
The ``bootonly '' image is suitable for booting a machine to do a network based installation using FTP or NFS .
The ``disc1 '' , ``disc2 '' , and ``disc3 '' images are used to do a full installation that includes a basic set of packages and does not require network access to an FTP or NFS server during the installation .
To boot into a ``live CD - based filesystem ' ' and system rescue mode ``disc1 '' and ``livefs '' are needed .
The ``docs '' image has all of the documentation for all supported languages .
Most people will find that ``disc1 '' , ``disc2 '' and ``disc3 '' are all that are needed if you want to install some packages during the initial install , and just ``disc1 ' ' if you prefer to install packages after the initial install is completed .
FreeBSD 7.0 - RELEASE can also be purchased on CD - ROM from several vendors .
One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 7.0 - based products is :
Bittorrent
7.0- RELEASE ISOs are available via BitTorrent .
A collection of torrent files to download the images is available at :
http://torrents.freebsd.org:8080/
FTP
The primary mirror site is :
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/
However , before trying the central FTP site , please check your regional mirror (s ) first by going to :
ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.
FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD
Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2 , ftp3 and so on .
More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at :
http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html
For instructions on installing FreeBSD , please see Chapter 2 of The FreeBSD Handbook .
It provides a complete installation walk - through for users new to FreeBSD , and can be found online at :
http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html
Updating Existing Systems
An upgrade of any existing system to FreeBSD 7.0 - RELEASE constitutes a major version upgrade , so no matter which method you use to update an older system you should reinstall any ports you have installed on the machine .
This will avoid binaries becoming linked to inconsistent sets of libraries when future port upgrades rebuild one port but not others that link to it .
This can be done with :
# portupgrade - faP
after updating your system .
Note some of the tools to help with this or the instructions below for FreeBSD Update are not installed by default ( e.g. portupgrade , gpg , or similar tools like portmaster ) .
Updates from Source
The procedure for doing a source code based update is described in the FreeBSD Handbook :
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/synching.html
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
The branch tag to use for updating the source is RELENG_7_0 .
FreeBSD Update
Starting with FreeBSD 6.3 , the freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems systems running earlier FreeBSD releases , release candidates , and betas .
Users upgrading to FreeBSD 7.0 from older releases ( in particular , older than 7.0 - RC1 ) will need to download an updated version of freebsd - update ( 8 ) that supports upgrading to a new release .
# fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~cperciva/freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz
Downloading and verifying the digital signature for the tarball ( signed by the FreeBSD Security Officer 's PGP key ) is highly recommended .
# fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~cperciva/freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz.asc
# gpg --verify freebsd - update- upgrade.tgz.asc freebsd-update-upgrade.tgz
The new freebsd - update ( 8 ) can then be extracted and run as follows :
# tar - xf freebsd - update - upgrade.
tgz
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd-update.conf -r 7.0 - RELEASE upgrade
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd- update.conf install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# shutdown -r now
Next , freebsd - update.sh needs to be run again to install the new userland components , after which all ports should be recompiled to link to new libraries :
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd- update.conf install
# portupgrade - faP
Finally , freebsd - update.sh needs to be run one last time to remove old system libraries , after which the system should be rebooted in order that the updated userland and ports will be running :
# sh freebsd - update.sh -f freebsd- update.conf install
# shutdown -r now

Ebbsfleet United are chasing a play - off place
In January more than 18,000 members voted on the £ 635,000 takeover , with 95.8 % backing the Kent club 's purchase .
The deal is believed to represent the first website - community takeover of a football club or business in the world .
Members will be able to vote on team selection , player transfers as well as other decisions affecting the club .
MyFootballClub has more than 28,000 members , spread over 80 countries .
In November , MyFootballClub announced it had reached agreement with Ebbsfleet - known as Gravesend & Northfleet until last summer - to buy control of the club .
Each of its members have paid £ 35 to provide a £ 700,000 takeover pot and , after the majority backed the move to acquire a 75 % controlling stake , they will all own an equal share in the club .
The first Internet team selection is scheduled to take place in March .
Last week Ebbsfleet announced sportswear manufacturer
Nike will manufacture home and away strips from next season after 91.26 % of the 13,809 members voted to accept their offer to supply kit and merchandise .
MyFootballClub members could be in control of team selection
" It 's a wonderful opportunity for the club , " said Brian Kilcullen , who will take over as interim chairman from club chairman Jason Botley .
" It 's been great to see Ebbsfleet fans and new supporters from around the world coming together , both at Stonebridge Road and online . "

Conventional wisdom has it that net neutrality is dead .
Embalmed .
Buried .
Covered with six feet of dirt and a mahogany lid .
But just in time for All Hallows Eve , the concept has risen from the dead like a zombie and started shambling round the halls of Congress as two senators asked the Senate Commerce Committee to look into the issue of network discrimination this week .
Senators Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) have tag - teamed in the past on the net neutrality issue , and they 're still a formidable bipartisan duo .
On Friday , the two senators asked the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to see if a lack of network neutrality rules were causing problems for Americans in the wake of some widely - publicized PR gaffes by some of the country 's largest telecommunications firms .
It was n't supposed to be this way .
Critics argued only a few weeks back that the issue had lost traction , both in Congress and among the public , because there just were n't any actual problems to get worked into a lather about .
Who needed rules when the telcos and cable operators were all behaving themselves so well ?
And then came the bad behavior , the litany of minor cases , dropping like early Christmas gifts into the laps of net neutrality advocates across the country .
AT&T censored political lyrics in a Pearl Jam webcast ( then apologized ) .
Verizon initially blocked a mass text message from NARAL Pro-Choice America ( then apologized ) .
Comcast was found to be delaying BitTorrent and Lotus Notes traffic ( and remains unapologetic ) .
AT&T 's new terms of service appeared to prohibit criticism of the company ( the company apologized and changed the terms ) .
The companies have all been quick to see just how bad such censorship looks from a PR perspective ; even Comcast has gone on a PR offensive to convince journalists and customers that it is not monitoring , filtering , or throttling traffic ( it 's just ... delaying it a bit ) .
But the damage appears to have been done .
No matter how many apologies or explanations are offered , net neutrality backers now have solid examples of the ways in which ISPs can affect the lives of ordinary netizens .
Whether the renewed Congressional interest in the matter will lead anywhere is one of the world 's great imponderables , right up there with " How far past its expiration date can I drink from this carton of milk ? "
Several federal agencies that might be charged with implementing network neutrality laws have already made their stances clear , though .
The FTC has weighed in with its opinion on network neutrality ( " No " ) , and the Department of Justice wrote a less - than - convincing position paper of its own that came to the same conclusion , but in stronger terms ( " Hell , no ! " ) .
The FCC is still looking into the issue .
Despite this federal skepticism , Dorgan and Snowe 's letter will come as a relief to network neutrality backers , who could only be more pleased if Ed Whitacre came out of retirement and started shooting off his mouth again .
Part of growing up is realizing almost everything your mom said was wrong .
This is especially true when it comes to the human body ( how many of you grew up with the " masturbation will make hair grow on your palms " thing ? ) where , as you 'll see , mom often failed to do her research .
" If you shave , your facial hair will grow back thicker ! "
The Lie :
Fellas , do you remember when you first started getting those wispy specks of hair on your chin ?
They were patchy and thin , but dammit you loved them , and you knew that it was merely a matter of months before you looked like those guys from ZZ Top .
Do you remember what your mom told you ?
" If you shave your beard / moustache / muttonchops off it will grow back thicker and look much nicer . "
So you continued shaving it until , sure enough , five years later you had a perfectly serviceable moustache .

The Truth :
Actually , the only reason you ever managed to grow those whiskers was simply time .
Renowned ( read : gets the most tail ) dermatologist Dr. Jerri Hoskyn M.D. , says here that , " Shaving is just a method of cutting the hair at the skin surface and has no effect on the part of the hair ... where growth and pigmentation occur . "
Who 's to argue with a man who had to go through eight years of medical school to cure pimples ?
So why do moms perpetuate this one ?
Most likely out of the embarrassment most mothers of pubescent boys feel .
It seems you did n't have the good fortune to hit the ground running with puberty like we Cracked staffers did , and it took you a few years to start looking and sounding like Powers Boothe .
Consequently you had a fuzzy neck beard , and your parents did n't want to be seen in public with you until you shaved it .

So instead of telling you straight up that you were a repulsive pock - marked abomination and having to hear you whine in your broken girly voice , they simply lied and told you shearing hair makes it stronger and thicker , knowing you would do it -- and keep doing it -- in a futile attempt look like Grizzly Adams .
With NASA lifting body airfoil technology and a sleek futuristic design , the Sea Phantom could be the ultimate watercraft .
It has a top speed of 150MPH and can seat 5 passengers .
According to its manufacturer , “ several computers operate quietly in the background sampling the vessel ’s attitude 400 times per second , automatically balancing the craft until manual override steering inputs are registered . ”

At the end of last year , at the Shanghai Auto Show , General Motors revealed their new car concept : Buick Riviera .
Also , the car is going to appear US Auto Show from Detroit this year .
The car has a traditional coupe profile that ’s greatly combined with Lamborghini doors , which allow wide entrance into the car ’s 2+2 interior .
There are no technical information about this car , but as you will see from the pictures , it ’s design is thrilling and probably the performance numbers would be like that too .
Here are several pictures with the Buick Riviera Concept
Almost 10 million children -- 27,000 a day --
die needlessly every year .
Why is there no war on this terror ?
by Shreeram Krishnaswami
" Another child will die in the time it takes to read this sentence .
And the death of that child , a child who had a name and a personality , a family and a future , is a rebuke to all humanity .
It is no longer necessary .
It is therefore no longer acceptable . "
State of the World 's Children -- UNICEF
According to the video documentary , " A World Without Water , " ( you can watch it at the bottom of this post ) " every day 3900 children die as a result of insufficient or unclean water supplies . "
Most of these children , under 5 years old , are dehydrated to death -- slowly , excruciatingly .
According to UNICEF , " 9.7 million children under five die ( every year ) four million in the first month of life .
Most of these deaths are from preventable and treatable diseases .
These children do n't die from birth defects or incurable diseases - they die from infections , diarrhea , pneumonia , malaria , measles , and other causes that are almost unheard of in our own country .
Undernutrition is a key factor in up to half of all child deaths . "
That 's about 27,000 children dying a day from easily preventable or treatable causes .
Their parents drown in their own tears .
Their only crime was to have the misfortune of being born on the " wrong " side of the tracks -- both globally and within their own countries .
So successful has been the dehumanization of these , the wretched of the earth , that year after year the holocaust of 10 million children remains invisible and silent to those with full bellies and working faucets .
We do n't allow our young children free access to money and bank accounts because we have n't yet " taught them how to manage money wisely . "
We fear they would fritter it away on toys and candy and perhaps do something reckless , like give some of it to friends .
Literally millions of pages have been written waxing eloquent on how best to teach children responsible money - management skills .
Yet the world over , wise adults collectively spend $ 1.1 trillion every year on weaponry -- weapons that , by denying people food and water , kill millions every year without ever firing a shot .
I take that back .
As the reprehensible NRA is fond of saying , " It 's not guns that kill people " without ever firing a shot .
It 's people who kill millions of people every year without ever saying a word .
Glenn Greenwald , Salon.com ) .
As Glenwald observes , there is a " bipartisan consensus on U.S. military spending . "
Yet a dollar a day can feed , clothe , house and educate a child .
A dollar a day can prevent the death of a child who has the same right to life that you and I do .
Instead we have an annual holocaust that murders 10 million of the most innocent , vulnerable and voiceless human beings on this bloody planet .
In this we are all silently complicit and all the water in the world can not wash that blood off our hands .
Can someone please explain to me why there is no war on this terror ?
More Water Facts and Figures :
* 1.1 billion people in the world do not have access to safe water , roughly one - sixth of the world 's population .
* 2.4 billion people in the world do not have access to adequate sanitation , about two - fifths of the world 's population .
* 2.2 million people in developing countries , most of them children , die every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water , inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene .
* Some 6,000 children die every day from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water , inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene – equivalent to 20 jumbo jets crashing every day .
* At any one time it is estimated that half of the world 's hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from water - borne diseases .
* 200 million people in the world are infected with schistosomiasis , of whom 20 million suffer severe consequences .
The disease is still found in 74 countries of the world .
Scientific studies show that a 77 % reduction of incidence from the disease was achieved through well designed water and sanitation interventions .
* The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is 6 km .
* The weight of water that women in Africa and Asia carry on their heads is the equivalent of your airport luggage allowance ( 20kg ) .
* The average person in the developing world uses 10 litres of water a day .
* The average person in the United Kingdom uses 135 litres of water every day .
* One flush of your toilet uses as much water as the average person in the developing world uses for a whole day 's washing , cleaning , cooking and drinking .
* Comparative costs :
In Europe $ 11 billion is spent each year on ice cream ; in USA and Europe , $ 17 billion is spent on pet food ; in Europe $ 105 billion is spent annually on alcoholic drinks , ten times the amount required to ensure water , sanitation and hygiene for all .
* In the past 10 years diarrhoea has killed more children than all the people lost to armed conflict since World War II .
* In China , India and Indonesia twice as many people are dying from diarrhoeal diseases as from HIV / AIDS .
* In 1998 , 308,000 people died from war in Africa , but more than two million ( six times as many ) died of diarrhoeal disease .

cloc counts blank lines , comment lines , and physical lines of source code in many programming languages .
Given two versions of a code base , cloc can compute differences in blank , comment , and source lines .
It is written entirely in Perl with no dependencies outside the standard distribution of Perl v5.6 and higher ( code from some external modules is embedded within cloc ) and so is quite portable .
cloc is known to run on many flavors of Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD , Mac OS X , AIX , HP - UX , Solaris , IRIX , z/OS , and Windows .
( To run the Perl source version of cloc on Windows one needs ActiveState Perl 5.6.1 or higher , Strawberry Perl , Cygwin , or MobaXTerm with the Perl plug - in installed .
Alternatively one can use the Windows binary of cloc generated with PAR :: Packer to run on Windows computers that have neither Perl nor Cygwin . )
cloc contains code from David Wheeler 's SLOCCount , Damian Conway and Abigail 's Perl module Regexp : : Common , Sean M. Burke 's Perl module Win32:: Autoglob , and Tye McQueen 's Perl module Algorithm : : Diff .
Language scale factors were derived from Mayes Consulting , LLC web site http://softwareestimator.com/IndustryData2.htm.
Depending your operating system , one of these installation methods may work for you :
npm install -g cloc # https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc sudo apt - get install cloc # Debian , Ubuntu sudo yum install cloc # Red Hat , Fedora sudo pacman - S cloc # Arch sudo pkg install cloc # FreeBSD sudo port install cloc # Mac OS X with MacPorts
The source code , release notes , Windows executable , and Unix package for the current stable release can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloc/files/cloc/v1.64/.
Source code for the latest Subversion commit can be found at http://sourceforge.net/p/cloc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/cloc.
cloc is licensed under the GNU General Public License , v2 , excluding portions which are copied from other sources .
Code copied from the Regexp : : Common , Win32:: Autoglob , and Algorithm : : Diff Perl modules is subject to the Artistic License .
cloc has many features that make it easy to use , thorough , extensible , and portable :
Exists as a single , self - contained file that requires minimal installation effort --- just download the file and run it .
Can read language comment definitions from a file and thus potentially work with computer languages that do not yet exist .
Allows results from multiple runs to be summed together by language and by project .
Can produce results in a variety of formats : plain text , SQL , XML , YAML , comma separated values .
Can count code within compressed archives ( tar balls , Zip files , Java .ear files ) .
Has numerous troubleshooting options .
Handles file and directory names with spaces and other unusual characters .
Has no dependencies outside the standard Perl distribution .
Runs on Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD , Mac OS X , AIX , HP - UX , Solaris , IRIX , and z / OS systems that have Perl 5.6 or higher .
The source version runs on Windows with either ActiveState Perl , Strawberry Perl , Cygwin , or MobaXTerm + Perl plugin .
Alternatively on Windows one can run the Windows binary which has no dependencies .
If cloc does not suit your needs here are other freely available counters to consider :
Other references :
QSM 's directory of code counting tools .
The Wikipedia entry for source code line counts .
Although cloc does not need Perl modules outside those found in the standard distribution , cloc does rely on a few external modules .
Code from three of these external modules -- Regexp : : Common , Win32 :: Autoglob , and Algorithm : : Diff - - is embedded within cloc .
A fourth module , Digest :: MD5 , is used only if it is available .
If cloc finds Regexp : : Common or Algorithm : : Diff installed locally it will use those installation .
If it does n't , cloc will install the parts of Regexp : : Common and / or Algorithm : Diff it needs to temporary directories that are created at the start of a cloc run then removed when the run is complete .
The necessary code from Regexp :: Common v2.120 and Algorithm : : Diff v1.1902 are embedded within the cloc source code ( see subroutines Install_Regexp_Common ( ) and Install_Algorithm_Diff ( ) ) .
Only three lines are needed from Win32:: Autoglob and these are included directly in cloc .
Additionally , cloc will use Digest :: MD5 to validate uniqueness among input files if Digest :: MD5 is installed locally .
If Digest :: MD5 is not found the file uniqueness check is skipped .
The Windows binary is built on a computer that has both Regexp : : Common and Digest : : MD5 installed locally .
The default Windows download , cloc - 1.64.exe , was built with PAR :: Packer on a Windows 7 computer with Strawberry Perl .
Windows executables of cloc versions 1.60 and earlier were built with perl2exe on a 32 bit Windows XP computer .
A small modification was made to the cloc source code before passing it to perl2exe ; lines 87 and 88 were uncommented :
85 # Uncomment next two lines when building Windows executable with perl2exe 86 # or if running on a system that already has Regexp :: Common . 87 #use Regexp :: Common ; 88 #$HAVE_Rexexp_Common = 1 ;
Why is the Windows executable so large ?
Windows executables of cloc versions 1.60 and earlier , created with perl2exe as noted above , are about 1.6 MB , while newer versions , created with PAR :: Packer , are 11 MB .
Why are the newer executables so much larger ?
My theory is that perl2exe uses smarter tree pruning logic than PAR :: Packer , but that 's pure speculation .
Create your own executable
If you have access to perl2exe , you can use it to create a tight Windows executable .
See lines 84 - 87 in the cloc source code for a minor code modification that is necessary when using perl2exe .
Otherwise , to build a Windows executable with pp from PAR :: Packer , first install a Windows - based Perl distribution ( for example Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl ) following their instructions .
Next , open a command prompt , aka a DOS window and install the PAR :: Packer module .
Finally , invoke the newly installed pp command with the cloc souce code to create an .exe file :
C:> perl - MCPAN -e shell cpan > install PAR :: Packer cpan > exit C :> pp cloc-1.64.pl
portableshell.bat
A variation on the above is if you installed the portable version of Strawberry Perl , you will need to runfirst to properly set up your environment .
The Strawberry Perl derived executable on the SourceForge download area was created with the portable version on a Windows 7 computer .
cloc is a command line program that takes file , directory , and / or archive names as inputs .
Here 's an example of running cloc against the Perl v5.10.0 source distribution :
prompt > cloc perl - 5.10.0.tar.gz 4076 text files .
3883 unique files .
1521 files ignored .

To run cloc on Windows computers , one must first open up a command ( aka DOS ) window and invoke cloc.exe from the command line there .
prompt > cloc Usage : cloc [ options ] < file (s ) / dir(s ) > | < set 1 > < set 2 > | < report files >
Count , or compute differences of , physical lines of source code in the given files ( may be archives such as compressed tarballs or zip files ) and / or recursively below the given directories .
Input Options -- extract - with= < cmd >
This option is only needed if cloc is unable to figure out how to extract the contents of the input file (s ) by itself .
Use < cmd > to extract binary archive files ( e.g. : .tar.gz , .zip , .Z ) .
Use the literal '> FILE <' as a stand - in for the actual file (s ) to be extracted .
For example , to count lines of code in the input files gcc -4.2.tar.gz perl -5.8.8.tar.gz on Unix use -- extract - with= ' gzip - dc > FILE < | tar xf -' or , if you have GNU tar , -- extract - with= ' tar zxf > FILE <' and on Windows use , for example : -- extract - with= " \ " c: \Program Files\WinZip\WinZip32.exe\ " -e -o > FILE < . " ( if WinZip is installed there ) .
-- list - file= < file >
Take the list of file and / or directory names to process from < file > , which has one file / directory name per line .
Only exact matches are counted ; relative path names will be resolved starting from the directory where cloc is invoked .
See also -- exclude - list - file .
-- unicode Check binary files to see if they contain Unicode expanded ASCII text .
This causes performance to drop noticably .
Processing Options -- autoconf Count .in files ( as processed by GNU autoconf ) of recognized languages .
-- by - file Report results for every source file encountered .
-- by - file - by - lang Report results for every source file encountered in addition to reporting by language .
-- count-and -diff < set1 > < set2 > First perform direct code counts of source file (s ) of < set1 > and < set2 > separately , then perform a diff of these .
Inputs may be pairs of files , directories , or archives .
See also -- diff , --diff - alignment , --diff-timeout , --ignore-case , --ignore - whitespace . -- diff < set1 > < set2 >
Compute differences in code and comments between source file (s ) of < set1 > and < set2 > .
The inputs may be pairs of files , directories , or archives .
Use -- diff - alignment to generate a list showing which file pairs where compared .
See also -- count - and - diff , -- diff - alignment , --diff- timeout , --ignore-case , --ignore - whitespace .
-- diff-timeout < N >
Ignore files which take more than < N > seconds to process .
Default is 10 seconds .
( Large files with many repeated lines can cause Algorithm : : Diff : : sdiff ( ) to take hours . ) -- follow - links [ Unix only ]
Follow symbolic links to directories ( sym links to files are always followed ) .
-- force-lang= < lang >[ , < ext > ]
Process all files that have a < ext > extension with the counter for language < lang > .
For example , to count all .f files with the Fortran 90 counter ( which expects files to end with .f90 ) instead of the default Fortran 77 counter , use -- force - lang = " Fortran 90 " , f If < ext > is omitted , every file will be counted with the < lang > counter .
This option can be specified multiple times ( but that is only useful when < ext > is given each time ) .
See also -- script- lang , -- lang - no - ext . -- force-lang -def= < file >
Load language processing filters from < file > , then use these filters instead of the built - in filters .
Note : languages which map to the same file extension ( for example : MATLAB / Objective C/ MUMPS / Mercury ; Pascal / PHP ; Lisp / OpenCL ; Lisp / Julia ; Perl / Prolog ) will be ignored as these require additional processing that is not expressed in language definition files .
Use -- read - lang - def to define new language filters without replacing built - in filters ( see also -- write - lang - def ) .
-- ignore - whitespace Ignore horizontal white space when comparing files with -- diff .
See also -- ignore - case .
-- ignore - case Ignore changes in case ; consider upper - and lower - case letters equivalent when comparing files with -- diff .
See also -- ignore - whitespace .
-- lang-no-ext=< lang >
Count files without extensions using the < lang > counter .
This option overrides internal logic for files without extensions ( where such files are checked against known scripting languages by examining the first line for #! ) .
See also -- force- lang , -- script - lang .
--max-file-size= < MB >
Skip files larger than < MB > megabytes when traversing directories .
By default , < MB >=100 .
cloc 's memory requirement is roughly twenty times larger than the largest file so running with files larger than 100 MB on a computer with less than 2 GB of memory will cause problems .
Note : this check does not apply to files explicitly passed as command line arguments .
-- read - binary - files Process binary files in addition to text files .
This is usually a bad idea and should only be attempted with text files that have embedded binary data .
-- read-lang - def= < file >
Load new language processing filters from < file > and merge them with those already known to cloc .
If < file > defines a language cloc already knows about , cloc 's definition will take precedence .
Use -- force - lang - def to over - ride cloc 's definitions ( see also -- write - lang - def ) . -- script-lang=<lang > ,<s >
Process all files that invoke < s > as a #!
scripting language with the counter for language < lang > .
For example , files that begin with #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.8.8 will be counted with the Perl counter by using -- script- lang =Perl , perl5.8.8
The language name is case insensitive but the name of the script language executable , < s > , must have the right case .
This option can be specified multiple times .
See also -- force - lang , -- lang - no - ext . -- sdir= < dir >
Use < dir > as the scratch directory instead of letting File : : Temp chose the location .
Files written to this location are not removed at the end of the run ( as they are with File : : Temp ) .
--skip-uniqueness
Skip the file uniqueness check .
This will give a performance boost at the expense of counting files with identical contents multiple times ( if such duplicates exist ) .
-- stdin-name= < file >
Give a file name to use to determine the language for standard input .
-- strip-comments=<ext >
For each file processed , write to the current directory a version of the file which has blank lines and comments removed .
The name of each stripped file is the original file name with . < ext > appended to it .
It is written to the current directory unless -- original - dir is on .
-- original - dir [ Only effective in combination with -- strip - comments ]
Write the stripped files to the same directory as the original files .
-- sum - reports
Input arguments are report files previously created with the - - report - file option .
Makes a cumulative set of results containing the sum of data from the individual report files .
-- unix Override the operating system autodetection logic and run in UNIX mode .
See also -- windows , -- show -os .
-- windows
Override the operating system autodetection logic and run in Microsoft Windows mode .
See also -- unix , -- show -os .
Filter Options -- exclude - dir= < D1 >[ , D2 , ]
Exclude the given comma separated directories D1 , D2 , D3 , et cetera , from being scanned .
For example -- exclude - dir=.cache , test will skip all files that have /. cache / or / test / as part of their path .
Directories named .bzr , .cvs , .hg , .git , and .svn are always excluded .
-- exclude-ext=<ext1 >[ , < ext2 >[... ]]
Do not count files having the given file name extensions .
-- exclude- lang= < L1 >[ , L2 , ]
Exclude the given comma separated languages L1 , L2 , L3 , et cetera , from being counted .
-- exclude - list - file= < file >
Ignore files and / or directories whose names appear in < file >. < file > should have one file name per line .
Only exact matches are ignored ; relative path names will be resolved starting from the directory where cloc is invoked .
See also -- list - file .
-- include-lang= <L1 >[ , L2 , ]
Count only the given comma separated languages L1 , L2 , L3 , et cetera .
-- match-d=< regex >
Only count files in directories matching the Perl regex .
For example -- match - d= ' /( src|include ) / ' only counts files in directories containing / src / or / include / . -- not-match -d= < regex >
Count all files except those in directories matching the Perl regex .
-- match-f=< regex >
Only count files whose basenames match the Perl regex .
For example -- match - f= ' ^ [ Ww ] idget ' only counts files that start with Widget or widget .
-- not-match - f=< regex >
Count all files except those whose basenames match the Perl regex .
-- skip-archive= < regex >
Ignore files that end with the given Perl regular expression .
For example , if given -- skip - archive= '( zip|tar ( . ( gz| Z|bz2|xz|7z ) ) ? ) ' the code will skip files that end with .zip , .tar , .tar.gz , .tar. Z , .tar.bz2 , .tar.xz , and .tar.7z .
-- skip-win- hidden
On Windows , ignore hidden files .
Debug Options -- categorized=< file >
Save names of categorized files to < file >. -- counted= < file >
Save names of processed source files to < file >. -- explain= < lang >
Print the filters used to remove comments for language < lang > and exit .
In some cases the filters refer to Perl subroutines rather than regular expressions .
An examination of the source code may be needed for further explanation .
-- diff-alignment=< file >
Write to < file > a list of files and file pairs showing which files were added , removed , and / or compared during a run with -- diff .
This switch forces the - - diff mode on .
-- help Print this usage information and exit .
-- found= < file >
Save names of every file found to < file >. -- ignored= < file >
Save names of ignored files and the reason they were ignored to < file > .
-- print - filter - stages
Print processed source code before and after each filter is applied .
-- show-ext [ =< ext >]
Print information about all known ( or just the given ) file extensions and exit .
-- show-lang[=< lang >]
Print information about all known ( or just the given ) languages and exit .
-- show - os Print the value of the operating system mode and exit .
See also -- unix , -- windows . -v[=<n >]
Verbose switch ( optional numeric value ) .
-- version Print the version of this program and exit .
-- write-lang -def= < file >
Writes to < file > the language processing filters then exits .
Useful as a first step to creating custom language definitions ( see also -- force - lang - def , -- read - lang - def ) .
Output Options -- 3 Print third - generation language output .
( This option can cause report summation to fail if some reports were produced with this option while others were produced without it . ) -- by- percent X Instead of comment and blank line counts , show these values as percentages based on the value of X in the denominator : X = ' c ' -> # lines of code X = ' cm ' ->
# lines of code + comments X = ' cb ' ->
# lines of code + blanks X = ' cmb ' ->
# lines of code + comments + blanks
For example , if using method ' c ' and your code has twice as many lines of comments as lines of code , the value in the comment column will be 200 % .
The code column remains a line count .
-- csv
Write the results as comma separated values .
--csv-delimiter=<C>
Use the character < C > as the delimiter for comma separated files instead of , .
This switch forces - - out= < file >
Synonym for -- report - file = < file > .
-- csv to be on .
-- progress - rate= <n>
Show progress update after every < n > files are processed ( default < n > =100 ) .
Set < n > to 0 to suppress progress output ( useful when redirecting output to STDOUT ) .
-- quiet Suppress all information messages except for the final report .
-- report - file= < file >
Write the results to < file > instead of STDOUT . -- sql= < file >
Write results as SQL create and insert statements which can be read by a database program such as SQLite .
If < file > is - , output is sent to STDOUT .
-- sql - append Append SQL insert statements to the file specified by -- sql and do not generate table creation statements .
Only valid with the -- sql option .
-- sql-project=<name >
Use < name > as the project identifier for the current run .
Only valid with the -- sql option .
-- sql-style= < style >
Write SQL statements in the given style instead of the default SQLite format .
Currently , the only style option is Oracle .
-- sum-one
For plain text reports , show the SUM : output line even if only one input file is processed .
-- xml Write the results in XML . -- xsl= < file > Reference < file > as an XSL stylesheet within the XML output .
If < file > is 1 ( numeric one ) , writes a default stylesheet , cloc.xsl ( or cloc - diff.xsl if -- diff is also given ) .
This switch forces -- xml on .
-- yaml Write the results in YAML .

The above list can be customized by reading language definitions from a file with the - - read - lang - def or -- force - lang - def options .
Eight file extensions have multiple language mappings :
.cl files could be Lisp or OpenCL
files could be Lisp or OpenCL .inc files could be PHP or Pascal
files could be PHP or Pascal .jl files could be Lisp or Julia
files could be Lisp or Julia .m files could be MATLAB , Mercury , MUMPS , or Objective C
files could be MATLAB , Mercury , MUMPS , or Objective C .p files could be D or dtrace
files could be D or dtrace .pl files could be Perl or Prolog
files could be Perl or Prolog .pp files could be Pascal or Puppet
files could be Pascal or Puppet . pro files could be IDL , Prolog , or a Qt Project
.m
cloc has subroutines that attempt to identify the correct language based on the file 's contents for these special cases .
Language identification accuracy is a function of how much code the file contains ; files with just one or two lines for example , seldom have enough information to correctly distinguish between MATLAB , Mercury , MUMPS , or Objective C .
Languages with file extension collisions are difficult to customize with -- read - lang - def or -- force - lang - def as they have no mechanism to identify languages with common extensions .
In this situation one must modify the cloc source code .
cloc 's method of operation resembles SLOCCount's : First , create a list of files to consider .
Next , attempt to determine whether or not found files contain recognized computer language source code .
Finally , for files identified as source files , invoke language - specific routines to count the number of source lines .
A more detailed description :
If the input file is an archive ( such as a .tar. gz or .zip file ) , create a temporary directory and expand the archive there using a system call to an appropriate underlying utility ( tar , bzip2 , unzip , etc ) then add this temporary directory as one of the inputs .
( This works more reliably on Unix than on Windows . )
Use File :: Find to recursively descend the input directories and make a list of candidate file names .
Ignore binary and zero - sized files .
Make sure the files in the candidate list have unique contents ( first by comparing file sizes , then , for similarly sized files , compare MD5 hashes of the file contents with Digest : : MD5 ) .
For each set of identical files , remove all but the first copy , as determined by a lexical sort , of identical files from the set .
The removed files are not included in the report .
( The -- skip - uniqueness switch disables the uniqueness tests and forces all copies of files to be included in the report . )
See also the - - ignored= switch to see which files were ignored and why .
Scan the candidate file list for file extensions which cloc associates with programming languages ( see the -- show - lang and - - show - ext options ) .
Files which match are classified as containing source code for that language .
Each file without an extensions is opened and its first line read to see if it is a Unix shell script ( anything that begins with # ! ) .
If it is shell script , the file is classified by that scripting language ( if the language is recognized ) .
If the file does not have a recognized extension or is not a recognzied scripting language , the file is ignored .
All remaining files in the candidate list should now be source files for known programming languages .
For each of these files : Read the entire file into memory .
Count the number of lines ( = L original ) .
Remove blank lines , then count again ( = L non_blank ) .
Loop over the comment filters defined for this language .
( For example , C++ has two filters : ( 1 ) remove lines that start with optional whitespace followed by // and ( 2 ) remove text between /* and */ )
Apply each filter to the code to remove comments .
Count the left over lines ( = L code ) .
Save the counts for this language :
blank lines = L original - L non_blank
comment lines = L non_blank - L code
code lines = L code
The options modify the algorithm slightly .
The -- read - lang - def option for example allows the user to read definitions of comment filters , known file extensions , and known scripting languages from a file .
The code for this option is processed between Steps 2 and 3 .
How can you tell if cloc correctly identifies comments ?
One way to convince yourself cloc is doing the right thing is to use its -- strip - comments option to remove comments and blank lines from files , then compare the stripped - down files to originals .
prompt > tar zxf sqlite - amalgamation - 3.5.6.tar.gz prompt > cd sqlite - 3.5.6 / prompt > cloc -- strip - comments=nc sqlite .c 1 text file .
1 unique file .
Wrote sqlite3.c.nc 0 files ignored .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let 's try this out with the SQLite amalgamation , a C file containing all code needed to build the SQLite library along with a header file :
The extention argument given to -- strip - comments is arbitrary ; here nc was used as an abbreviation for " no comments " .
cloc removed over 31,000 lines from the file :
prompt > wc -l sqlite3.c sqlite3.c.nc 82895 sqlite3.c 50901 sqlite3.c.nc 133796 total prompt > echo " 82895 - 50901 " | bc 31994
We can now compare the orignial file , sqlite3.c and the one stripped of comments , sqlite3.c.nc with tools like diff or vimdiff and see what exactly cloc considered comments and blank lines .
A rigorous proof that the stripped - down file contains the same C code as the original is to compile these files and compare checksums of the resulting object files .
First , the original source file :
prompt > gcc - c sqlite3.c prompt > md5sum sqlite3.o cce5f1a2ea27c7e44b2e1047e2588b49 sqlite3.o
Next , the version without comments :
prompt > mv sqlite3.c.nc sqlite3.c prompt > gcc - c sqlite3.c prompt > md5sum sqlite3.o cce5f1a2ea27c7e44b2e1047e2588b49 sqlite3.o
cloc removed over 31,000 lines of comments and blanks but did not modify the source code in any significant way since the resulting object file matches the original .
Versions of cloc before v1.07 required an - - extract - with = < cmd > option to tell cloc how to expand an archive file .
Beginning with v1.07 this is extraction is attempted automatically .
At the moment the automatic extraction method works reasonably well on Unix - type OS 's for the following file types : .tar.gz , .tar.bz2 , .tgz , .zip , .ear .
Some of these extensions work on Windows if one has WinZip installed in the default location ( C : \Program Files\WinZip\WinZip32.exe ) .
Additionally , with newer versions of WinZip , the command line add - on is needed for correct operation ; in this case one would invoke cloc with something like
-- extract - with= " \" c: \Program Files\WinZip\wzunzip\ " -e -o > FILE < . " ( ref. forum post ) .
In situations where the automatic extraction fails , one can try the - - extract - with = < cmd > option to count lines of code within tar files , Zip files , or other compressed archives for which one has an extraction tool .
cloc takes the user - provided extraction command and expands the archive to a temporary directory ( created with File : : Temp ) , counts the lines of code in the temporary directory , then removes that directory .
While not especially helpful when dealing with a single compressed archive ( after all , if you 're going to type the extraction command anyway why not just manually expand the archive ? ) this option is handy for working with several archives at once .
For example , say you have the following source tarballs on a Unix machine
perl -5.8.5.tar.gz
Python-2.4.2.tar.gz
and you want to count all the code within them .
The command would be
cloc -- extract - with= ' gzip -dc >FILE < | tar xf -' perl -5.8.5.tar.gz Python-2.4.2.tar.gz
cloc -- extract - with='tar zxf > FILE <' perl - 5.8.5.tar.gz Python-2.4.2.tar.gz
c: \Program Files \WinZip
cloc.exe -- extract - with= " \" c: \Program Files\WinZip\WinZip32.exe\ " -e -o > FILE < . " perl -5.8.5.tar.gz Python-2.4.2.tar.gz
.ear
.ear
Unix > cloc -- extract - with = " unzip -d .
> FILE < " Project.ear DOS > cloc.exe -- extract - with= " \" c: \Program Files\WinZip\WinZip32.exe\ " -e -o > FILE < . "
Project.ear
If that Unix machine has GNU tar ( which can uncompress and extract in one step ) the command can be shortened toOn a Windows computer with WinZip installed inthe command would look likeJavafiles are Zip files that contain additional Zip files .
cloc can handle nested compressed archives without difficulty -- provided all such files are compressed and archived in the same way .
Examples of counting a Javafile in Unix and Windows :
The -- diff switch allows one to measure the relative change in source code and comments between two versions of a file , directory , or archive .
Differences reveal much more than absolute code counts of two file versions .
For example , say a source file has 100 lines and its developer delivers a newer version with 102 lines .
Did he add two comment lines , or delete seventeen source lines and add fourteen source lines and five comment lines , or did he do a complete rewrite , discarding all 100 original lines and adding 102 lines of all new source ?
The diff option tells how many lines of source were added , removed , modified or stayed the same , and how many lines of comments were added , removed , modified or stayed the same .
In addition to file pairs , one can give cloc pairs of directories , or pairs of file archives , or a file archive and a directory .
cloc will try to align file pairs within the directories or archives and compare diffs for each pair .
For example , to see what changed between GCC 4.4.0 and 4.5.0 one could do
cloc -- diff gcc-4.4.0.tar.bz2 gcc-4.5.0.tar.bz2
-- diff
Be prepared to wait a while for the results though ; theoption runs much more slowly than an absolute code count .
To see how cloc aligns files between the two archives , use the - - diff - alignment option
cloc --diff-aligment=align.txt gcc-4.4.0.tar.bz2 gcc-4.5.0.tar.bz2
align.txt
to produce the filewhich shows the file pairs as well as files added and deleted .

Python-X/ Mac / Modules/qd/qdsupport.py
Note the two errors for the file .
This file has Python docstrings ( text between pairs of triple quotes ) that contain C comments .
cloc treats docstrings as comments and handles them by first converting them to C comments , then using the C comment removing regular expression .
Nested C comments yield erroneous results however .
There 's also output for the language " ( unknown ) " .
Files in this category are non-source files and therefore not counted ; their presence is merely noted as having been removed , added , or modified .
cloc can write its language comment definitions to a file or can read comment definitions from a file , overriding the built - in definitions .
This can be useful when you want to use cloc to count lines of a language not yet included , to change association of file extensions to languages , or to modify the way existing languages are counted .
The easiest way to create a custom language definition file is to make cloc write its definitions to a file , then modify that file :
Unix > cloc --write-lang-def=my_definitions.txt
my_definitions.txt
-- read-lang-def
--force-lang-def
--force-lang-def
Unix > cloc --read-lang-def=my_definitions.txt file1 file2 dir1 ...
creates the filewhich can be modified then read back in with either theoroption .
The difference between the options is former merges language definitions from the given file in with cloc 's internal definitions with cloc' taking precedence if there are overlaps .
Theoption , on the other hand , replaces cloc 's definitions completely .
This option has a disadvantage in preventing cloc from counting languages whose extensions map to multiple languages as these languages require additional logic that is not easily expressed in a definitions file .
Each language entry has four parts :
The language name starting in column 1 .
One or more comment filters starting in column 5 .
One or more filename extensions starting in column 5 . A 3rd generation scale factor starting in column 5 .
This entry must be provided but its value is not important unless you want to compare your language to a hypothetical third generation programming language .
C++ filter remove_matches ^\s*// filter call_regexp_common
C extension C extension cc extension cpp extension cxx extension pcc 3rd_gen_scale 1.51
//
A filter defines a method to remove comment text from the source file .
For example the entry for C++ looks like thisC++ has two filters : first , remove lines that start with optional whitespace and are followed by .
Next , remove all C comments .
C comments are difficult to express as regular expressions so a call is made to Regexp : : Common to get the appropriate regular expression to match C comments which are then removed .
A more complete discussion of the different filter options may appear here in the future .
The output of cloc's -- write - lang - def option should provide enough examples for motivated individuals to modify or extend cloc 's language definitions .
If you manage multiple software projects you might be interested in seeing line counts by project , not just by language .
Say you manage three software projects called MySQL , PostgreSQL , and SQLite .
The teams responsible for each of these projects run cloc on their source code and provide you with the output .
For example MySQL team does
cloc -- report-file=mysql-5.1.42.txt mysql-5.1.42.tar.gz
mysql-5.1.42.txt
Unix > cat mysql-5.1.42.txt

The report combination produces two output files , one for sums by programming language ( ) and one by project ( ) .
Their contents are
Report files themselves can be summed together .
Say you also manage development of Perl and Python and you want to keep track of those line counts separately from your database projects .
First create reports for Perl and Python separately :
cloc -- report - file=perl-5.10.0.txt perl-5.10.0.tar.gz cloc --report-file=python-2.6.4.txt Python-2.6.4.tar.bz2

then sum these together withFinally , combine the combination files :
Cloc can write results in the form of SQL table create and insert statements for use with relational database programs such as SQLite , MySQL , PostgreSQL , Oracle , or Microsoft SQL .
Once the code count information is in a database , the information can be interrogated and displayed in interesting ways .
A database created from cloc SQL output has two tables , metadata and t :
metadata Field
Type timestamp text project text elapsed_s real t Field Type project text language text file text nBlank integer nComment integer nCode integer nScaled real
The metadata table contains information about when the cloc run was made .
The -- sql - append switch allows one to combine many runs in a single database ; each run adds a row to the metadata table .
The code count information resides in table t.
Let 's repeat the code count examples of Perl , Python , SQLite , MySQL and PostgreSQL tarballs shown in the combine reports example above , this time using the SQL output options and the SQLite database engine .
The -- sql switch tells cloc to generate output in the form of SQL table create and insert commands .
The switch takes an argument of a file name to write these SQL statements into , or , if the argument is 1 ( numeric one ) , streams output to STDOUT .
Since the SQLite command line program , sqlite3 , can read commands from STDIN , we can dispense with storing SQL statements to a file and use -- sql 1 to pipe data directly into the SQLite executable :
cloc -- sql 1 --sql- project mysql mysql-5.1.42.tar.gz | sqlite3 code.db
-- sql - project mysql
Thepart is optional ; there 's no need to specify a project name when working with just one code base .
However , since we 'll be adding code counts from four other tarballs , we 'll only be able to identify data by input source if we supply a project name for each run .
Now that we have a database we will need to pass in the -- sql - append switch to tell cloc not to wipe out this database but instead add more data :
cloc -- sql 1 --sql- project postgresql -- sql- append postgresql-8.4.2.tar.bz2 | sqlite3 code.db cloc -- sql 1 --sql- project sqlite -- sql- append sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.22.tar.gz | sqlite3 code.db cloc -- sql 1 --sql- project python -- sql- append Python-2.6.4.tar.bz2 | sqlite3 code.db cloc -- sql 1 -- sql- project perl -- sql- append perl-5.10.0.tar.gz | sqlite3 code.db
Now the fun begins -- we have a database , code.db , with lots of information about the five projects and can begin querying it for all manner of interesting facts .

's default output format leaves a bit to be desired .
We can add an option to the program 's rc file , , to show column headers :
One might be tempted to also includeinbut this causes problems when the output has more than one row since the widths of entries in the first row govern the maximum width for all subsequent rows .
Often this leads to truncated output -- not at all desireable .
One option is to write a custom SQLite output formatter such as sqlite_formatter .
It is used like so : Note also thathas an HTML output option , , that might also prove useful .
cloc versions before 1.50 by default computed , for the provided inputs , a rough estimate of how many lines of code would be needed to write the same code in a hypothetical third - generation computer language .
To produce this output one must now use the - - 3 switch .
Scale factors were derived from the 2006 version of language gearing ratios listed at Mayes Consulting web site , http://softwareestimator.com/IndustryData2.htm, using this equation :
cloc scale factor for language X = 3rd generation default gearing ratio / language X gearing ratio
for example ,
cloc 3rd generation scale factor for DOS Batch = 80 / 128 = 0.625
The biggest flaw with this approach is that gearing ratios are defined for logical lines of source code not physical lines ( which cloc counts ) .
The values in cloc's ' scale ' and ' 3rd gen. equiv . ' columns should be taken with a large grain of salt .
Identifying comments within source code is trickier than one might expect .
Many languages would need a complete parser to be counted correctly .
cloc does not attempt to parse any of the languages it aims to count and therefore is an imperfect tool .
The following are known problems :
Lines containing both source code and comments are counted as lines of code .
Comment markers within strings or here - documents are treated as actual comment markers and not string literals .
For example the following lines of C code printf ( " /* " ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i++) { a += i ; } printf ( " */ " ) ; appear to cloc as two lines of C code ( the lines with black text ) and three lines of comments ( the lines which have only red text - - lines with both black and red text are treated as code ) .
Lua long comments are not recognized .
If cloc does not recognize a language you are interested in counting , post the following information to a Feature Request at cloc 's Source Forge page :
File extensions associated with the language .
If the language does not rely on file extensions and instead works with fixed file names or with #!
style program invocations , explain what those are .
A description of how comments are defined .

Spoons are so last year .
Who has time to find a clean one , lift your hand , swirl your wrist to mix in sugar with your tea or coffee , tap the spoon dry or lick it and then place it back on the plate ?
I mean really , are we animals !?
No , most of us are not .
So that is why Florian Dussopt , Jérémie Reneau & Julie Girard got together and created the “ Ceramix For Mix ” saucer and cup design .
All sarcasm aside , this is a elegant and simple design .
Incorporating a molded glass groove ( resembling a roulette wheel ) that acts as a track for a ceramic ball as well as keep you from choking to death on it , the user is inclined to swirl the cup using centrifugal force to mix your beverage .
I applaud the design and am still pondering its need over my premixed vanilla latte .

HAUPPAUGE , N.Y . 
The men gathered in a new golf clubhouse here a couple of weeks ago circled the problem from every angle , like caddies lining up a shot out of the rough .
“ We have to change our mentality , ” said Richard Rocchio , a public relations consultant .
“ The problem is time , ” offered Walter Hurney , a real estate developer .
“ There just is n’t enough time .
Men wo n’t spend a whole day away from their family anymore . ”
William A. Gatz , owner of the Long Island National Golf Club in Riverhead , said the problem was fundamental economics : too much supply , not enough demand .
The problem was not a game of golf .
It was the game of golf itself .
Over the past decade , the leisure activity most closely associated with corporate success in America has been in a kind of recession .
Tracey Edmonds Would n't Sign Pre-Nup to Wed Eddie Murphy
HAHAHAHA , andhad a commitment ceremony in Bora Bora in front of friends and family on New Years Day .
Because the ceremony was not considered legal , the two planned on coming back to the states and making it official .
One little problem came up ; Tracey would n't sign the prenup .
I gotta ask why the hell they would n't have discussed this before they flew to Bora Bora and professed their undying love for each other ?
She was so in love until she was told , 'oh yeah and in the event of a divorce , you get nada ' .
How funny is that ?!
For the record , neither Eddie nor Tracey 's rep would comment on the matter .
HOUSTON , Texas ( CNN ) -- Former President Bush endorsed John McCain on Monday and defended the conservative record of the Republican Party 's presumptive presidential nominee .
Former President Bush endorses Sen. John McCain at an event in Houston , Texas , Monday .
Bush 's endorsement was another sign the GOP 's establishment is coalescing around the Arizona senator .
" At this critical time in history ... the United States of America cannot be allowed to falter , " the 41st president said in Houston , Texas .
" No one is better to lead our nation in these trying times than Senator John McCain .
" His character was forged in the crucible of war , " Bush said , referring to McCain 's experience as a Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Watch Bush praise McCain character »
Bush served as a Navy pilot during World War II .
Like McCain , Bush was shot down in combat .
" Few men walking among us have sacrificed so much for the cause of human freedom , " Bush said .
" I believe now is the right time for me to help John in his effort to start building the broad - based coalition it'll take for our conservative values to carry the White House this fall , " the former president said .
After Bush spoke , McCain said that his endorsement would " help me enormously in the process of uniting our party and moving forward . "
McCain is working to win the support the party 's conservative base , many of whom were angered by the positions the Arizona Republican took on immigration , campaign finance and other issues as well as his willingness to work with Democrats to pass legislation .
Bush said the criticism of McCain 's record by some conservatives was " absurd " and " grossly unfair . "
" He 's got a record that everybody can analyze in the Senate , a sound , conservative record , and yet he 's not above reaching out to the other side , " he said .
The former president , who served as President Reagan 's vice president , noted that Reagan was attacked by " ultra - right " activists who said his record was not conservative enough when he ran for president in 1980 .
McCain strategists see the Bush endorsement as a way to send another message to the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee to exit the race .
The Bush nod also may bolster McCain in Texas , where a strong bloc of politically active social conservatives could embarrass him in the state 's March 4 primary .
Though saying he " had not come here to tell any other candidate what to do , " Bush seemed to suggest that it was time for Huckabee to end his campaign .
" After so much time and exhaustive effort by so many friends , it can take a while for any candidate to read the handwriting on the wall , and that certainly was true of me , " he said .
After Monday 's endorsement , McCain , who has 830 of the 1,191 delegates needed to win the nomination , heads to Wisconsin , where Huckabee , who has 217 delegates , is already campaigning .
On Thursday , former GOP rival Mitt Romney threw his support behind McCain , calling him a true American hero " capable of leading our country in this dangerous hour . "
Watch the two former rivals shake hands »
Romney had collected 286 delegates before he suspended his campaign two weeks ago .
Those delegates would put McCain less than 100 delegates away from securing the nomination .
On Sunday , McCain brought memories of Bush 's infamous broken promise -- " read my lips : no new taxes " -- after the 2008 candidate was asked whether he would make a similar pledge .
Speaking on ABC's " This Week , " McCain said he would not increase taxes under any circumstances and mentioned several alternatives , including lowering interest rates and corporate tax rates " if our economy continues to deteriorate . "
" There 's a lot of things that I would think we should do to relieve that burden , including , obviously , as we all know , simplification of the tax code , " he said .
Budget analysts , however , say it will be tough for McCain to keep his " no new taxes " pledge , like it was for former President Bush .
" The problems in the future are so large , that it 's pretty unthinkable we could close those deficits either by just cutting programs or just raising taxes .
We 're going to have to do both sooner or later , " said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .

ニコニコ動画の新サービス 「ニコニコ素材」を提案するも合わせて読んでみてください。
はじめに
ニコポイントとはひろゆき氏がインタビューの中で新機能の候補として可能性の一部として考えてる機能で、基本的に株式会社はてなにおける「はてなポイント」と似たようなサービスで、ユーザーが他のユーザーにポイントを送れるシステムです。この記事では、ニコポイントが実現するために作らなければいけない仕組み、そして将来的にどのような方面で応用し、ビジネスモデルとして成り立たせるかを考えていきます。
「 Web2.0 は 大嫌い 」 とひろゆき氏 ニコ動有料版で 「 もっと面白くしたい 」 ( 2/3 ) 2007年06月18 日 より文、イメージともに引用
要約：ユーザーがクリエイターを直接支援できるようになるのが理想

なぜニコニコポイントが必要か
理不尽な大前提を確立してしまったインターネット
まず、インターネットというものは、国によって普及しだした時期が違います。
それゆえ社会の対応が遅く、ネットでの金銭の扱い方が、いまだに理想とはかけ離れた、大掛かりで手間がかかる作業になっています。
「 コンビ二に行ってテレホンカードのようにネット通貨を買って、パソコンに差し込んで、全世界のどんなサイトでも買い物や金銭のやり取りをする」
そういうシステムは国内だけとかならありますが、グローバルなシステムは未だに確立されていません。
それが、10年前の1998年ぐらいに完成していれば、今頃ネットは違う進化の仕方をしていたでしょう。ＭＰ３のブーム、Ｐ２Ｐのブーム、そして動画共有サイトのブームを、ある程度防げたと思います。しかし、今となっては人間の著作物に関する価値観は変わってしまいました。
ネットの文化というのは、基本的に「無料」という大前提の中で成り立っています。流れでそうなってしまったんです。コンテンツを無料で見せて、そこから利益を生む方法は、基本的に広告収入でしか成り立ちません。しかし、広告収入では賄えない分野の活動などは、正規な報酬が入らないような仕組みになっていて、コンテンツ業界に関しては、海賊行為が絶えません。
いまどき、小学校に行って 「インターネットで音楽とかダウンロードしてますか」という質問に対して子供が正直に答えた場合、大抵は「お金が無いから買えない。でもほしいからダウンロードする。」とか、「無料で手に入るものになんでお金払わなければいけないのか」というように、著作者が頑張って著作物を作ってくれてることに、感謝の気持ちの欠片も無い態度を取っています。
「無料でダウンロードするのは犯罪を肯定してるってことになるし、好きなバンドの人が仕事止めてサラリーマンになっちゃうかもよ？」という質問をすると、最近の小学生は「別に構わないし、というか実質ＪＡＳＲＡＣにぼったくられてるだけだし、シングルのＣＤに１０５０円払ったら国に５０円行って、歌手に30円（３％）*しか行かない仕組みなんだし、買う気うせるよね」なんてことは小学生が言うわけないですが、社会が卑怯だっていうのは多分気づいています。
今の業界というのはクリエイターが成果を出すと「経済効果」が出るっていうじゃないですか。つまりそのクリエイターの才能で稼いだ金がクリエイターに行かないで大部分が他のところに行ってるわけです。そういう意味では今の時代、ぼったくりをしようとしている人達が、今までのように利益を得ていないわけですので、「ざまあ見ろ」という風にも思えます。
しかし、これからネットがさらに進化する上で、ネット上のクリエイターが、無料でコンテンツを公開して、同時にその人にお金が入る仕組みができないと、クリエイターが報われません。
要約：クリエイターに対価を支払う方法は、必ずしも「何かを買う」というのが最善な方法ではない
＊音楽CDの場合、価格の３％は歌手に、１％は作曲者に、１％が作詞者に行く仕組みです。シングルで一枚３０円はまだマシなほうで、アルバムとかだと曲数で割るのでもっと悲惨です。
現状でクリエイターがネット上で利益を得る方法
クリエイターがウェブサイトを持ってることを前提にした場合：
1.通信販売：印刷物や音楽ＣＤなどを、パッケージとして輸送して、銀行振り込みなどで販売する方法
2.ダウンロード販売：DLsite.comのようなサイトでコンテンツをデジタル化して販売する方法。
3.アフィリエイト：Amazonのリンクを貼って、そのリンク経由で品物が購入されると、利益の一部が還元される方法
4.広告：Adsenseのようなクリック保障型広告を貼ることによって利益を得る方法
要約：広告とか貼るのは、人を騙してるみたいで嫌だ
アフィリエイトとバナー広告は、そのクリエイターのサイトのアクセスが高くないと、一日１円も入らないときがあります。また、サイトの更新がアクセスを増やすのなら、ブログを更新しまくるといったような、そのクリエイターの本当の才能とは違うところで無駄に頑張ってしまったり、結局収入が足りないので、現実問題サイトを止めてしまうということもあると思います。ダウンロード販売などに関しては、クレジットカードを持ってる人間だけが買えるというようなことが多いです。ハードルが高すぎます。結果、例えば同人の場合、結局同人誌即売会で手渡し販売したりして、稼いで、Ｗｅｂは宣伝の方法でしかないという位置づけになってる場合が多いです。しかも同人っていうのは大手サークル以外利益なんて出ない場合が殆んどです。
要約：ネット上で儲けられないからリアルに逃げるも、結局元が取れない
理想のクリエイターへの報酬の仕組み
イメージしてみてください
クリエイターはコンテンツをネット上で無料公開する
鑑賞してる人たちは、その人に自分で金額を決めて、その人に寄付できる
寄付できない人は、自分のブログ等にリンクをしたりして、クリエイターを応援する。
Ｗｉｎｎｙの作者の人の案ですねこれは。次回作を期待するという意味で、その人に投資する感覚、そして、素晴らしい作品を提供してくれたことに感謝する意図での寄付。それが今までのビジネスの中で無視され続けた発想です。ビジネスじゃないからなんでしょうけどね。
要約：人それぞれ応援の仕方には違いがある。何かを買わない限り応援していることにならないのは理不尽だ。
「 寄付」それはどういう違いを生むのか。
簡単に言うと、あなたがこのブログを気に入ってくださったとして、小額でも寄付してくださったら、自分は明日もブログを書くと思います。モチベーションっていうのですかね、別にお金のためにやってるわけではないですが、お金を頂くことでやる気が出るってことは、人間どこかで「好きなことやってお金稼ぎたい」という願望があるようです。逆にモチベーションが無いと、明日の今頃ゲーム遊んでると思います。（書いてるのは夜中です）
なんと本当にポイント寄付してくださった方がいました。ありがたく頂きます。自分の記事は内容が長いので数日間必要な場合があるんで、気長に待っててください。ありがとうございました。
それは、ストリートミュージシャンが路上ライブをやってるとして、その歌声やら曲やらを気に入った人が通りかかった場合「ありがとう、頑張って」という意味で寄付するのと同じです。いわゆる｢投げ銭」ですね。リアルだと、財布を開けて小銭を取り出すだけの行為が、ネットではクレジットカードを使わないといけないとかハードルが高すぎるでしょう。でもハードルを低くした仕組みを作れば、ネットでも路上ライブ的なことが出来るのではないか。自分はそう考えました。
要約：路上ライブの文化ほど信頼関係が重視される寄付スタイルはない。投げ銭ほど、自分の心が現れるお金のやり取りは見たことが無い。それは、金額に関係なく「魂が宿っている」と思えるほどだ。
はてなポイントの仕組み
一応自分は、はてなポイントを買ったことがあるので書きますが
他人に送れる はてなの有料機能を使いたいときに支払える アマゾンと楽天とかでポイントで商品を購入できる はてな運営側はポイントがユーザー間で送られる際、手数料を取る ポイントを現金化することはできな い
他に色々あると思いますが、基本的にこんな感じですよね
ニコニコ動画がこのシステムを採用した場合どうなるか
要約：何をどうあがいても運営には取り分がある。
ニコポイント( 仮）がなぜ現実化できないと言われてるか
１．違法アップロードで儲けようとする人達
例えばアニメの違法アップロードを繰り返してる人達に、それを支援してる人達の情が移ったら寄付しかねない。構図として、「他人のコンテンツでお金を稼いでる」わけで、ＮＧ。
2．釣り動画
「寄付してくれれば見せてあげる」などという文を動画内に置き、ＺＩＰでどこかのアップローダーに違法コンテンツを載せておいて、「みんなありがとう〜。ＯＯポイントの寄付が集まったらもっと色々載せちゃうよ」といったようなことを書いて儲けようとする。構図として、「他人のコンテンツでお金を稼いでる」わけで、ＮＧ。
3.ランキング工作、外部ブログ工作
コメントを沢山して、動画を目立たせたりして客を集めたり、外部ブログを沢山作って動画ページをリンクしまくることによって、ページランクを上げてネット検索で引っかかりやすいようにするとか。自作自演や、ポイント目的でアグレッシブな行動が行われる可能性があるのでＮＧ
ネットでは、これらを理由にニコニコ動画内で、はてなのようなポイントシステムを採用できないという議論が交わされていて、ニコポイントの案自体が棚上げ状態だ。しかし、この程度の問題はいわゆる「なんでもありになってしまう」というような、ゲームのバグと同じで、制限や条件を付けてやれば普通に解決すると自分は思うのでそれを書いてみる。
要約：悪用しようとしている輩は、一人ずつ潰せばいい。
基本的な解決 作
1．タグで分別する
特定のタグが貼られているのを条件に、ポイント送信機能が発動する。例えば、「ミクオリジナル曲」というタグの貼られている動画は、初音ミクを使ったオリジナル曲を使用してることが条件だから、アニメ本編の動画に「ミクオリジナル曲」タグが付けられていたら、「釣り」と言われて当然だ。特定のタグの動画だけポイント送信機能が使えることによって、運営はそのタグの動画だけを見張っていればいい。ポイント送信対応タグの例：ミクオリジナル曲、リンオリジナル曲、レンオリジナル曲、カイトオリジナル曲、メイコオリジナル曲、バンドオリジナル曲等。次第に対応タグを増やしていけば良い。
要約：特定のタグが貼られた時のみポイント送信機能が発動
2．動画投稿者がポイントシステムを発動させるにはいくつか条件をクリアしなければいけない
アップして、ポイント送信機能が使えるタグを動画に追加したら、投稿者コメントで、自分のウェブサイトが記入可能で、それがインターフェイスのどこかにリンクとして出る。投稿者は、そのウェブサイトに、「ニコニコ動画のポイント送信機能で寄付を受け付けています」の類のバナーかアイコンを貼らなければいけない。鑑賞してる人達は寄付するにあたって、サイトに一度足を運びその投稿者が本当にその作品の作者かどうか、言動をチェックしたうえで寄付する。可能性として、単に同人ＣＤなどを買ってきて、それをＭＰ３に変換し、動画としてアップしてオリジナル曲と装う偽者が現れる場合があるからだ。本物として認めてもらう方法として、イベントでの写真や、初音ミクだったらＶＳＱファイル、アカペラ音源、作りかけの曲、作業環境の写真、ソフトウェアで作品を作ってる最中のスクリーンショット等を公開して本物と信じてもらうようにする。偽者が本家のサイトのＵＲＬを貼る場合も考えて、アイコンの下に登録している動画ＩＤを添えておく。また、同じＵＲＬが2つのユーザーＩＤから登録されてはならないシステムにする。(画像使用元は自分のようつべ動画から)
この処置を行うことよって、つまり本家サイトを完全コピーしたりしてオリジナルと装った、相当悪質な偽者以外は存在しなくなる。そういうのは週刊誌を切り取って同人誌として投稿するのと同等のレベルの犯罪なので、ユーザー間の情報網を使って見張るしかない。まとめサイトなどがあれば情報を提供し合って偽者を追放できるかもしれない。
要約：作者が本物か確かめてから寄付。
3．ニコニコ動画の運営側がスタンプをつけないといけない
動画投稿され、ＵＲＬが記入された時点でポイント送信機能は発動し、ポイントが贈れるようになるが、送ったらすぐにそのユーザーに届いて、ポイントが使えるようになるわけじゃなく、一週間程度の間の審査期間があり、運営側がポイントが多い順に動画が違法かどうかチェックしていく。その間、寄付されているポイントは「保留」という位置づけで、いわゆるニコニコ市場での予約のように、キャンセルしたりできる。動画が合法かどうかを投票できるシステムを設置して、「ＹＥＳ」の場合も「 ＮＯ」の場合も理由をユーザーに書いてもらい、確認する。勿論その動画が違法だと運営が判断した場合その動画が削除されるかは、ケースバイケースだと思うが、少なくともポイント送信機能は無効化して、保留されていたポイントは全て送信者に戻る。動画がオリジナルだと判った場合は、その動画に運営公認のマークが、タイトルの終わりとかに付く。同時に今まで保留されていたポイントは投稿者に行き、そこからは、新たなポイント送信があった場合、リアルタイムでそれが確認できる。
要約：運営が動画を審査
要約：はてなポイントのシステムそのまま
4.コメントの制限と別ランキングの用意
投稿者にはお金がらみの投稿を許可している以上、色々ハンデを背負わせる。まず、マイリストランキングでは、専用の別のランキングを用意することで、ノーマル投稿との分別化を行う。一人がコメントできる回数、何時間内にどのくらいの頻度でコメントできるかなどを一般投稿よりも厳しくする。投稿者自身のコメントは投稿者コメントでしかできなくて、検索に「age」として引っかかるのは一日一回まで。同じ人間が複数コメントしても、「age」」として認識されるのは最初の一回のみ。他のコメントは「sage」として認識される。これを解除したい場合は、一般投稿モードにしなければいけない。勿論一般投稿モードでは寄付を受け付けない。モードの変更は3日間とかのタイムラグをかけることによって、モードスイッチを多様しながらアクセスを稼ぐ手法を阻止。これによって、自作自演系の行為は防げる。
要約：コメントしまくってもいいが、検索結果に影響するのは最初の一回だけ
「寄付受付モード」の動画は、ある一定の数より上回ってはいけない。例えば、一人当たり１０動画とか。それ以外は一般投稿モードにしなければいけない。そうすれば、全ユーザー公平に１０動画しか「寄付受付モード」にできない。どれを「寄付受付モード」にするかは投稿者次第、これによって、沢山動画をスパムアップロードする馬鹿な行為を防げる。また、「寄付受付モード」は＠ジャンプ、＠キーワードジャンプ機能を受け付けない。どっち道、ユーザーを不快にしたら寄付なんてしてもらえるわけがない。クオリティーの高い動画で勝負するしかなくなる。まだこれだけでは穴があるかもしれないがこういうことは適当に考えれてば必ず解決策が出てくる。
要約：作品が多ければ良いというわけではない。
（これについて書いたのは、ニコニコ動画の現状が、「sage機能が無い２ちゃんねる」みたいになっているからです）
5.コラボによるポイント分配
例えばミクオリジナル曲の場合、複数のユーザーがコラボしながら音楽を作っていくことがある。作曲、編曲、ミクパートなどなど、５：５で分配したい場合もあるだろうし、３：３：４とかで寄付を分配したい場合も有るだろう。専用のページを作って...いや、ニコスクリプトでおそらく十分だと思う。
動画の投稿者コメントで
＠ share spyre 「 30 % 」 milky 「 35 % 」 monster 「 35 % 」
と入力すると、そういう分配率で寄付がシェアされる。そういうのは予めメンバー間で話し合う必要があるが、ネットでのコラボを続けるためにも、公平に分配するのは大前提だ。(シェア機能で寄付を分配されて良い動画は、簡単に言うと「寄付をもらって良い動画は一人当たり10個まで。一人が複数アカウント持ってる場合とか、そういうのはそもそも規約違反とかそういう次元の話なので、別に考えるべき。
要約：コラボした人にも寄付金を公平に還元できるようにする。
オリジナル作品ではな い 「 ＭＡＤ 動画 」の作者にも収益を
ＭＡＤ 動画の文化というのは、関連商品の販売促進に、大きく貢献することがニコニコ市場で証明されています。よって、自分はMAD動画の作者も、寄付によってユーザー達に支えられるのが理想だと感じています。しかし、ＭＡＤ動画というのは、権利を侵害しているものが殆んどです。動画の再生数の面でも、その元ネタの認知度があってこその視聴率ですので、これは正直、権利者を巻き込まないとなにも始まらない状態だと思います。画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプル写真から
なんとYouTubeでは、 「 涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱 」 や「らき☆すた」で知られる角川文庫が、ＭＡＤ動画を公認する意向を示しました。基本的に、その動画にアドセンスの広告をつけることで、収益を得ようとしているようです。公認された動画には、認定マークが付くらしいです。
「 ユーザー投稿角川アニメ」の公式認定も YouTubeに角川参加 より文、イメージともに引用
新規に投稿されようとしている動画が権利を侵害している場合は「この動画は著作権を侵害している可能性があります」と表示して公開をいったん保留し、公開するかどうかを権利者が判断する。
権利者が許諾した場合は 「認定マーク」を動画ページに付けて公開する。ページには関連グッズやDVDなどのバナー広告を掲載するほか、動画の下部に半透明の広告を10秒間ほどオーバーレイする「InVideo Ad」も掲載する計画だ。広告収入は権利者に分配し、動画再生数なども伝える。
画像 公認動画の下部には、半透明の広告をオーバーレイす る「 InVideo Ad」を掲載したり、関連するバナー広告を掲載する 公式チャンネルや公認投稿動画の広告枠は、他社にも販売する計画。角川グループの雑誌や携帯電話向けサイトと連動した広告企画も展開する。他社がYouTubeを活用したコンテンツビジネスに参入する際のコンサルティングも行う。
少なくとも企業はそういうＭＡＤ動画を利用して収益を得ることも、将来的に考えているということが判ります。角川に関しては、Youtubeに公式チャンネルを作ったうえで、アニメの第一話などを丸ごとアップしたり、結構太っ腹です。以下がフルメタルパニックの第一話（20分以上の本編）。これ合法です。
角川公式チャンネル ：http://jp.youtube.com/KADOKAWAanime
要約：MADが公認されるには、権利者側に何かメリットがないといけない。
MAD 動画の作者にも 「 ニコポイントを使って寄付する」というのを実現させるためには
YouTubeで言う広告のようにいくつか権利者が納得できるような条件が必要となります。そこで、一番簡単なのは、「寄付されたポイントを権利者と動画投稿者の間で分配する」ことです。動画の種類や、動画の完成度、そこから見て取れる労働量などは、動画によって違うわけですから、権利者がケースバイケースで分配額を決めていくことが理想だと思います。いわゆる権利者が公認したいＭＡＤ動画を探すにあたって、同時に削除するべき動画も観て回るわけですので、これまでの「削除人を雇わなければいけない」というような状態よりも、かなり有益な作業になりうると思います。画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプルから
要約：寄付は投稿者と権利者で分配
寄付するにあたって、 「権利者が自分の寄付を差し引いてる」という考え方は間違っていて、その権利者がその素材を提供してるわけですから、そういう意味でも「権利者と投稿者の両方に同時に寄付できる」という考えであるべきです。権利者側から、ボーナスとして直接投稿者にポイントを寄付することがあっても良いかもしれません。
要約：権利者は素材提供者だと理解する必要がある。
ここからこの 「公認 」 ＭＡＤ動画で、権利者がさらに収益をあげる方法を考えていこうと思います。
1．アマゾンでの手数料の分配
公認動画でのアマゾンの収益は権利者側と分配率を相談した上で分配される。「公認」というだけで、その動画の再生数は飛躍的に上昇するだろうし、そもそも元ネタの認知度に頼ったうえでの再生数なわけだから、アフィリエイトの収益を分配するのは当たり前。というかこれはすでに公式動画で行われていると思うものだが。公認動画では、動画投稿者にも一部分配することも考えるべき。
要約：アマゾンの手数料を：運営、権利者、動画投稿者で分ける
要約：ユーザーはポイントを買って投稿者に送る。それは、権利者にも分配される。動画ページで行われたアマゾンの買い物の手数料も山分け。
追記：
tomityさんという方がより分かりやすい図を用意してくださいました。
審査依頼料っていうのは必要だと思います。人件費っていう面では、認定を判断する立場の人が時間費やしてMADをチェックするんですからね、できるだけ数百円で済んでほしいです。後は寄付があれば元が取れるでしょうし。
２．関係者を出演させ、寄付を誘導
ＭＡＤ の動画が再生し終わった後に、ランダムに用意された動画が流れる。それは広告じゃないが、ユーザーからの寄付を誘導する効果がある。具体的に京都アニメーションの「涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱」のＭＡＤを想定した場合を例に上げてみる。
ＭＡＤ の動画が終わると、平野綾が画面に映る。そこで彼女が言うのは「角川は、この動画を応援しています。この動画の作者の方を一緒に応援したい方はポイントを贈ってあげたり、下に載ってる商品をお買い上げになったり、この動画を、ブログやウェブサイトで紹介してください。私達を応援してることにもなりますので、どうぞよろしくお願いします！バイバーイ」
要約：MAD動画作者に寄付などで応援するよう、声優が呼びかける
こういう動画を声優別に複数用意しておき、公認ＭＡＤ動画の後にランダムで再生されるようにすれば、寄付の誘導にもなるし、これ自体をコンテンツとして観るユーザーもいるだろうし。なによりＭＡＤ文化に肯定的だという意思がユーザーに伝わる。ＭＡＤ動画を気にいったユーザーは、権利者がその動画をサポートしていると知ると、仲間意識というか、好意的感情が生まれる。それは寄付やら商品購入が行われる動機にもなる。また、寄付の誘導も、動画投稿者への寄付という意味で呼びかけているので、嫌らしくない。企業にだけ寄付するよりもMAD動画の作者への同時寄付なら、ある程度乗り気になるだろう。上記2点の画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプル写真から
要約：作者と権利者に同時寄付
（寄付呼びかけ動画はリピートボタンをＯＮで観るのを回避）
3．寄付呼びかけ動画の後に動画広告を
さっきの例の場合、平野綾が話し終わったら、平野綾関連の商品の宣伝動画がランダムで流れる（ＴＶやラジオでの広告を流用すればいい）。ユーザーの心理はどういう風になるだろう。「ＭＡＤ動画のうｐ主は頑張ってる。でも確かにこれは違法動画だし、本当は消されるべき動画だったわけだ。だがそれを消さないで、この動画を支援してくれて、しかもうｐ主に寄付できるように公認してくれた。この子は頑張って働いている。それを俺らは何のお返しも出来ないまま、ただ傍観視している。理不尽すぎるだろう、常識的に考えて。自分は今月苦しいから金銭的な支援とかはできないけど、ブログで紹介するとかならできるからサムネイル貼っておこう」のように、「寄付呼びかけ動画」の後、その人関連の動画（広告）を観ると、感情移入する確立が高い。頑張ってるように見えるはずだ（場合による）。（動画広告はリピートボタンをＯＮすることで観るのを回避）画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプル写真から
要約：MAD動画を応援してくれる声優、公認してくれる会社、どう敵視しろと？
感情移入という点で例を挙げると、例えばＪＡＭプロジェクトがニコニコ生放送に出たとき、新曲「 No Border」の告知をしたら
告知したら、 「よし、買ってくる」といったようなコメントが並んだ。知り合いがテレビに出ている感覚なのだろう。親近感があることで、出費を惜しまなくなる。上記の案は、それに近い効果を生む。自分が好きなものを応援してくれるアーティストがいたとしたら、その人を応援したくなるだろう。その域に来るとお金というのは二の次の話になる。
要約：自分が好きなことを認めてくれる人が、頑張っているのを見たら応援するのは当たり前。
4．静止画広告（ＦＬＡＳＨ ）
上記の広告動画が再生してる時、その広告は商品の広告じゃないかもしれないし、動画をクリックするとニコニコ市場に飛ぶというのもどうだろう。ちゃんとある程度詳細を確認してから市場に飛びたいし、広告動画も観るのなら最後まで観たいものだ。つまり何かクリックできるものが必要なわけで、適役なのがニコニュースが載ってる動画上部の部分。別にそこに派手な広告を貼れというわけではない。地味に白黒で「↓の商品に関しての詳細はここをクリック」と、広告動画の詳細ページへジャンプできるようにしておけばいいだけ。詳細をそのまま動画内で告知したい場合、動画画面いっぱいにＦＬＡＳＨの静止画広告を貼ればいい。ニコニコ動画のインターフェイスならＦＬＡＳＨは可能だろう。
（リピートボタン をＯＮで観るのを回避）
5 ． 「 権利者コメント 」 と「 コメント広告 」
簡単に言えば、公認動画では、投稿者＝うｐ主で、権利者にもコメントを書き込める機能があったほうがいいと思う。「権利者コメント」という機能を作るとして、それ特有のニコスクリプトを用意したりすれば新しいタイプの広告を確立できる。動画ページ下のニコニコ市場というのは、基本的にユーザーが商品を選ぶことで動画の内容と上手くリンクする。それを権利者がいじって、つまらないラインアップにしてしまっては、市場の理想とはかけ離れてる。しかし権利者は、自社の商品もしっかり宣伝しておきたいはずだ。そこで、権利者にもアマゾンのリンクが貼れるようにする方法として新しくスペースを用意する。それは「動画画面」だ。当たり前だがそこにはユーザーのコメントが流れている。そこにコメントするわけだが、普通のコメントとどう違うかというと、「クリックできる」わけだ。
書き方は以下のようなフォーマット
「 ＤＶＤ 第 一巻でました。よろしくです」というコメントが流れて、色は普通のコメントと分別するために薄い黄色とかにして、それをクリックするとターゲットのＵＲＬが別窓で開く。商品を紹介したい場合はニコニコ市場のページを記入すればいいし、イベントなどを告知したい場合は、詳細の載ってるサイトのＵＲＬを記入すればいい。ただそれだけの機能だが、毎動画同じ書き込みをしないといけない訳じゃなく、例えばハルヒＭＡＤの公認動画が複数存在する場合、
＠アマゾン ＤＶＤ 第２ 巻出ました。よろしくです 「 http://ichiba.nicovideo.jp/item/azB000FBG0O4」 後ろ ハルヒＭＡＤ
公認動画で 「 ハルヒＭＡＤ 」のタグの付く動画全てに、動画の終わりに近い辺りに「ＤＶＤ第２巻出ました。よろしくです」と出る。このように、色々書き方でどの動画にこの「コメント広告」が出るか設定できる。また、極めて「私語」に近いコメントが、広告になるので、違和感がない。他にも色々設定できるようにすれば、可能性は広がるだろう。勿論このコメント広告というのは専用ボタンをＯＦＦにしておけば非表示できる。
要約：権利者が商品についてコメントしてる場合は、それをクリックすれば詳細ページに行く
追記：
ブックマーク で 2008年02月27 日 y_arimさんより
好きな動画が消されたり、消さざるを得ない状況を強いられたら、敵意を持つのは当たり前です。でも、仮にそのアイマスPVを、権利者が認めたとして、ちょっとした広告を貼ったら、それさえバッシングの対象にしてしまうほど、理不尽な人がニコニコにはいるんですかね。それならニコニコ市場が存在する時点で喚いてると思います。無料でコンテンツを観れることを、権利みたいに主張するような人達は、ちょっとよく理解できません。ストリートミュージシャンに何も寄付しないのに、路上ライブが中止されたら文句を言う。そんな感じですね。それってマナー云々のレベルを超えてると思います...そういう人達には考え方を改めてもらわないと困りますね。
6．＠ジャンプ広告
この広告は基本的に第三者の投資によって成り立つ。例えば吉本興業が、自社の特定の公式動画の再生数を上げたい場合（告知目的？）、良い動画を発見したら投資フォームで申し込む。完了すると、その動画が再生し終わったら、自動的に吉本のその動画へジャンプする。ただそれだけの仕組みだ。動画のアクセスアップにはもってこいだし、動画の投稿者、権利者、そして運営にそれぞれ投資金が分配されるので普通に「スポンサー」だ。面白いのは、ある会社が他の会社に投資するということが成り立ったりする。上の例でいうと、吉本興業がハルヒＭＡＤに投資することで、「吉本→角川」というお金の流れが出来上がる。一つの動画の投資額が数百円〜数千円だとしても、何百動画にも出資すれば、立派な投資額になる。ニコニコ動画では、一定のアクセスが集まれば、そこからは無理に宣伝しなくても勝手に伸びる習性があるので、投資側が十分だと思ったときはやめればいい。
要約：動画が終わったら自動的に他動画にジャンプする機能を使って、広告枠を作る。例えば初音ミクのオリ曲「メルト」の動画に角川がスポンサーになった場合、動画の再生後、角川の広告動画に飛ぶ。
複数の投資がある場合、代わりばんこでジャンプするようにすればいい。基本的に投資に有利な動画は、すでに多くのアクセスを稼いでいる有名動画と、これから伸びる可能性がある新着動画だ。投資額が数百円でも可能ならば、ユーザー個人でも投資しやすいし、あまりお勧めできないがジャンプするのが外部サイトという選択肢もあっても良いかもしれない。企業や個人が良作を発掘するという素晴らしい文化が出来上がり、投資してる側は自分の動画のアクセスを伸ばすことができる。また、ジャンプ先の動画を自分が投稿したもの意外に設定できるようにすれば、たとえば応援してる動画のパブリシティーを強制的にとりあえず上げたい時、「とりあえずみんなこれを観てくれ」というように、「埋もれてる動画が生きを吹き返す」ということが可能になる。コメントをしまくることでパブリシティーを上げる原始的な方法より、この方が文明的だ
要約：企業は再生数を買える。動画のスポンサーになれる。
しかしこの条件だと、悪質なアンチ行為が絶えなくなるのは大いに有りうる。自分や他人の動画を支援するために作られたシステムなのに、逆に特定の動画の再生数を伸び悩ませることが可能になってしまうからだ。自分がアンチだとしたら、多少の出費は惜しまずに、適当に再生数の少ない弱小動画を見つけて来て、それに投資する。そしてジャンプ先の動画を自分が嫌いな動画に設定しておく。どうなるかというと、@ジャンプ広告契約期間中は、ジャンプ先の動画はマイリストランキングから排除されて、検索で「age」と判定されるコメントは、ユーザー一人に付き1日一回。同じユーザーから複数コメントがあっても、最初の一回以外は「sage」扱いされてしまうからだ。つまり、全部その弱小動画からのジャンプアクセスに頼らなければいけなくなる。予めそういうことも考えて、他人からの投資を却下できる機能と、ジャンプ先に設定された場合それを投稿者が却下できる機能が必要だと思う。
要約：ユーザー１人が複数コメントしても、検索結果の順番には影響しない。
＠ジャンプ広告の金額とか、契約期間というのは運営が勝手に決めれば良いわけだが、有名動画の投資額の基準は、再生数とかマイリスト率とか、そういうものだろう。投稿日時とかもプロモーション力に影響してくるし、一筋縄には決められないと思う。必須なことだと思うが、投資者の動画（ジャンプ先の動画）は契約期間中マイリストランキングなどには載らない。契約期間を終了したところから、自力でアクセスを稼がなければいけなくなる。（投資を解除したり、契約期間が切れたら載るようになる）勿論このジャンプというのはリピートボタンをＯＮにしておけば発動を防げる。ユーザーの使い勝手は優先される。
7．外 部Embed
これが可能になる条件は二つある。ニコニコ動画の新たなサービスとしてブログサービスが出来ること、外部Embedできるのは公認動画とオリジナル認定動画のみ。つまりポイント送信等の上記機能に対応した動画のみ。ニコニコのクローズドサービスの中でなら、動画埋め込み機能を付けて良いと思う。ブログで動画が紹介できるわけだ。ブログ自体もニコニコのコミュニティー内だからトラフィックに関してはある程度コントロールできると思う。単純に宣伝効果があると思うし、動画の外部Embedも一度テストされたことがある機能なので、技術的には可能なわけだ。
WEB +DB PRESS Tech Meetingを参照
要約：ニコ動のコミュニティー内でブログサービスを作れば、クローズドサービスのため、動画を埋め込み可能にしても、コントロールできる範囲だ。
（ニコニコのブログというのは、アイディアとして頭にあるので、考えがまとまったらこの記事と同じような長さで書いてみるつもり）
有料視聴権を購入するための用途
ニコニコポイントというのは、単純にニコニコ動画内のサービスを利用するときにも使えます。今後アニメなどの有料配信が行われるにあたって、これまで紹介してきた機能やサービスは重要な役目を果たすと思います。有料配信というのは、収益という面では最初は期待できないかもしれません。しかし、ニコニコ動画の姿勢を世の中に示すためにも必須だと思います。これをやることによって新たなスポンサーが集まる可能性が高いわけですので。画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプル写真から
要約：有料配信の支払いのためにポイントを使う。
特に先ほど紹介した＠ジャンプ広告を利用することによって、大企業がアニメ本編の有料配信をスポンサーしてくれるということになれば、アニメの場合、全話は無理だとしても、一部スポンサーの力で無料配信状態、あるいはそれに近いものにできると思います。極端な例を挙げると、「ソニーがＣＬＡＮＮＡＤ本編動画を＠ジャンプ広告でスポンサーして、その動画は無料で観れるようになる」といったような感じです。無料で観れることによって、しかも公式動画となれば、アクセスが殺到するし、広告動画へ強制的にジャンプさせるわけですから、かなりの視聴率が望めるでしょう。そうなると、ジャンプ先の広告動画でも、ユーザーは「ソニーさん、ＣＬＡＮＮＡＤ3話無料にしてくれてありがとうううう」といったようなコメントが出るはずです。ソニーがＣＬＡＮＮＡＤを応援してることになるので（単にアクセス買ってるだけですが）、ブランド印象も、少なくともニコニコ内では上がるしかないでしょう。同時に、動画単位で投資が成立することで、企業間でもリアルで色々なコラボが可能になると思います。単なるアクセスアップ目的で知り合った複数の企業が、それをきっかけに色々展開していけると思います。ポイントシステムとジャンプ広告のおかげで企業が個人に投資することも容易になっていき、趣味だけで食べていける人達が出てくると思います。画像使用元はアマゾンの商品ページのサンプル写真から。
要約：アニメ本編の動画再生数を企業が買った場合、その会社がスポンサーしてることになるが、場合によってはアニメを無料視聴できるような契約が交わされるかもしれない。
最終的な目 的
これらの機能や仕組みは、最終的にニコニコ動画を以下のような環境にすることになります。
1．違法動画をアップする必要がなくなる
違法動画をアップロードしてる人達は、動画ソースを持っているのだから、その動画を観ようとすれば好きなだけ観れる。なぜわざわざエンコードして、不特定多数に観れるようにするのか。それは、単に「色んな人達に知ってもらいたいから」という単純なものなわけで、元々企業がやるべきプロモーションを、肩代わりしてるだけだ。そこを企業自ら配信すれば、違法動画をアップする必要がなくなる。よって、合法動画としてすでアップされてれば違法動画は無くなる。
要約：企業が動画を先にアップすれば、違法にアップする必要が無い
2．クリエイターに対価が支払われる
クリエイターは、質の高い作品作りに専念してればいい。金銭的な援助は個人からも企業からも来る。動画のパブリシティーの面でもそういう投資に任せておけば良い。最終的に動画だけでご飯が食べれるようになる。
3．権利者は違法動画を合法に変えてプロモーションを行う
ＭＡＤ 動画の文化を肯定することによって、それを合法化し、プロモーションに役立てられる。それらの動画経由で支払われる投資金や、寄付金、アフィリエイト収入などで作品の製作費を賄えるようになれば成功だ。
4．運営は儲かる
収入源は ：
バナー広 告
プレミアム会 員
ニコニコ市 場
時報
ニコポイント送信時の手数料
＠ジャンプ広告の投資分配金
二つの新しい収入源があることと、寄付されたポイントはニコニコ市場やニコニコのサービスでしか使えないことで市場の活発化が図れる。
要約：ニコニコ動画は今まで以上の収入が見込めると同時に、違法コンテンツに頼らなくても良い状況になる。
