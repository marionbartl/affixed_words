It 's a double shot of bad news today as jobless claims soar while factory orders sink .
Weekly Claims For The Week Ending Jan. 31
Chart from US Department of Labor .
The best way to look at weekly claims is the 4 week moving average which smooths out minor week to week variations .
The moving average has been trending up for well over a year .
Compare the number from today to a year ago : 582 K vs. 339K .
Remember that the economy was losing jobs rapidly a year ago .
This is evidence that upcoming monthly jobs reports are going to be dismal .
New Jobless Claims Jump To 626K
Inquiring minds are digging deeper into New jobless Claims .
New jobless claims jumped far more than expected last week in an already dismal labor market , and there 's no relief in sight for workers as mass layoffs persist .
The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of newly jobless workers seeking benefits rose last week to a seasonally adjusted 626,000 , from the previous week 's upwardly revised figure of 591,000 .
The latest total is far more than analysts ' expectations of 583,000 .
That 's also the highest since October 1982 , when the economy was in a steep recession , though the work force has grown by about half since then .
The numbers reflect the large spate of layoffs announced last month by companies from all sectors of the economy , including Caterpillar Inc. , Pfizer Inc. and Microsoft Corp .
The layoffs continued Thursday with cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos. saying its fiscal second - quarter profit fell 30 percent and it plans to begin a four - year restructuring plan that will include cutting 2,000 staffers , or 6 percent of the work force .
The company will also continue its hiring freeze .
The number of people that remained on the unemployment compensation rolls increased slightly to nearly 4.8 million , the Labor Department said , most since records began in 1967 .
The continuing claims data lags the number of new claims by one week .
As a proportion of the work force , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits is at the highest level since August 1982 .
But that does n't include an additional 1.7 million people receiving unemployment insurance through an extension of benefits Congress approved last year , which brings the total to about 6.5 million .
The extension provides up to 33 additional weeks of benefits , on top of the 26 weeks typically provided by states .
U.S. December Factory Orders Fall Fifth Month
Bloomberg is reporting U.S. December Factory Orders Fell More Than Forecast .
Orders placed with U.S. factories fell in December for a fifth month , reflecting a pullback in business spending that will extend the recession .
Bookings declined 3.9 percent , more than forecast , after a revised 6.5 percent drop in November , the Commerce Department said today in Washington .
Other reports showed firings jumped at the end of January .
Today ’s report showed orders for non-durable goods including food , petroleum and chemicals fell 4.8 percent in December .
Bookings for petroleum and coal products fell 18 percent .
Orders for durable goods , which make up just over half of total factory demand , fell 3 percent , after a 4 percent drop the previous month .
Civilian aircraft orders plunged 44 percent after declining 46 percent the prior month .
Boeing Co. , the world ’s second - biggest commercial - airplane maker , last week said customers may continue to cancel or defer orders in 2009 as demand for travel slides and credit remains restricted .
The Chicago - based company reported a fourth - quarter loss and announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs .
Bookings for auto assemblies and parts decreased 5.7 percent in December .
The deterioration has spilled over into this year : U.S. sales plummeted 49 percent in January at General Motors Corp. , the biggest U.S. automaker , and 40 percent at No. 2 Ford Motor Co. , the companies said .
Orders for construction machinery plummeted 28 percent .
Bookings for capital goods excluding aircraft and military equipment , a measure of future business investment , fell 3.2 percent after a 1.1 percent gain .
What Happened To Hope and Change ?
" A failure to act , and act now [ on the bill ] , will turn crisis into a catastrophe , " Obama said , sounding a lot more like his predecessor than the candidate of hope and change .
Even as he sees the potential for a near - term rally , Todd Harrison , CEO of Minyanville.com , says Obama is understandably worried about the risk of Congressional inaction .
" He 's right there 's potential for this [ economy ] to get much worse and manifest itself not only financially , but through societal unrest , " he says .
More than Obama 's rhetoric or what 's in the stimulus bill , Harrison is worried that protectionist policies worldwide could lead to heightened geopolitical tension and , ultimately , global war .
Now that 's something to really be worried about .

The Conficker worm is finally doing something -- updating via peer - to - peer between infected computers and dropping a mystery payload on infected computers , Trend Micro said on Wednesday .
This piece of computer code told the worm to activate on April 1 , researchers found .
Researchers were analyzing the code of the software that is being dropped onto infected computers but suspect that it is a keystroke logger or some other program designed to steal sensitive data off the machine , said David Perry , global director of security education at Trend Micro .
The software appeared to be a .sys component hiding behind a rootkit , which is software that is designed to hide the fact that a computer has been compromised , according to Trend Micro .
The software is heavily encrypted , which makes code analysis difficult , the researchers said .
The worm also tries to connect to MySpace.com , MSN.com , eBay.com , CNN.com and AOL.com as a way to test that the computer has Internet connectivity , deletes all traces of itself in the host machine , and is set to shut down on May 3 , according to the TrendLabs Malware Blog .
Because infected computers are receiving the new component in a staggered manner rather than all at once there should be no disruption to the Web sites the computers visit , said Paul Ferguson , advanced threats researcher for Trend Micro .
" After May 3 , it shuts down and wo n't do any replication , " Perry said .
However , infected computers could still be remotely controlled to do something else , he added .
On Tuesday night Trend Micro researchers noticed a new file in the Windows Temp folder and a huge encrypted TCP response from a known Conficker P2P IP node hosted in Korea .
" As expected , the P2P communications of the Downad / Conficker botnet may have just been used to serve an update , and not via HTTP , " the blog post says .
" The Conficker / Downad P2P communications is now running in full swing ! "
In addition to adding the new propagation functionality , Conficker communicates with servers that are associated with the Waledac family of malware and its Storm botnet , according to a separate blog post by Trend Micro security researcher Rik Ferguson .
The worm tries to access a known Waledac domain and download another encrypted file , the researchers said .
Conficker .
C failed to make a splash a week ago despite the fact that it was programmed to activate on April 1 .
It has infected between 3 million and 12 million computers , according to Perry .
Initially , researchers thought they were seeing a new variant of the Conficker worm , but now they believe it is merely a new component of the worm .
The worm spreads via a hole in Windows that Microsoft patched in October , as well as through removable storage devices and network shares with weak passwords .
The worm disables security software and blocks access to security Web sites .

Khaled Meshaal said the great powers needed Hamas
The political leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshaal , has credited US President Barack Obama with using a " new language " for the Middle East .
Speaking to an Italian newspaper Mr Meshaal also said that an official opening to his Palestinian Islamist movement was only " a matter of time " .
The interview was published three days after President Obama called for a " new beginning " in relations with Iran .
Iran and Syria , where Mr Meshaal is exiled , are key backers of Hamas .
Mr Obama 's video message to the Iranian leaders and people was seen as a major break with previous US policy .
But in response , Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded concrete policy changes from the US .
' Roots in society '
Mr Meshaal , speaking in an interview with La Repubblica , said " a new language towards the region is coming from President Obama " .
He did not directly mention Mr Obama 's message to Iran .
" The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in US and European policies , " Mr Meshaal said .
" Regarding an official opening towards Hamas , it 's a matter of time . "
The US , EU and UN will not deal with Hamas , which seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 , unless they reject violence and recognise Israel .
Hamas 's charter calls for the destruction of Israel , although the group has also offered a long - term truce if Israel withdraws to its pre-5 June 1967 borders .
" The great powers need us to resolve the Arab - Israeli conflict , " Mr Meshaal told La Repubblica .
" Our weight in resolving the Palestinian question stems from our roots in society , in the people who have voted for us and who will do so again . "
While the United States remains all but silent and our national gay rights organizations finally start paying attention , queers in Iraq continue to be persecuted .
And it ’s not just the slayings any more .
We told you about the “ glue ” that ’s being used to literally seal the anuses of suspected gay men .
That type of torture might explain why Iraqi hospitals are seeing a whole new class of patients : young gay men .
Because they are “ behaving like women , ” queer Iraqi men are actively being persecuted .
And if the Iraqi government is n’t behind the attacks , they ’re certainly complacent ; no investigations , police involvement , let alone prosecution against suspects is taking place .
Meanwhile , there are reports of police engaging in the torment :
An eye - witness reported “ a police patrol in Shaab district , north east of Baghdad , stopped two young men ‘ behaving like women ’ in mid March and forced them to take - off their clothes in front of other passers - by and made fun of them and their naked bodies . ”
But what we ’re missing here is not all of these men may be gay .
While it makes no difference to the attackers , it ’s likely many of them are transgender , preferring long hair , women ’s clothes and accessories , and make - up .
Either way , they all end up on the lists of names being distributed to murderers .
The website Niqash says doctors are facing new patients hurt during anti-gay attacks .
As one sense of safety ( from insurgent attacks ) returns , the ability for Iraq ’s GLBTs to live their lives more openly means they ’re arguably in more danger than before .
We have n’t heard anyone say it yet , but we ’re going to : THIS IS TERRORISM .
Anti-gay Iraqis are inflicting terror on their own citizens , challenging them to live their lives openly with the threat of death if they do .
You do n’t need to hijack planes or plant IEDs to terrorize .
What we ’re seeing is a systematic “ cleansing ” of Iraq ’s queer community .
And while the U.S. government at least pays lip service to the terrorism in Darfur , Baghdad gets nothing .
A regular update of Haskell in Arch Linux
Arch now has 926 Haskell packages in AUR .
That ’s an increase of 27 new packages in the last 8 days , or 3.38 new Haskell apps a day .
Well done everyone !
Noteworthy updates
Installing Packages from AUR
To install AUR packages , we recommend yaourt , as in :
yaourt -- noconfirm -- lightbg -- aur - S haskell - haha
You may want to alias that command line .
Here ’s an example from this week ’s releases :
The reason to use yaourt over cabal - install is that AUR packages correctly resolve all versions and , more importantly , C library and other system dependencies .
Packages will also be pulled from the binary releases in [ extra ] and [ community ] where available , saving you build times .

You may think your new ten - megapixel camera is pretty hot –- but not when you compare it to the 1.8 Gigapixel beast built for the Pentagon .
The camera is designed as a payload for the A - 160T Hummingbird robot helicopter now being quietly delivered to Special Forces .
It will give them an unprecedented ability to track everything on the ground in real time .
The camera is scheduled for flight testing at the start of next year .
Developed under the auspices of Darpa , the camera is the sensor part of Autonomous Real - time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance - Imaging System or ARGUS -IS .
The camera is composed of four arrays , each containing 92 five - megapixel imagers .
The other parts of ARGUS are the airborne processing system , which has to deal with a phenomenal torrent of data , and the ground - based element .
The airborne part fits into a 500 - pound pod .
The Hummingbird is unique in its ability to hover at high altitude ( over 15,000 feet ) and its endurance of over 20 hours .
This means it can park high in the sky and scan a wide area .
Robo - chopper camera - maker BAE
Systems says that its imager will be able to cover an area of over a hundred square miles .
The refresh rate is fifteen frames per second and a " ground sample distance " of 15 centimeters –- this means that each pixel represents six inches on the ground .
( The Darpa diagram , above , suggests a smaller area of coverage , 40 square kilometers or 15 square miles , at that resolution . )
The volume of data is too great to be completely transmitted , but users will be able to define at least sixty - five independent video windows within the image and zoom in or out at will .
The windows can be set to automatically track items of interest such as moving vehicles .
In fact , the resolution is good enough for it to offer " dismount tracking " or following individual people on foot .
In addition to the windows , ARGUS will provide " a real - time moving target indicator for vehicles throughout the entire field of view in real - time . "
Basically , nothing can move in the entire area without being spotted .
Unlike radar , ARGUS can zoom in and provide a high - resolution image .
The camera is pretty impressive , but it 's the processing and the software behind it that will make this such a capable system .
It would take a human a very long time to scan the whole area under surveillance if they were looking for something – but this is exactly the type of task which the swarming softwarewe looked at last week excels at .
Luckily enough , that just happens to be a Darpa program too .
The technique of looking at small windows of interest also means that it may be possible to speed the frame rate up considerably – we previously looked at a windowing system so fast it could follow speeding bullets .
The ARGUS - IS mounted on the Hummingbird could be a significant battlefield asset for getting a real - time picture of what 's on the other side of the hill .
And no doubt there will be civilian agencies who think it might be quite a useful capability for them to have too .
Mythological Footnote : Someone in Darpa may be a fan of the classics – Argus or Argos Panoptes was a giant , unsleeping watchman with a hundred eyes all over his body .
Unfortunately he was killed by Hermes ; according to the myth , his eyes were placed on the tail of the peacock .

Since then , he has accelerated Ford along that path , pursuing a top - to - bottom transformation that extends from its global product lineup to its renewed focus on the Blue Oval trademark .
As a result , for the first time in decades , Ford ’s fortunes no longer seem so closely tied to the broader fate of Detroit .
Mr. Mulally , 63 , is doing all he can to separate Ford in the public ’s mind from its hometown competitors .
To emphasize his point , he pulled out a recent newspaper cartoon that compared college basketball ’s Final Four to Toyota , Honda , Volkswagen — and Ford .
Get Real - Time Quotes for All Auto Companies Mentioned Above
“ We are competing against the best in the world , ” Mr. Mulally said .
“ It ’s not just with the companies in the U.S. ”
While GM and Chrysler wait for more federal aid , Ford is capitalizing on its status as the only one of the Big Three in Detroit to make it , so far , on its own .
Some surveys are showing consumers migrating away from GM and Chrysler to Ford showrooms .
Inside Ford headquarters here in Dearborn , management sees a unique opportunity to expand its market share and further separate Ford from the competition .
“ I do n’t take any joy in watching GM and Chrysler struggle , ” said William C. Ford Jr. , the company ’s executive chairman .
“ I wish them well , but I wish us better .
I want us to win . ”
Ford is hardly out of the woods .
The company lost $ 14.6 billion last year , when its vehicle sales in the United States slumped 20 percent , compared with 22 percent at GM and 30 percent at Chrysler .
Its once - bulging bank account is dwindling as well .
Industry analysts estimate that Ford has about a year ’s worth of cash left to carry it through a still - depressed car market .
Still , Ford ’s decision to borrow billions in 2006 when the capital markets were thriving will go down as one of the most significant moves in the company ’s 105 - year history .
“ We believe this foresight to strengthen the company ’s balance sheet is what has separated Ford from its crosstown rivals during the economic downturn , ” a Merrill Lynch analyst , John Murphy , said in a report to investors this week .
I had to laugh when I saw the headline blaring from one end of the Huffington Post to the other : “ Pentagon Preps For Global Economic Warfare “ !
Yikes !
Man the battlements !
Deploy the credit cards !
Unleash the default credit swaps !
And for the love of God speed up those printing presses at the Federal Reserve !
The story in Politico deadpanned this hilarious news :
“ The Pentagon sponsored a first - of - its - kind war game last month focused not on bullets and bombs — but on how hostile nations might seek to cripple the U.S. economy , a scenario made all the more real by the global financial crisis . ”
Why should these “ hostile nations ” bother with a campaign to cripple our economy when we ’re doing such a good job of it ourselves ?
The whole premise of this dubious exercise is that our problems are n’t caused by anything or anyone here on the home front — no , no , it ’s those horrible foreigners , with their cheap labor costs and spicy foods , who are responsible for the economic plight of our nation !
Oh , I can hear it now , in calls for protectionist measures , and lame justifications for government subsidies to favored businesses : “ The Europeans do it ! ”
It wo n’t be long before we hear accusations that the Enemy of the Month is harboring economic weapons of mass destruction aimed directly at the American people .
As absurd as such a premise is — the idea of the world economy as a battle zone , rather than an interlocking grid of economic self - interest , is a primitive throwback to pre-industrial economics — it is perfectly suited to the modern welfare - warfare state , and hardly surprising that the Pentagon is now spending our tax dollars on such anti-market , autarchist nonsense .
They ’re keen to dissolve the economic bonds that bind us all , and treat the world market as if it were a battle zone — and they call us “ isolationists ” !
A reflexively warlike mentality has infected the national psyche since September 11 , 2001 , and now permeates every aspect of life , including discussions of economics .
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President changes this not one iota : indeed , it suits the purposes of this administration , which is fighting a “ war on recession ” as well as the Long War on the Af - Pak front .
The Politico piece describes the enactment of this taxpayer - funded display of computerized economic ignorance as follows :
“ The two - day event near Ft. Meade , Maryland , had all the earmarks of a regular war game .
Participants sat along a V - shaped set of desks beneath an enormous wall of video monitors displaying economic data , according to the accounts of three participants .
“ ‘ It felt a little bit like Dr. Strangelove , ’ one person who was at the previously undisclosed exercise told POLITICO . ”
Well , yes , I do indeed see the resemblance : Dr. Strangelove , after all , was a former National Socialist and all - around creepy mad scientist .
Yet who were these would - be Strangeloves , playing games on the taxpayers ’ dime ?
Politico reports :
“ Instead of military brass plotting America ’s defense , it was hedge - fund managers , professors and executives from at least one investment bank , UBS — all invited by the Pentagon to play out global scenarios that could shift the balance of power between the world ’s leading economies . ”
This Pentagon for plutocrats playing war - games with our economy turns out to consist of none other than the Napoleons of our recent economic Waterloo .
Is a bigwig from UBS , a Swiss bank that had to be bailed out by its government , really the sort of general we want to put in command of our economic fate ?
I think not .
As “ uniformed military officers and members of the intelligence community carefully observed , ” Politico assures us , the game reached its climax :
“ In the end , there was sobering news for the United States — the savviest economic warrior proved to be China , a growing economic power that strengthened its position the most over the course of the war - game .
“ The United States remained the world ’s largest economy but significantly degraded its standing in a series of financial skirmishes with Russia , participants said .
The war game demonstrated that in post - Sept. 11 world , the Pentagon is thinking about a wide range of threats to America ’s position in the world , including some that could come far from the battlefield . ”
A nation with one of the world ’s highest savings rates and lowest labor costs , not to mention a fifth of the world ’s population , is an economic powerhouse ?
You do n’t say !
For this solemn revelation we needed a panel of “ experts ” playing around on expensive super - computers ?
The Politico writer gushes
“ And it ’s hardly science fiction .
China recently shook the value of the dollar in global currency markets merely by questioning whether the recession put China ’s $ 1 trillion in U.S. government bond holdings at risk — forcing President Barack Obama to issue a hasty defense of the dollar . ”
It ’s an interesting perspective : the problem , you see , is n’t the weakness caused by the popping of the bubble economy , and the policies pursued by our own elites in government and high finance — the problem is the Chinese , who dared to point out our essential insolvency .
We are never at fault : it ’s always other people .
I know a lot of drunks who talk like that .
But are we really drunk enough on our easy money and our own hubris to believe it ?
The United States pursues futile and horrendously expensive wars of “ liberation ” throughout the world , maintains an empire on which the sun never sets , spends more than it produces — and it ’s all China ’s fault !
After all , they lured us into borrowing all that money from them — it was a Communist plot utilizing capitalist means !
Now I know what Lenin meant when he said that the last capitalist would sell the revolutionaries the rope to hang him with .
Except Lenin got it wrong : the ChiComs sold us the rope , and then we hung ourselves .
One of the session attendees , Professor Paul Bracken , a private equity specialist at the Yale School of Management , claims to have gained an important insight from the exercise :
“ First , that the United States needs an integrated approach to managing financial and what the Pentagon calls ‘ kinetic ’ — or shooting — wars .
For example he says , the U.S. Navy is involved in blockading Iran , and the U.S. is also conducting economic war against Iran in the form of sanctions .
But he argues there is n’t enough coordination between the two efforts . ”
Even as the Obama administration airs videos of the Dear Leader holding out his hand like God did to Moses , the Pentagon game - players are planning to strangle the Iranians , economically , or else obliterate them physically — and they are making no secret of it .
What can one say of a culture that makes everything a “ war on this ” or a “ war on that ” ?
Where the popular language , the national mindset , is seemingly fixated on the glory and necessity of conquest ?
At least , that ’s what I ask in my gloomier moments .
Most of the rest of the time , however , I realize that this characterization of American political culture is just a reflection of the “ false consciousness ” created by regime propaganda , superimposed by the elites on ordinary Americans .
That ’s why Antiwar.com exists — to counter this false consciousness , to expose the lies of the War Party and create a counter - culture of antiwar and anti-authoritarian consciousness .
No matter which party is in power , this movement is growing and will grow beyond the power of States to tame or stop it — and that ’s the power our own rulers , and the rulers of states all around the world , fear the most .
Any attempt to blame “ foreigners ” for our economic ills is letting the Money Power in the US off the hook , and diverting the righteous anger of the American people to a convenient overseas scapegoat .
If we ’re looking to blame someone for the impending bankruptcy of the United States of America , then the search for the culprits ought to begin on our own shores — and you do n’t have to be a modern day Sherlock Holmes to know exactly where to find them .
The economic saboteurs are n’t in Beijing or Moscow — they ’re in Washington , D.C .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I have written a memorial essay in honor of Burt Blumert , a mentor of mine and a good friend who died the other day : it has just been published by Taki ’s Magazine .
If you want to know what a true champion of liberty is all about , then you ’ll want to check it out .
THURSDAY AM UPDATE : Estimates now are that the Hugh Jackman film , the 4th in the X - Men franchise for 20th Century Fox , was downloaded hundreds of thousands of times from file sharing websites on Tuesday .
This is a huge blow to the studio ’s major summer blockbuster if those viewers do n’t go to a theater to see the film .
Meanwhile , the web piracy has created a lot of buzz around the pic , both positive and negative .
The Internet is now filled with fanboy comments about whether Wolverine is any good .
Despite the added publicity , this is a nightmare scenario for Fox .
2ND UPDATE : I ’ve just been given this statement by 20th Century Fox :
“ Last night , a stolen , incomplete and early version of X - Men Origins : Wolverine was posted illegally on a website .
It was without many effects , had missing and unedited scenes and temporary sound and music .
We immediately contacted the appropriate legal authorities and had it removed .
We forensically mark our content so we can identify sources that make it available or download it .
The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law – the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past .
The FBI and the MPAA also are actively investigating this crime .
We are encouraged by the support of fansites condemning this illegal posting and pointing out that such theft undermines the enormous efforts of the filmmakers and actors , and above all , hurts the fans of the film . ”
8:50 AM UPDATE : This is no April Fool ’s joke .
Instead ,
Fox executives are describing it to me as one of the worst piracy scandals they can recall , since it involves a major studio and major movie .
The studio is understandably in a panic .
With the film opening on May 1st , this leak could cause incalculable damage to the box office of the latest in the valuable X - Men franchise .
The studio must find out who did this and punish him / her / them to the full extent of the law .
Meanwhile , the Internet is on fire about this DVD - quality work print of Wolverine being leaked online yesterday .
Twentieth Century
Fox stresses it ’s an old rough cut without FX , music , etc — so that may mitigate the damage because is n’t that why you see the movie in a theater anyway ?
The execs say it may contain a virus .
But even if the studio claims that viewers of the pirated copy will age 20 years overnight , that is n’t going to solve the problem .
Toughness will .
And it looks as if that ’s exactly what 20th Century Fox is doing to combat this piracy .
Coincidentally , this comes just days before U.S. Congressman Howard Berman , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , will hold a field hearing in Van Nuys on April 6th to assess the financial impact of global intellectual property piracy .
On April 30 the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to release its annual report on intellectual property policies and practices in other countries .
Last year ’s report placed nine major offenders on the USTR ’s Priority Watch List , including China , Russia , Thailand , and Argentina .
A RAND study released earlier this month alleges that organized crime is increasingly active in film piracy .
Just one problem — that study was funded by the MPAA .

Mind you , Pitkin Avenue — at least the part that ran a few blocks away over the border in East New York — was hardly a laughing matter 20 years ago , when drug - fueled homicides were rampant .
And given the cemeteries on the Queens side , you ’d expect to see mausoleums , not museums .
But inside the offices of A. Ottavino Corporation — a place that looks like a wood - paneled throwback to the 1960s — was an actual , though modest , collection of posters and portraits honoring Groucho Marx , Abbott and Costello , Lucille Ball and John Cleese , among others .
Some cartoons and sketches are perched on ledges , while a George Burns doll is displayed under an array of family photos .
( There are also stone samples , technical drawings and non-funny catalogs through much of the space . )
“ Welcome to Galleria Boobatz , ” said Sallie Elkordy , who presides over this tiny collection housed at the company her grandfather founded in 1913 .
“ My father used to say that everything I do was ‘ boobatz , ’ because he was trying to get me to get serious about the stone business .
He ’d ask me , ‘ You know the root of ‘ boobatz ? ’
I ’d tell him , ‘ Um…atz ? ' ”
The museum displays a fraction of the collection she built over the years .
She keeps most of it in storage , from movies and books to posters and dolls ( including a talking Dennis Miller action figure , which is what boys call dolls . )
Ms. Elkordy incorporated the museum in 2001 , not so much to enshrine the comics who inspired and delighted her , but also to raise money to pay the many comics who have helped her put on hundreds free shows in hospitals and homeless shelters throughout the city .
She figured if she set up a museum , she could accept donations through a nonprofit corporation ,
“ I always wanted a museum of comedy so I could have an organization that would let me pay people , ” she said .
“ This is my only real concern .
I have more shows coming up .
The coffers are dry , and I ’d like to raise money to pay these comics without having to keep dipping into my pockets . ”
She is still footing the bill .
Even the Web site she set up for the place is more or less dormant , since she ’d rather spend her budget on the shows .
Her relatives were stone cutters .
She was a cutup .
Growing up in Brooklyn , Long Island , and Queens , she said she liked all things silly .
It came in handy when early in grammar school she was bused to another school .
“ Anybody who ’s been bused knows that ’s when the comedians emerge , ” she said .
“ There ’s this stress of people from different schools coming together and being territorial .
Other kids were terrified , but I was n’t .
A sense of humor had everything to do with that . ”
Fast forward to graduate school , where she was studying architecture .
She kept a collection of New Yorker cartoons taped to her door .
People laughed at them .
She liked that .
She liked even better the man who gave her the magazine subscription — Mohamed Elkordy , a fellow student who became her husband .
He went into her family ’s business .
She would too , eventually .
By 1992 , a decidedly unfunny fall led her to comedy .
She broke her right ankle at a New Year ’s Eve party and was homebound , with two young children , for eight months .
That kind of thing gives you time to think .
She declared 1993 would be the year of bold moves .
“ I wanted to do the boldest thing I could and I decided stand - up comedy would be it , ” she said .
“ I remember knowing hilarious people who would rock your world .
Then they ’d get up on stage and freeze in the spotlight .
The first time I did that and people laughed , where they ’re not supposed to laugh , threw me for a loop . ”
When she was able to get around , she took a comedy course , using it to sift through jokes she had written .
Late night open microphone nights at comedy clubs were hard , because of her children at home .
Instead , she performed at fund - raising events for charities .
In time , she developed a knack for getting other comics to help out .
Early gigs included several at the United Nations , though she decided by the mid-1990s to stage shows at hospitals and shelters where spirits , and entertainment budgets , were low .
“ It ’s been downhill ever since , ” she said .
“ A lot of church basements . ”
Bill McCarty , a comedian and actor , is among her regular performers .
“ My attitude was I ’d love to do a show for charity if someone asked me , ” he said .
“ Sallie saw me at the Comic Strip and asked me . ”
The sites are unusual , he admitted .
“ Usually her shows have a two - drip minimum , ” he said .
“ There ’s usually somebody on meds .
Besides me . ”
Brian Kiley , a writer for Conan O’Brien and his just - completed New York show , said the audiences at her shows have challenged his preconceptions about people and comedy .
He has discovered he has a lot more in common with some people than he imagined .
Next Tuesday , he will be honored at a site where he has been a favorite — United Cerebral Palsy of New York City on East 23rd Street .
“ That ’s a tough room , because it ’s very hard for these people to respond , physically , ” he said .
“ You think you ’re not doing well .
The first five times I went there , I do n’t know if I got a laugh .
They were just staring at me .
Then at the end of the year they said they wanted me back because I was their favorite comic . ”
And sometimes being funny will drive away an audience , as he found at one hospital .
“ A guy had just had surgery for stomach cancer , ” Mr. Kiley said .
“ He left , but waited for me outside when I finished .
He said : ‘ I ’m sorry , but it hurt to laugh .
You were making me laugh so I had to go . ’
As a comic , you ’re flattered , because your dream is to hurt people as much as possible . ”
Ms. Elkordy ’s dream started with hopes of being in the spotlight .
Yet in hospitals and shelters , she has sometimes gone telling one - liners from bed to bed or person to person .
She knows that sometimes the hardest crowd consists of one .
In her case , it was her father , A. George Ottavino .
“ He would bust my chops , ” she recalled .
“ He was so funny , everything I said , he had to top .
He ’d say something and it was like a rim shot afterward .
He was so entertaining , yet he was so serious . ”
Yet , her father ’s portrait sits next to her own pantheon of comics , set on a narrow ledge in the office .
Maybe it would be nice to have a museum after all .
“ We need a real building , ” Ms. Elkordy said .
“ We need encasements for the dolls and frames for the pictures so people can see them .
And it ’d be nice to have a building located where people can see them , too .
Not across the street from a cemetery . ”

TORONTO - A powerful business lobby is pressuring the McGuinty Liberals to merge the province 's eight per cent sales tax with the five per cent goods and services tax .
However , the move would impose Ontario 's eight per cent sales tax on items that are currently exempt , including new homes , books , heating fuel , children 's clothing and diapers .
The Canadian Council of Chief Executives says combining the sales taxes would be " the single most powerful measure " the province can take to encourage business investment .
The council has written Premier Dalton McGuinty asking for a clear commitment in the March 26th budget on tax harmonization .
McGuinty says it 's an option he 's considering .
Global warming is dissolving the Alpine glaciers so rapidly that Italy and Switzerland have decided they must re-draw their national borders to take account of the new realities .
The border has been fixed since 1861 , when Italy became a unified state .
But for the past century the surface area of the “ cryosphere ” , the zone of glaciers , permanent snow cover and permafrost , has been shrinking steadily , with dramatic acceleration in the past five years .
This is the area over which the national frontier passes and the two countries have now agreed to have their experts sit down together and hash out where it ought to run now .
Daniel Gutknecht , responsible for the co-ordination of national borders at Switzerland ’s Office of Topography , said “ the border is moving because of the warmer climate ” , among other reasons .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Italy , the change in frontier requires that parliament approve a new law before it can happen .
Franco Narducci , an opposition member of the foreign affairs committee , is preparing the bill to be put to MPs .
The draft law has already been endorsed by the Foreign Minister , Franco Frattini , and is expected to become law before the end of next month .
In Switzerland no new law is required to make the changes .
The zones affected include areas around the Matterhorn , the 4,478 - metre - high mountain known in Italy as il Cervino .
The frontier will have to be shifted between a few metres and a hundred metres , but there will be no impact on border communities as the frontier , which is more than 4,000 metres above sea level , is well above any human habitation .
The new border will address changes that have been noticeable for at least 20 years , according to Luca Mercalli , a well - known Italian metereologist and climatologist .
“ But the melting of the glaciers has been accelerating since the very hot summer of 2003 , ” he said .
“ That heatwave caused a lot of changes in the landscape , and many landslides resulted from the melting of the permafrost .
For the first time ever the zero - degree altitude went higher than 4,000 metres , and the morphology of many parts of the mountains began to change . ”
Mr Mercalli says it is not only glaciers but other points of reference used in delimiting the border that have changed their position under the impact of global warming .
“ In places the conventional border fixed in 1861 followed water courses , and where glaciers have melted these may have changed significantly , ” he said .
The decision to redraw the border is a dramatic reminder of how seriously mountains are affected by climate change , he added .
“ The mountains are particularly sensitive to change .
And they are also areas that teach us a lot : effects of climate change that you do n’t notice in the cities are vividly apparent in the mountains .
Increased incidence of mud and rock slides , caused when soft ground previously covered by permafrost is exposed to rain , is only the most dramatic consequence . ”
The redrawing of the borders brings together the geological and geographical experts of two countries which have adopted drastically different approaches to global warming .
In Switzerland the government has been fully aware of the problem for years , and is actively engaged in reducing atmospheric pollution and energy use to minimise human impact on the atmosphere .
In Italy , on the other hand , scepticism prevails .
The Berlusconi government threatened to veto the EU Energy and Climate Package last October , and Italy is among the worst - performing states in the Climate Change Performance Index .
Do you misplace your keys or regularly miss appointments ?
Do you often forget the names of people you know well ?
Do you feel like your memory is slowly getting worse ?
If so , then you may find yourself considering those brain games advertised everywhere .
Sales pitches such as “ where the sweat is figurative , but results are real ” and “ your brain will thank you ” are amusingly alluring .
But you may find yourself wondering whether they are really worth the time and expense .
You shell out the money , play a few rounds and your brain will start spitting out names , dates and pin numbers like you ’re 18 again — right ?
Yes , those computerized brain - training games seem like a cool idea .
They are based in large part on clear evidence that living in an enriched environment with lots of mental stimulation produces positive brain changes .
And we agree there ’s huge potential for tapping into your own neuroplasticity ( that is , the brain ’s ability to change itself by remodeling nerve cell connections after experience ) to enhance mental fitness and prevent age - related memory decline .
The well - established benefits of early life education on reducing later risk for dementia has also given much credence to the theory that building a greater cognitive reserve capacity can help the brain compensate for injury — analagous to the concept that more cell phone towers equals fewer dropped calls .
Furthermore , several brilliant neuroscientists have , in recent years , served as the designers of the best brain games on the market .
But there ’s a crucial catch : most of these early studies were done on rodents .
So lost in the brain game buzz is the obvious question :
Are these claims true when it comes to human brain performance and aging ?
Can they really make your brain faster and stronger ?
Are there really better than the tried - and - true approach : remaining healthy , active , and engaged in the world around you ?
In other words , are they worth the money ?
To date , more than 50 studies have examined the benefits of brain training in humans but only a handful have tested whether or not the benefits persist and transfer over to real life .
Results from one of the best studies , published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society , is certainly encouraging , however .
As Glenn Smith of Mayo Clinic and her colleagues report , cognitively normal older adults who trained their brain were able to improve their auditory information processing speed by about 58 percent ( versus 7 percent in controls ) .
In their multi-center IMPACT trial , 487 adults ages 67 to 93 years worked for eight weeks at Posit Science ’s Brain Fitness Program , which seeks to improve brain function by stimulating the auditory system .
The Posit Science program is premised on the idea that as we get older our brains become less efficient at processing information from the senses ( not because of specific hearing or vision loss but because of degenerative changes in the brain ’s associative cortex ) , which then leads to a decline in memory .
The control group did a more conventional cognitive learning program that entailed viewing educational videos on art and history .
At the end of the study the brain training group also demonstrated more gains on measures of overall cognition and memory than the control group , but the differences were less impressive ( 4 percent versus 2 percent improvement ) .
Forty - eight percent of people in the active training group ( versus 40 percent of controls ) also reported positive changes in their daily life such as greater self - confidence , better recall of shopping lists and attending to conversations in noisy settings .
So what do these findings tell us ?
Clearly IMPACT demonstrated that both trained and some untrained cognitive abilities can improve after two months of structured sensory input training .
But the control group also improved , albeit to a smaller extent , suggesting that even watching videos ( such as The History Channel ) may help !
Improving the Parts , Helping the Whole ?
One of the crucial questions for brain - training programs is whether or not the specific skills emphasized during training , such as improved auditory perception , actually generalize to other cognitive abilities .
In other words , will practicing auditory perception lead to improved visual perception ?
And how long do training effects persist ?
According to Sherry Willis and colleagues at Pennsylvania State University brain exercises that focus on training reasoning skills do translate into long - lasting improvements in daily life .
The team looked at the effects of three non-computerized cognitive training modules ( designed to narrowly target memory , reasoning , or processing speed skills ) versus a no -contact control group in a sample of 2,832 cognitively - intact elders .
The subjects received 10 one - hour sessions plus a booster at months 11 and 35 .
Surprisingly , at two years , there was no benefit on daily activities .
But after five years the group trained in reasoning showed better performance on daily activities ( an effect that was made more noticeable by the fact that some in the control group showed a decline ) .
These results suggest that a short training session plus periodic boosters may induce long - lasting cognitive and functional benefits — sort of a “ teaching a person to fish for life ” effect .
Where Do We Stand Now ?
The typical consumer of brain - training programs is part of the “ worried well , ” a group of individuals with normal brains but significant concerns about cognitive decline that comes with aging .
Should you decide to try one or more commercially sold brain games , be forewarned that you may not see big improvements in your scores if you are already cognitively fit — a phenomenon referred to as the ceiling effect — or you may may max out soon due to frustration or boredom .
And remember that despite their promises , no computerized brain fitness program has yet been proven to prevent the onset of Alzheimer ’s disease or even to make brain cells any younger at a biological level .
Improving your computer - determined “ brain age ” to a 29 - year - old ’s level will certainly give you a mental workout ( and a nice ego trip ! ) but is currently about as well proven to reduce your risk for future memory loss as learning to hit a golf swing like Tiger Woods .
A related question is whether doctors can use brain games in ways analogous to cardiac rehab programs , to help people who already suffer from a mild memory disorder .
The pioneering early work of psychiatrist David Loewenstein and colleagues at the University of Miami has demonstrated that a skills training cognitive rehab program ( practicing skills such as paying bills , counting change and associating names with faces ) helped individuals with early stage Alzheimer ’s disease to improve on the tasks the were trained on , at least initially and for three months after the targeted intervention was completed .
These benefits , though likely to degrade quickly in the face of a progressive dementia , certainly compare favorably to what has been shown with any commercial brain game .
Why Not Just Play Bridge ?
Several studies have already demonstrated that exercise and socialization in later life have positive effects on cognition , and both of these are as easy as taking a walk and calling a friend .
Even the simple act of practicing juggling for a week increases gray matter in brain areas involved in visual and motor activity ( even if you never become very good at juggling ! ) .
What , then , is the rationale for using expensive brain games , which are essentially solitary activities that require you to shell out the bucks , sit on your gluteus maximus , stare at a screen and exercise little more than your index finger as it pushes the button on the mouse ?
The immediate answer is that we do n’t know .
We simply cannot say that brain games are better than activities such as learning a new language because no one has done those sorts of scientific comparisons .
But perhaps both the hype and the promise ( not to mention those tongue - firmly - in - cheek slogans ) combined with a little personal financial investment is just what someone needs to find the right motivation to train their brain in a systematic manner .
Think about how more effective it is to pay for a gym membership and feel obligated to go ( especially when your trainer is also fit and attractive ) compared with sitting in your garage alone in front of a bunch of dumbbells .
On the other hand , maybe brain games lead to unnecessary frustration , boredom or even added isolation .
One thing remains clear : there is no serious harm to brain training other than the effect on your wallet ( and the risk of some egg on your face if your seven - year old can play them better ) .
And evidence is accumulating that they not only improve the skills they are designed to help , but likely generalize to other cognitive abilities and have some long - lasting benefits .
If you ’re working at them now , we advise you to keep it up !
Perhaps computerized brain training will eventually evolve into a form of cyber - vaccine , in which socially - networked multiplayer training sessions every year will keep our brains forever young .
In the meantime , you can get cheaper and easily accessed brain benefits the old - fashioned way : eat your fruits and vegetables , exercise , do n’t be afraid to try new activities and be a social butterfly .
Your brain will really thank you !

Perl 's history shows two spikes in adoption rates .
The first came early in its life , when system administrators realized that Perl could replace homegrown and ad hoc polyglot scripts written in shell and AWK and Unix command line utilities .
The second came several years later , after the WWW and CGI revolutions , when programmers recognized that Perl made a great language for dynamic web sites .
Perl has expanded into other application domains , but it 's still a bicameral ( not sorry for the pun ) language .
I 've pitched this tent clearly in one camp , but I want write clearly about the other camp and why it does n't concern me .
Stability and Predictability
Many Perl-using system administrators fit into this camp .
They have a lot of mottos , such as " You ca n't break existing code ! " and " Slow and steady change is fine ! "
Upgrades should be infrequent and predictable .
Some of these people have code they wrote a decade or more ago that runs , unchanged , on the most recent version of Perl .
The Perl 5 development process has catered to this group since its inception .
The goal of this group is to ensure that old code -- never touched -- always works the same way .
It 's easy to mock this position , as some of its adherents are truly crazy in expecting that people running a decade - old release of Perl should expect that a CPAN module written in 2009 will install and run successfully , but there 's some validity to this position .
Take , for example , the all - too - common example of the Mac OS X update breaks Perl story .
Perl is useful .
Apple distributes several utilities which rely on Perl .
When Perl - savvy developers make routine changes and perform routine upgrades , the OS gets caught off guard .
Something changed .
Please note that this problem is not particular to Apple .
It 's affected many other operating systems and distributions , both proprietary and free .
The problem with this approach is that it 's fundamentally incompatible with the other approach .
Expecting that nothing will change when you change something is a good way to discover that making a change may , in fact , change something .
Again , I 'm mocking an extreme position .
I do find it reasonable to preserve some degree of backward compatibility for a reasonable period of time , but that line of thinking leads to the question " How do you solve this problem ? " , which I 'd like to delay until the next entry .
The real point of contention between these two camps is on how to deal with change .
( This question is at the heart of Masterminds of Programming -- Powell 's affiliate link -- which asks it of the designers of several influential programming languages . )
Improvement and Abstraction
The other school of thought believes that change is necessary to improve the language .
The Perl 5 development process has made some concessions to this view over time as well .
The module system and the CPAN itself demonstrate the value of a loosely - organized and self - organizing language extension system .
The goal of this group is to improve the language and its ecosystem based on feedback from real - world usage .
What 's good ?
What 's difficult ?
Which changes would make the language and its libraries easier or faster or more pleasant or more powerful ?
Which new niches can and should the language target to improve the lives of programmers or gain new ideas ?
Another good question is " Are programs getting easier to write , over time ? "
( Try Moose for an obvious improvement over Perl 5's default OO . )
A scary question is " Are the internals getting better over time ? "
There are very good reasons Perl 5 has trouble attracting new developers , and they 're the same reasons that Perl 5 does n't have a JIT or an advanced garbage collector or ports to other VMs -- not that I 'm bitter .
( I have patched the Perl 5 parser , however .
If that does n't give my authority some appeal , I 'm not sure what would . )
The Real Question
No one sits completely in one camp or the other .
They 're poles .
This is a spectrum .
No one seriously argues against fixing any bugs because people might be relying on them .
( Some people seriously argue against fixing some bugs , because someone might be relying on them , however .
Drives me crazy . )
My stance should be obvious .
I believe that it 's possible to design and build a working , reliable system which undergoes constant improvements at regular intervals such that upgrading frequently is boring and predictable .
Other projects have done this .
Other projects in the Perl ecosystem have done and continue to do this .
The most important question is not " Should change occur ? " but " How can change occur to minimize disruption to the first group and meet some of the goals of the second group ? "
I have two practical , technical details to explain in my next two entries .
Roasting a chicken
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Never underestimate the smell and taste of a simple roast chicken .
A crisp , golden skin that falls from a pinkish white slice of meat , served with a simple bread sauce , is all you need to appreciate such a homely dish .
Who really needs those rotisserie jobbies from the supermarket when one 's home could be filled with the aroma of freshly cooked food ?
Simon Hopkinson , chef and author of the cookbook Roast Chicken and Other Stories , agrees , saying we should roast our own chickens out of love .
" The best I ever enjoyed was my mother and father 's , " he says .
" We were lucky enough to have an Aga when I was young – an old - fashioned solid - fuel one , and I can still smell that chicken being roasted in their kitchen now .
You can't beat it – with that beautiful , crisp , salty skin – served with gravy , bread sauce and a little sausage wrapped up in some streaky bacon . "
Simon recommends selecting a good - sized , preferably free - range , bird ( 300g is sufficient per person ) .
Remove its innards , and smother the skin with plenty of butter before placing carefully in the cooker .
Do n't bung it in ( " This kind of food needs great respect , " he says ) .
Let it roast at 220C ( gas mark 7 ) for 10 minutes .
Turn the oven down to 190C ( mark 5 ) and allow 45 minutes per kilo , plus another 20 minutes , or until the juices run clear .
Allow its skin to become golden and prepare a good bread sauce .
Remember , says Simon : a true Englishman believes chicken and bread sauce ( milk , butter , onion , garlic , cloves , thyme , salt and breadcrumbs ) should never be parted .
You can stuff the chicken cavity with garlic , lemon halves and onion , but this is of the Gallic school , he says , and could lose you friends .
" You have to want to roast a chicken .
Do n't be driven by necessity .
It 's all about being able to look forward to its delicious flavours on your tongue , or salivating when you pull it from the oven .
It 's not a chore . "

Going for a walk
As you zoom into work on the train , or drive your car to your mother - in - law 's house three roads away , think about the physical and mental health benefits you are missing out on by not using your legs as God intended .
Martin Christie , founder of exercisewith friends .co.uk , is a firm believer in the value of taking a walk to put a brake on your pace of life , or to provide a useful hiaitus in our frantic daily lives and careers .
" My wife and I have one car between us and she takes it to work , " he says .
" So every day at around midday , I walk to pick up my little boy from nursery .
This takes 45 minutes out of my day , ambling down the road .
But I love it .
Along the way , I pick up calls on my mobile .
There 's no reason my business has to stop . "
When walking , why not take a look around you and appreciate the natural world – how spring is bringing lighter mornings , or the blossom is appearing on the trees ?
The simplicity of it , or the social side of walking with a friend , can make an important difference to people 's lives .
Some even do it to get fit .
" If you are walking for fitness set yourself a realistic target , " continues Christie .
" You do n't have to do it for more than an hour , and even that will make a big difference to your health .
The Government advises you walk at a brisk pace .
You certainly want to feel you are raising your breathing rate and getting slightly warm , but you should be able to converse comfortably with any walking partner accompanying you .
If you swing your arms you are also using your upper body . "
Try to fit your walking around your lifestyle , he says .
If you live in a city , travel home from the railway station on foot rather than take a bus .
And do n't bother changing Tube lines – travel the old - fashioned way , instead .
Our species has been doing it for thousands of years , after all .

Caring for clothes
In these days of fast fashion , the concept of caring for one 's clothes seems hopelessly outdated .
Why would anyone bother with all that folding and storing , stitching and darning when all they 've got to do is pop to the high street , and buy an armful of new outfits each year ?
Consequently – tragically – many of us do n't know the ritualistic pleasure that comes with good , old - fashioned , wardrobe routines .
The notion of carefully packing away your winter wools as spring dawns , and lovingly laundering delicates by hand , has become an alien concept .
Hopefully , with less cash in our pockets to throw away on passing fads , this wo n't continue .
Not long ago Prince Philip stepped out in a pair of perfectly - preserved 51 - year - old trousers ( altered only to taper the legs to make them fashionable ) .
Whatever you might think of HRH , for true clothes lovers it was a heart - warming sight – not just because it conjures up the rather terrific image of the prince studying stills from a Hedi Slimane catwalk – but also because it represents a peculiarly old - fashioned mentality of make - do and mend , whereby clothes are treasured , not coveted .
" People do n't realise , but I 've seen an enormous increase in damage to clothes , thanks to our culture of rushing , " says Garry Charnock of Jeeves of Belgravia , the royal dry cleaners , who laments fashion 's disposable culture .
" But it 's much more economical to buy good quality classics and care for what you 've got .
They do n't have to be Chanel , they can be Marks & Spencer . "
Garry recommends using a cotton sheet ( he customises his own ) to cover items that you wo n't be wearing for a while : " That way , the moths wo n't get to them and you wo n't need mothballs . "
He also advises scenting clothes with dried lavender to dispel any musty odours : " To quote John Keats and Mary Poppins , ' A thing of beauty is a joy for ever . ' "

Cleaning the windows
Back in the Seventies , when Robin Askwith was clambering up ladders in Confessions of a Window Cleaner , this task probably had men scrambling for the bucket and cloth and offering to " do " their neighbours ( nudge , nudge ) .
Nowadays most of us view it as a tedious chore , but taking charge of your glazing is simple to do , and will instantly brighten your home .
Guy Scott has been in the business for more than 20 years .
" The best way to go about washing your windows is to use a squeegee and an applicator with some warm soapy water , " says Guy .
" Go in a horizontal fashion from one side to another , then use the back of the applicator , following the same pattern , to remove all the dirt and grime .
Finally , use a crimp – a muslin cloth that has broken down – and wipe the frames to remove any residue . "
Guy says that , if possible , the process should be repeated at least once a month .
" In this day and age , for high windows , even the householders should n't be going up ladders .
It 's not worth the risk , and most people do n't realise they wo n't be covered on their house insurance , " says Guy .
Instead , he advises using a " reach and wash " pressure water system , or extension poles .
Though Guy admits it can be difficult to illicit much pleasure from cleaning windows during colder months , he says there 's no excuse for not getting the squeegee out during the summer .
" When it 's warm , it 's just nice to be outside , " he says .
" It can be sociable too - if your neighbours are out , you can have a chat . "

Servicing the car
Changing your own starter motor was once not only a matter of pride , but a matter of course .
Today , however , many motorists happily spend fortunes to have mechanics change something as simple as a brake light .
This , according to James Ruppert , of bangernomics.com is partly the fault of the manufacturers .
" They deliberately make cars complicated , " he says .
" With some models , every time you replace a bulb you need to reset the car computer .
It 's all to force you to go back to the dealer . "
In reality , even the most intimidating sounding tasks ought to be well within the capabilities of the up - for - it amateur mechanic .
All they need are some basic tools – a set of spanners , three or four screwdrivers – and the relevant Haynes manual , all of which will , says Ruppert , quickly pay for themselves .
" There 's no law against servicing your own motor .
When it comes to something like the brakes , then perhaps if you 're not confident , you should pay someone to do it , but with most other jobs you may well do a better job than your garage . "
And , if you 're handy with a wrench , you 'll soon be able to deal with a whole host of household tasks that might previously have seemed to demand a plumber or electrician .
" Young motorists today do n't know one end of a car from the other .
There are fewer and fewer people able to do these things .
It gives you a sense of satisfaction , you learn a skill – and you save money . "
And besides , oil - stained overalls can be quite the aphrodisiac .

Baking a cake
Our butter is unbeatable , our cream and milk unmatched .
Our chickens lay some of the finest eggs you 'll crack and we mill a mean flour .
So why do we so often reach for the supermarket shelf for a sweaty lump of stodge wrapped in plastic ?
It 's a mystery to Lesley Norris , who oversees cake creation at Betty 's Craft Bakery in Harrogate , Yorkshire .
" When you make a cake in the home , the family can mix the ingredients and lick the bowl , " she says .
" And then , best of all , you 've got the smell of a freshly baked cake coming out of the oven – you can't get any of that if you get something off the shelf . "
Lesley has seen a return to traditional cakes as austere times breed nostalgia .
And cakes do n't get much more traditional , or easy , than the Victoria sponge .
The recipe requires only butter , caster sugar , self - raising flour as well as four eggs , a teaspoon of baking powder and the all - important jam and cream for the filling .
Over to Lesley : " Mix the butter and sugar really well so it 's pale and fluffy .
Then , add your eggs a tablespoon at a time , beating well after each addition .
Sift in the flour and baking powder , using a large metal spoon to fold it in gently with a spoon using a figure of eight motion so you do n't knock any air out .
" Then divide the mixture between two greased tins and bake for 20 minutes ( at a 175C ) until golden brown .
Cool on a rack , remove the sponge from the tins , and spread one half with jam and the other with whipped cream .
Finally , sandwich the sponges together and dust the top with icing sugar . "
What could be nicer ?

Making sloe gin
Erroneously believed to be the province solely of Miss Marple types , the making of fruit liqueurs is thriving in certain quarters .
This was forcibly brought home to me when I agreed to judge the category entitled " One Bottle Sloe Gin or Other Fruit Liqueur " at a country show in North Yorkshire .
Instead of the half - dozen entries I anticipated , the phalanx of 30 - odd multi-coloured bottles posed problems for both stamina and sobriety .
The best of these potent refreshments is sloe gin , made from the tiny , intensely bitter fruit of the blackthorn ( look for them in the local park , or next time you take a walk somewhere leafy ) .
To make a bottle , you need a pound of berries and a pin , though two hours in the freezer is said to perform the puncturing just as well .
Mix the punctured sloes with a quarter their weight of sugar .
Half - fill an empty bottle with the mixture .
Top up with gin and leave for two months , shaking occasionally .
If you pick sloes after the first frost , which weakens the skins , the resulting liqueur should be ready by Christmas .
Be warned , however : once you start making fruit liqueurs there is a danger of the house filling with bottles , though these soon empty after reaching maturity .
My home - made crème de cassis resulted in a kir so irresistible that the entire production run disappeared in a single evening .
This proved to be somewhat expensive since , unless you happen to have a still , hidden in your back garden , the gin or vodka required as a basis for fruit liqueur involves a substantial payment to Mr Alistair Darling .
One way of avoiding rapidly vanishing stocks is to make a drink that is resistant to consumption .
This proved to be the case with my dauntingly rustic elderflower vodka .
Though unappealing taken neat , I eventually discovered a cocktail that adequately disguised this stalky concoction .
Elderflower caipirinha , anyone ?

Reading a map
Reading a map is an invitation to the imagination .
The nautical chart leads the desk - captain into stormy harbour ; the aviator 's Tactical Pilotage Chart brings with it the vision of clouds forming as the wind heaps up over this ridge , this one , here .
The Ordnance Survey maps , even the big ones , lay history before our eyes .
These villages , all in hollows : the people who settled them were n't afraid of their neighbours or they'd have built on the hilltops .
See how the place - names change : this valley was once a river , separating tribes with different languages .
GPS , or Google Maps , show a world through glass , with the manic focus of an imbecile .
Zoom out your satnav to see the places passing either side of your affectless motorway and within seconds it autozooms in again , a flat line on a joke horizon .
You do n't need to know that .
Time to destination , to the minute ?
I can do that with my thumb on the map and a glance at my wristwatch .
Let me navigate – boat , car , or aeroplane – with a map and a protractor , an E6 - B drift calculator , a sextant and skills other men have taught me , passed down since that worst of all navigators , Odysseus .
Let me see not just where but how and why and what .
Great Circles , Mercator projections , rhumb lines , speed - over - ground ; B-roads and single - tracks and villages big enough for a pub or small enough for a history : map - reading brings these all into view , and , with them , the pleasure of being wrong .
And , of course , texture .
Paper and chinagraph pencils and sun-sightings and compass dip : more to life than precision on a screen .
Yes , I love Google Maps on my iPhone .
But maps are qualitatively different .
When my father was dying , he gave me his Rand MacNally Road Map of the USA .
" I 'll have no more use for it , " he said .
I read it in bed , pencil in hand , thumb on the map , planning the journeys he 'll never make .
You ca n't do that with a TomTom .

Brewing a cup of coffee
For some of us , getting to work without at least one shot of caffeine is as unthinkable as turning up without clothes on .
And while it may be tempting to fork out for a Nespresso machine , or grab a skinny macchiato at Costa Nerobucks , anyone who knows their beans would attest that brewing a proper cup of coffee requires nothing more complicated than a cafetière .
Ben Townsend is a " barista trainer " and self - confessed coffee geek from London .
His morning routine starts with a bag of beans .
" The most critical part of making good coffee is to grind good - quality , fresh beans every time , " he says .
" I use a little burr grinder rather than a blade grinder .
Blades tend to create particles of uneven size . "
Ben then places his cafetière , or French press , on a set of digital scales and weighs out his freshly ground coffee and hot water ( not boiling – the heat overpowers the coffee ) .
" The industry standard is 50 grams of ground coffee to one litre of water , " Townsend says .
You can reset the scales and use them to measure the water – a litre is roughly one kilo .
Then you 've got time to get your cereal sorted .
Good coffee comes to those who wait ( for about four minutes ) .
Add milk if you like , though he thinks " it 's a shame to dilute the flavour of the coffee " , and pour .
The final decision : the cup .
According to psychologists who have studied how our brains are wired up to latch on to the rituals associated with drug delivery , coffee " tastes better " in your favourite mug .
Just make sure it 's clean – a week 's worth of encrusted rings will do nothing to improve the taste of organic arabica beans .

Having a clear - out
Having a good clear - out is something we should think of as less of a chore and more of a meditative experience .
According to Isobel McKenzie - Price of Ideal Home , " there 's nothing more satisfying than the sense of tranquillity that comes from an organised home " .
And rather than spending money on storage for your long - forgotten possessions , surely it 's better to confront clutter head - on and get your house in order .
" We have a need to create order from chaos , " explains McKenzie - Price .
She recalls the bliss of visiting a well - ordered home .
" A couple of years ago , I spent a weekend with the CEO of a global company in her house in the Hamptons .
She showed me her perfectly ordered cupboards and her fully stocked larder and I was in heaven . "
To feel this euphoric about one 's own abode , she recommends tackling one room at a time , claiming this makes it a far more relaxing , and even a de-stressing experience .
Be systematic – do n't just drift from pile to pile , get stuck in – and be ruthless .
Teenage love letters and puffball skirts might once have loomed large in your life but if you 're drowning in stuff then it 's time to sling them out .
Clear bookshelves of anything you 've always meant to read and have n't , then deliver the spoils to Oxfam so others can enjoy your cast - offs .
One top tip for sorting out a crowded bedroom or sitting room is to tip all of the debris on the bed or the couch – that way , you can't have a sit - down or sneak off to sleep until you 've thoroughly dejunked and dealt with the mess .
Anything valuable can be posted on eBay or , if you 're feeling altruistic , listed on Freecycle.org .
Finally , sit down and enjoy a well - earned drink .

... or just doing nothing
" We 're busy doing nothing , working the whole day through , " sang Bing Crosby in the 1949 film , A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur 's Court , " Trying to find lots of things not to do .
/ We 're busy going nowhere , is n't it just a crime ? / We 'd like to be unhappy but we never do have the time . "
It 's a lost art , the art of idling , loafing , wool - gathering .
We 're so driven by schedules and deadlines , BlackBerry - consulting and Facebook - checking , it 's hard to imagine life without it all .
There 's always , we tell ourselves , something to be done , someone to be rung , something to be read or cooked or recycled or consumed .
Kipling , in his poem
If , encouraged us to fill any spare minute on our hands with " 60 seconds ' worth of distance run " , like some deranged scoutmaster .
Should we try that ?
Try doing nothing , instead .
The TV is switched off , the children are away , the phone is dead , the dogs are silent – and you are prowling in your kitchen , picking up a corkscrew or a wooden spoon as though trying to familiarise yourself with ordinary life .
In the garden , you stare at the leaves of a magnolia tree as if you 've never seen them before .
You spend whole , unrecoverable minutes of your life gazing at a caterpillar arching its back along a wooden fence .
Back indoors , you sit on the living - room carpet and admire the complicated geometry of the sticks that make up the unlit fire in the grate ...
Doing nothing , in other words , makes you notice everything .
The mind , sated with processing external stimuli from page , screen and the chatter of humans , finds itself fixing on the ordinary and being startled by its unfamiliarity .
Doing nothing inspires involuntary meditation , until you suddenly hear the sound of your own self , tucked away deep inside you , ruminating on the world and your place in it .
It 's a fantastic noise .

Security forces have recently clashed with supporters of the ousted president
Soldiers have stormed Madagascar 's constitutional court and arrested its head of security , who has been accused of destabilising the country .
Journalists were allowed into the court in the capital , Antananarivo , following the raid and shown a cache of weapons .
Supporters of former President Marc Ravalomanana have been pressing the court to reverse its decision to recognise the leader who ousted him .
Andry Rajoelina came to power in March after weeks of unrest .
Remnants ' rounded - up '
The BBC's Jonny Hogg in Madagascar says the raid on the court may be an attempt to intimidate the judiciary .
Several cars filled with heavily armed soldiers - most from the regiment that brought Mr Rajoelina to power - arrived at the court in mid-afternoon and fired warning shots to disperse spectators , our correspondent says .
A few minutes later journalists were allowed into the court grounds and shown weapons that had apparently been hidden there .
The AFP news agency quoted sources as saying that the military operation was aimed at rounding up remnants of the armed forces who remained loyal to Mr Ravalomanana .
Mr Ravalomanana was forced from power in March by the army which backed Mr Rajoelina , following weeks of protests by his supporters .
But in recent days , the streets of Antananarivo have become the scene of daily rallies by backers of the former president .
A week ago , two people died when police clashes with protesters , leading the government to ban public demonstrations .
We always thought that policing by consent was the British way .
Our constables were simply citizens in uniform .
Not for us the weapons , masks and boots of the continental riot police and their political masters .
If you wanted a difference between us and the rest , this was it : no policeman in Britain would ever go about his business with his face covered .
This was a style of policing that minimised the risk of violence and abuse .
It was a philosophy that , to this day , keeps the majority of our officers from bearing firearms .
It is an approach that has overwhelming public support .
It is also an approach that has sometimes been undermined in practice .
Yet the disgraceful conduct of the Special Patrol Group in Southall in 1979 , those out - of - area officers waving their £ 20 notes in mining villages in the early 1980s , even the scandalous organised perjury of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad could not completely destroy a bond between people and law enforcement in this country .
It remained a defining characteristic of our public life and Britons were very proud of it .
And it survived despite the fact that identifying wrongdoers in the police service has always been challenging .
Speaking of the death by brain injury of young schoolteacher Blair Peach in the Southall riots , Lord Denning famously said there was much evidence he had been killed by a police officer - and no evidence he was killed by anyone else .
But the assailant was never produced .
And when illegal weapons , including coshes and knives , were found in its lockers , the SPG was ignominiously disbanded .
The Metropolitan police commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , a thoughtful and honest man , will be anxious that its successor , the Territorial Support Group , is acquiring a similarly unenviable reputation .
It is not systematic corruption or even political compromise that most threatens the relationship between the British and their police in this new century .
In a deeply ironic reflection of the government 's obsession with surveillance , it is the newly discovered power of mass photojournalism .
Now a single punch , or a glancing whack of the truncheon can be captured and broadcast to the watching world without control .
It seems anyone with a camera can do a better job than the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Indeed , it is apparently only those people with cameras who can prise a decent distance between that body and the police they are supposed to be watching .
The IPCC will come under severe strain if it repeatedly finds its instincts belied by the jumpy , inexpert , but deeply telling frames of evidence that jolt out at us from the evening news .
It is a signal of the IPCC 's struggle to establish a robust reputation for independence that no one can imagine this material being sent directly to its own investigators rather than to journalists .
The identity of police officers matters .
That is why they all have numbers .
As we citizens are sometimes lectured by home secretaries : if you have done nothing wrong , you have nothing to fear .
In the early 1980s , after an innocent young black man leaving a funfair in north London was badly beaten in the back of a police van , it was seriously contended by the Metropolitan police that the vehicle in question could not be identified .
Subsequently , all police carriers had numbers painted on their sides .
We need to be on the same side as the police .
And the police need to be on the same side as the rule of law .
In classical common law doctrine , this means that they are subject to exactly the same constraints as the rest of us .
This is not a weakness in their armoury .
On the contrary , under our system it is their greatest strength because it brings the police the co-operation and consent of the public .
So here are some questions for the IPCC to consider as it investigates the events leading to Ian Tomlinson 's death : why were British police officers attending a demonstration in the heart of London with their identifying numbers hidden ?
In the absence of a fire risk , who authorised them to pull balaclavas up over their heads ?
And why did n't they want anyone to see their faces ?

Chelsea 4 - 4 Liverpool ( agg. 7 - 5 )
Trailing 3 - 1 from the first leg at home , Liverpool knew they had more than a mountain to climb and it looked almost impossible from the onset after talismanic captain , Steven Gerrard failed to recover from his niggle in time to even make the squad .
Chelsea , meanwhile , had their own influential skipper , John Terry missing due to suspension and it would come down to a case of which team would miss their on - field leaders the most .
First Half
Both sides started very tentatively as poor touches and stray passes dominated the opening few minutes .
The visitors , predictably , looked the more bullish in attack while the hosts were happy to wait for gaps to appear for them to exploit .
And the first chance fell to Liverpool after 12 minutes when Dirk Kuyt ’s through ball found Yossi Benayoun , whose audaciously backheel flick - on released Fernando Torres , but the Spaniard ’s left - footed shot looking for the top corner flashed over the crossbar .
Straight to the other end , Lampard drilled in a blistering , swerving low free kick from 30 yards out but it just whistled inches wide of the right post , even though Pepe Reina would have had it covered .
But on 18 minutes , the Reds found themselves back in the tie as they went ahead on the night .
Fabio Aurelio swung in a free kick on the right touchline but instead of delivering a cross to his team - mates in the middle , he arrowed in a cleverly disguised shot to Petr Cech ’s near post and the Czech shot - stopper , who had drifted out of his line towards the back post , was left flailing for the ball as it trickled into the back of the net .
The Blues failed to respond as the Reds continued to push forward and ten minutes later , they amazingly made it 2 - 0 .
And it was yet again another free kick from the right from Aurelio which caused all the mayhem when he floated in a cross to the middle this time and Chelsea ’s first leg hero , Branislav Ivanovic wrestled Xabi Alonso to the ground and Spanish referee , Luis Medina Cantalejo did not hesitate in pointing to the spot .
Alonso stepped up and took the penalty himself and smashed it to his left corner with authority , sending Cech the wrong way .
The aggregate tie was now levelled at 3 - 3 but Chelsea still had the away goal advantage .
But the Londoners came to life after the early double shock and a nervous Guus Hiddink made a tactical change after just 35 minutes , taking off the ineffectual Salomon Kalou for Nicolas Anelka .
But they were restricted to half chances from free kick deliveries as Didier Drogba , Alex and Ivanovic all had a look - in but failed to really trouble Reina .
A minute before the break , the Merseysiders came agonisingly close twice to turning the tie completely on its head .
First , Alonso ’s diagonal cross into the box found Dirk Kuyt , but the Dutchman ’s looping header was brilliantly slapped away by Cech .
The goalkeeper , however , spilled the ensuing cross from Aurelio and that almost led to a goalmouth scramble , but Torres was deemed to have fouled Michael Essien as he desperately lunged at the Ghanaian to try and rob the ball off him .
Second Half
Whatever Hiddink screamed at his charges in the dressing room during the break , it did n’t quite get through as Chelsea looked jittery from at the restart .
Lucas latched on to a Benayoun through pass and rounded a hapless Cech to the byline , but without any angle , he knocked it back to Aurelio , whose ambitious first time shot just dipped over the bar at the back post .
But on 50 minutes , Hiddink ’s men finally responded as they pulled one back .
Anelka drilled in a low cross from the right and Drogba nicked in just ahead of Martin Skrtel to get to slightest of touches to divert it past Reina , but the Spaniard had to be held accountable as he spilled the ball into this own net at his near post .
Five minutes later , the Stamford Bridge faithful were up on their feet again when they thought Drobga had the ball in the back of the net .
The Ivory Coast hitman curled in a free kick from 20 yards out but it only rippled the side netting .
Sixty seconds after that , however , it was 2 - 2 .
And it was off a free kick from an almost identical range and distance , except , it was Alex who pummelled in an unstoppable piledriver with the outside of his right boot as the ball swerved away from the outstretched hands of Reina into the top of the goal .
A shell - shocked Liverpool tried to react and on 63 minutes , Javier Mascherano unleashed a rocket from 25 yards out but Cech just managed to palm it away at full stretch .
Chelsea should have killed off the contest on 66 minutes , when Drogba ran onto Malouda ’s long ball out of defence , shrugged off Carragher down the right flank and squared it to Michael Ballack but the German ’s tame first time effort was saved by Reina .
But it was indeed game over 15 minutes from time when Lampard stabbed home Drogba ’s low cross from close range .
Or so one thought .
With 10 minutes left on the clock , Benitez ’s men sensationally clawed their way back into the game .
First , Lucas made it 3 - 3 on the night when his speculative effort outside the box took a wicked deflection off Essien and wrong - footed Cech .
And merely two minutes later , Kuyt set up a tense finale when he easily outjumped a static Carvalho to meet Albert Riera ’s cross and nodded a bullet header past the Czech goalkeeper .
On 88 minutes , however , it really would be curtains this time when Anelka ’s pull back found Lampard , and the stand - in captain smacked in a first time shot across goal past Reina and the ball pinged into the back of the net off the inside of the post .
There was to be one last drama , though , as David N’Gog ’s shot inside the box was headed off the line by Essien with just seconds left in regulation time .
And that proved the final piece of action on a thriller night as Chelsea marched to the semi-finals of the Champions League 7 - 5 on aggregate , where they will now meet Barcelona .

The Taliban , whose extreme interpretation of Sharia law and its harsh punishments made Afghanistan one of world 's most repressive and reviled regimes , have agreed to soften their position on such things as beards and burqas as part of a trade - off in negotiations with the Afghan government .
Afghanistan is increasingly the focus of international diplomatic attention following a major international conference in The Hague this week .
It will surface on the fringes of the G20 summit and dominate this week 's Nato meeting in Strasbourg .
Hillary Clinton , the US Secretary of State , floated the idea of talking to " moderate " Taliban at the Hague conference , saying that those who gave up " extremism " would be granted an " honourable form of reconciliation " .
Publicly , a Taliban spokesman yesterday rejected the American offer , describing it as " a lunatic idea " .
But preliminary talks between President Hamid Karzai's government and Taliban insurgents are already under way , and appear to have yielded a significant shift away from the Taliban 's past obsession with repressive rules and punishments governing personal behaviour .
The Taliban are now prepared to commit themselves to refraining from banning girls ' education , beating up taxi drivers for listening to Bollywood music , or measuring the length of mens ' beards , according to representatives of the Islamist movement .
Burqas worn by women in public would be " strongly recommended " but not compulsory .
The undertakings have been confirmed by Mullah Abdul Salaam Zaeef , who was the Taliban 's ambassador to Pakistan in the late 1990s , and who has been part of a Saudi - sponsored peace initiative .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The initiative also comes , according to former senior members of the movement , at a time when the Taliban are intensely apprehensive about the immediate future with an impending military and diplomatic offensive by the Obama administration .
According to Christoph Hörstel , a German analyst of Afghan affairs , Mullah Zaeef has confirmed that the Taliban are no longer insisting that their members should form the government .
Instead , they would agree to rule by religious scholars and technocrats who meet with their approval following a national loya jirga , or community meeting , attended by public figures .
The demand for a loya jirga could be met as early as next month if President Karzai convenes a meeting of elders to determine who should rule when his term officially ends on 21 May .
The Independent revealed earlier this year that the new head of Saudi intelligence , Prince Muqrin Abdulaziz al Saud has taken personal charge of organising a dialogue between the Karzai government and the Islamists .
The Saudis are also said to have been reassured by the Obama administration that the US was not following a purely military solution but would welcome establishing contacts with some strands of the insurgency .
Mrs Clinton reiterated this message this week .
Although the new stance shows a shift in the Taliban posture , some demands are certain to be rejected by both President Karzai 's government and the Americans .
They include the stipulation that all foreign forces should withdraw from Afghanistan within six months .
According to a former Taliban minister , however , some of the more aggressive demands are for " internal consumption " within the radical Muslim groups involved in the insurgency in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and the Taliban negotiators would be content , for the time being , with gestures such as removing from a UN blacklist the names of some senior figures in the insurgency .
The Islamist group want a guarantee of safe conduct for Mullah Mutassim and others in Taliban delegations .
" But there are others , people like me who are no longer part of the Taliban and people who have been helping with the peace process who are still on the blacklist .
We believed our names would be lifted from the blacklist , but that has not happened . "
Banned by the Taliban : Cassettes , kites and schools for girls
Televisions , pop music and kite flying were banned at the height of the Taliban 's rule between 1996 and 2001 .
Women were only allowed outside with a male relative , men 's beards had to be long enough to exceed a fist clasped at the chin , and anyone who broke the rules risked being beaten - or worse .
Public executions – stonings , shootings and hangings – were held in football stadiums and on street corners .
Gangs of " morality police " would patrol the streets in pick - up trucks looking for any signs of secularism .
Television sets were rounded up and smashed .
Cassette tapes were strung up on telegraph poles as a warning .
Music with instruments was banned .
Images of people and animals were officially outlawed .
Girls ' schools were closed and women were only allowed to work in their homes .
Starving widows were n't even allowed out to beg .
Today Taliban rule where it prevails , such as in Wardak , remains brutal but inconsistent .
Some men are spared the need for fist - length beards , if they travel to Kabul .
Frontal lobe dementia
Frontal lobe dementia ( Frontotemporal Dementia , FTD ) strikes people at an earlier age .
After Alzheimer 's disease , FTD is the form of dementia that occurs most frequently in patients younger than 65 .
In FTD , the disease process starts in the frontal lobe where large numbers of brain cells begin to die off .
The frontal lobe is the foremost part of the brain and constitutes about 30 % of the brain .
Among other things , it is involved in regulating behavior , movement and mood , and it is responsible for cognitive functions such as language .
So , the first clinical signs of FTD are changes in behavior and personality , and then , in a later stage of the disease , the loss of memory functions .
Progranulin : a main actor
Genetic research has shown previously that there is a genetic defect in chromosome 17 in a large percentage of the families with FTD .
There are two genes in chromosome 17 that , if a defect occurs , cause a hereditable form of FTD .
In 1998 , defects were found in the gene for the tau protein , a substance that appears in the protein clots in the brains of FTD and Alzheimer 's patients .
In 2006 , Christine Van Broeckhoven 's team discovered hereditable defects in the gene for the progranulin protein .
They predicted that people with these hereditable defects produce only half of the normal amount of progranulin .
This has been confirmed by Christine Van Broeckhoven 's team , who have shown that a shortage of this growth factor leads to the dying off of brain cells in the frontal lobe and in this way causes FTD .
New results indicate that progranulin also plays a role in the death of brain cells in other diseases of the brain , such as Alzheimer 's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) .
Predictive test
On the basis of their research , Kristel Sleegers , a scientist in Van Broeckhoven 's team , has developed a test for measuring the quantity of progranulin in the blood in a simple way .
This test enables one to determine whether someone has an increased risk of FTD due to a shortage of progranulin long before symptoms appear .
The blood test can be used on a large scale and is much more simple and user - friendly than the current genetic tests .
This finding also offers prospects for the early detection of FTD caused by a shortage of progranulin .
However , it is still too early for a medicine to combat FTD .
Further scientific research is needed to determine how a shortage of progranulin can be restored to normal .

Nate Dahl writes , " The Honda Super Cub may be the most - produced motorcycle in the world , having sold more than 60 million since it was introduced in 1958 , but in spite of the fact that it 's still going strong in Japan and other countries in the far - east , Honda has n't offered the Super Cub for sale in the USA since 1983 .
That 's about to change , sort - of .
San Yang Motorcycle of Taiwan is about to re-introduce the Super Cub to the American market this spring .
The Symba is an updated rendition of the classic step - through Cub design , developed by San Yang over the 40 years they made the Super Cub in Taiwan under license from Honda .
Now that the company has gone independent , it is trying hard to develop its own brand presence in the world .
In recent years it has signed up Carter Brothers as its distributor in the USA , and has introduced its popular line of scooters though a growing network of San Yang dealers across the country .
This year , encouraged by strong scooter sales and by the enthusiasm of its USA dealers regarding the potential popularity of the Super Cub design among American scooter and small - displacement motorcycle enthusiasts , San Yang began laying the groundwork for a Symba introduction to the American market .
They Symba features a 100 cc 4 - stroke engine paired with a 4 - speed manual transmission with the classic Cub - style foot - actuated clutch / shifter mechanism ( sometimes referred to as a ' semi-auto ' transmission ) . "
The Symba hits the market this spring , priced at $ 2,598 .

A new type of yogurt provides an almost vaccine - like effect against the bacteria that cause gastritis and stomach ulcers , researchers in Japan said .
Hajime Hatta , a chemist at Kyoto Women 's University in Kyoto , Japan , said the yogurt represents a unique approach to fighting stomach ulcers .

" With this new yogurt , people can now enjoy the taste of yogurt while preventing or eliminating the bacteria that cause stomach ulcers , " Hatta said in a statement .
Hatta and colleagues said H. pylori seems to rely on a protein called urease to attach to and infect the stomach lining .
Hatta turned to classic vaccine - making technology and injected chickens with urease and allowed the chickens ' immune systems to produce an antibody to the protein .
The researchers then harvested the antibody , called IgY - urease , from chicken eggs .
The scientists recruited 42 people who tested positive for H. pylori to eat two cups daily of either plain yogurt or yogurt containing the antibody for four weeks .
Levels of urea , a byproduct of urease , decreased significantly in the antibody group when compared with the control group , indicating reduced bacterial activity , the researchers said .
Hatta cautioned that the anti-ulcer yogurt is not for those who are allergic to milk or eggs .
The findings were presented at the 237th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Salt Lake City .
It has been revealed that two children were in the same back yard as a man who was shot in Sydney 's inner - west overnight .
The man underwent surgery after being shot in a back street at Glebe .
The 25 - year - old was at a party in Bellevue Street at about 8:00 pm ( AEDT ) with a group of friends .
Police say three people pulled up in a blue Subaru WRX and called out the victim 's name , before firing a number of shots , five of which hit the man in the upper legs and stomach .
The victim was then taken to hospital by his friends .
Detective Inspector Peter Bailey says that the most worrying aspect to the crime is that two teenagers related to the man who were standing nearby could have been hurt .
" The issue for us is that there were children in the yard at the time of the shooting , and the shooting was obviously outrageous in that some of these children could have been shot and killed , " he said .
Police are still looking for the three people who were in the car , and anyone who witnessed the attack or has information is being urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .

An 89 - year - old man wanted in Germany on war crimes charges has been released from custody after his deportation from the US was blocked .
Earlier , US federal agents had detained John Demjanjuk at his home in Ohio , carrying him out in a wheelchair .
But a US federal appeals court granted an 11th hour stay of deportation after Mr Demjanjuk 's family argued that he was too ill to be transported .
He is accused of being a guard at the Sobibor death camp in World War II .
Mr Demjanjuk denies the charges , claiming that he was captured by the Germans in his native Ukraine during the war and kept as a prisoner of war .
He was arrested at his home earlier on Tuesday and taken to a federal building in Cleveland , from where he was expected to be flown to Germany .
It 's just a shame that Mr Demjanjuk had to go through the hell that he went through once again this morning
Ed Nishnic
Demjanjuk family spokesman
But the 6th Circuit US Court of Appeals intervened to prevent the deportation while it examined the case further .
A spokesman for Mr Demjanjuk 's family said they were " delighted " by the decision .
" It 's just a shame that Mr Demjanjuk had to go through the hell that he went through once again this morning , " said Ed Nishnic .
Mr Demjanjuk 's son , John Demjanjuk
Jr , said if the " madness and inhumane action " of deportation was not stopped his father would die in hospital in Germany without standing trial .
He also criticised the manner of the arrest , saying the government had not kept a promise to give three to five day 's notice of their arrival and to collect his father in an ambulance .
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agency has said it will continue electronic monitoring of Mr Demjanjuk and will " work co-operatively with the Department of Justice and the government of Germany to effect [ his ] removal " .
Israeli trial Mr Demjanjuk arrived in the US in 1952 as a refugee , settling in Cleveland , Ohio , where he worked in the car industry .
DEMJANJUK CASE TIMELINE 1952 : Gains entry into the US , claiming he spent most of the war as a German prisoner 1977 : First charged with war crimes , accused of being " Ivan the Terrible " 1981 : Stripped of US citizenship 1986 : Extradited to Israel 1993 : Israeli Supreme Court overturns conviction , ruling that he is not Ivan the Terrible 2002 : Loses US citizenship after a judge said there was proof he worked at Nazi camps 2005 : A judge rules in favour of deportation to his native Ukraine 2009 : Germany issues an arrest warrant for him ; US immigration agents seize him at his home
Profile : John Demjanjuk
In 1988 , Mr Demjanjuk was sentenced to death in Israel for crimes against humanity after Holocaust survivors identified him as the notorious " Ivan the Terrible " , a guard at the Treblinka death camp .
Israel 's highest court later overturned his sentence and freed him , after newly unearthed documents from the former Soviet Union indicated that " Ivan the Terrible " had probably been a different man .
Mr Demjanjuk returned to the US , but in 2002 had his US citizenship stripped because of his failure to disclose his work at Nazi camps when he first arrived as a refugee .
In 2005 , a US immigration judge ruled that he could be deported to Germany , Poland or Ukraine .
Germany issued a warrant for his arrest last month , and his family have been fighting to prevent him from being deported ever since .
He faces charges of aiding the death of 29,000 Jews .

Maamon Khozendar , chairman of Khozendar and Sons Company Ltd. , is one of Gaza 's most successful industrialists .
He 's a petroleum importer , and executes major construction projects around the Palestinian enclave .
What he'd most like to do now is help his fellow Gazans recover from the devastating 22 - day war that came to an uncertain pause in late January .
But rebuilding and rehabilitating Gaza requires the basics of the construction industry – cement and steel – that Israel will not allow in through their border crossings .
His dilemma presents a window into a core challenge faced by Palestinians and international donors as they gather in Egypt on Monday to pledge funds for postwar reconstruction .
" I have almost everything I need , except for gray cement and white cement , " Mr. Khozendar says .
" Without those two elements , you can't produce . "
Without a substantial shift in Israel 's policy , the $ 2.8 billion the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) hopes will be pledged Monday will probably not go beyond humanitarian needs .
Until Israel and Hamas reach a negotiated truce , which is being worked on through Egyptian mediation , a whole range of reconstruction projects will remain theoretical .
The 10 Qassam rockets fired at Israel by Gaza militants Saturday underscore the shakiness of the pair of unilateral cease - fires each side declared in January .
Following the latest strikes , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised there would be a " painful , uncompromising response . "
Hours later , another Qassam launched from Gaza exploded off the coast of Ashkelon .
Even though the conference takes place amid much uncertainty over the state of Palestinian politics and the state of war in the coastal strip , Gazans themselves are desperate to begin rebuilding their lives .
2,800 Gaza homes destroyed
According to the most recent figures from the International Committee for the Red Cross and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society , the conflict destroyed more than 2,800 homes completely , and 1,900 partially , leaving tens of thousands of people homeless .
In addition to that , many symbols of government were damaged , from the parliament building to ministries to police stations .
None of those figures include losses to private businesses .
Khozendar says that his businesses alone suffered $ 2 million in direct losses .
This includes a petroleum station in northern Gaza that got hit by a missile and a marble factory that was reduced to rubble by bulldozers .
He says he does n't count the 100 dunams of farm land destroyed in the fighting ; bulldozers were used extensively by the Israeli army to " clean out " area where Hamas guerrillas were based .
" In my own home , I have plastic and nylon sheets on the windows , because all the glass broke in the bombing , and from where should I get glass ? " asks Khozendar .
He says that what does come in is brought through the tunnels from Egypt , a system that financially benefits Hamas , which collects taxes on the goods .
" We need glass for 5,000 houses , " says Khozendar .
Small quantities exist , but because of the extreme shortages , the prices are prohibitive for most .
A meter of glass was 45 shekels a few years ago ; now it 's 300 to 350 shekels .
" The amount needed does n't exist here , and this is one of the critical points to address if we are to rebuild and rehabilitate , " he says .
" We 're giving people hammers to break the cement and iron to break up the ruins and reuse it .
From the rubbish , we can get maybe 40 percent of our needs .
The other 60 percent has to be brought in , " he adds .
A delegation of 17 Gazan businessmen , who are slated to attend Monday 's conference , plans to announce that the Israeli army destroyed " 600- 700 factories , small industries , workshops , and business enterprises throughout the Gaza Strip , " Israel 's Haaretz newspaper reported .
Of 255 Gazan plants connected to the construction industry , 63 were hit directly , totaling an estimated $ 36 million in damages , the paper reported .
Eager to rebuild
When Mohammed Abed Rabbo decided to move his family from Beit Hanoun – the northeastern corner of Gaza – further south to East Jabaliya , he thought it would be safe .
Beit Hanoun , an agricultural area , was used by Palestinian militants to launch rockets at Israel .
But during the war , Mr. Abed Rabbo's house was largely – but not totally – destroyed .
After sheltering temporarily in a United Nations school during the worst of the fighting , Abed Rabbo and his family came back to the tattered remains of this neighborhood , and saw no choice but to move into the one mostly enclosed room that remained standing amid the wreckage .
Now he wonders how they 're going to rebuild .
" I was ready to move elsewhere in Gaza to live in better conditions , and now I 'd do anything to have my family in a better situation than this , " says Abed Rabbo , as his wife cooks an egg and tomato stew in a pan on an open fire on the floor .
Cooking gas is expensive but also pointless – their stove as well as their kitchen were destroyed – electricity for this war - torn neighborhood is long gone .
They cook and warm themselves by fires built from scavenged firewood , and have light at night from a small lantern .
" I would accept even a caravan , " he says , the local term for temporary , prefab unit that is about the size of a trailer home .
" I even tried to rent an apartment somewhere , but the problem is that there is n't one available in the whole of Gaza , " he explains , leaning on his cane .
He was wounded in a previous Israeli operation in northern Gaza in 2006 , when Israel was also after Hamas rocket launchers .
That was part of what drove him to move south , away from what he thought was the front line .
" Israel did this , but the Arab countries bear responsibility , too .
I blame Hamas also , because they 're not meeting the demands of the international community , " he says , reflecting on his situation and that of all Palestinians here .
" Without a national unity government , nothing will be rebuilt , even if it rains money on Gaza . "
' Humanitarian goods only '
Israel says that it will provide unfettered access to Gaza for basic assistance such as food and medical supplies .
But goods for heavy industry remain off limits for now .
" The policy is we 're facilitating humanitarian goods only , and anything beyond that will have to be discussed between Israel and the international community , " says Maj .
Peter Lerner , the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense 's committee on Gaza .
He says that during the last cease - fire with Hamas , which ended Dec. 19th , cement , piping , and gravel went into Gaza , and were used to build and reinforce tunnels and bunkers .
" This is something we 're not happy with obviously , and this is something we 're looking to avert in the future , and we 've said this to all the international organizations , " Major Lerner says .
At the Monday conference , the US is pledging $ 900 million , said secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who arrives in the region Sunday on her first trip to the Middle East for the Obama administration .
" The plan , as we will present it , is not only to restore Gaza to its pre-Israeli offensive state , but to rebuild the Palestinian economy as well , " said PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .
Hamas , meanwhile , is submitting a separate reconstruction plan to the conference .
The rival Palestinian factions relaunched talks last week in Cairo , but seemed to make little headway .
On Saturday , Mr. Abbas said that for Hamas to join a unity government , it must embrace a two - state solution and recognize Israel .
Hamas reiterated its refusal to do .
On Saturday , Steve Eves did in fact enter the record books with the launch of the largest model rocket ever : a 1:10 scale model of a Saturn V .
I 'd hoped to be there , as I mentioned in my original article , but events in my family life made that impossible .
So I have to make do , as do most people , with some of the very good video many people who did make it there took .
Of the many posted online , the one below is the best I 've seen — keep watching after the initial viewing of the launch for a slow - motion replay .
This is another good one , including up - close views of the recovered rocket from after the launch .

Great know how all dad 's must learn .
1. Measure Everything
Bartending is closer to baking than savory cooking ; it requires precise measurements for the final product to be perfect every time .
Most bartenders use counting or jiggers ; I recommend getting yourself a set of OXO angled mini-measuring cups for home bartending .
2. Control Dilution
The cocktail itself is defined as containing water , so water is an essential component of your drink .
However , there is not one texture or amount of dilution that is perfect , so you must taste and get used to the different amounts of dilution and texture for each drink .
Consider the rich , full - bodied texture of the brandy Alexander versus the taut , sleek body of the dry martini cocktail .
3. Taste , Taste , Taste
Good chefs taste their ingredients ; so do good bartenders .
Get to know the various spirits and mixers .
When an ingredient calls for two ounces of London dry gin , you still have a staggering array of product to choose from .
In the past I 've had friends get together and bring one bottle each .
Have a vodka , gin , or Bourbon party .
That way learning does n't cost an arm and a leg .
4. Use Lots of Ice
When you make a drink , do n't skimp on the ice .
This is where good , hard , dense cubes come in handy .
Load up your shaker or mixing glass to the brim with ice .
Making sure the cocktail is properly chilled is crucial to a well - made drink .
5. Garnishes Matter
Garnishes do n't belong on the side of the drink -- they belong in it .
They should be working for their board .
No lazy garnishes !
Use only fresh garnishes that will enhance the drink .
The Gin Rickey is a good example , the lime shell , once squeezed goes directly in the drink where the lime peel continues to flavor the drink .
6. Recipes Are a Baseline
I hate to say it , but some of my favorite bar books have recipes I find necessary to tweak and re-tweak before I 'm satisfied .
This requires a little extra research on your part ; fortunately , you get to taste each result !
Do n't take the recipe for face value .
7. Muddle Softly
You know the saying , " Walk softly and carry a big stick " ?
Try this : muddle softly and carry a big stick .
You need n't muddle limes , mango , or mint with such intensity that you obliterate the fruit or herb .
In fact , you 'll often draw bitter results .
You only need to start the process .
Shake and stir , and the alcohol itself will draw out the flavor .
8. Use Fresh Juice
This goes for all culinary endeavors -- the fresher the ingredient , the better , more articulated the flavor .
Do n't believe me ?
Buy Roses Lime , Santa Cruz Organic 100 % lime juice , and Mr. & Mrs. T Sour Mix , and taste them side by side with fresh lime juice .
You 'll be astounded at the difference .
9. Sweeten it Yourself
Everyone knows that the bright red color in grenadine is the result of the marriage of unnatural and unholy elements .
Try making your own !
Buy 100 percent pomegranate juice and sugar .
Mix two - to - one sugar - to - juice by boiling the juice and adding sugar .
You can create many different sweeteners , including cane sugar and Demerara sugar , each with boiled water at equal parts .
This will steer you away from any mixture that starts with " high fructose corn syrup . "
10 . Shaken and Stirred
The principal methods to blend cocktail ingredients are to shake or stir .
The rule of thumb that any bartender worth a shake of salt ( no pun intended ) will tell you is to stir liquors and shake juices , sugar , and egg whites .
If the cocktail calls for two or three liquors , take the Manhattan as a prime example : it should be stirred .
If it calls for juices and egg whites , like a Pisco Sour , shake vigorously to combine the ingredients .

The car — the actual car — that unseated the Bugatti Veyron to become the fastest production car on the planet is for sale on eBay , and the winning bidder not only gets an insanely powerful sports car but a nifty commemorative watch and key fob .
Shelby SuperCars is making room in the garage and selling Ultimate Aero chassis No TT - 02 , the car Chuck Bigelow drove through the traps at an average of 256.18 mph on Sept. 13 , 2007 .
That eclipsed the Veyron by 3.63 mph to become just the 26th car in history to hold the Guinness world production speed record .
Shelby calls TT - 02 " a piece of automotive history " and says " it is sure to remain valuable and sought - after by future generations . "
Bidding stood at $ 155,000 when this was posted , but the reserve had n't been met .
Given that the Ultimate Aero costs something north of $ 600,000 , the reserve on this record - setting ride is probably in the seven - figure ballpark .
That kind of money gets you more than a 1,183 - horsepower car , though .
Place the winning bid and you also get a framed Guinness World Records certificate for your wall , a commemorative watch and key fob and the wheels and tires used during the record run for your ... whatever .
We 'd probably make them into a coffee table .
TT - 02 has 1,345 miles on the odometer .
Power comes from a 387 - cubic - inch V - 8 with twin turbochargers putting out 14 PSI of boost .
Interior appointments include a 10 - speaker stereo system , a DVD player and , of course , a navi system to help you find a few places to open 'er up .
Before making its record - setting run , Shelby SuperCars tested the car in the wind tunnel at the NASA Langley Research Center — that 's where the photo above was snapped — and determined the car would be aerodynamically stable up to 273 mph .
That 's purely academic though , as it seems highly unlikely anyone would actually hit that speed .
Twenty - six cars have held the record .
Ferrari leads the way with six titles , followed by Mercedes - Benz with five .

The company did n't provide anything bigger .

Your company calls me repeatedly throughout the day , on average about 10 - 15 times a day .
I have to continuously block numbers although I have asked to be placed on the do not call list .
They call from new numbers each time , and they all begin with the area code of where I live .
I answer the calls because I am not sure if this is an important call from my job , doctor , family , etc. or just another call from your business .
It has been extremely frustrating to deal with on a daily basis and I wish it would end when I ask to be placed on the do not call list .
I 'm not looking to extend the warranty of my vehicle and I have expressed this to your call service reps numerous times .

A row has broken out over allegations of antisemitism at the New York Times , America 's most vaunted name in journalism and a newspaper with a large Jewish readership .
The storm centres on a column about Jews in Iran written by New York Times journalist Roger Cohen and a cartoon attacking the recent war in Gaza .
The newspaper , and Cohen in particular , has been accused of being too critical of Israel and an apologist for Iran and its leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Cohen 's column was written from Iran about the country 's small Jewish minority .
His piece acknowledged the difficulties the group experienced and portrayed them as part of an Iranian society that he said was more tolerant , democratic and sophisticated than many American critics allowed .
Such sentiments might seem uncontroversial , but in America no one touching on issues around Israel or antisemitism escapes close scrutiny .
Cohen was attacked by Jewish writers and bloggers .
The Jerusalem Post dubbed him " misled " , while the Atlantic Monthly called him " credulous " .
Others went much further .
" The Nazis had Theresienstadt , their ' model ' concentration camp used to ' persuade ' the gullible that Jews and others who aroused the ire of the Nazis were being treated well .
Would Roger Cohen have had no problem portraying that favourably as well ? " fumed writer Ed Lasky on the American Thinker website .
Cohen said he was stunned by the vehemence of the response , an impression exacerbated when he visited exiled Iranian Jews in California and was abusively heckled .
" I was surprised at the anger and intensity of the reaction ... I expected a reaction but did not expect it to blow up into a whole furore , " Cohen said .
Perhaps part of the reason for the intensity of the attack is the fact that he is Jewish himself .
" I think it 's partly my name .
The ' self - hating Jew ' things can come to the surface in some of the responses , " he said .
Another reason is that the column appeared in the Times , which many media experts hardly see as a fierce critic of Israel , given its home audience .
" As soon as I read the column I thought a lot of people would be unhappy , " said Jack Lule , a journalism professor at Lehigh University .
The debate over Cohen 's piece came as the Times published Pat Oliphant 's cartoon , which shows a headless figure goose - stepping and pushing a snarling Star of David in front of it .
The figure is herding a woman carrying a child labelled Gaza to the edge of a cliff .
The cartoon also appeared in the Washington Post , Slate and other publications .
It caused instant outrage among Jewish groups .
" It is cartoons like this that inspired millions of people to hate in the 1930s and help set the stage for the Nazi genocide , " said a statement from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre .
A woman has been remanded in custody accused of breaching an Asbo banning her from being noisy during sex .
Neighbours complained of hearing Caroline Cartwright , 48 , groaning and her bed banging against the wall at her home in Washington , Wearside .
Earlier this month she was given a four - year Asbo banning her from making excessive noise anywhere in England .
But she appeared in court on Monday , charged with three breaches of her Asbo in just 10 days .
She was remanded in custody until 5 May .
Cartwright was convicted of five breaches of a noise abatement notice on 17 April and fined £ 515 .
But Houghton le Spring Magistrates '
Court heard police arrested her on 18 April , on 22 April and again on 26 April , after reports from neighbours she was flouting the ban with her husband Steve .
Prosecutor Claire Ward said neighbours complained to police about early morning noises including shouting and groaning coming from the Cartwrights ' home in Hall Road , Concord , Washington .
Cartwright elected to be tried by jury and the case will be transferred to Newcastle Crown Court at a later date .
Planning for GNOME 3.0

Subject : Planning for GNOME 3.0
Date : Thu , 2 Apr 2009 13:17:10 +0200
During the first few months of 2008 , a few Release Team members discussed here and there about the state of GNOME .
This was nothing official , and it could actually have been considered as some friends talking together about things they deeply care about .
There were thoughts that GNOME could stay with the 2.x branch for a very long time given our solid development methods , but that it was not the future that our community wants to see happening .
Because of lack of excitement .
Because of lack of vision .
Slowly , a plan started to emerge .
It evolved , changed , was trimmed a bit , made more solid .
We started discussing with a few more people , got more feedback .
And then , at GUADEC , the Release Team proposed an initial plan to the community that would lead the project to GNOME 3.0 .
Quite some time passed ; actually , too much time passed because too many people were busy with other things .
But it 's never too late to do the right thing , so let 's really be serious about GNOME 3.0 now !
Let 's first diverge a bit and discuss the general impression that GNOME is lacking a vision .
If you look closely at our community , it'd be wrong to say that people are lacking a vision ; but the project as a whole does indeed have this issue .
What we are missing is people blessing one specific vision and making it official , giving goals to the community so we can all work together in the same direction .
In the pre -2.x days , the community accepted as a whole one specific vision , and such an explicit blessing was n't needed .
But during the 2.x cycle , with our six months schedules , it appeared that everything ( community , development process , etc. ) was just working very well , and as the vision got more and more fulfilled , the long - term plans became less important as we focused on polishing our desktop .
But we 've now reached a point where our next steps should be moving to another level , and those next steps require important decisions .
This is part of what the Release Team should do .
Please note that Release Team members do n't have to be the ones who have the vision ; we " just " have to be the voice of the community .
( As a sidenote , the roadmap process [ 1 ] that we tried to re-establish two years ago was a first attempt to fix this .
Unfortunately , it turned out that we were missing the most important side of things : a project - wide roadmap .
This is because a collection of individual roadmaps is n't enough to create a project - wide roadmap . )
So let 's go to the core topic and discuss what the GNOME 3.0 effort should be .
We propose the following list of areas to focus our efforts on : - Revamp our User Experience - Streamlining of the Platform - Promotion of GNOME
There are also other potential areas that are worth exploring if there is enough interest from the community .
Can you believe it ?
This is so great !!
Morrison & Foerster are representing TomTom in a new patent infringement lawsuit TomTom has just filed against Microsoft !
I love covering their cases .
Patent law is usually soooo boring to me , but these guys will keep me awake , and no doubt if I pay attention , I 'll learn a lot .
I 'd already decided to cover the lawsuit Microsoft filed against TomTom in Seattle last month , and we 'll cover this one too .
Eventually one or both sides will probably file a motion to consolidate the two cases , either in Washington State , where Microsoft filed , or in Virginia , where TomTom has just filed its Complaint [ PDF ] .
But they could also just lope along on two separate tracks .
So far , Microsoft 's statement , on both TechFlash , linked above , and in part on Bloomberg , indicates they want to stay on their home turf : " We are reviewing TomTom 's filing , which we have just received , " said Horacio Gutierrez , Microsoft deputy general counsel , in a statement released by the company today .
" As has been the case for more than a year , we remain committed to a licensing solution , although we will continue to press ahead with the complaints we initiated in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington and the International Trade Commission . " [ Update :
If , like me , you were wondering why Virginia , this article explains the advantages to filing in what was the first state to be called The Rocket Docket .
I assume TomTom figures Microsoft might want to drag things out , since it can afford to do that and TomTom less so , and Virginia apparently handles patent cases very , very fast . ]
What does it mean ?
It means TomTom intends to fight and fight hard .
Microsoft always does that .
So , it 'll be a real dogfight .
And we 're probably going to get to see some fabulous lawyering on both sides .
Not to make anybody nervous or anything , but it 's exciting to see lawyers who really know what they are doing .
Sidley Austin represents Microsoft .
That 's the firm where Michelle and Barack Obama met , if you recall , when he was a summer associate there .
She did antitrust law there .
He turned down an offer to work there .
We 're going to be seeing some really good lawyering .
That will be the fun part .
The hard part will be that they 'll know a lot more than we do , and some of what happens may fly over our heads , but I 'll do my best to find legal commentary for us for those parts .
This dispute now has three fronts , actually , because Microsoft filed a complaint with the ITC , too .
Here 's a blog that specializes on ITC issues , the ITC Blog .
Whew .
Because I know very little about the ITC , except that I know it 's not unusual to file there too when you file a patent infringement case .
And I know you file there to ask that the ITC issue an order to ban importation of something that you allege infringes your patents , or for a cease and desist order .
One recent entry on the blog explains how the ITC interfaces with the district court , or in this case two of them .
What happens , for example , if the ITC reaches a decision before Virginia or Washington State does ?
Here 's the answer , " Did You Know . . . Determinations Of Patent Issues At The ITC Are For Purposes Of Section 337 Only And Do Not Have Res Judicata Effect ? " OK .
Kidding .
I just wanted to demonstrate that they go deeply into ITC stuff , in other words , and they are lawyers writing like lawyers .
But we can peek inside , and I 'll try to explain in our language here and there , as I can .
In this case , I do n't need to much , because here 's how the entry explains what Section 337 means , etc. : Patent owners often simultaneously file suits in both the ITC and district court on the same patent ( s ) .
If an ITC investigation is ongoing , an accused infringer can request , as a matter of right , a stay of the parallel district court action under 28 U.S.C. § 1659 .
Even if the accused infringer does not request a stay , the ITC investigation typically will conclude before ( and sometimes well before ) a trial in district court .
After the ITC issues a final determination on infringement , validity , and / or enforceability of a U.S. patent , one might think this ruling would be binding on a district court .
This is not the case , however , because the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to ITC determinations concerning patents .
The doctrine of res judicata , which is also referred to as claim preclusion , means  the thing has been decided . 
The doctrine is rooted in the principle that once a competent court has rendered its final judgment on a matter , that judgment has a conclusive effect upon subsequent litigation between the parties regarding the same cause of action .
However the Federal Circuit has held that ITC findings neither purport to be , nor can they be , regarded as binding interpretations of the U.S. patent laws in particular factual contexts .
Therefore , it seems clear that any disposition of a Commission action by a federal court should not have a res judicata or collateral estoppel effect in cases before such courts . 
Tandon Corp. v. U.S.I.T.C. , 831 F.2d 1017 , 1018 ( Fed. Cir. 1987 ) .
The reason often cited for lack of a preclusive effect for ITC holdings is that Congress intended the ITC to be primarily responsible for administrating the trade laws and not the patent laws which is specifically referenced in the legislative history of Section 337 .
Texas Instruments v. Cypress Semiconductor Corp. , 90 F.3d 1558 ( Fed. Cir. 1996 ) .
I do n't dare quote any more than that , since it 's written by four lawyers and all .
But if you hop on over there , you 'll find that they go on to explain that while a judge may be influenced somewhat by an ITC finding , he or she does n't have to follow the decision there .
They say the winner at the ITC can use the decision as " persuasive evidence " in district court , meaning the judge there will find it useful to consider in a patent case .
But it 's not like a decision by the US Supreme Court , which all lower courts are supposed to follow .
It also does n't mean the ITC has no effect , since it can ban importation , for example , as a trade matter .
Here 's the Texas Instruments ruling , where the court of appeals affirmed that there was no patent infringement by Cypress even though the ITC had earlier found that there was .
It 's a ruling you will like , because some of you worry about juries who may not grasp technical issues .
The jury found for the plaintiff , but the judge threw out their verdict , and the appeals court reviewed and agreed with him :
In conclusion , this case has presented a fairly uncommon situation of a trial judge overriding a jury verdict in a patent case , following an earlier ITC decision on some of the same subject matter .
Although we have been mindful of the deference accorded to a jury on fact findings , as the trial judge surely was , we have felt it necessary to affirm the district court 's judgment .
The trial judge did a careful and thorough job of analyzing the case .
His factual and legal analyses fully support his decision .
He observed the jury and believed that it lacked a grasp of the issues before it .
The judge was convinced that the jury failed to meaningfully deliberate on the case .
So you 'll be relieved to know that can happen .
Here 's another paragraph from the ruling , which will show you why I find patent cases so hard to follow sometimes :
TI asserts that even accepting the court 's claim construction , it presented substantial evidence to support a finding of literal infringement .
TI argues that during the encapsulation processes used by the defendants , the semiconductor device was supported by the " die pad , " which acted like a " conductor . "
TI relies on evidence that allegedly demonstrates that , during encapsulation , the semiconductor device was mechanically attached to the die pad with an electrically conductive adhesive ; in turn , the die pad was connected through the lead frame to an external ground , forming a conductive , continuous current path from the die to ground .
According to TI , this current path protected the die from static electricity during assembly and encapsulation .
TI contends that the testimony of its expert witnesses supports this theory .
Sigh .
But I 'm committed , and no matter what Microsoft writes or TomTom , I 'll be reading the sentences as often as I must to get from the beginning of the sentences to the very end , without mind - wandering detours .
No doubt you guys will help me , because you will understand the tech so much better , and your lips will curl if I nod off mid-sentence or write that there was no protection of the die from static electricity during assembly when there actually was .
So here goes .
Section 337 .
I 'll let the ITC explain what that is : Section 337 investigations conducted by the U.S. International Trade Commission most often involve claims regarding intellectual property rights , including allegations of patent infringement and trademark infringement by imported goods .
Both utility and design patents , as well as registered and common law trademarks , may be asserted in these investigations .
Other forms of unfair competition involving imported products , such as infringement of registered copyrights , mask works or boat hull designs , misappropriation of trade secrets or trade dress , passing off , and false advertising , may also be asserted .
Additionally , antitrust claims relating to imported goods may be asserted .
The primary remedy available in Section 337 investigations is an exclusion order that directs Customs to stop infringing imports from entering the United States .
In addition , the Commission may issue cease and desist orders against named importers and other persons engaged in unfair acts that violate Section 337 .
Expedited relief in the form of temporary exclusion orders and temporary cease and desist orders may also be available in certain exceptional circumstances .
Section 337 investigations , which are conducted pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1337 and the Administrative Procedure Act , include trial proceedings before administrative law judges and review by the Commission .
So a 337 investigation relates to unfair practices , most often related to IP , I gather .
Here 's an example of an exclusion order , related to logic boards that the ITC said could n't be imported to the US from France any more .
Hmm .
I wonder what exactly happens if the ITC issues an exclusion order , based on finding patent infringement , and then a district court refuses to find patent infringement ?
Does the ITC back down ?
I presume so , following some sort of established procedure .
Here are the ITC Rules .
I notice the Rules on page 80 say the ITC can back down , modify , or change its mind based on new info brought to its attention .
And the FAQ , on page 32 of the PDF , says that you can appeal a Commission order to the federal court of appeals , so that 's the answer .
I see the President has to sign off on any Commission orders too , and he can negate them if he thinks the order is n't good policy .
That 's on page 31 of the FAQ .
I guess that 's why the defendants often ask for a stay of the ITC matter , to try to avoid intersection crashes between the ITC and the courts .
But clearly when it comes to patent infringement , the courts are the main tent , not the ITC .
There 's a page on ITC 's website called Section 337 Publications , but they use that word in their own way , to mean their decisions in their investigations .
They have names like " Certain NOR and NAND Flash Memory Devices and Products Containing the Same . "
Here 's the law , 19 U.S.C. Section 1337 [ PDF ] .
They have a list of recent complaints , including Microsoft 's against TomTom , Docket No : 2654 .
The status of the Microsoft letter requesting an investigation by the ITC says , " Status : Pending Institution " .
The Rules , on page 4 , indicate that " institution " is a term of art at the ITC , and it means they agree to investigate , and you find out by means of a notice in the Federal Register .
That has n't happened yet .
No doubt it will , though .
My brain hurts .
That 's enough for now .
But first , here 's the other case the ITC Blog mentioned , Tandon Corp. v. U.S.I.T.C. , which was a case where the decision of noninfringement by the ITC was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , the same folks that gave us In Re Bilski .
Judge Pauline Newman wrote the decision .
So , what 's the bottom line ?
TomTom is not going to just roll over and settle .
Or beg .
Sweden is set to send three of its naval vessels to the Gulf of Aden to help in the international effort to fight the scourge of piracy that has engulfed the seas off of Somalia .
The government voted overwhelmingly to support the ongoing UN mission , code - named Operation Atalanta .
Sweden will be sending two corvettes and one support ship along with a security force , the government said in a statement .
The Chinese news agency Xinhua reports that Sweden ’s participation in the UN mission will start before the middle of 2009 , and last four months at the longest .
Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt said in the statement that “ Sweden ’s participation is a response to the UN request for protection and security for the deliveries of food aid to Somalia from the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
In addition , the operation will help combat the increasing number of acts of piracy off the coast of the country . ”
The EU officially started its anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden on 8 December 2008 .
This marked the first time the 27 - nation union embarked on a joint naval mission .
Currently , more than 90 per cent of all WFP aid to Somalia is delivered by sea .
Continued interruption by the pirates could spell disaster for the people of this nation , which is now considered the world ’s most lawless .
A bipartisan group of senators predicted Tuesday that Congress was ready to pass legislation to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba .
Removing the travel ban would produce a burst of tourism , create thousands of jobs and generate as much as $ 1.6 billion in business a year , an independent research group said .
A Senate news conference Tuesday and one in the House set for Thursday reflect new attempts to lift the travel ban , a key part of the U.S. trade embargo imposed after Fidel Castro took power in Havana in 1959 .
The broader trade embargo would remain in place .
Sponsors said the bill would free Americans to travel to the one place in the world they ca n’t go and encourage Cubans to push for democratic reforms by exposing them to new people and information .

“ Punishing the American people in our effort to somehow deal a blow to the Castro government has not made any sense at all , ” said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) .
“ At long last , this policy , which has been in place for 50 years and has not worked , will finally be removed . ”
Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) strongly opposes the measure .
He warned that flooding Cuba with tourists and dollars would only sustain the Castro regime .
“ Having tourists on Cuban beaches is not going to change the equation of how to create the opportunity for democratic institutions in Cuba , ” Martinez said .
“ It ’s only going to enrich those who are oppressing the Cuban people and provide them with more economic means with which to do that . ”
Dorgan and fellow sponsors sense an opportunity to change U.S. policy now that President Obama has replaced George W. Bush in the White House and Castro has turned power over to his brother , Raul Castro .

Obama has ordered a review of U.S. policy on Cuba and last month loosened restrictions to let Cuban Americans visit relatives .
Journalists can travel to Cuba , as can people on humanitarian missions .
On one side of the debate in Congress are liberal Democrats , Republican free - traders and farm - state members of both parties who seek a wider market for food sales .
Unfettered travel would make it easier to sell more products , they contend .
They are backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Senate sponsors include Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) and Michael B. Enzi ( R - Wyo . ) .
House sponsors include Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) and Jeff Flake ( R - Ariz . ) .

On the other side are Cuban Americans and conservatives , who remain alarmed by a communist island 90 miles from the Florida Keys .
If travel limits were lifted , about 3 million Americans would visit Cuba each year , according to a 2002 study by the Brattle Group , economic consultants in Washington .
The increase in air travel , cruises and a ripple effect through the travel industry would produce $ 1.2 billion to $ 1.6 billion a year , the group estimated , creating as many as 23,000 jobs .
Martinez accused the Chamber of Commerce and business interests of seeking profits at the expense of freedom and democracy .

“ They are simply acting from an economic advantage standpoint . ”

Experts Debate Pandemic Potential of Swine Flu A top CDC official says concern over the outbreaks has grown since Thursday .
April 24 , 2009  --
A top federal health official said the government 's concern over the swine flu outbreaks in the United States and Mexico has grown since Thursday -- and a handful of influenza experts worry the deadly , never - before - seen hybrid strain may spur a pandemic .
Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that health officials confirmed yet another U.S. case of swine flu in California today , bringing the total number of Americans infected with the disease to eight .
Though it is still too early to say for certain whether a swine flu pandemic is possible or likely , the cases , all of which have occurred in California and Texas , have aroused concerns among the public , Besser acknowledged .
" We are worried as well , " he said .
" Our concern has grown since yesterday in light of what we 've come to know since then . "
Thus far , the first seven Americans found to have contracted the new variant have recovered , which Thursday led health officials to urge calm while the investigation into the virus continued .
Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , had said during a Thursday afternoon press conference that the strain did not " [ look ] like a very severe influenza .
...
We do n't think this is time for major concern around the country . "
The sentiments were echoed by Canada 's Dr. Michael Gardam , director of infectious disease prevention and control at Ontario 's public health agency , in a Thursday night interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation .
Moreover , the World Health Organization has not yet made a change to the pandemic threat level -- the established worldwide barometer for pandemic threat .
Still , Mexican officials reported that what is believed to be the same mutant strain of swine flu already has killed at least 16 people in Mexico , and possibly as many as 61 .
Swine Flu Outbreaks a ' Serious Situation '
John Barry , author of " The Great Influenza , " said he believes there is a chance that the infections signal the beginning of the next pandemic -- a global disease outbreak that occurs when a new virus emerges for which there is little or no immunity in the human population , begins to cause serious illness and then spreads easily person - to - person worldwide .
" Obviously , this is an extremely serious situation , " he said , adding that the real determinant as to how dangerous this virus will become lies in how easily it is spread from person to person .
" If the virus is halfway efficient at that transmission , we have the next pandemic , " he said .
" No way it can be contained in a place like Mexico City , and it 's already in California , and probably some places -- if not every place -- in between . "
Barry is not the only one to harbor such concerns .
" If 16 to 60 out of about 800 cases in Mexico have died , then this is indeed a serious public health threat deserving of the full attention of the U.S. public health infrastructure , " said Robert Garry , a microbiologist at Tulane University .
And Dr. Martin Blaser , chairman of the Department of Medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center , agreed the situation is serious .
" This is worrisome , because it is a swine , avian , human recombinant ; it involves people who do not have any obvious exposure to swine , " he said .
He further noted that the patterns of spread so far point toward the possibility that the virus may have been spread through human - to - human contact .
" It could just represent the results of improved surveillance by the CDC -- they have stepped up flu surveillance -- or it could be a low level transmission of a newly emerging strain , " he said .
" Or [ it ] could possibly be the start of a new epidemic . "
Not Time for Panic , Some Argue
Despite the prevailing concern over the swine flu cases , other infectious disease experts believe that it is not quite time to consider this virus a major public health threat .
First of all , it would not be the first time the country has encountered a pandemic .
In the 20th century alone there were three pandemics of influenza .
The worst was the 1918 influenza pandemic , which caused at least 675,000 U.S. deaths and up to 50 million deaths worldwide .
The 1957 influenza pandemic caused at least 70,000 U.S. deaths and 1 million to 2 million deaths worldwide , while the 1968 influenza pandemic caused about 34,000 U.S. deaths and 700,000 deaths worldwide -- only about as many deaths as a normal flu season .
Some Protections Already in Place to Curb Swine Flu
Flu experts also point out that several conditions must all be satisfied at once for a full - blown pandemic to occur .
" [ There ] is a very low probability [ that this is will be a ] high - consequence scenario , " said Dr. Peter Katona , associate professor of clinical medicine at The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" The potential is there to do great harm , but many factors -- season of the year , level of hygiene , robustness of the virus -- have to come together for the ' perfect storm ' to happen . "
Moreover , some experts pointed out that the increased diagnosis of these cases of swine influenza in humans was an accidental result of increased CDC flu surveillance .
Therefore , there was no cause for concern about the new influenza strain before the CDC accidentally identified it .
" It is of note that the two cases in California were ' accidental ' findings , as both infected children were treated in facilities that carried out clinical studies , " said Nicole Baumgarth , chair of the graduate group in Immunology at the University of California at Davis .
" Identification of the virus was done therefore by ' looking harder ' rather than because of clear suspicion of influenza .
...
Increased surveillance will result in increased diagnosis . "
Another advantage that health officials enjoy is the fact that while the virus appears to be resistant to at least two weapons in the antiviral arsenal -- amantadine and rimantadine -- it is still susceptible to the popular flu drugs oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) and zanamivir ( Relenza ) .
Besser said that scientists are also already starting work on a preliminary vaccine for the illness .
And he said the country is prepared to deal with the threat of a pandemic - level virus should the situation escalate .
" The level of planning that has taken place in this country is unprecedented , " he said , adding that preparations in recent years would allow U.S. health officials to respond to a pandemic threat far more effectively than in the past .
Disease Agencies Mobilize Against Swine Flu
Mexico , meanwhile , is taking no chances .
A government order Friday closed Mexico City private and public schools , from pre-school through university level .
The Associated Press also reported that Friday afternoon , the country 's government closed museums , libraries and state - run theaters in Mexico City in an effort to curb the outbreak .
Besser said that U.S. health officials are currently working with their Mexican counterparts to learn more about the strain , but he said there was much more to be done .
" While we are now working with health officials in Mexico , we are very early on in those efforts , " he said .
" We need more complete lab analyses and better understanding with regard to the number of people experiencing influenza - like illness in Mexico . "
He added that the CDC has already sent a team to California to learn more and will likely send a team to Texas as well .
Thus far , the CDC has issued no travel restrictions to any of the locales .
Protecting Yourself From Infection
If there is one point on which all infectious disease experts agree , it is that this flu strain should be monitored closely .
More importantly , the public should also take on increased hygienic measures to avoid contracting the virus .
The CDC currently recommends that you cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze , wash your hands often with soap and water , avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth , and try to avoid close contact with sick people .
The CDC also suggests that if one does contract an illness , they should stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to avoid spreading the infection .
If you develop an illness with fever and respiratory symptoms and you live in or near a region in which the virus has been identified , the CDC recommends that you immediately seek attention from your health care provider to determine whether further influenza testing is needed .
" Good nutrition that promotes host defense and control of any underlying diseases that may make someone high risk ... is also important , " said Dr. Len Horovitz , pulmonary specialist at the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .
Those who wish to learn more about the government 's actions in response to the swine flu cases can access the CDC 's swine flu page online at http://cdc.gov/flu/swine.
Alternatively , the CDC has also set up a toll - free information hotline : 1-800 - CDC-INFO .

The keepers ' bravery was praised after they dragged the 32 - year - old out of a moat for the animals .
They had to shove the animal out of the way after one of four polar bears dived into the water and attacked her , inflicting serious bites to her legs and arms .
The MPAA is n't known for wasting opportunities to obtain information about BitTorrent sites and their users .
In 2005 the MPAA paid around $ 15,000 to a hacker who obtained emails from TorrentSpy and The Pirate Bay .
The case was heard in court and won by the MPAA , but this decision will soon be appealed .
In an attempt to dig up dirt on the owner of TorrentSpy and the people behind The Pirate Bay , the MPAA hired a “ hacker ” , better known as Robert Anderson , to steal e-mail correspondence and trade secrets .
Anderson , a former associate of TorrentSpy owner Justin Bunnel , configured the TorrentSpy mail server to copy and forward all of the site ’s email to his own Gmail account .
The 34 pages of information he gathered was then sold to the MPAA for $ 15,000 .
TorrentSpy ’s owner later sued the MPAA , arguing that they had spied on him illegally , but this case was lost .
The court ruled that the MPAA did not technically intercept them under the WireTap Act , although jurisprudence would suggest otherwise .
TorrentSpy owner Justin Bunnel told TorrentFreak that he has filed a brief at the Court of Appeals and that the MPAA is expected to do the same in the near future .
From then on it can take up to a year before the appeal is heard in court .
TorrentSpy is supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) that described the earlier decision as a “ dangerous attempt to circumvent privacy laws . ”
Indeed , if upheld the ruling will basically legalize the unauthorized copying of other people ’s emails , which raises serious privacy concerns .
The Pirate Bay , who were also the target of MPAA spying activities , have not taken any action .
Instead , spokesman Peter Sunde laughed it away .
“ I think it ’s amazingly funny if the MPAA bought information like that , expensively , and against the US law .
Only proves their stupidity and that they have no case , ” he told Torrent Freak earlier .
For the MPAA , losing the appeal might have some serious repercussions , especially for MPAA President Dan Glickman .
Glickman is already highly criticized among Hollywood insiders for his lack of effectiveness .
Since his contract renewal is due around the same time the hacker case appeal will be decided on , his job is on the line .
When discussing lsof and open files a few weeks ago , I also mentioned that lsof - i will show you information about which IP sockets are open .
lsof is a handy way to check for security problems or keep an eye on how your machines are interacting with the wider internet .
This can be useful in checking for security problems or just to keep an eye on how much your machines are interacting with the wider internet .
Here 's a little sample output :
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME dhclient 2242 root 6u IPv4 6110 UDP *: bootpc cupsd 2928 root 1u IPv4 260191390 TCP localhost : ipp ( LISTEN ) mysqld 5763 mysql 4u IPv4 187454609 TCP thisserver.example.com:38530->thatserver.example.com:ldaps ( CLOSE_WAIT ) sshd 17005 root 3u IPv6 264275196 TCP thisserver.example.com:ssh->thatserver.example.com:53043 ( ESTABLISHED )
ps -l 5763
mysql
/ proc/5763 /
You 'll quite often see two reports from a single command , one for TCP and one for UDP .
The PID and user is shown for each IP socket , so if you see something suspicious , you can investigate further ( e.g. , withto get more information on theprocess here , or by looking at ) .
For a real - time look at what 's being opened where , try watch lsof - i ( hit Ctrl - C to exit ) .
To check out who 's connecting to your web server , specify the port with lsof - i :80 : You 'll get a list that shows which IP addresses or hosts are looking at your web server right now .
You can also check connections to a particular host with lsof -i@hostname.example.com
( or give the IP address instead ) .
Learning to Invest with Mutual Funds
If you have a small account or if you are just learning to invest , you should consider investing with mutual funds .
A good mutual fund offers access to professional money managers and also allows you to diversify your holdings across multiple asset classes .
Once you feel you understand how to evaluate businesses and stocks and have enough capital to diversify into asset classes that you want , than you may consider buying stocks on your own and build your own unique portfolio .
Even seasoned investors with significant investments may still want to use mutual funds as part of their portfolio as it saves time by outsourcing the research and due diligence of stocks to a professional mutual fund manager .
In practice , however , you still need to perform detailed due diligence on the mutual fund that you are considering buying to understand its investment philosophy , managers , fees , performance and its fit into your asset allocation and investment strategy .
Besides , many investment accounts available today ( such as 401Ks , 529 plans , etc ) , offer mutual funds as the only available investment options , and therefore , it is important to understand mutual funds and how to invest in them .
We will present the basics of investing in mutual funds in a set of articles that will cover all aspects of investing in a mutual fund .
Please be sure to check back often for new articles in the series .
What is a mutual fund ?
At its very basic , a mutual fund is a way of pooling investments from many different investors to invest according to a definite strategy .
Typically the strategy of the mutual fund is outlined in its Prospectus .
Every mutual fund investor should review the mutual fund prospectus of the fund they are looking to invest in .
Wide array of strategies are available today .
Investors can choose from bond mutual funds of different durations ( short term , intermediate term , long term ) , stock mutual funds of all types and flavor ( value , growth , small / medium / large cap , sector specific funds , income funds , long only funds , short only funds , global funds , international funds , country or region focused funds , etc ) , blend funds , commodity funds , real estate funds , index funds and so on .
The concept of pooling investments from many investors allows a fund to leverage a large capital base to make investments in a diversified set of securities .
Most funds available to retail investors have low minimum investments that allows an investor with small capital to invest .
An investor in a mutual fund is issued shares of the mutual fund .
Every share of a mutual fund is equivalent , meaning they all represent a portion of the total assets of the mutual funds equally .
Types of mutual funds
There are essentially two main types of mutual funds in US today ( similar concepts exist in most other countries globally ) , Open Ended Mutual Fund and Closed - Ended Mutual Fund .
Exchange Traded Funds ( or ETFs ) have recently emerged as a new kind of investment fund that essentially combines the features of an Open - Ended mutual fund and a Closed - Ended mutual fund .
An Open - Ended fund is a mutual fund where new shares are issued as new investments come in .
Conversely , as investors redeem their shares , the redeemed shares are retired .
This means that there is no secondary market for the shares of an open - ended mutual fund .
All buy and sell transactions of these funds are ultimately conducted with the mutual fund itself ( even though the funds may be sold through brokers and advisers ) .
A new investment in these mutual funds mean that the mutual fund manager may use the new money to buy additional shares of the investments it carries .
Similarly , a redemption often means that the mutual fund manager may need to sell some of the investments to meet the redemption request .
An open ended mutual fund is always quoted and transacted at its Net Asset Value ( NAV ) , which is the market value of all its investments on a per share basis .
Typically mutual fund NAVs are revised once each trading day ( although there may be cases where the NAVs may be revised less often , mostly if the underlying investments are illiquid ) .
A Closed - Ended fund has a fixed number of shares that it issues once when the fund launches .
The launch of the fund creates the capital base for the fund that it can use for investments .
The fund may choose to do additional issues or even buy back shares at a later date .
Once the fund has launched , its shares can be bought and sold in the secondary market .
The shares of a closed - ended funds are continually priced just like stocks and may be higher than the NAV ( selling at a premium to NAV ) or they may be lower than the NAV ( selling at a discount to NAV ) .
A good rule of thumb when buying a closed - ended mutual fund is to always buy it at a discount to its NAV ( A quick tip : if you use Yahoo Finance to look up the quotes on a closed - ended fund with ticker ABC , you can in most cases find the NAV of this fund using the ticker XABCX , i.e , by adding Xs before and after the ticker symbol ) .
Closed - ended funds are legally a closed - end companies in US and are similar to Investment Trusts in UK or Listed Investment Companies in Australia .
Exchange Traded Funds have recently emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional mutual funds .
ETFs combine the best features of Open - Ended mutual funds and Closed - Ended mutual funds .
ETFs trade on exchanges just like a stock at a price very close to its NAV .
This is accomplished by letting retail investors trade ETFs in the secondary market and at the same time allowing authorized participants ( mainly large institutional investors ) the ability to buy or redeem shares of ETFs from the fund manager directly in exchange for a basket of underlying securities .
This arbitrage opportunity for the institutional investors helps maintain the ETF price close to its NAV .
ETFs were originally created to track indexes but can now also be actively managed .
Exchange Traded Funds are an attractive alternative to traditional mutual funds as they typically have low cost , tax efficiency and high liquidity .
In future articles we will cover each of these fund types in greater detail , including some tips on how to select these funds for investment .
In the meantime , here are some excellent resources on mutual funds available around the net .

Editor ’s Note :
This is a guest post from AoM reader and friend Cameron Ming .
Cameron is an award - winning barbequer and griller here in Oklahoma .
One of the closest links between man and beast is our love for meat .
But what should separate us from mere animals is the manner in which that meat is cooked .
Sadly , just because you ’re human does n’t mean you ’re eating your meat any better than a beast .
Grilling a steak truly is like art : lots of people can draw , but not everyone is Michelangelo .
Most of us will never make masterpieces at home , but getting close is much more simple than you think .
Properly grilling a steak will separate you from the majority of the guys on the block and might even impress the ladies .
But more important than showing up the fellas , you owe it to yourself to prepare the meat in the best way possible .
It ’s a matter of respect , I ’d say .
Here are 5 simple tips to get you on track to painting your Meaty Sistine Chapel .
1. Choose your meat wisely .
The meat is absolutely the most important part of the process .
And knowing what cut you like will open your eyes to endless possibilities .
Most people think the filet or tenderloin is the best cut .
It is probably the most tender , but “ best ” is up for debate .
Filets sacrifice flavor for tenderness and usually rely on some outside agent to give them a stronger flavor .
Ribeyes have killer flavor but tend to be on the fatty side .
The New York Strip falls somewhere in between .
So try different cuts to see what works for your taste .
I love Ribeyes , but when I can’t shell out the cash , I ’ll get a good chuck steak .
It has good marbling ( fat content ) , but has enough meat that I do n’t feel like I ’m wasting my time .
No matter which cut you favor , freshness is the key .
If you have a little extra money , buy your meat at a true butcher ’s shop .
Chain stores like Walmart only carry “ case - ready , pre-packaged ” meat .
This meat , sitting in styrofoam and covered in cellophane , is far less fresh than meat bought at a shop that actually cuts it themselves .
2 . Let the flavor of the beef come through .
Now matter how much make - up you put on an ugly woman , at the end of the day , she ’s still ugly .
By this I mean use only salt and peppe0r for seasoning .
If you are using quality meat then you should n’t need anything else as a marinade .
Minimalism is the key .
Too many flavors and you mask the true beef flavor .
This concept applies to BBQ and sauce as well .
Depending on the cut , I use a little olive oil , Kosher Salt , and fresh , coarse ground pepper .
That ’s really all you need .
3 . Get the fire hot .
Most prime steak restaurants have their grills going ridiculously hot — close to 1000° .
Now , you probably wo n’t be able to get your home grill that hot , but you need to get it as hot as you possibly can .
The more sear you can get on the meat , the more flavor you will lock in .
The higher quality the meat , the more time you have before the meat really burns .
It should just sizzle and sear , but keep an eye on it so you do n’t lose your $ 30 steak to the flames .
4 . Check the temp .
There is nothing more destructive to a steak than overcooking it .
A good steak should be cooked to medium rare ( 130° – 135° Fahrenheit , 55° – 60° Celsius ) .
Anything over medium is pushing it .
Cooking it to “ well done ” is a punishable crime in 39 states and basically ruins the steak .
With practice you can tell the “ done- ness ” of your steak by touch .
But most of us are n’t that skilled .
Get yourself a good meat thermometer .
They are definitely worth the investment if you are doing a lot of cooking .
For the regular guy , you can get a good thermometer for $ 6 - $ 20 that will do just fine at keeping your meat “ in the red . ”
5 . Let the meat rest .
During the cooking process , the meat proteins constrict and essentially squeeze out their juices .
Letting meat sit and rest after cooking partially reverses this process .
If you let your steak rest for 5 minutes on a separate plate , the liquid should redistribute throughout the meat .
It ends up retaining more flavor and will be juicier .
Cover it with some tin foil to keep it warm .
6. Dig in .
And pity your poor vegetarian friends .

I ’m happy to announce my first Firefox extension called Library Detector .
Similar to a greasemonkey script I published to the jQuery mailing lists a couple months ago that showed if jQuery is running ( which proved to be pretty useful to extend the Sites using jQuery page ) , the library detector is able to detect multiple libraries , currently including the following :
If one of these is found on the current page , it displays their favicon in the statusbar , and if you hover it , a tooltip will show with additional information ( In most cases the version of the library , in the case of jQuery UI the plugins being used , and for Dojo if Dijit is being used ) .
Of course , there ’s one catch in some libraries :
If the developer renamed the scope of the Library ( i.e. window. dojo ) to something entirely different , the test fails ( however , usually that ’s not the case ) .
So , if you want to know what websites use your favorite library ( or which do not ) , go ahead and grab the Library Detector from its download page .
Additionally , I ’d love to see feedback , and if you think there ’s a library missing , or if you have an idea how to improve a test / show additional information , please leave me a comment .
Cheers !

PALO ALTO , Calif .
—Technology for tapping ocean waves , tides and rivers for electricity is far from commercial viability and lagging well behind wind , solar and other fledgling power sectors , a panel of experts said last week during a forum here on climate change and marine ecosystems .
While the potential for marine energy is great , ocean wave and tidal energy projects are still winding their way through an early research and development phase , these experts said .
" It 's basically not commercially financeable yet , " said Edwin Feo , a partner at Milbank , Tweed , Hadley & McCloy , during a conference at Stanford University .
" They are still a long ways from getting access to the capital and being deployed , because they are simply immature technologies . "
Wave and tidal energy are renewable sources that can be used to meet California 's renewable portfolio standard of 10 percent of electricity by 2010 .
But the industry has been hampered by uncertainty about environmental effects , poor economics , jurisdictional tieups and scattered progress for a handful of entrepreneurs .
Finavera Renewables , based in British Columbia , recently canceled all of its wave projects , bringing to a close what was the first permit for wave power from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .
And last fall , the California Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) denied Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 's application for a power purchase agreement with Finavera Renewables , citing the technology 's immaturity .
Roger Bedard , head of the Electric Power Research Institute 's wave power research unit , said the United States is at least five and maybe 10 years away from the first commercial project in marine waters .
A buoy at a Marine Corps base in Hawaii is the only wave - powered device that has been connected to the power grid so far in the United States .
The first pilot tidal project , in New York 's East River , took five years to get a permit from FERC .
Feo , who handles renewable energy project financing at his law firm , says more than 80 ocean , tidal and river technologies are being tested by start - ups that do not have much access to capital or guarantee of long - term access to their resource .
That has translated into little interest from the investment community .
" Most of these companies are start - ups , " Feo said .
" From a project perspective , that does n't work .
People who put money into projects expect long - term returns . "
William Douros of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) expressed similar concerns and said agency officials have been trying to sort through early jurisdictional disputes and the development of some technologies that would " take up a lot of space on the sea floor . "
" You would think offshore wave energy projects are a given , " Douros said .
" And yet , from our perspective , from within our agency , there are still a lot of questions . "
' Really exciting times '
But the belief in marine energy is there in some quarters , prompting the Interior Department to clear up jurisdictional disputes with FERC for projects outside 3 miles from state waters .
Under an agreement announced last week , Interior will issue leases for offshore wave and current energy development , while FREC will license the projects .
The agreement gives Interior 's Minerals Management Service exclusive jurisdiction over the production , transportation or transmission of energy from offshore wind and solar projects .
MMS and FERC will share responsibilities for hydrokinetic projects , such as wave , tidal and ocean current .
Maurice Hill , who works on the leasing program at MMS , said the agency is developing " a comprehensive approach " to offshore energy development .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar himself has been holding regional meetings and will visit San Francisco this week to talk shop as part of that process .
Hill said MMS and the U.S. Geological Survey will issue a report within 45 days on potential development and then go public with its leasing program .
" These next couple of months are really exciting times , especially on the OCS , " he said .
Still ,
Hill acknowledged that the industry is in an early stage and said federal officials are approaching environmental effects especially with caution .
" We do n't know how they 'll work , " he said .
" We 're testing at this stage . "
' Highly energetic ' West Coast waves
But if projects do lurch forward , the Electric Power Research Institute 's Bedard said , the resource potential is off the charts .
He believes it is possible to have 10 gigawatts of ocean wave energy online by 2025 , and 3 gigawatts of river and ocean energy up in the same time frame .
The potential is greatest on the West Coast , Bedard said , where " highly energetic " waves pound the long coastline over thousands of miles .
Alaska and California have the most to gain , he said , with Oregon , Washington and Hawaii not far behind .
To Feo , a key concern is the length of time MMS chooses to issue leases to developers .
He said the typical MMS conditional lease time of two , three or five years wo n't work for ocean wave technology because entrepreneurs need longer - term commitments to build projects and show investors the industry is here to say .
" It just wo n't work " at two , three or five years , Feo said .
" Sooner or later , you have to get beyond pilot projects . "
Hill refused to answer questions about the length of the leases being considered by MMS .

WASHINGTON  President Obama and his advisers have decided to significantly expand Afghanistan ’s security forces in the hope that a much larger professional army and national police force could fill a void left by the central government and do more to promote stability in the country , according to senior administration and Pentagon officials .
A plan awaiting final approval by the president would set a goal of about 400,000 troops and national police officers , more than twice the forces ’ current size , and more than three times the size that American officials believed would be adequate for Afghanistan in 2002 , when the Taliban and Al Qaeda appeared to have been routed .
The officials said Mr. Obama was expected to approve a version of the plan in coming days as part of a broader Afghanistan - Pakistan strategy .
But even members of Mr. Obama ’s national security team appeared taken aback by the cost projections of the program , which range from $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion over the next six or seven years .
By comparison , the annual budget for the entire Afghan government , which is largely provided by the United States and other international donors , is about $ 1.1 billion , which means the annual price of the program would be about twice the cost of operating the government of President Hamid Karzai .

Throughout recent elections , bloggers have become an increasingly important part of our political landscape , taking politicians and the media to task , demanding accountability , raising money for candidates , and organizing in force .
Many , if not most , bloggers and blog readers remain anonymous for a variety of reasons .
For a long time , I was also anonymous , fearful I would receive retribution at my now former job .
But I spoke out using my anonymous handle " Scout Finch " because the injustices in this country were mounting and I could bear no more .
I took inspiration from the legions of other pseudonymous anonymous bloggers , including many with funny names like Kos , Meteor Blades , Devilstower , and KagroX .
They were influencing the debate and inspiring me to join the conversation .
I was also reminded of another group of anonymous writers who wrote under the pseudonym " Publius . "
They once published a series of anonymous articles , better known as The Federalist Papers , which would become catalyst to ratify the constitution .
One of those radical , anonymous writers would later go on to become President of the United States .
This country has long prided itself on the principle of freedom of speech .
Writing anonymously about the affairs of our government is as old a tradition -- or arguably even older -- as our government itself .
And the ability to speak freely without fear of retribution is as entrenched in our society as deeply as apple pie and fireworks on the Fourth of July .
So , imagine my surprise to discover this morning that you have taken it upon yourself to " out " the increasingly well - known Alaskan blogger known simply as AKMuckraker at the blog mudflats .
From your newsletter :
Anonymous Blogger Anonymous No More
The identity of the person who writes the liberal Democratic Mudflats blog has been secret since the blog began , protected by the Anchorage Daily News , among others .
My own theory about the public process is you can say what you want , as long as you are willing to stand behind it using your real name .
So I was interested to learn that the woman who writes the blog is Anchorage resident _______.*
Best wishes ,
( real name redacted by me )
So , based on your own " theory , " you took it upon yourself to joyfully expose someone who you knew was going to great lengths to protect their personal privacy .
Someone whose only " offense " was writing about Alaskan political issues .
You seemed to even derive joy from warning AKMuckraker AKMuckraker via email only hours before your grand unveiling .

Subject : your identity **********:
I am reliably told that you are the anonymous blogger who writes Mudflats .
I am planning to reveal this in the enews I send to my constituents tomorrow , and am writing to let you know this and offer the opportunity to comment .
Mike Doogan
Most astonishing is your own career as a journalist .
From your profile :
Mike has worked as a Teamster , teacher , janitor and legislative aide , but for most of his adult life was a journalist , including nearly 14 years as a columnist for the Anchorage Daily News where he shared in a Pulitzer Prize for Journalism in 1989 .
He has published a number of books of nonsense about Alaska and currently writes mystery novels .
Surely , having a serious background in journalism , you of all people would understand and respect anonymous sources and privacy issues .
As it turns out , you have little or no respect for open government , whistleblowers , anonymous citizens working to cover the issues of the day , or the First Amendment .
In fact , judging by your now public emails with Alaskan blogger Phil Munger , it seems you 've been on a one - man mission to out AKMuckraker .
It is even more amusing when you consider the title of the next edition of your newsletter blog : " Special War and Toxic Politics Edition . "
Oh , the irony of you lecturing about " toxic politics . "
I 'm sure Alaskans can appreciate your focus on outing a blogger who is most known for exposing the hypocrisy , questionable ethics , and corruption of Alaskan officials .
I 'm sure they appreciate your focus on warring with bloggers instead of taking on the difficult economic and social issues Alaskans find themselves faced with this winter , including those who can't afford to heat their homes .
But , instead , here you are -- gloating about your efforts to ruin somebody 's life .
Why are you so threatened , Mr. Doogan ?
As a member of the Alaskan Democratic Party , why are you so anxious to out a blogger working for progressive causes ?
What sort of perverse joy are you getting by outing this person ?
Did you think they would back off and shy away -- leaving you to run Alaska as only you see fit ?
Did you think those pesky bloggers would wither like shrinking violets ?
Did you ever stop to think that you might be violating his / her rights ?
From the Electronic Frontier Foundation :
Anonymous communications have an important place in our political and social discourse .
The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that the right to anonymous free speech is protected by the First Amendment .
A much - cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads : Protections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse .
Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical , minority views . . .
Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority .
. . .
It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights , and of the First Amendment in particular : to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society .

Whatever your reasoning , you 've certainly caught our attention .
And if you think we are going to scuttle back into the shadows and let this pass , you 've got another thing coming .
Your petty , vindictive , unprofessional , unethical , and perhaps even illegal actions are certain to come back to haunt you .
The drumbeat for a 2010 primary opponent has already begun .
You can bet your last frozen dollar your next opponent will have support far and wide -- from across Alaska and well beyond .
Of course , given the possible legal ramifications of your actions , getting re-elected next year may well be the least of your concerns .
Sincerely ,
Jennifer Bruenjes

Update - From AKMuckraker him / herself :
Lukas and I were trying to write a succinct comparison of the most popular packages that are typically used for data analysis .
I think most people choose one based on what people around them use or what they learn in school , so I ’ve found it hard to find comparative information .
I ’m posting the table here in hopes of useful comments .
Name Advantages Disadvantages
Open source ?
Typical users R Library support ; visualization Steep learning curve Yes Finance ; Statistics Matlab Elegant matrix support ; visualization Expensive ; incomplete statistics support No Engineering SciPy / NumPy / Matplotlib Python ( general - purpose programming language ) Immature Yes Engineering Excel Easy ; visual ; flexible Large datasets No Business SAS Large datasets Expensive ; outdated programming language No Business ; Government Stata Easy statistical analysis No Science SPSS Like Stata but more expensive and worse
[ 7/09 update : tweaks incorporating some of the excellent comments below , esp. for SAS , SPSS , and Stata . ]
There ’s a bunch more to be said for every cell .
Among other things :
Two big divisions on the table :
The more programming - oriented solutions are R , Matlab , and Python .
More analytic solutions are Excel , SAS , Stata , and SPSS .
Python “ immature ” : matplotlib , numpy , and scipy are all separate libraries that do n’t always get along .
Why does matplotlib come with “ pylab ” which is supposed to be a unified namespace for everything ?
Is n’t scipy supposed to do that ?
Why is there duplication between numpy and scipy ( e.g. numpy.linalg vs. scipy.linalg ) ?
And then there ’s package compatibility version hell .
You can use SAGE or Enthought but neither is standard ( yet ) .
In terms of functionality and approach , SciPy is closest to Matlab , but it feels much less mature .
Matlab ’s language is certainly weak .
It sometimes does n’t seem to be much more than a scripting language wrapping the matrix libraries .
Python is clearly better on most counts .
R’s is surprisingly good ( Scheme - derived , smart use of named args , etc. ) if you can get past the bizarre language constructs and weird functions in the standard library .
Everyone says SAS is very bad .
Matlab is the best for developing new mathematical algorithms .
Very popular in machine learning .
I ’ve never used the Matlab Statistical Toolbox .
I ’m wondering , how good is it compared to R ?
Here ’s an interesting reddit thread on SAS / Stata vs R .
SPSS and Stata in the same category : they seem to have a similar role so we threw them together .
Stata is a lot cheaper than SPSS , people usually seem to like it , and it seems popular for introductory courses .
I personally have n’t used either …
SPSS and Stata for “ Science ” : we ’ve seen biologists and social scientists use lots of Stata and SPSS .
My impression is they get used by people who want the easiest way possible to do the sort of standard statistical analyses that are very orthodox in many academic disciplines .
( ANOVA , multiple regressions , t- and chi-squared significance tests , etc. )
Certain types of scientists , like physicists , computer scientists , and statisticians , often do weirder stuff that does n’t fit into these traditional methods .
Another important thing about SAS , from my perspective at least , is that it ’s used mostly by an older crowd .
I know dozens of people under 30 doing statistical stuff and only one knows SAS .
At that R meetup last week , Jim Porzak asked the audience if there were any recent grad students who had learned R in school .
Many hands went up .
Then he asked if SAS was even offered as an option .
All hands went down .
There were boatloads of SAS representatives at that conference and they sure did n’t seem to be on the leading edge .
But : is there ANY package besides SAS that can do analysis for datasets that do n’t fit into memory ?
That is , ones that mostly have to stay on disk ?
And exactly how good as SAS ’s capabilities here anyway ?
If your dataset ca n’t fit on a single hard drive and you need a cluster , none of the above will work .
There are a few multi-machine data processing frameworks that are somewhat standard ( e.g. Hadoop , MPI ) but It ’s an open question what the standard distributed data analysis framework will be .
( Hive ? Pig ?
Or quite possibly something else . )
( This was an interesting point at the R meetup .
Porzak was talking about how going to MySQL gets around R ’s in - memory limitations .
But Itamar Rosenn and Bo Cowgill ( Facebook and Google respectively ) were talking about multi-machine datasets that require cluster computation that R does n’t come close to touching , at least right now .
It ’s just a whole different ballgame with that large a dataset . )
SAS people complain about poor graphing capabilities .
R vs. Matlab visualization support is controversial .
One view I ’ve heard is , R ’s visualizations are great for exploratory analysis , but you want something else for very high - quality graphs .
Matlab ’s interactive plots are super nice though .
Matplotlib follows the Matlab model , which is fine , but is uglier than either IMO .
Excel has a far , far larger user base than any of these other options .
That ’s important to know .
I think it ’s underrated by computer scientist sort of people .
But it does massively break down at > 10 k or certainly > 100 k rows .
Another option : Fortran and C / C++.
They are super fast and memory efficient , but tricky and error - prone to code , have to spend lots of time mucking around with I/O , and have zero visualization and data management support .
Most of the packages listed above run Fortran numeric libraries for the heavy lifting .
Another option : Mathematica .
I get the impression it ’s more for theoretical math , not data analysis .
Can anyone prove me wrong ?
Another option : the pre-baked data mining packages .
The open - source ones I know of are Weka and Orange .
I hear there are zillions of commercial ones too .
Jerome Friedman , a big statistical learning guy , has an interesting complaint that they should focus more on traditional things like significance tests and experimental design .
( Here ; the article that inspired this rant . )
I think knowing where the typical users come from is very informative for what you can expect to see in the software ’s capabilities and user community .
I ’d love more information on this for all these options .
What do people think ?

The series detailed how the Bush Administration circumvented Congress to rewrite air pollution rules to benefit business , and how a conservative - leaning court later declared a dozen of those rules illegal , invoking unusually caustic language .
The Inquirer analysis also found that in nearly 50 pollution lawsuits filed in Washington , the EPA settled 80 percent of those brought by industry , compared to just 15 percent of those filed by environmental groups .

With a swoop of his well - manicured fingers , Dr. David P. Rapaport lifts the lining of my black Calvin Klein underwear — and gives me a wedgie worthy of a grade - school bully .
With nothing left to shield my naked flesh from his discerning eyes , I stand in the unforgiving light wondering what the hell I was thinking when I decided to come here .
My mission within this sterile examination room is simple enough : to catch an up - close - and - personal glimpse of a multi-billion - dollar industry .
This is my first stop in a series of three consultations with plastic surgeons at various price points .
I plan to give each one free rein over my face and body , to discover how far each will go in urging me to alter my objectively healthy , 27 - year - old , five - foot - nine - inch , 120 - pound figure .
Alongside me is a Vanity Fair staffer appointed to pose as my boyfriend while secretly recording the sessions .
Dr. Rapaport , who charges $ 200 for a consultation , received his M.D. from Tel Aviv University in 1985 , trained at the N.Y.U. Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery , and made New York magazine ’s 2003 list of the city ’s best cosmetic surgeons .
His Fifth Avenue offices are lavish , with pristine walls and plush carpeting .
My companions in the luxe waiting room include a stunning , Prada - clad Asian woman and multiple photo albums showcasing before and after shots for various nips and tucks .
Now the doctor and I stand in front of the floor - length mirror while he deconstructs the “ before ” me .
“ As a Caucasian woman , you probably — if you were doing lipo — would want this brought down , ” he says , pointing to my “ banana rolls ” — his clever name for the part of my rear end that peeks from beneath my underwear lining .
“ And again , you know , in jeans , to most people … on white women , you guys like to get this down .
And we like to see it down . ”
I gulp , realizing that I ’ll never be able to eat my favorite fruit again without thinking of my own ass .
I ’ve always thought of plastic surgery as a wealthy , distant relative — one I do n’t want to know now , but on whom I might have to rely someday .
To avoid dooming myself to a choice between hypocrisy and wrinkled skin , therefore , I ’ve refrained from condemning it altogether .
Still , it ’s hard not to disapprove of what its rise has wrought : the expressionless faces , the cartoonish body parts , the celebrities who look like they ’re wearing masks of their former selves .
The roots of plastic surgery are certainly honorable enough .
The term derives from the ancient - Greek word plastikos , meaning “ to mold . ”
The earliest recorded examples date back to 600 B.C. , when the Hindu surgeon Sushruta developed techniques for repairing mutilated faces .
It was not until the mid-19th century that the aspirations of plastic surgeons swayed markedly toward superficial ends , when anesthesia became more widely available .
New techniques were developed in the mid-20th century , in response to the needs of wounded veterans from World Wars I and II , but even then the emphasis remained on healing , not on enhancing .
Fast - forward to the present .
In 2007 alone , Americans spent $ 13 billion on 11.7 million cosmetic procedures ( both surgical and nonsurgical ) .
An ongoing controversy over what qualifies as “ cosmetic ” makes it difficult to determine the number of treatments that were purely restorative , necessitated by third - degree burns , mastectomies , and other medical issues .
But what ’s clear is that the overall number of men and women undergoing cosmetic procedures in the U.S. has increased by 457 percent since 1997 , when relevant statistical data was first collected .
As many as one in 20 people today reportedly suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder ( B.D.D. ) , a sort of “ imagined ugly ” syndrome .
While difficult to diagnose , plastic - surgery addiction is often linked to B.D.D. Dr. Barry Eppley , who writes a blog titled “ Explore Plastic Surgery , ” estimates that one - third of plastic - surgery patients will eventually return to have additional work done .
Ana Guembes made a quick trip to the Westfield Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , one recent morning to pick up some face powder at Macy's .
But before she could get to the department store , she was accosted by a salesman at a cosmetics cart in the middle of the mall corridor .
" Hello , miss .
I want to show you something , " he called out to her , brandishing a tube of lotion with Dead Sea minerals .
Soon the salesman was applying eye gel , salts and creams to Ms. Guembes 's skin while chatting away about their cleansing ...
From the ' self serving study ' files :
A new report out today from IDC , sponsored by Linux vendor Novell indicates that the current economic downturn is a good thing for Linux adoption .
with more than half of the IT executives surveyed planning to accelerate Linux adoption in 2009 .
This is definitely something we 've heard before from multiple open source and Linux vendors , but the IDC report puts some numbers to the premise .
According to IDC , in a poll of 300 IT professionals more than 72 percent reported that , "
they are either actively evaluating or have already decided to increase their adoption of Linux on the server in 2009 . "
The numbers on the Linux desktop are equally encouraging with some 68 percent reporting they would be looking closely at adoption .
On the deep drill down of the IDC results , it looks like the retail industry is leading in term of the potential for Linux adoption ( 69 percent on server and 63 percent on the desktop ) .
A key driver for moving to Linux according to the study is virtualization -- again no big surprise in my view .
88 percent of respondents reported that they , " plan to evaluate , deploy or increase their use of virtualization software within Linux operating systems over the next 12 - 24 months . "
In a rare public forecast , Paul A. Volcker , a former Fed chairman and now an economic adviser to President Obama , added his voice to the optimism , although cautiously .
“ I ’m not here to tell you the economy is going to recover very strongly in the short run , ” Mr. Volcker said in an interview recorded for a weekend show on Bloomberg Television .
But he said the improvement was sufficient to avoid a second government stimulus on top of the $ 787 billion in spending and tax breaks enacted in February .
An obstacle to easier credit , however , might come from the Treasury Department , which said in a report issued Wednesday that it would step up the issuing of 30 - year bonds .
The funding is needed to help finance the hundreds of billions of dollars that the government is spending on bank bailouts and stimulus .
But the quickening pace could force Treasury to raise long - term interest rates to attract enough buyers for the bonds  an action that in turn could impede lending .
A special advisory committee to the Treasury warned in a report that the government ’s huge and rapidly escalating need to borrow money would weigh heavily on the financial markets and that investors would demand higher interest rates in exchange for buying up the avalanche of new bonds .
Until now , that has not been a problem , the report said .
Investors have snapped up Treasury bonds as a haven for their money in a troubled world economy , and China invested the proceeds of a huge trade surplus in United States government securities .
“ Treasuries will probably not receive the same favorable demand treatment from either source over the coming quarters , ” the advisory committee ’s report said .
Consumer spending stood out as the only significant bright spot in the Commerce Department ’s otherwise bleak update on the gross domestic product , the broadest measure of the nation ’s economic activity , which has now posted three straight quarters of decline .
Consumer spending turned up in the first quarter , rising at a 2.2 percent annual rate , for the first time since last summer .
Most of the spending was on autos , kitchen appliances , computers and other durable goods .
But retailers allowed shoppers to draw down inventories , without reordering to fill their shelves .
Indeed , imports , a source of much of the nation ’s consumption , fell sharply , along with exports .
And so did business investment .
Savage Love Rape Date
I met this girl on an " adult " website .
We exchanged a few e-mails , then we chatted over IM twice , just the basic small talk , before exchanging numbers .
It was on the phone that she told me about her rape fantasy :
She has always fantasized about being kidnapped by a stranger from a public place , held in a dark room over the weekend , and forced to do whatever her captor wants .
That sounds hot , but I would n't do it without at least meeting first .
Safety first .
So the idea now is to meet at a bar , have a drink , and then go back to my place and enact a date - rape scene .
Not quite her ultimate fantasy , but it just so happens to be one of my all - time fantasies .
We 're both turned on by the idea that we will be near - strangers .
Now here comes the problem :
What if she is some wacko who will call the cops on me / blackmail me and say it was actual rape ?
Can I protect myself from this somehow ?
We never talked about it over IM , just on the phone .
This is one of the boxes I would like to check before I die , but I want to be safe about it .
Help !
To Rape Or Not To Rape
I 'm tempted to advise you — and others with similar fantasies ( not all of them men , not all of them straight ) — to Google " Oliver Jovanovic " and then move on to the next question .
But there 's the digital divide to consider :
Not all aspiring date - rape fetishists have access to the interwebs .
Oliver Jovanovic was a graduate student at Columbia University when he met a woman named Jamie Rzucek on the interwebs way , way back in 1996 .
The two bonded over a shared interest in bondage and torture , and they met up for an evening of consensual sex that included bondage and torture .
After it was all over , Rzucek went to the police and Jovanovic was arrested , prosecuted , found guilty , and given 15 years to life .
He spent almost two years in prison — during which time he was brutally assaulted — before he was released on appeal and ultimately kinda , sorta exonerated .
Guess what got Jovanovic out of prison ?
E-mails that had been improperly excluded by the judge during the first trial .
The e-mails showed that Rzucek had not only consented to engage in bondage and S&M , but that she had touched base with Jovanovic after the fact to tell him how exhilarated she was .
The lesson for you , TRONTR , is to get it in goddamn writing .
Negotiate this scene via e-mail , keep copies of those e-mails , and agree in advance — via e-mail — on a safe word that , if uttered , brings the action to a screeching halt .
I 'd also suggest that you — with her consent — make a digital audio recording of the encounter .
Then you would n't just have e-mails proving she consented going in , TRONTR , but a digital recording that proved you stopped whatever it was you were doing if she used her safe word and retracted her consent during the encounter .
Making a digital audio recording of the encounter means you wo n't have photos or video to share over the interwebs , which should appeal to her if she is concerned about privacy .
And using the magic of the World Wide Interwebs , you can simultaneously record this encounter on your computer and remotely on hers .
That should give her some assurance that you wo n't take advantage of her written consent to a consensual rape - role - play scenario as a cover to actually rape her , i.e. , to do things she has n't consented to or to ignore her if she removes her consent during the act , because then she'd have proof that you ignored her safe word and kept going after she withdrew her consent .
I 've been seeing " Radioman " for a few weeks — the physical chemistry between us is amazing , and we have a lot of fun .
He had a vasectomy a year ago ( he 's only 26 ) , and for me this is a deal breaker since I want to have a family .
The other surprise is that he is in relationships with two other women and the three of them get together and have threesomes .
I am a bisexual woman recently out of a long - term relationship , and I am interested in joining this little playgroup .
However , I met one of the other women recently , and she seemed jealous and upset .
Radioman insists that she was just tired and actually likes me .
I 'm not so sure .
Am I asking for drama by getting involved in this foursome ?
Thinking Of Joining A Harem
Yes .
Speaking of drama :
Teen mom Bristol Palin and her fiancé , Levi Johnston , called it quits last week .
So we 've been cheated out of the Royal Rube Wedding we were promised during last summer 's Republican National Convention — and another child will grow up without a father in the home , which is a tragedy for the child , according to America 's Talibangelists .
Or that 's what they said when Mary Cheney — remember that dyke ?— had a baby with a woman she would marry if she could marry .
It 's weird that America 's Talibangelists are n't making the same point now .
I hate to disagree , Dan , but you missed the mark when you wrote this : " When we marry , we 're signing up to fuck someone at least semiregularly for decades .
Not interested in fucking ?
Do n't marry . "
Dan , people marry for many , many reasons .
Sex is only one of them , and sometimes it is n't even high on the list — or on the list at all .
Family , friendship , stability , love , someone to grow old with , and on and on .
Your surprisingly narrow description of what marriage means needs some rethinking .
Thanks for your work ,
Cacilda Jethá , MD
I 'm willing to concede that I left an important subordinate clause out of the sentence that riled you , CJ : " When we marry , we 're signing up to fuck someone at least semiregularly for decades , among other things ... "
Marriage can be about all the things you list , but so long as sexual exclusivity is presumed to be a part of marriage — a defining part , according to the right - wingers — spouses have a right to expect sexual activity within their marriages .
People who are interested in marriage but not sex — people whose lists only include family , friendship , stability , love , someone to grow old with , and on and on , but not sex — need to inform their prospective spouses of their disinterest in sex before marrying , not after .
As I 've said a million times :
If you do n't think that sex is what marriage is all about , mostly about , or even partly about , if sex is something you can live without , that 's grand .
But you need to marry someone who feels the same way or inform your betrothed of your disinterest in advance .
And if you lose interest in sex after you marry , but want your partner to stick around for the family and stability and friendship , I 'll let you in on a little secret :
The spouse is likelier to stick around if you give the spouse permission to get his or her sexual needs met elsewhere .
It never ceases to amaze me how many people who are n't interested in sex — who consider sex to be trivial and unimportant — nevertheless deny their frustrated partners permission to do this trivial , unimportant thing with others .

Coaxing YBCO Above 175K
Standard 91 K YBCO ( Y - 123 ) has only 6 metal layers in the unit cell and very little PWD .
In this new discovery - based on a 9223C theoretical structure type shown at left - there are 16 metal layers and a large amount of PWD .
The closest analog to this structure type is the B212/1212C intergrowth of the Sn - Ba - Ca - Cu - O family , with Tc near 200K .
The chemical formula of this new discovery - dubbed " Hyper YBCO " - is Y 2 Ba 6 Cu 8 Ox .
However , HY - 268 does not form stoichiometrically .
In order to synthesize a sufficent volume fraction to detect , the " layer cake " method must be used .
The layer cake used to produce the prototype pellet had 17 layers , 9 of ( BaCuO ) and 8 of ( Y2O3 + CuO ) .
This resulted in 16 interference regions in which the desired structure was encouraged to form .
The layer cake method is depicted in the simplified graphic below .
Below is a composite plot of three magnetization tests that were digitally summed to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .
Weak diamagnetic transitions also appeared near 165 K and 185K .
These are believed to have resulted from minority phases : one less Ba-Cu layer for the 165 K signal ( 7223C structure ) and one more Ba-Cu layer for the 185 K signal ( B223C structure ) .
These are the highest transition temperatures ever observed in a quaternary ( four element ) compound .
Synthesis of HY - 268 was by the solid state reaction method .
Stoichiometric amounts of the below precursors were mixed , layered , pelletized at 70,000 psi and then sintered for 11 hours at 890C .
The pellet was then annealed for 10 hours at 500C in flowing O2 .

The magnetometer employed twin Honeywell SS94A1F
Hall - effect sensors with a tandem sensitivity of 50 mv / gauss .
The 4 - point probe was bonded to the pellet with CW2400 silver epoxy and used 7 volts on the primary .
RESEARCH NOTE :
The copper - oxides are strongly hygroscopic .
All tests should be performed immediately after annealing .

In the debate over whether God exists , we have theists on the one side , atheists on the other , and , in the middle , science .
Atheists claim there is scientific proof that God is not real .
Theists , on the other hand , insist that science , in fact , has been unable to prove that God does not exist .
According to atheists , however , this position depends upon a mistaken understanding of the nature of science and how science operates .
Therefore , it is possible to say that , scientifically , God does not exist — just as science discounts the existence of a myriad of other alleged beings .
What Science Can and Cannot Prove
To understand why " God does not exist " is a legitimate scientific statement , it 's important to understand what the statement means in the context of science .
When scientist say , " God does not exist , " they mean something similar to when they say " aether does not exist , " " psychic powers do not exist , " or " life does on the moon does not exist . "
All such statements are shorthand for a more elaborate and technical explanation , which is that this alleged entity ( or God ) has no place in any scientific equations , plays no role in any scientific explanations , cannot be used to predict any events , does not describe anything or force that has yet been detected , and there are no models of the universe in which its presence is either required , productive , or useful .
What should be most obvious about the more technically accurate statement is that it is n't absolute .
It does not deny for all time any possible existence of the entity or force in question ; instead , it 's a provisional statement denying the existence of any relevance or reality to the entity or force based on what we currently know .
Religious theists may be quick to seize upon this and insist that it demonstrates that science cannot " prove " that God does not exist , but that requires far too strict of a standard for what it means to " prove " something scientifically .
Scientific Proof Against God
In " God : The Failed Hypothesis — How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist , " Victor J. Stenger offers this scientific argument against the existence of God :
Hypothesize a God who plays an important role in the universe .
Assume that God has specific attributes that should provide objective evidence for his existence .
Look for such evidence with an open mind .
If such evidence is found , conclude that God may exist .
If such objective evidence is not found , conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a God with these properties does not exist .
This is basically how science would disprove the existence of any alleged entity .
If God existed , there should be concrete evidence of His existence — not faith , but tangible , measurable , consistent evidence that can be predicted and tested using the scientific method .
If we fail to find that evidence , then God can not exist as defined .
Certainty and Doubt in Science
Of course , nothing in science is proven or disproven beyond a shadow of any possible doubt .
In science , everything is provisional .
Being provisional is not a weakness or a sign that a conclusion is weak .
Being provisional is a smart , pragmatic tactic because we can never be sure what we 'll come across when we round the next corner .
This lack of absolute certainty is a window through which many religious theists try to slip their god , but that 's not a valid move .
In theory , it may be possible that someday we will come across new information that will lead us to further explore the God hypothesis .
If the evidence described in the above argument were found , for example , that would justify a rational belief in the existence of the sort of god under consideration .
It would n’t prove the existence of such a god beyond all doubt , though , because belief would still have to be provisional .
It may also be possible that the same could be true of an infinite number of other hypothetical beings and supernatural forces .
Zeus or Odin , Christian or Hindu— every possibility of a God or gods is up for exploration .
What Does it Mean to " Exist " ?
Finally , for such a proposition as " God exists " to have meaning to science , we need to define what " existence " in this case means .
When it comes to God or a series of gods , their existence is dependent on evidence that they have had or continue to have an impact on the universe .
In order to prove impact on the universe , there must be measurable and testable events that could best or only be explained by whatever this " God " is we are hypothesizing .
Believers must be able to present a model of the universe in which some god is " either required , productive , or useful . "
This is obviously not the case .
Many believers work hard trying to find a way to introduce their god into scientific explanations , but none have succeeded .
No believer has been able to demonstrate , or even strongly suggest , that there are any events in the universe that require a supernatural being to explain .
Instead , these constantly failing attempts end up reinforcing the impression that there is no " there " there — nothing for " gods " to do , no role for them to play , and no reason to give them a second thought .
So far , everyone who has tried to scientifically prove that God exists has failed .
While it 's technically true that this does n't mean that no one ever will succeed , it is also true that in every other situation where such failures are so consistent , we do n't acknowledge rational or even serious reasons to bother believing .
A second suburban school district has been drawn into the public - corruption probe that threatens to upend the deeply entrenched power system that runs Cuyahoga County .
Warrensville Heights schools have received a subpoena ordering officials to turn over all documents showing any relationship between the district and more than a dozen contractors whose names already have surfaced in the probe .
They include the law firm Vorys , Sater , Seymour and Pease and attorney Anthony O. Calabrese III ; 1 - 888 - Ohio Comp and its owners , the Lucarelli family ; and Nature Stone and other companies connected to Rusty Masetta .

For more on the federal investigation in Cuyahoga County visit cleveland.com/countyincrisis
The probe first became public last July , when 175 agents raided the homes and offices of County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora , Auditor Frank Russo and county employee J. Kevin Kelley along with the offices of several contractors .
Federal prosecutors also have demanded documents from two county judges , MetroHealth Medical Center , the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority and contractors including Nature Stone and Ohio Comp , which handles workers ' compensation claims .
The Warrensville Heights district received its subpoena in February , the same month Parma schools received a subpoena seeking information about that district 's relationship with many of the same contractors .
The subpoena gave a deadline of a week ago for the Warrensville Heights schools to turn over the documents , but school attorneys talked to federal prosecutors in the case and received an extension .
How many of the contractors or people listed on the subpoena did business with Warrensville Heights schools is unclear .
The school 's business manager , Jim Russo , confirmed Tuesday that the Vorys law firm worked for the district until January and that 1 - 888 - Ohio Comp manages workers ' compensation claims for the district .
But the school had no dealings with some of the other contractors listed on the subpoena , Russo said , although he declined to say whom .
Russo said he is not related to the county auditor .
But a Warrensville Heights school board member does have ties to Frank Russo and to Kelley , a former Parma school board president .
Pamela O'Bannon -- who served as president of the Warrensville Heights school board last year -- worked as an office assistant in Russo's office until 2002 , when she went to work for Parma schools ' business department .
At the time , the business department was controlled by Kelley , whom O'Bannon had befriended when the two worked for Russo .
In Parma , where she worked until 2005 , O'Bannon served as the school 's risk manager , working directly with 1 - 888 - Ohio Comp .
The district hired the company with Kelley 's support .
On Tuesday , O'Bannon confirmed her friendship with Kelley but avoided questions about 1 - 888 - Ohio Comp , saying she had to go to a meeting at work .
She said she would call a reporter later but did not .
Attorneys familiar with the case have said prosecutors are still gathering information , sending out hundreds of subpoenas to municipalities , public agencies , contractors and others .
So far , they have charged only one person .
Henry Picozzi , a superintendent and project manager for K&D Group Inc. , was accused this month of bribing two Cleveland building inspectors in connection with the Stonebridge development on the west bank of the Flats in 2007 .
It is unclear when the Warrensville Heights district will turn over records to a grand jury .
The school board has hired an electronic - data retrieval company to compile the documents .
On Tuesday , that company spent the day copying the school 's computer servers and the hard drives from desktop and laptop computers , said Inajo Davis Chappell , the school 's attorney .
The company then will scour the files looking for any information about the contractors and names listed on the subpoena .
" I think it 's the smart and prudent thing to do , " Chappell said .

Over a century ago , on June 30th , 1908 a huge explosion detonated over an unpopulated region of Russia called Tunguska .
It is probably one of the most enduring mysteries of this planet .
What could cause such a huge explosion in the atmosphere , with the energy of a thousand Hiroshima atomic bombs , flattening a forest the area of Luxembourg and yet leaving no crater ?
It is little wonder that the Tunguska event has become great material for science fiction writers ; how could such a huge blast , that shook the Earth ’s magnetic field and lit up the Northern Hemisphere skies for three days leave no crater and just a bunch of flattened , scorched trees ?
Although there are many theories as to how the Tunguska event may have unfolded , scientists are still divided over what kind of object could have hit the Earth from space .
Now a Russian scientist believes he has uncovered the best answer yet .
The Earth was glanced by a large comet , that skipped off the upper atmosphere , dropping a chunk of comet material as it did so .
As the comet chunk heated up as it dropped through the atmosphere , the material , packed with volatile chemicals , exploded as the biggest chemical explosion mankind had ever seen …
12,000 years ago , a large object smashed into North America , causing global destruction .
Dust and ash was released into the atmosphere , triggering global cooling and possibly causing the extinction of a number of large mammals around this time .
The Tunguska event was of a similar energy to that catastrophic impact , but fortunately for us , Tunguska had a benign effect on the world .
It simply exploded high in the atmosphere , flattened a region of Russia and vaporized .
“ Significantly , the energy of the chemical explosion is substantially lower than the kinetic energy of the body , ” says Edward Drobyshevski of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg , who has published his research into the Tunguska event .
The fact that the Tunguska explosion energy is lower than what is expected of the kinetic energy of an object that hit the Earth from space is key to his work .
Drobyshevski therefore concludes that the event must have been caused not by an asteroid or whole comet , it was actually caused by a fragment of comet material that fell off as the main cometary body skipped off the Earth ’s upper atmosphere .
This means that the Earth was hit on a tangent and the fragment dropped comparatively slowly toward the surface .
Sounds reasonable so far , but how did the fragment explode ?
Using our new understanding as to what chemicals comets contain , Drobyshevski surmises the fragment was rich in hydrogen peroxide .
This is where the magic happened .
The explosion was not due to a rapid release of kinetic energy , it was in fact a hydrogen peroxide bomb .
As the fragment descended , it heated up .
As the reactive chemicals in the material got hot , they explosively disassociated to form oxygen and water , ripping the fragment apart .
The Tunguska event was therefore a huge chemical bomb and not a “ regular ” comet - hits - Earth impact .
An interesting study .
Not content with dropping asteroids on our planet , the Universe has started throwing hydrogen peroxide explosives at us too .
Whatever next ?

Pictured : Shocking moment polar bear attacks woman who climbed into zoo enclosure
This is the terrifying moment a woman was attacked by a polar bear after jumping into its zoo enclosure .
The 32 - year - old leapt over bars at Berlin Zoo during the bears ' feeding time yesterday .
Despite six zookeepers ' efforts to distract the four predators kept in the enclosure , the woman was bitten several times on her arms and legs .
Shocking attack : A woman was mauled by a bear after jumping into a enclosure at Berlin Zoo yesterday
The brave keepers eventually managed to push the bear away and pull the woman to safety .
She was bitten by one of the four older polar bears in the enclosure and not by the famous Knut , who took Germany by storm as a cub after he was hand - raised by a keeper .
Build - up to the attack :
The woman swims towards a polar bear
Still under attack , the woman swims for and then finally grabs a rope hanging down by rescuers
She finally escapes the bears and is rushed off to hospital for treatment
It is not known why the woman pulled the dangerous stunt but she initially appeared to be elated as she swam towards a bear in the enclosure .
It is not easy to access the enclosure , which is surrounded by a fence , a line of prickly hedges and a wall .
The woman 's cardigan hangs from the polar bear 's jaws after the attack
Heiner Kloes , a zoo spokesman , said keepers pushed the huge bear away before pulling the woman out .
She was taken to a hospital for treatment where she is now recovering after undergoing surgery to heal her wounds .

With foreign warships looming off its shores and a worldwide debate raging over how to defeat piracy , leaders in this seaside Somali capital say there ’s a solution that could be fast , simple and relatively cheap : the Somalis themselves .
With the exception of the pirates , who showed they were undeterred by seizing two more ships Tuesday and attacking others , including an American vessel they did not manage to board , Somalis have been largely bystanders in the unfolding drama playing out hundreds of miles from Mogadishu ’s coastline .
The crisis has again exposed the impotency of Somalia ’s transitional government , but its leaders hope to turn the negative publicity into international momentum to end their nation ’s 18 - year stint as a failed state .
“ We are not being utilized as much as we could be , ” Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said in an interview at the government ’s well - guarded compound in Mogadishu .
“ We need to fight pirates on land .
We have information about how they function and who they are .
Advertisement
“ I understand the short - term need to use warships in a crisis , ” he added , “ but the long - term objective should be to build institutions that will deal with pirates from inside the country . ”
So far , that has not been a big part of the global strategy .
Somali officials say they were barely informed , much less consulted , about U.S. Navy efforts to rescue American ship captain Richard Phillips .
He was freed Sunday when U.S. snipers killed three pirates holding him .
There have been calls among military experts for U.S. troops to pursue pirates on land or strike at their hide - outs in northern Somalia .
President Obama spoke Monday about coordinating with international partners and boosting U.S. efforts in the waters off East Africa , where three U.S. warships are already patrolling .
But the anti-piracy coalition includes nations such as China , India , France and Kenya , not Somalia .
Advertisement
That ’s largely because the Somali government , which has no coast guard and no money to pay its disintegrating 3,500 - person army , is barely holding its own against insurgents in Mogadishu .
But Somali leaders and some U.S. experts are beginning to question whether warships equipped with heavy weapons , commandos and sophisticated technology are the best tools to fight criminal gangs of young people carrying AK - 47s and satellite phones .
The U.S. and other nations initially hoped a strong show of force might scare off the pirates , but the attacks have persisted .
Tuesday , pirates grabbed the Greek - owned bulk carrier Irene with a crew of 22 in the Gulf of Aden .
Hours later , others attacked the Lebanese - owned cargo ship Sea Horse less than 100 miles off Somalia , seizing a crew that was believed to number about a dozen .
Officials said pirates also fired automatic rifles and rocket - propelled grenades at the Liberian - flagged Safmarine Asia , which managed to escape .
The U.S. - flagged cargo ship Liberty Sun , owned by New York - based Liberty Maritime Corp. , was attacked by pirates firing grenades and automatic weapons .
The pirates did not board the Liberty Sun , which was carrying food aid and heading to Mombasa , Kenya , when it requested and received U.S. Navy assistance .

Newly installed Somali President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed said his government had a plan to bring piracy under control , similar to one he used to reduce the problem for a short time when he was in charge of the country in 2006 .
At the time , Ahmed led the Islamic Courts Union , a religious alliance that briefly unified southern Somalia until it was routed by Ethiopian troops .
“ We had a small force on land , a small force in the water , ” he said .
The courts backed them up with a pledge to execute pirates .
The six - month period marked the only time in the last five years that piracy subsided .
Somali officials want to dispatch 1,000 soldiers dedicated to chasing pirates into a handful of port cities .
They also want to create a 3,000 - person coast guard as part of a 10,000 - member security force .
But lack of money is preventing the new government from equipping and training the force .
United Nations and international support for the government has slowed to a trickle , they said , leaving it to operate on the $ 2 million a month it gets in port revenue .

During a visit to Mogadishu this week , Rep. Donald M. Payne ( D - N.J. ) said providing direct assistance to allow Somalis to crack down on pirates might cost the international community less , especially after accounting for rising insurance premiums and the cost of using warships .
“ It ’s a lot cheaper to deal with this on the land before these guys get into the water , ” Payne said .
He said he planned to seek funding in Congress .
Payne called the hesitation by the international community understandable .
Since 1991 , numerous transitional governments have risen and fallen in Somalia amid infighting , corruption and human rights abuses .
Donors want to see whether the current government does any better , he said .
Somalis say their hometown advantage makes them more effective at fighting piracy as well .
Advertisement
“ We are all Somalis , ” said Abdi Wali Alitaar , an entrepreneur based in the autonomous northern Puntland region who sells protection services to commercial shippers .
“ These guys would n’t dare kill us .
At most , they ’d probably run away .
But when they are facing the Americans , it ’s a different story . ”
Pirates have learned from experience that foreign naval ships wo n’t follow them into Somali waters .
“ But as Somalis , we do n’t hesitate to track them down on land , ” said M.A. Jama , chief executive at Dalkom , a telecommunications provider that has been combating pirate attacks as it tries to lay underwater cables .
One of his European shipping contractors wants to arrange for a French naval escort to guard its boats , but Jama is trying to convince it that Somali security guards would be a better deterrent .
“ If pirates see Somalis , they know when they get ashore , those guys will be waiting for them , ” Jama said .
Advertisement
Of course , U.S. , French or other foreign naval powers could also take the fight against pirates to Somali soil themselves , but such moves risk heightening anti-Western sentiment and creating a backlash against “ foreign occupiers , ” experts said .
Already many Somalis are angry about illegal foreign dumping and fishing off their coast .
The U.S. has launched airstrikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia over the last two years that witnesses said killed some civilians .
In the meantime , Somali government officials say the international community should move quickly .
Last year , pirates and their business partners netted at least $ 50 million in ransom .
They ’re reinvesting the money in better weapons and entrenching themselves in coastal communities by hiring young people and bribing elders .

In short , Somalis say , pirates are becoming richer and more powerful than the government .
Said Prime Minister Sharmarke : “ It ’s getting to the point where they are in a position to overthrow the government . ”

The impacts of aerosols on climate are significant , but also very uncertain .
There are several reasons for this , one of which is the uncertainty in how and how fast they are formed in the atmosphere by nucleation .
Here , in part I , I ’ll review some of the basic processes that are important in determining the climate effects of aerosols , focusing in particular on their formation .
This is also relevant in order to better understand –and hopefully quantify - the hypothetical climate effects of galactic cosmic rays which I ’ll discuss in a follow - up post .
Background
Aerosols are liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere ( but not including water droplets or ice crystals ) .
They can either be directly emitted into the atmosphere ( primary aerosols like dust ) , or they can be formed in the atmosphere by condensation ( secondary aerosol like sulfates ) .
Almost all of their properties , and thus effects , are size dependent :
The particle size governs the rate at which they fall out ( and thus atmospheric lifetime ) , their interaction with radiation , their impact on clouds , or even their health effects .
And they come in very different sizes , ranging from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers .
Some sites with good introductory explanations to aerosols and their climate effects are here , here and here ( German ) .
RC also had some posts on the same generic topic here and here .
Climate effects of aerosols
Aerosol particles can influence climate in several ways :
They scatter and absorb ( in the case of black carbon ) solar radiation ( direct effects ) .
They also act as cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) around which clouds can form , and thereby influence cloud reflectivity and cloud lifetime ( indirect effects ) .
Black carbon can have another indirect effect by changing the albedo of snow and ice , but that ’s not the topic of this post .
The aerosol indirect effects are the greatest source of uncertainty in assessing the human impact on climate change ( reviewed here .
The main idea is that more CCN causes liquid clouds to consist of more , but smaller , droplets .
The resulting cloud is more reflective ( first indirect effect ) .
Due to the smaller size of cloud droplets , the formation of precipitation may be suppressed , resulting in a longer cloud lifetime and larger cloud cover ( second indirect effect ) .
The mass of a freshly nucleated aerosol particle is more than 100,000 times smaller than that of an ‘ aged ’ aerosol of a size optimal to affect climate .
As a rule of thumb , particles have to grow past 100 nm ( 1 nm = 10 - 9 meters ) in order to become climatically active ; below this size they are not easily activated into a cloud droplet and they do n’t scatter solar radiation very efficiently .
It is thus not immediately obvious that the climate effects of aerosols will depend very strongly on nucleation ; the dependence is likely considerably damped , because a lot can happen to the aerosol particle as it comes of age .
Aerosol formation
The most prevalent trace gases do not generally nucleate new aerosols ( or even condense onto existing ones ) , because they are too volatile ( i.e. they have a high saturation vapor pressure and thus evaporate readily ) .
They first have to be oxidized ( usually under the influence of sunlight ) to produce a compound with a lower vapor pressure .
The prime example of this is the oxidation of sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) into sulfuric acid ( H 2 SO 4 ) , which has a very low vapor pressure .
The H 2 SO 4 can then condense together with water vapor ( and perhaps organic compounds and / or ammonia ) to form a stable cluster of molecules : A new particle is typically 1 - 2 nanometers in diameter .
Ions can also play a role , by lowering the energy barrier that needs to be overcome :
The attractive forces between the molecules are stronger when one of them is charged .
See here and here for a review of atmospheric nucleation processes .
Instead of nucleating into a new particle , H 2 SO 4 could also condense on an existing aerosol particle , making it grow in size .
Because of this competition for the vapor , nucleation is more likely to happen when there is only a little aerosol present .
Aerosol growth
Condensation of more vapor onto the nucleated aerosol makes it grow in size .
However , other processes hamper its possibility to grow large enough to substantially influence the climate :
Two aerosols can collide together , in a process called coagulation .
Coagulation is particularly efficient between very small nano - particles and larger particles ( of a few hundred nanometers ) .
It causes the bigger one to grow in size , whereas the smaller ( recently nucleated ) one disappears .
When there are a lot of very small aerosols around ( i.e. after a nucleation event ) , they can also coagulate together .
This causes them to grow in size , but decreases their number concentration .
The loss processes for the number of aerosols ( deposition and coagulation with bigger particles ) are stronger when they ’re very small .
Figure 1 : Different factors influence the extent to which nucleation contributes to the number of cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) .
( Figure partly based on AGU presentation by Jeff Pierce )
Measurements
New particle formation has been observed all over the globe , from the Poles to the Tropics , from urban to remote areas , and from surface sites to the upper troposphere ( see here for a review of such observations ) .
Of these locations , only nucleation in the free troposphere and in the vicinity of clouds seems to agree with theoretical predictions .
In most other cases the number of aerosol particles produced is under- predicted .
This has led to the development of semi-empirical approaches to describe nucleation .
Laboratory studies have typically found much stronger dependencies on H 2 SO 4 than atmospheric measurements .
A confounding factor is that newly formed particles of 1 to 2 nanometers can not be directly measured by commercially available instrumentation ( though there are new developments in this area ) .
Nucleation takes place in a kind of no - man ’s land between the gas and the liquid phase , about which we know surprisingly little .
Figure 2 : Measurements of an atmospheric nucleation and growth event in the Lower Fraser Valley , Canada .
The color gives the ( normalized ) number concentration , where the red color indicates the enhanced concentration of nucleated particles , growing into the CCN size range .
( from Mozurkewich et al. )
So what is needed for nucleation to occur ?
Favorable conditions include a strong source of condensable vapor ; high UV radiation intensity ; low aerosol surface area ; high relative humidity ; low temperature ; presence of ions ; and atmospheric mixing processes .
Under different environmental conditions , different nucleation mechanisms may be at work .
For example , in industrial plumes and over urban areas enough sulfuric acid may be present to form new particles and have them grow to a stable size .
Ammonia may neutralize the acidic cluster , and thereby help stabilizing it .
Over forested areas , the relative role of organic compounds is expected to be much larger ( though a strong correlation of nucleation events with sulfuric acid remains ) .
In coastal areas , iodine compounds are likely involved in the nucleation process .
In the upper troposphere , the ion density is usually larger , whereas the sulfuric acid concentration is lower .
The relative role of ion induced nucleation may therefore be larger up there .
The dominant role of sulfuric acid has remained a steady conclusion over the years , whereas the potential roles of organic compounds and ions are still hotly debated .
In part II , I ’ll discuss the potential importance of nucleation and of galactic cosmic rays for climate change .
The new draft surveillance bill is like an iceberg , with a vast bulk of technical change obscured beneath the surface .
Theresa May , the Home Secretary , presented the Investigatory Powers Bill to parliament as a measure " consolidating and updating our investigatory powers , strengthening the safeguards " .
But it amounts to a dramatic alteration in the powers already available not just to the intelligence services , but to police , tax inspectors , and officials and regulators in almost every department of state .
If enacted , it would replace several pieces of complex and technical legislation .
The real issue is the tens of thousands of surveillance actions a day carried out by officials .
The Bill is an iceberg .
It is easy to focus on the sunlight glinting on a few peaks , it is harder to grasp the important bits beneath the surface .
What is clear is that Parliament is expected to deal with all of this before the expiry of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers
Act at the end of 2016 – to swallow the iceberg before its dimensions can be fathomed .
It 's the curse of Hollywood :
We can't get new space opera movies unless they 're the resurrection of 1960s workhorse Star Trek .
And we can't explore artificial intelligence intelligently unless it 's a Battlestar Galactica adjunct .
Advertisement
I 've been realizing a lot lately that the only reason I 'm excited for both the new Star Trek movie and the new Caprica series is because of the territory they cover .
I do n't particularly want any more Trek , and I think I 've already hit my limit of Cylons and eye - twitching .
But I desperately want more movies featuring space battles .
And I would fervently greet any TV show that explores the themes of artificial intelligence and dead children ( among other things ) that Caprica is staking out .
Advertisement
I did n't actually realize until last week that Caprica did n't start its life as a BSG spinoff at all .
At Paleyfest , producer David Eick explained that co-writer Remi Aubuchon had pitched the show to the Sci Fi Channel as a new show about artificial intelligence .
And the Sci Fi execs thought that because of those A.I. themes , it would make a good continuation for BSG , and they told Aubuchon to work with Eick and Ronald D. Moore to revamp it into a BSG show .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Reading about that remark , I 'm now dying to see Aubuchon 's original pitch for Caprica , before the Adama family and the other BSG continuity baggage got shoe - horned in .
If you watch the pilot , it 's pretty obvious the Adama clan does n't fit - the storyline makes a lot more sense if you take them out .
In the pilot , Zoe Graystone dies in a terrorist bombing , but it turns out she found a way to scan her brain and create a virtual avatar with all her memories .
And then her grieving dad strives to load that avatar into a robot body , inadvertently helping to create a super - weapon .
It has a certain elegance , no ?
Until you shoehorn in the idea that Joseph Adama 's daughter could also be restored to life , based on her Facebook page and whatever other info Google can dig up .
Adding the BSG elements basically transforms this story into a giant " WTF " .
And I 'd be much more interested in seeing where Caprica goes - if I did n't already know where it ends up .
I can only really get super excited about Caprica if I pretend I have n't already seen the saga 's ending : Bob Dylan , gelatinous orbs , angels , mass shipicide , etc .
I actually enjoyed the pilot a lot , but I also kept wishing it would be its own thing , instead of a prequel for a show that had already spawned a history that was way too sweeping and nonsensical .
Advertisement
As for Star Trek , I 'm excited for it and hoping it does well - but a large amount of that excitement comes from the fact that I can count the number of space - opera movies in the past decade on a multiple amputee 's fingers .
There 's the Star Wars prequels , the Riddick films , maybe Supernova , Serenity ... and Star Trek : Nemesis .
I 'm reaching a bit here , and some of those films are barely space opera .
( I 'm thinking interstellar spaceships , ideally shooting at each other in space . )
Advertisement
Just imagine how cool it would be if there was a new movie about space captains venturing out into other star systems and getting into firefights with aliens or other space captains - and we did n't know what was out there , because it was a whole new universe .
Advertisement
So when I root for J.J. Abrams ' Star Trek to do well , I 'm really rooting for Hollywood to realize that there 's still a market for movies about people on super - awesome spaceships exploring , fighting , emoting and defying several laws of physics at once .
I 'm hoping that if Star Trek makes Dark Knight money , we 'll start seeing a slew of fatuous articles in Variety and the Hollywood Reporter quoting various execs as saying this proves the masses love faster - than - light travel and energy weapons .
And aliens with funny heads .
Please .
This is the real evil of franchises , after all : they subsume genres .
Space opera is a genre , not a franchise .
But these days , the only way we get to see space opera on the big screen ( or small , for that matter ) is as part of a franchise that someone has decided is still a cash cow .
And then you have that example , where the Sci Fi Channel hears a writer pitch a cool concept about artificial intelligence - and instead of saying " Hey , this could be the next Battlestar Galactica , " they say , " Hey , this could be turned into more Battlestar Galactica . "
Like stories about robots automatically need to be branded as BSG , or audiences wo n't " get " them .
Advertisement
Where does this stop ?
Do we eventually end up with just two or three franchises , with names like " Space Gloop " or " Time - Travel With Robots " ?
And heroes with names like " Captain Cocky Z. Valiant " ?
Does it eventually go full circle ?
Meaning , after franchises swallow up whole genres , do the franchises eventually melt down and become genres again ?
( I feel like this nearly happened to Star Trek already - Voyager and Enterprise managed to be utterly generic , even as they felt less and less connected to whatever Trek was originally about . )
Or maybe the process will just continue , as franchises eat each other and we eventually end up with just one mega - franchise , called " Blam " or " Spow " .
Anyway , consider this a plea : Continue Star
Trek for another 50 years , spawn another dozen Battlestar incarnations , I do n't mind at all .
But please , please give us some original space opera and self - aware robot stories on screen .
We 'll still like them even if they 're not an existing brand .
I promise !

the hypercube
A point is one dimensional .
A line ( the side of a plane ) is two dimensional .
A cube is three dimensional .
A " hypercube " is four dimensional .
The shadow of a line ( seen from above one end ) is a one - dimensional point .
The shadow of a cube ( seen from above one side ) is a two - dimensional plane .
So , too , the shadow of a hypercube is three dimensional .
If one were to turn it around in three dimensions , a cube can cast two - dimensional shadows of different shapes .
For example , the shadow of a cube seen from above the midpoint of one of its faces is a square .
The shadow of a cube seen from above one of its corners is a hexagon .
Etc .
So , too , as one rotates and reorients a hypercube in four dimensions , it casts three dimensional shadows of different shapes .
It is by the shapes of these shadows alone that we can rightly describe the movements of the hypercube .
Just as there are certain angles from which a cube can be viewed that cast regular shaped shadows ‹ the hexagon , the square , etc . ‹ so also are there certain angles and positions at which the hypercube will cast regular shaped three dimensional shadows .
One of these is , of course , the cube itself .
The angle at which the hypercube casts a cubic shadow I call " standard position . "
A hypercube also casts a regular solid shape at " nested position , " and the shape it casts then is a cube - within - a - cube .
This is shape is the one most commonly associated with the hypercube .
Here is a picture of the hypercube at " nested position " :
Another position at which the hypercube casts a regular shadow is what I call the " conjoined position . "
The shadow it casts at this position is a shape geometres know as a " tesseract . "
The word tesseract is another name for the hypercube .
Here is a picture of the " conjoined " hypercube 's shadow , the tesseract :
The last position at which the hypercube casts a regular shaped shadow which we will be dealing with here is called " antipode " position .
Like the cube - within - a- cube and the tesseract , the hypercube at antipode also consists of two cubes .
The " nested " cube - within - a - cube shows one cube within the other , a view as above one of the faces of the hypercube .
The " conjoined " tesseract shows one cube off - set from the other ( by diaganols ) and this is the view from above one of the hypercube 's corners .
The " antipode " position is a view from above one of the hypercube 's edges .
Here is a picture of the " antipode " position of the hypercube :
Remember , all of these regular solid shapes are only different shadows cast by the same hypercube .
The only difference is that the hypercube is being seen from different angles .
Just as a cube casts different shaped two dimensional shadows as it is rotated in three dimensional space , so , too , does the hypercube cast different shaped three dimensional shadows as it rotates in four - space .
The rotation of a hypercube differs from the rotation of a cube , however .
Because a hypercube is comprised of two cubes , each with the same volume , its rotation moves one of these cubes through the other .
Here is a picture showing a few stages of this process :
It should be remembered , however , that , just as the cube can be rotated around three axes of 3 - space , so does the hypercube rotate through itself along a 4 - d axis .
This means that , while the simple rotation depicted above is occuring between two cubes on opposite sides , the same rotation is actually occuring for the hypercube through 6 cubes , 3 opposite 3 .
Here is a computer rendering of the rotation of the hypercube :
Here is a depiction of a " slice " of a hypercube taken from one corner to the opposite corner :
Notice that the corner of the hypercube is a tetrahedron , that 1/4 through the hypercube is an octahedron , and that 3/4 through the hypercube is a zonehedral .
Discuss this section on the forums
applications of the hypercube
There are applications of the hypercube in many fields of study .
Consider the following lattice which explains a complex series of relationships in quantum mechanics :
Also , ancient Hebrew mystics , when looking for an alternative to the tetractys of Pythagoras , stumbled upon the hypercube at antipode position for their " tree of life " diagram .
Here , we see that each corner , or node , of the tree describes an attribute of YHVH , and that the twenty - two " paths " connecting these " sefirot " emanations are assigned to the twenty - two letters of the Hebrew alef - bet .
This arrangement is called the Gra .
The tree of life diagram may be better recognised by its later depiction , rendered by the Safed school of Ha QBLH , known as the Ari arrangement .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the hypercross
When an ordinary 3 - cube is unfolded , it forms a cross of six unit squares :
So it has been reckoned that when the hypercube is unfolded , it forms a cross of eight unit cubes .
Here , we see that the central cube is surrounded by six cubes , one for each side , plus a subtended eighth cube .
Here is a depiction of this type of hypercross by Salvador Dalí :
However , this type of hypercross is comprised of eight unit cubes , while the flat cross formed by the unfolded 3 - cube is only comprised of six unit squares .
Another tye of hypercross can be formed without the subtended eighth cube .
Like the unfolded 3 - cube , it has six cube sides around each side .
Here is a picture of it :
This type of hypercross should not be misunderstood as lacking the eighth subtended cube , however .
The eighth cube is simply hidden within this form of the hypercross , between the six surrounding cubes and the central seventh .
It is what is known as an " impossible " cube .
Here is a picture of the " impossible " cube in the hypercross :
This type of impossible cube was discovered , along with a similar impossible triangle , in the 20th century by mathematician Roger Penrose .
Such impossible shapes were then incorporated into the architectures depicted by Dutch artist Maurit Cornelius Escher :
This type of cube is called " impossible " because it cannot exist in three space , although it can be depicted two dimensionally .
Here is a wooden scultpure of the impossible cube .
It is comprised of two separate sculptures , one above and one below , and then photographed at an angle which allows them to appear as if they were a single cohesive whole .

PHI / PI
This diagram depicts a large part of what I work with on a daily basis .
It shows the orientation between what I consider , for shorthand notation , a pi and a phi spiral .
It should be noted that arithmetic expansion occurs unilinearly , as a diaganol vector on a cartesian coordinate graph .
Now , exponential expansion occurs when the exponent of the integer is increased .
For example , if one takes the exponential expansion of the numberline of arithmetic expansion , such that , 1^2 , 2^2 , 3^2 , etc ... where it then forms the summed numberline , such that , 1 , 4 , 9 , etc . ...
A third kind of expansion rate exists , however it has been considered more or less esoteric , because it forms a very specific inherent pattern when graphed .
This kind of expansion rate is associated with the Fibonnaci sequence of numbers , such that , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , etc ... where the rate of expansion is determined by the addition of only the preceding two numbers to form the sum digit third in the sequence .
When this sequence is graphed as points around an origin in a cartesian grid , it forms a spiral , and this spiral has been found everywhere throughout nature , from the branching patterns on plants to the proportions of the human body .
This is the pattern I call , for shorthand , phi .
Returning to exponential expansion , we find that , when graphed around the origin point in a cartesian graph , this type of expansion also forms a spiral pattern .
The difference between this , exponential , and the Fibonnaci spiral is that the exponential spiral is rectalinear , whereas the phi spiral progresses triangularly .
This type of spiral , which is rectalinear and exponential , is what I call , for notation , pi .
The difference between them is the solution to an equation I refer to as phi/pi .
Above the origin point , phi appears as the upper central spiral , and pi as the lower central spiral .

Now , I would like to take a moment to compare some self - evident facts that we can observe in nature .
I am not going to claim to have invented any of these things , as I hear doing so results in bad karma .
It is a self - evident fact , for example , that the seven basic colours of the spectrum of light ( red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet in order ) can be mapped onto the surface of a torus , or hypersphere , in only one way , such that each of the seven colours occupies the same area on the surface of the shape .
Now , once these colours have been mapped onto the surface of the torus , we see that the outline between each of the mapped areas forms a spiral that wraps around the surface of the hypersphere .
The spiral that outlines the seven coulour spectrum is , and this also is a completely self - evident fact and was not " invented " by any human hands , is a " phi " spiral .
Now , this " phi " spiral revolves AROUND the circumference of the torus ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) depending upon the rotation THROUGH the centre of the torus ( outward from centre or inward toward centre , respectively ) of the seven coloured areas mapped onto its surface .
In other words , the " phi " spiral revolves around the circmference as a MEASUREMENT of the surface of the torus .
It MEASURES the fourth - dimensionality of this shape by MOVING , that is , it changes over time , and is therefore , like the clock , a means of measuring the passage of the fourth dimension .
However , this MEASUREMENT is only of the SURFACE of the torus , measuring the revolution from the circumference ( seen from above ) to the centre .
This is a measurement of AREA , that is , of the combined seven areas of the mapped colour spectrum .
However , what if we measure the VOLUME of the torus , that is , the interior of the rotating radii of the hyersphere ?
Just as the " phi " spiral REVOLVES as it measures the SURFACE AREA , so too do we need a measurement device for the ROTATION of the INTERIOR VOLUME .
We know that , as the " phi " spiral " revolves " around the " top " and " bottom " of the hypersphere , so too , when we look at the torus from the " side " we see there is " rotation " of each radius , " right " or " left . "
Thus , just as the " revolution " of the " phi " spiral tells us about the external surface area , so too can the rotation of these radii tell us about the internal volume .
Now , when the " phi " spiral is revolving " clockwise " it means the torus is rotating " outward . "
When the " phi " spiral is revolving " counterclockwise " it means the torus is rotating " inward . "
But , just as the " top " rotates " inward " while the " bottom " rotates " otward , " yet there are not two phi spirals , only one continuous spiral measuring the external area , so , even though there are two radii " sides " that rotate " clockwise " or " counterclockwise " respectively , there are not two different spirals , one for each radius , one moving " clockwise " while the other moves " counterclockwise , " but only one cntinuous spiral measuring the internal volume .
So , we have " phi " measuring the outside , and another , single and continuous , spiral measuring the inside .
I call this spiral " pi " for short hand , but the spiral I mean when I refer to this spiral as " pi " is really the " spiral mirabilis " derived from " e , " the so - called " natural number . "
I have found that by dividing " phi " ( 1.1618 ) by " pi " ( 3.14 ) and adding one , you arrive at 1.37 , which is the same as the so - called " natural " number .
Therefore " e " would equal the combined " phi " ( exterior ) and " pi " ( interior ) spirals .
This would mean that , if " phi " was both clockwise and counterclockwise , and " pi " was both counterclockwise and clockwise , as in the torus , then the " natural " spiral would be equal to the combination of their motions , that is , would be the sum of their spin , expressable mathematically as e=phi / pi .
All of these observations arise from self - evident facts of nature .
None of them is my own personal invention , nor , I would posit , the " invention " of anyone other than the Creator of this universe , God .
Therefore , please feel at utter liberty to discuss these ideas with no worry that I will oppose your applications of them .
We are free here , and we are equal .
My own personal applications of this model , the " phi / pi " spiral model for the measurement of the fourth dimension and the hypershapes that exist therein , form the basis for my cosmological diagrams that I included with my published book , " the Metaphysician 's Desk Reference . "

Attentional Blink and the Stream of Consciousness
• Next article in this series : • Previous article : 18 Ways Attention Goes Wrong
Yesterday I was sitting in a park staring off into the distance , without a care in the world .
The park was empty , the sky blue , trees rustling ; a small lake shimmering in the distance , nudging its banks .
A lone figure approached across the grass , not yet identifiable as a man or a woman in the haze ; I returned to my reverie , lulled by the air sliding across my brow , lost to sensation .
Then in an instant the figure , now obviously a man , was not 5 metres away , striding towards me .
He had travelled 50 metres in what seemed like the blink of an eye .
My muscles tensed and I prepared to defend myself .
He reached where I sat , then turned away , following the path past and away from me , leaving me looking both surprised and foolish .
It was obvious I had been distracted for much longer than I thought — long enough for the man to walk 50 metres — but still it felt to me as though he had covered the distance in an instant .
In fact the man had simply fallen through the cracks in my consciousness .
Attentional blink
Just how frequent these cracks are is demonstrated by a classic study which was the first in the psychological literature to report the phenomenon of ‘ attentional blink ’ ( Broadbent and Broadbent , 1987 ) .
These researchers were inspired by unpublished reports that participants in psychology studies , after focusing their attention on a particular target , showed a strange gap in their attention — a kind of blind spot .
To examine it Broadbent and Broadbent flashed up a series of five - letter words to participants at about 10 every second and asked them to search for two particular words .
Normally people are remarkably good at this sort of test despite the words only being shown for a tenth of a second — they will usually spot about 80 % of the targets .
But what Broadbent and Broadbent found was that when one target followed the other in quick succession ( less than half a second apart ) participants did n’t notice the second item and the average proportion of correct reports went down to almost 0 % .
It was as though participants ’ attention had ‘ blinked ’ for half a second after spotting the first target and so they did n’t notice the second .
This phenomenon has subsequently been extensively examined and even found in the auditory domain ( Koelewijn & Van der Burg , 2007 ) .
One strong explanation for it is a processing bottle - neck .
When spotting the first thing we ’re looking for it takes an attentional effort to focus on it .
This maxes out the brain ’s processing abilities for as much as half a second , during which time our attention is effectively blinking .
During that half a second it ’s as though the unconscious is knocking on the door of consciousness to report something interesting .
Effectively it takes us half a second to answer the door and see who ’s there , but in the meantime we do n’t notice the phone ringing and the kettle boiling .
The stream of consciousness ?
What the attentional blink demonstrates is the illusory component of our everyday experience of consciousness .
We experience the world as one long continuous stream of thoughts , feelings and events , each neatly seguing into the next .
But the existence of the attentional blink points to a somewhat different story .
Our brains are actually paying attention to one event or thing which swallows up our attention , blocking out other inputs for short periods , then it releases and fixates on something else .
In this sense consciousness is less of a smooth stream and more of a bumpy ride .
Reading is a good analogy .
When we read the conscious experience is of the eye gliding smoothly across the page .
In fact the eye is rapidly saccading , fixating every 7 - 9 characters — a fact bourne out by eye - tracking studies .
Just as the difference between the experience of reading and how it really works is huge , so the difference between the experience of attention and how it really works is also huge .
For good or ill we are caught in a world of metaphorical attentional blinks which , like literal eye - blinks , we usually do n’t notice because consciousness papers over the cracks .

What makes parachuting dangerous ?
It might be thought that it is the risk that the parachute wo n’t open , but in a dissertation he is defending at Umeå University in Sweden on March 27 , Anton Westman shows that carelessness or lack of skill in controlling your body or your parachute through the air is considerably more dangerous .
In both skydiving ( jumping from aircraft ) and BASE jumping ( from stationary objects ) , instability in free fall is a fatal risk factor .
Jumping from an airplane into the wind rushing by feels roughly like diving into a swift current of water , and there is a risk that beginners will lose control and start tumbling around in the new environment , which can lead to unstable activation of the parachute with subsequent tangling of its lines and even late parachute activation .
When you jump from the ledge of a cliff , it ’s not as windy , but this can in fact be a danger , since for the first few seconds you do n’t get any help from rushing wind to control your body and straighten up if you should fall forward and start tumbling around .
Just as in skydiving , there is a risk of unstable or late parachute activation .
An extra risk factor in BASE jumping is that a wing parachute can open in such a way that it steers you toward the object you jumped from .
The fatality risk in Swedish skydiving between 1994 and 2003 was roughly one death per one hundred thousand jumps .
The fatality risk in BASE jumping appears to be about 60 - 90 times as great as in skydiving , and the dissertation urges jumpers to be cautious in pursuing this activity .
Wing parachutes are formed in different ways for different types of parachuting .
BASE parachutes are constructed for landing at low speeds in difficult terrain , whereas certain types of wing parachutes for skydiving are designed for opposite reasons , for flying and landing at speeds of over 100 km per hour , roughly like small sailplanes made of cloth .
They place great demands on the judgment and skill of the parachutist .
The dissertation shows that many injuries are a result of “ pilot error ” on the part of the jumper .
Besides miscalculated landings , collisions between wing parachutes have also led to injuries and deaths .
Further fatal and non-fatal risks are described in the dissertation , with suggestions for dealing with each .
Injury prone body parts include legs , feet , the spine , and shoulder joints .
Beginners run a greater risk of getting hurt , but the most serious injuries are described among the most experienced jumpers .
An interview study describes the views of a number of parachutists regarding the risk of injury and their motives for pursuing the sport .
What stand out are depictions of its recreational value , of “ having fun , ” as a main reason .
It really has not happened yet .
A team has yet to lose one of their best players to injury as a result of playing in The World Baseball Classic .
It is going to happen one of these years and it will change the format of this international tournament .
The first place you are going to see a difference is in player contracts .
When a free agent comes to a team , you are going to start noticing lingo stating that a said player must not play in these types of tournaments .
I ’m sure Donald Fehr and the gang will fight this , but simply put , if I am paying someone $ 10 million per year , I should be allowed to say whether or not that player can participate in such events .
It is already in contracts that players can’t water ski , ride a motorcycle , chop wood , etc .
This tournament hurt almost every pitcher who participated in 2006 .
It will be interesting to see of this trend continues .
In my opinion , it is important for a pitcher to go to spring training and slowly build stamina over 40 days to endure the rigors of an entire MLB season .
Historically , pitchers who get hurt in the Spring , rarely have a complete and / or productive season .
By pushing a pitcher like Roy Oswalt to throw an extra twenty pitches against Venezuela , you are not doing the Astros any favors .
I love watching these games .
It is like a mini all - star game for most teams .
Cuba and the Asians have their own talent pool .
The Domenicans , Americans , Venezuelans , Canadians , and Puerto Ricans , are loaded with contracted major league talent .
The players like to skip school to play in it , the fans love it , but somewhere mid to upper management cringes and loathes what this tournament can potentially ruin for a whole team with one injury .
It has n’t happened yet , but when it does , look for the new format called The World Amateur Baseball Challenge .
The Cleveland Indians just spent plenty to sign Mark DeRosa to be their new third baseman .
DeRosa banged a two - out two - run triple in the fourth inning last night putting the USA back in the game .
If DeRosa pulls his groin sliding and misses 3 - 6 weeks , how happy is GM Mark Shapiro with the tournament ?

Yeah , you may say that 's kind of dirt baggy but you gotta admit I got some great photos .
And hey , it was published in the Boston Globe and quickly became a popular internet meme as well !
I must have seen my photos on 5 separate message boards yesterday just minutes after they were published .
I probably should 've shouted out , " Hey , that ice is fucking slippery ! " instead of crouching down with my Nikon and snapping away even once your head had bounced off the glacial pavement but , you know , whatevs .
Point is --- I dig your shit .

Key parts of a £ 12.7 bn programme to upgrade the NHS 's information technology are on the brink of failure , a powerful cross-party group of MPs warned today .
The Commons public accounts committee ( PAC ) said recent progress in deploying a new care records system to hospitals across England was " very disappointing " .
The system was supposed to link 30,000 GPs to nearly 300 hospitals across England , providing NHS staff with instant access to the medical notes of 50,000 patients at every stage of diagnosis , treatment and discharge .
The NHS is currently forecasting a completion date of 2014 - 15 - four years later than originally planned .
But the MPs said even this revised schedule looks over - optimistic .
By the end of last year , no hospital was yet able to use the Lorenzo version of the care records software , which had been due to operate throughout the north , Midlands and east of England .
The committee said : " There must be grounds for serious concern as to whether Lorenzo can be deployed in a reasonable timescale . "
Plans to instal an alternative Millenium system in the south of England were also in doubt after the government terminated the contract of the service provider Fujitsu .
The committee said : " The programme is not providing value for money at present . . .
Unless the position on care records system deployments improves appreciably in the very near future ( ie within the next six months ) , the Department of Health should assess the financial case for allowing [ hospital ] trusts to put forward applications for central funding for alternative systems . "
The MPs also called on the department to spell out how it will punish staff who breach the security procedures that are supposed to stop patients ' confidential medical information falling into the wrong hands .
They said : " Ultimately data security and confidentiality rely on the actions of individual members of NHS staff in handling care records and other patient data .
To help provide assurance , the department and the NHS should set out clearly the disciplinary sanctions that will apply in the event that staff breach security procedures . "
Edward Leigh , the PAC's Conservative chairman , said : " It is worrying that , if trusts decide not to deploy the patient care records systems , the taxpayer can still be obliged to make payments to the suppliers concerned . "
Responding to the committee , the NHS Confederation said hospitals are frustrated by delays in introducing the care records system .
Nigel Edwards , the policy director , added : " The time is quickly approaching to make tough decisions on what the future of the project should be ...
Many of our members still do not know if they are going to get a system that works or does the things they want it to . "
The Department of Health defended the IT programme .
It said : " New IT systems in the NHS are delivering better , safer and faster care .
Current costs have declined because of the delays to implementation due mainly to adding extra functions to the system .
Costs are also controlled by the contracts which only pay to providers once the service has been successfully delivered . "
Pelosi briefed on waterboarding in ' 02 [ UPDATED ]
Nancy Pelosi denies knowing U.S. officials used waterboarding — but GOP operatives are pointing to a 2007 Washington Post story which describes an hour - long 2002 briefing in which Pelosi was told about enhanced interrogation techniques in graphic detail .
Two unnamed officials told the paper that Pelosi , then a member of the Democratic minority , did n't raise substantial objections .
Joby Warrick and Dan Eggen wrote :
In September 2002 , four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody .
For more than an hour , the bipartisan group , which included current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , was given a virtual tour of the CIA 's overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk .
Among the techniques described , said two officials present , was waterboarding , a practice that years later would be condemned as torture by Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill .
But on that day , no objections were raised .
Instead , at least two lawmakers in the room asked the CIA to push harder , two U.S. officials said .
UPDATE : A Pelosi spokesman passes along her response to the article when it first appeared , claiming that Pelosi 's successor on the intel committee -- Yep , Jane Harman -- lodged a protest with the CIA when she learned waterboarding was in use .
" On one occasion , in the fall of 2002 , I was briefed on interrogation techniques the Administration was considering using in the future .
The Administration advised that legal counsel for the both the CIA and the Department of Justice had concluded that the techniques were legal .
I had no further briefings on the techniques .
Several months later , my successor as Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee , Jane Harman , was briefed more extensively and advised the techniques had in fact been employed .
It was my understanding at that time that Congresswoman Harman filed a letter in early 2003 to the CIA to protest the use of such techniques , a protest with which I concurred . "
Lower down in the article , the authors and their sources acknowledge Pelosi & Co. were severely constrained in what they could do with the information — and had no way of knowing how the techniques would ultimately used or abused in a pre-Abu Gharaib era .
Congressional officials say the groups ' ability to challenge the practices was hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited them from being able to take notes or consult legal experts or members of their own staffs .
And while various officials have described the briefings as detailed and graphic , it is unclear precisely what members were told about waterboarding and how it is conducted .
Several officials familiar with the briefings also recalled that the meetings were marked by an atmosphere of deep concern about the possibility of an imminent terrorist attack .
" In fairness , the environment was different then because we were closer to Sept. 11 and people were still in a panic , " said one U.S. official present during the early briefings .
" But there was no objecting , no hand - wringing .
The attitude was , ' We do n't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people . ' "

Study finds universal health care would cost less than bailouts Joe Byrne
Published : Sunday March 1 , 2009

The biggest obstacle to an enhanced national health care system would n't be money , a study conducted by the Institute for Health and Socio- economic Policy found .
The transformation of America 's current health care system into a single - payer ' Medicare for all ' system could cost six times less than the bank bailouts .
This week , Barack Obama is expected to start movement on an ambitious overhaul of the country 's health care system .
Previous attempts at reform by FDR , Truman , Kennedy , Johnson , and Clinton have proved largely unsuccessful .
46 million Americans are without insurance , ABC reports , and the US spends twice as much on health care than the average developed nation , most of which work with universal health care .
Critics of the current system point to the government treating health care as if it was a commodity , not a social service ; because of the demands of the market , insurance companies have a motivation to avoid unprofitable patients .
Obama 's plan , to be laid out in detail this week , will cost $ 634 b out of the new overall budget .
In addition , $ 175 b that was to be payment to private insurers for the coverage of 10 million Medicare patients will be re-allocated over the next ten years ' for health care reform .
Yesterday , he asked Kathleen Sebellius to become his new Health and Human Services secretary .
Scheduled on Thursday is a nonpartisan health care summit at the White House .
" The cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough .
So let there be no doubt : health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year , " Obama told Congress on Tuesday .
Single - payer national health insurance is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health financing , but delivery of care remains largely private .
The Institute for Health and Socio-economic Policy ( IHSP ) is a non-profit research group for the National Nurses Organizing Committee .
According to the analysis of their proposal for a single - payer universal health care system , IHSP found that full medicare benefits for all  would have these immediate effects : * $ 317 billion in increased business and public revenues throughout the US economy .
* 2,613,495 new permanent jobs , at an average of $ 38,262 per year .
* $ 100 billion in additional employee compensation .
* $ 44 billion in increased tax revenue .
The biggest impact of the proposal would be coverage for the 46 million uninsured Americans , but ' Medicare for all ' would also get rid of the current chaos of eligibility , exclusions , family coverage , premium costs , and high out - of - pocket expense ,  unenviable consequences of the present system .
The full report can be found here .
A similar proposal for single - payer national health insurance was published by the American Medical Association in 2003 .
That study found that national health insurance would save the US $ 200 b by eliminating the high overhead and profits of the private , investor - owned insurance industry and reducing spending for marketing and other satellite services . 
The debate over which health care system is best for America will almost certainly intensify in the coming weeks .

Just how lucrative is GameStop 's used games business ?
For every dollar of revenue from pre-owned games and consoles , the company gets 48 cents of gross profits -- that 's a margin of nearly 50 percent .
Overall , GameStop 's total revenue climbed to $ 8.8 billion in the fiscal year ending 31 January 2009 , up from $ 7.1 billion in the previous fiscal year , an increase of 24 % .
In fact , GameStop 's revenue for the past year was 2.8 times the size of its revenue just three years ago .
And , as part of a larger Gamasutra - exclusive analysis on the state of GameStop 's business , analyst Matt Matthews explains that gross profit margin is the gross profit divided by total revenue .
For example , Matthews explains , if you take in revenue of $ 60 on a unit of software and that software originally cost you $ 54 to obtain , then you have $ 60 in revenue and $ 6 in gross profit or $ 6/$ 60 = 10 % gross profit margin .
New software generates tremendous revenue for GameStop , but the cost of goods for new software is likewise somewhat high .
Used products , on the other hand , cost GameStop less to purchase , stock , and distribute .
In particular , it can be resold at much higher values than purchased or traded in for .
Thus , GameStop 's margins as cents of gross profit per dollar of revenue ( e.g. 10 � for each dollar of revenue ) can be calculated , as follows :
This figure hammers home just how lucrative used product sales are for GameStop .
On average , they get 48 � of gross profit for each dollar of used product revenue .
The " Other " category includes high - margin accessories , and of these , GameStop gets to keep almost 34 � for each dollar of sales .
As is widely known in the industry , GameStop 's used game sales are far more profitable than its sales of new games ; new software and hardware yield margins of 21 � and 6� , respectively .
These margins are actually relatively static from year to year for GameStop , Matthews explains .
However , with rocketing revenues overall , the full article notes that used product accounts for somewhere between 41 and 46 percent of GameStop 's gross profit .
In the last fiscal year , gross profit on used product almost reached $ 1 billion for the first time in the company 's history .
( The exact figure was $ 974.5 million , or 42.9 % of the company 's total gross profit . )
Virtual machines can seem juuuuust a bit too geeky for most otherwise computer - friendly people .
That 's sad , because it's an easy , free way to try another operating system , or use those one or two apps you can't get on yours .
And you can do it all separate from your current setup .

What 's virtualization ?
Why get that nerdy ?
Virtualization is a whole computer concept unto itself , at least on the server / enterprise / big - fancy - corporate level .
For home users , talk about " virtual machines " generally refers to x86 virtualization .
Basically , it 's software that allows an entire operating system ( the " guest " ) to run on another OS ( the " Host " ) , whether in a container window , or full - screen , or in what 's sometimes called a " seamless " mode , where just one application is run from the " guest "
Advertisement
Why would you want to run a virtual machine on your computer ?
Plenty of reasons :
You like using one OS , but need just an app or two from another running in their natural environments —
Office or Photoshop in Windows ( nine times out of 10 ) , a light - on - resources game , or maybe even some uber - cool Linux app .
You want to try out some new software , but would rather not chance it mucking up the pretty decent system you 've got right now .
Web sites that do n't play nice with the operating system you 're running ( we 're looking at you , almost every streaming site except Hulu and YouTube ) .
You 're intrigued at the idea of trying out a Linux desktop , but the word " partitioning " does n't sound like how you want to spend a Saturday afternoon .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
For those and many other good reasons , we 're going to walk through installing VirtualBox , a free , open - source virtualization tool offered for Windows , Mac , and Linux desktops , and then get virtual copies of Windows XP and Ubuntu running inside them .
Installing Windows Vista ( Ultimate or Business only , unfortunately ) or the Windows 7 beta is about the same process , and almost any Linux distribution is friendly as a virtual machine , but this will give you an understanding of the basic process .
Before you even ask , by the way , you can't run OS X as a guest system on Windows or Linux , but the VirtualBox can run most anything else — including those pre-rolled virtual images you find laying around the internet .
I have to note here that VirtualBox is far from the only competitor in this field — in fact , many in the tech community report that VMWare 's Workstation offers more features and handles multiple virtual machines better .
But VirtualBox is relatively easy to set up , free to install , and works on all three major operating systems .

Setting up

First off , head over to VirtualBox 's Download page and grab the right copy for your system .
The only real choice falls on Linux users having to choose between 32 - and 64 - bit versions for their particular distribution — you do n't want to run a 64 - bit guest on a 32 - bit host machine , if you can avoid it .
Linux users should note that while there may be a version of VirtualBox available in their repository , it 's usually the Open Source Edition , which may not be as up - to - date as the VirtualBox download page , and does n't offer support for USB devices , along with a few other odds and ends .
Advertisement
Click through the install screens ; in most cases , you wo n't have to stop and change anything .
You 'll probably get a warning that VirtualBox will have to disconnect and re-connect your network connection for a few seconds while it 's setting up , so finish up any crucial net transfers .
Advertisement
During setup on Windows , you 'll be asked to install " device software " or " drivers " — hit " Install " for each , or check the box that indicates you 'll " Always trust ... "
Sun 's drivers .
Once VirtualBox is installed , launch it and you 'll arrive at a tauntingly empty screen :

Setting up
Let 's get something running in there .
One big advantage of virtual machines over partitioning , dual - booting , and all that other hard - drive - tweaking stuff is the ability to install a system right from an ISO file .
So if you 're testing out a Linux system , just download the ISO from Ubuntu , Fedora , or wherever .
And if you 've got an older XP installation disc , you can slipstream the latest service pack into it to create a minimal - hassle installation ISO image , and never bother burning it .
While you 're at it , check out Adam 's guide to trimming down Windows to the bare essentials for a real speedy virtual installation ISO .
If you 've got your installation CD or DVD , however , that 'll play , too .

Hit " New " and you 'll be asked to give your system a name you 'll recognize — in my case , an XP system I 'll unleash all my morning Lifehacker test downloads on — and let VirtualBox know generally what variety and flavor it is .
Linux users trying out a funky remix can head for Linux -> Other Linux .

This next screen asking for a memory allocation seems imposing — I wo n't give it enough !
I 'll kill my host system with too much !— but you can entirely change it later on .
VirtualBox will recommend a minimum amount , based on the OS you said you were installing , but your common sense will pay off here .
I 'm usually not running anything intensive on my system with 2GB of memory , so if lost half a GB , or 512MB , I 'd probably not notice much .
Your mileage will certainly vary , but try peeling off as much as you can at first , then scale it back if you notice your system becoming unstable , or bump it up if you get frustrated with a lag - tastic system - in - a - system .

The next screen asks you to either create a new hard disk image or use an existing one .
Assuming this is a first install , keep Boot Hard Disk checked and hit Next to create the image .
Hit Next again at the start of the " New Virtual Disk Wizard " ( they keep changing the name from " Virtual " to " image , " but it 's all the same ) , then you 'll be asked to choose a dynamically expanding image or a fixed - size storage .
This depends on how much space you 're willing to give your virtual OS .
Do you have just 8 GB you want to give over , and do n't want it reaching past that ?
Choose the fixed - size option , set a size amount in gigabytes , and relax .
Or you can choose " dynamically expanding , " which , just like it sounds , allots only a little bit of space at first , but will re-report itself to the virtual system as bigger if the OS needs a bit more space .
If you happen to have multiple SATA hard drives in your system , or a fast external SATA , the How - To Geek recommends placing your virtual machine image ( the " guest " ) on a separate physical drive from the machine running it ( the " host " ) for better multi-tasking and performance speed , plus a little less wear on a single hard drive .
If not , do n't worry about it too much , and do n't go creating separate partitions for your machines , because you are n't fooling anybody , least of all your system 's I /O bus .

Booting up
Assuming everything went well , you 'll see your new virtual system in the left - hand pane of the VirtualBox window .
Huzzah !
But before you hit " start , " let 's hit " Settings " and get it ready to roll the right way .
The first category from the left - hand menu , General , lets you change how much base memory ( or RAM ) and video memory is given over to the virtual machine .
Unless you 're planning to enable 3D effects , the default chosen for video memory should be fine , and the 3D acceleration box can remain un-checked .
Let 's move down to " CD / DVD - ROM . "
Advertisement
Make sure " Mount CD / DVD Drive " is checked .
If you 're going to install your virtual system from a boot CD or DVD , put it in your computer 's drive , then select " Host CD / DVD Drive . "
If you 're using a downloaded or custom - made ISO file , select " ISO Image file , " hit the folder icon to the right of the drop - down box , and then hit the " Add " button and browse for the ISO you 're using .
Once you 've added an ISO file to this menu , you can mount it in any virtual machine you 're running at any time — kind of a nice feature for files you need to get at often .
Hit " Select " to close this dialog .
Advertisement
Back at the main Settings window , head down to the Audio and / or USB menus and enable them if you 're going to be needing sound or access to thumb / external drives while you 're in your OS - in - a - box .
Before we get to the " Shared Folders , " which is pretty darned convenient , let 's boot our system .
Hit OK and close out your Settings window , then hit Start back at the main box to get rolling .
Whatever ISO or disc you 've supplied VirtualBox with will load just like it's on a machine for the first time , and you 'll go through the same installation process as if you were loading Windows / Linux / whatever on a hard drive for the first time .
You 'll get occasional pop-ups from VirtualBox , " notifying " you that a mouse pointer is now in such - and - such a mode , the video display has changed , yada , yada — just hit OK and check the boxes so it does n't bother you further .
Click through all the usual name / username / password / registration jazz you 're used to ...
All done ?
Great .
After however many reboots , you 'll arrive at your fresh , clean desktop , which you could start using right away .
You might notice , however , that the resolution is limited , the mouse might be jerky , and your sound or USB might not work out of the box .
That 's where the Guest Additions come in .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Head to the " Devices " menu at the top of the virtual OS window ( if you 've accidentally gotten into full - screen mode , hit right - Control + F to switch out ) and choose " Install Guest Additions . "
In a virtual Windows , you 'll get a prompt like you were installing software you just downloaded ; if not , you can open My Computer , open up the CD drive named " VirtualBox Guest Additions , " and run the auto - run software in there .
In a virtual Linux , you may just get a CD or DVD mounted and displayed on the desktop .
Each Linux system will be slightly different , but the Tombuntu blog 's instructions for installing VirtualBox Guest Additions in Ubuntu hold mostly true : head to where the ISO is mounted as a CD / DVD drive , then run VBoxLinuxAdditions - x86.run ( or the - amd64 version for 64 - bit systems ) .
Click through everything , restart your system , and things should be a lot more convenient :
Your virtual desktop resizes itself to however big you make its window , the mouse does n't get " captured " and require un-locking when you click around , and everything should be a bit smoother .
You 've got a well - oiled virtual machine at this point , but let 's make it real easy to pass files between your host and guest systems ( terminology should be making sense at this point , no ? ) .
The VirtualBox makers have described the process for Windows and Linux users in a FAQ post , and I 've described the virtual - Windows - inside - Linux process in more detail in our guide to running Windows apps seamlessly inside Linux .
Giannis Tsakiris has also explained setting up sharing from an XP guest , and the process is much the same for any virtual Windows ( although some of the network tools have changed names ) .

Now you 're up and running with a machine you do n't have to feel bad about messing with , or which lets your run the few apps you need in one OS while enjoying the benefits of the one you really want to work in .

Update # 1 :
Sony ’s rumored plans for a new PSP supposedly dubbed the PSP Go ! — may also usher in a new wave of games becoming digital downloads for the device .
That includes , allegedly , the long - awaited arrival of Gran Turismo Mobile .
According to 1UP ’s report on the oft - rumored PSP - 4000 / PSP Go ! , Sony will be releasing about 100 new and classic PSP games in downloadable form on the PlayStation Store when the new PSP launches .
1UP even writes that Polyphony Digital ’s Gran Turismo Mobile is “ said to be one of the premier launch titles . ”
Announced in 2004 , there ’s been little mention of the portable racing simulator , with Polyphony boss Kazunori Yamauchi saying the title was still “ moving forward ” last November .
With two alleged storage options available ( 8GB and 16GB ) , future PSP owners may have to budget their internal storage space wisely , unless Sony has something clever planned for managing all those downloads .
1UP says it expects
Sony to announce the new hardware at E3 , just mere weeks away .
New Details of Sony ’s oft - rumored revision to its PlayStation Portable may have been leaked a little earlier than the company was expecting , as chatter of the PSP Go ! appear to have leaked a few days early .
According to the initially uploaded most recent episode of the ” at1UP ” podcast , Sony will soon be announcing the PSP Go ! , with some of the web site ’s staff having already seen the device .
The podcast goes on to describes the new hardware iteration as having “ slide out ” or “ flip out ” controls , as well as a larger screen .
The biggest point of contention among 1UP staffers appeared to be the name of the new hardware , lightly derided as “ PSP Go exclamation point . ”
That episode has since been edited to remove mention of the PSP Go !.
If true , the description of the new hardware appears to jibe with previous rumored mentions of the “ PSP - 4000 ″ which is allegedly planning to drop the system ’s UMD drive in favor of internal storage .
With more and more PSP games going digital download only — and additional loose talk of in - store kiosks that would allow gamers to rip UMD games to a storage device — that particular rumor is starting to look more feasible .
Sony itself surveyed PlayStation fans on what features they ’d like to see in a new PSP earlier this year , hinting at the possibility of built - in storage , a touchscreen interface and built - in keyboard .
The arrival of the new PSP hardware is expected to hit before the holidays , according to reports .
“ We have n’t announced any new PSP hardware and ca n’t comment on rumors or speculation , ” an SCEA rep told Kotaku when reached for clarification .
Thanks to PJ and Mr. Wednesday for the heads up .

PORTAGE , Ind . ( AP ) 
A school bus driver has been charged with felony child neglect for allegedly doing nothing to stop three teenage boys from terrorizing female students on his route .
Court documents say Terry Burch , 67 , of Portage , failed to prevent physical abuse to the girls or failed to report it .
The documents filed Friday also say Burch did nothing when the three boys — two 17 - year - olds and one 16 - year - old — threatened Burch and others , exposed their genitals on the bus , exposed their buttocks to passing motorists , ignited a flammable body spray and created other disruptions .
Burch denied knowing such behavior was occurring on the bus , said Cpl. Troy Williams , a Portage Township schools resource officer .
A message seeking comment left Saturday at Burch 's home was not immediately returned .
Burch told the Portage Township School Board on Monday that drivers cannot see what happens in the back of buses and that no parents notified him of problems .
One girl who claims to have been repeatedly groped on the bus told officers she reported the abuse to Burch more than once .
The 16 - year - old faces juvenile charges of sexual battery and attempted sexual battery .
One 17 - year - old faces charges of strangulation and intimidation , and the other is charged with sexual battery .
Porter County Prosecutor Brian Gensel is seeking to have the boys ' cases moved to adult court .

The news , that UBS The Swiss Bank is going to reveal customer data to the IRS was not only a blow to the Swiss banking sytem , but to Switzerland as a whole .
There was a move to make banking secrecy constitutional and thus part of the political make - up of the whole country .
It was renounced but the privacy provisions of the constitution in article 13 are decidedly meant to apply to banking matters , of course .
Then there is the law .
The banking secrecy law is handled very strictly .
Christoph Meili , the whistleblower in the “ dormant accounts ” - affair had to seek political asylum in the US after uncovering that banks illegally shredded papers that may have helped finding the owners of orphaned accounts , that is to say the legal owners of the money within those accounts .
The name of Christoph Meili sounds to a Swiss banker like “ Lord Voldemort ” to Ron Weasley .
What is the big deal ?
It ’s data of some 300 customers and it ’s only one bank right ?
Wrong .
First of all the oversight agency has decided to go forth and order the release of the data even though the persons affected by this decision have not yet exhausted their legal procedural opportunities .
This signals , obviously , that Swiss banks need not obey Swiss law and , if the pressure is heavy , wo n’t act according to law .
Forget trust .
Second , the banking system itself , is , in part , working on the premise that people who have money do n’t want to share it by paying taxes .
Like bootleggers got rich because there will always be a demand for booze , the Swiss banks cater to the demand for tax havens .
They use the fact that in Switzerland Tax avoidance is a misdemeanor and not a crime and argue only actual tax fraud requires legal assistance to foreign countries .
Well , yesterday the US announced that a couple of hundred customers ’ data was n’t their idea of collaboration and are now asking for the details of 52’000 US citizens who have undeclared Swiss bank acccounts .
The European Union used the moment and demanded the same treatment for their requests and British PM Gordon Brown just declared war on all tax havens .
The Swiss are in panic mode now .
While their banks claim to have all the experience and professionalism that comes with being a high ranking banking place , noone knows how many possibly toxic accounts they are still holding and if they are prepared to switch to on - shore banking only , on short notice .
The advantage of being an off - shore destination is gone , they will have to compete with all the other banks on an equal footing now .

The pirates apparently mistook the FGS Spessart for a commercial merchant ship when they targeted it in the Gulf of Aden , between Somalia and Yemen .
The German supply ship pursued the pirate boat , joined by two other ships , a frigate , a helicopter and a plane .
A Nato spokesman said : " Poor judgment by the pirates turned out to be a real opportunity for seven nations representing three task forces to work together and strike a momentous blow for maritime safety and security . "
A boarding team discovered several weapons and transferred seven suspected pirates on to another German frigate .
Nato said the suspects will remain on board until a decision is made as to where they will be prosecuted .
A sail that increases atmospheric drag could force rocket stages out of orbit more quickly , reducing the problem of space debris ( Image : ESA )
THE risk to spacecraft from a collision with space debris could be reduced by equipping launchers with a gossamer - thin “ sail ” .

When I was in high school back in the 80s , I worked at Taco Bell .
Work was not really tough at Taco Bell , so I had lots of time to goof off .
One of the things I discovered was that the hot sauce would clean pennies .
I 've showed the trick to people many times over the years , but never
really understood why it works so well .
I looked on the internet and found a wide variety of explanations from the silly ideas ,
like the idea the somehow hydrochloric acid is forming to the more reasonable ideas
involving the acid already in the sauce .
None of them seemed to make complete sense to me .
I decided to do a little investigative journalism and find out .
First I gathered up a bunch of fairly tarnished pennies .
The ones on the right are tarnished and the ones on the left are clean and shiny .
Here is a close - up to compare the clean penny with the dirty ones .
I knew that oxygen in the air reacted with the copper on the penny and
formed a copper oxide that appears as the dull finish .
Here 's a close up to show how a partially cleaned penny compares to
both clean and dirty pennies .
So here is the good stuff , both hot and mild Taco Bell hot sauce .
Back in the day , the sauce used to come in little tubs you could drop the
coins into .
Today it 's all about the mini-packet .
The sauce tastes the same to me , so I do n't think they changed much .
Taco
Bell hot sauce is made from the following ingredients :
Water , Tomato Paste , Jalapeno Peppers , Vinegar , Salt , Spices ,
Dehydrated Onions , Xanthum Gum , Sodium Benzoate , and Natural Flavor .
Now I think we can rule out water , but somehow , the other ingredients clean pennies .
Looking at the tiny amounts of Xanthum Gum , Sodium Benzoate , and Natural Flavor ,
I 'm going to rule those out too .
That leaves the following things to create the copper cleaning action :
Tomato Paste , Jalapeno Peppers , Vinegar , Salt , Spices , and Dehydrated Onions
Here is the method I used to test the cleaning power of the various concoctions .
Open sauce Apply thin layer of sauce onto half of the penny
Let sauce sit on penny for two minutes
Wipe sauce off with paper towel
Take photo of penny compared to clean and dirty pennies I followed this method for each of the following sauces .
Here we go .
The baseline .
Taco Bell Hot Sauce
Good cleaning power , but more time would have made it much cleaner .
The mild sauce does n't appear to do much better or worse than the hot stuff .
The amount of chili in the sauce probably does n't make much of a difference .
This is Jack in the Box taco sauce .
IMHO , their label kinda sucks .
Taco Bell at least said Taco Bell on it and had a witty saying .
This packet looks like generic sauce you get in a cafeteria .
The performance is OK , but not great .
Less cleaning than the Taco Bell sauce .
Whatever the causative agent , Jack in the Box sauce has less of it .
Don Sonora is the taco sauce you get at Burger King .
Friggin ' Burger King is so lame they do n't even make their own sauce .
The cleaning power is average , similar to Taco Bell sauce .
Next I tried McDonald 's ketchup .
McDonald 's does n't even have hot sauce , so I used ketchup instead .
The ketchup did a good job .
I think this rules out the impact of chili on cleaning .
It also rules out the possibility of Spices and Dehydrated Onions .
Let 's review .
Out of the possible ingredients that make hot sauce a copper cleaner
and that are in each of the effective sauces above , we are left with this list :
Tomato Paste , Vinegar , and Salt. Kinda narrows it down , eh ?
I remember something about tomato sauces being bad for copper cookware
or some other nonsense like that being talked about on FoodTV .
Could tomato sauce be the causative agent ?
It 's time to try them out individually This is pure tomato sauce .
No salt , as you can see .
Lookie here .
Absolutely no cleaning effect at all .
I did a second test and let the tomato sauce sit on
the penny for 5 minutes and still no cleaning .
It appears that tomato is not the causative agent .
But let 's be sure it 's not a catalyst .
Probably the most well known American hot sauce is Tabasco Sauce .
Tabasco is made of water , peppers , salt and vinegar .
No tomatoes .
The Tabasco Sauce did a good job , but again , no better than the other hot sauces .
And it has no tomatoes , ruling out tomatoes as being involved in the cleaning .
That leaves vinegar and salt .
This is a simple household vinegar , similar to what 's in hot sauce .
Vinegar is also known as acetic acid , a weak acid used for
cleaning , cooking , and even food preservation .
Is this acid the agent that cleans the pennies ?
No significant cleaning .
Vinegar itself does n't clean pennies .
And rubbing salt on pennies does n't do it either , I tried that ...
So it must be a combination of the two that does the cleaning .
I made a mixture of vinegar and salt as a cleaning agent .
Bingo !
Vinegar and salt are the ingredients that in combination can clean pennies .
A quick Google search reveals that I 'm not alone in determining this .
But no one can explain why the vinegar and salt work together in this .
Lots of suggestions , but no one that is an authority on the subject .
We need to know exactly why vinegar and salt do this .
To do this , I did what any person would do , I googled .
Since I am a web search ninja , I found this article by Professor Laurence D. Rosenhein
at Indian State University about The Household Chemistry of Cleaning Pennies .
Since I could only read the abstract , I sent an email to Professor Rosenhein .
I wrote : A lengthy internet search led me to you .
You wrote a paper " The Household Chemistry of Cleaning Pennies " but I am unable to read it since I am not a member of the JCE .
As far as I can determine , the acids ( usually vinegar - acetic acid ) break the copper oxide free from the penny .
As I have seen experimentally , acid alone does not clean as well as acid and salt .
As best I can tell from your abstract and other sources , the salt breaks down somewhat , freeing chlorine ions into the solution .
The chlorine ions bond with the copper in solution forming some sort of copper chloride , allowing the acid to break more of the copper oxide free from the penny .
He replied Any university library will have the hard copy publication , if you are really interested in reading it .
( Or I could send you a reprint . )
But it is written for chemists , so you might not get much more out of the longer version than the abstract .
In water , under any conditions , salt breaks down into sodium ions and chloride ions .
( Even in the solid , it is in that form , so it would be better to say that the water just allows the ions to separate . )
It 's a little more complicated than that .
The copper in the tarnish would be in the 2 + form .
Chloride ions do not bond strongly to this form .
However , they do bond fairly strongly to the 1+ form .
A reaction that would be unfavorable in the absence of chloride ions , Cu + Cu2 + *--> 2Cu1 + , becomes favorable when the chloride is present to tie up the Cu1 + form ( as [ CuCl2 ] - ) .
The first process can be viewed as transfer of an electron from Cu ( metallic copper ) to Cu2 + .
This is followed by reaction of the Cu1 + with the chloride .
The resulting copper - chloride complex is soluble in water .
It 's the electron - transfer aspect of the chemistry ( the conversion of metallic copper and the Cu2 + , to Cu1 + ) that makes the role of the salt a little surprising .
So there you have it .
It truly is the combination of vinegar and salt that allows
taco sauce to clean pennies so well .
Shown both in my empirical data
from the experiments and in theoretical chemistry terms by the Professor .
I hope this clears up any questions or concerns you may have had
regarding the cleaning power of taco sauce .
For the second time in the past few weeks , Zivit Avivi has been forced to terminate a tenancy agreement for her apartment in the northern town of Shlomi after the local council rejected her potential lodgers .
About two months ago , the tenants were a family of Sudanese refugees staying in Israel legally .
This time it was a young couple , former members of the Southern Lebanon Army , who had already signed a contract and paid rent .
In Ashkelon too ' Ethiopian tenants ?
Out of the question ' Shmulik Hadad Real estate agent trying to find apartment in Ashkelon for new immigrants shocked to discover building has policy of not selling flats to Ethiopians , ' because it drops the apartments ' value . '
Deputy mayor : Unfortunately , I 've encountered this problem many times ' Ethiopian tenants ?
Out of the question '
The rumor on the new lodgers also reached the neighbors at the apartment building , who sent a letter to Mayor Gabi Naaman , demanding that he prevent SLA member from settling in the community .
Several weeks ago , when the flat was rented to the Sudanese family , Naaman also prevented the connection of the apartment to the water supply , saying that he preferred bringing a strong and well - based population to Shlomi .
It should be noted that the parents in both families , the Sudanese and the Lebanese , have decent jobs and their children are part of the educational system .
The Sudanese family ( Photo : Doron Golan )
" I tried to explain that this is a lovely , pleasant and quiet couple , " said Zivit Avivi .
" Beyond the financial matter , there is the human element that people must not be disqualified based on their religion , race or nationality . "
Shlomi's Opposition Chairman Yigal Ziskind said in response , " This is a first - class scandal .
The law does not grant an authority or council head the mandate to choose who will live in the community and who wo n't .
There is no admission board in Shlomi , and Naaman is not authorized to act as one . "
No members of ' underprivileged classes '
Mayor Naaman does not hide his stance against non-Jewish residents in Shlomi .
" Zivit asked to rent her apartment to an SLA family , " he said .
" As far as I know , the building 's tenant strongly objected and she terminated the contract .
I definitely support the tenants and appreciate their desire to maintain Shlomi 's status as a Jewish community and not to turn it into a binational community . "
As for his refusal to connect the apartment to the water supply , Naaman stressed , " I gave an order in the past , and I stand behind it these days as well , not to change names in contracts when the residents are not Jewish or are members of what we call ' the underprivileged classes ' .
" The goal is to prevent a situation in which the tenants get into lots of debts which they will not be able to pay in the future .
The vast majority of Shlomi 's residents support my stand .
I do n't want Shlomi to turn into another Akko or Ma'alot . "
Rosa Gonzales , who lives in the building in question , said that the fact that the couple was non-Jewish had nothing to do with the neighbors ' objection .
" We are angry at the apartment owner for not consulting us before signing a tenancy agreement . "
In 2006 , The Knife ’s Silent Shout was received with near universal acclaim .
Pitchfork , who honored the Swedish duo with the title Album of the Year , recently hyperbolized that the siblings had created a masterwork that “ arguably sounded like nothing before it . ”
Indie rock critics ’ penchant for overstatement aside , the group does have a distinct sound — one that peculiarly has n’t been co-opted by imitators at large .
Perhaps it speaks to the reverence hipsters have for their perceived groundbreakers , or maybe it just means that the gear they use is too obscure to reproduce .
If voice transformers were as ubiquitous as Auto - Tune , would we be hearing The Knife pull a T - Pain on MTV complaining that they had been swagga - jacked ?
Well in honor of the release of Karin Dreijer Andersson ’s new solo project , Fever Ray , I ’ll demystify some of her and her brother ’s sonic magic .
Very rarely is a band ’s unique sonic character defined by a single effect but honestly , all songwriting and execution aside , there is n’t much that is wholly distinctive about the group insofar as sounds are concerned .
The beats are n’t revolutionary and could very well have come from any can of prefab loops .
The synth sounds are fairly generic and not treated in any inventive new way .
The album itself is fairly quiet by today ’s standards , perhaps attributable to a Swedish mastering job .
The swelling synthesizer in “ Silent Shout ” actually pops out quite sharply and distinctly from the rest of the mix showing that the tune is not overly compressed .
The tracks are immersed in several very artificial sounding reverbs , but that is not uncommon for electronica tracks .
Really , the only thing that grabs me about this group from a sonic perspective is the haunting vocal timbre .
Layers of vocals with pitch - shifting , formant - altering effects contribute to this ethereal tone as provided primarily by the TC - Helicon VoiceLive .
This handy little box allows the user to input a source program ( instrument , microphone , etc. ) and alter the pitch up to an octave in either direction , adjust the formants , loop , and add reverb .
Throughout the record , the sub -octave is the most used effect , although parallel 4ths and 5ths are occasionally audible and the super - octave is mixed in for flavor .
In some instances , the “ MIX BALANCE ” fader is all the way up to 100 % effect output such that Karin ’s natural tones are inaudible .
Other times they are mixed in tastefully with the dry vocal track .
The sheer prevalence of this effect contribute to the conspicuous absence in the tracks where the vocals are unaffected .
Songs such as “ Keep the Streets Empty ” sound all the more stark and vulnerable whereas the effected tracks have more body , presence , and strength .
One of the greatest tools in this gizmo is the formant filter .
Formants are intrinsic resonances from an acoustic sound source .
These in tandem with spectral content are what allow us to distinguish between human voices in the same range singing the same note or tell a Stradivarius from a Yamaha .
The formant filter allows the user to alter the sonic quality of the output , thereby creating the effect of different singers and thickness or various otherworldly sounds .
It is n’t immediately clear to me whether or not the looping functions were especially useful to either The Knife or Fever Ray since looping facilities were surely available in their DAW , but the applications are very intriguing for live performance .
An extant device that I like to use to a similar end is the Electroharmonix Microsynth .
It has some of the same facilities although it does n’t allow you to loop .
The use of such a filter is not unprecedented .
Apollo 440 used the same device to similar effect back in 1990 .
Brian Eno famously used formant filtering in his 2005 release entitled Another Day on Earth .
He has even accomplished similar ends with his famous suitcase ring - modulator that he has used throughout his storied career .
So even though the predominant discriminator for both The Knife and Fever Ray is the vocal effect and even though there is n’t much that is revolutionary about their instrumentals , something in their approach to songwriting is what contributed to many critics touting them as some of the most unique sounding artists of our time .
With all this in mind , it is important to stress again that there is a marked difference between obtaining an artists sounds and sounding like that artist .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama said Monday he will attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG , payments he described as an " outrage . "
President Obama says AIG " finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed . "
" This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , " Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House , where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation 's small businesses .
The president expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG , which has received $ 173 billion in U.S. government bailouts over the past six months .
" Under these circumstances , it 's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay .
I mean , how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? "
Watch why Americans have a right to be angry »
Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG 's financial products division , the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that wound up shaking the world 's economic foundations .
See a snapshot of facts , attitudes and analysis on the recession »
The president said he has asked Geithner to " pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . "
Obama spared AIG 's new CEO , Edward Liddy , from criticism , saying he got the job " after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . "
But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics .
" It 's about our fundamental values , " he said .
Watch Obama say he 's outraged by bonuses »
" All across the country , there are people who are working hard and meeting their responsibilities every single day , without the benefit of government bailouts or multimillion - dollar bonuses .
You 've got a bunch of small - business people here who are struggling just to keep their credit line open , " Obama said .
" And all they ask is that everyone , from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington , play by the same rules .
That is an ethic that we have to demand . "
Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again .
Then , coughing , he added in jest , " I 'm choked up with anger here . "
Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa did n't appear to be joking , however , when he spoke with Cedar Rapids , Iowa , radio station WMT .
" I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little better toward them [ AIG executives ] is if they follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say , ' I am sorry , ' and then either do one of two things : resign or go commit suicide , " he said .
" And in the case of the Japanese , they usually commit suicide . "
Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or " retention payments " -- by at least 30 percent .
That has did little to temper outrage over the initial plan , however .
Reality Check : Housing 1 in 5
Number of mortgage holders who owe more on their homes than they 're worth 59 percent
Percentage of Americans who blame the economic crisis on " bad loans by banks " 8 percent or more
Percentage of mortgage payments that analysts say will be late in 2009 see more » Sources : First American CoreLogic , Pew Research Center , Association of Credit and Collection Professionals
Obama received support from fellow Democrats , including Sen. Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs .
" This is another outrageous example of executives -- including those whose decisions were responsible for the problems that caused AIG 's collapse -- enriching themselves at the expense of taxpayers , " the Democrat from Connecticut said .
He noted in a written statement that executives at other companies that received bailout funds have volunteered to forgo bonuses .
" There 's no reason why those at AIG should n't do the same , " he said .
Later , Dodd told CNN he is considering an unusual approach to get the bonus money back .
" One idea we 're kind of thinking about is a tax provision , " the Connecticut Democrat said .
" We have a right to tax .
You could write a tax provision that 's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses .
That 's a way maybe to deal with it . "
Dodd said the notion is in the " earliest of thinking " and has not been settled on as a way to resolve the issue that has set off outrage in Washington and across the country .
In the House , Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses .
They 're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses , a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday .
The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses , which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September , according to the committee aide .
Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses .
Complicating the issue , said the committee aide , is that the first infusion of cash to AIG was authorized by the Federal Reserve before Congress passed the $ 700 billion bailout bill , also known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program , which included some restrictions on executive pay .
Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets .
Road to Rescue : CNN Survival Guide Unprecedented reporting on the money meltdown that 's changing your life
This week on CNN see full schedule »
On the floor of the Senate on Monday , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , issued a stinging rebuke of AIG , calling executive bonuses " beyond outrageous . "
" Our financial sector will never heal unless the financial companies who helped create this economic crisis begin to regain the public trust .
The actions of AIG do just the opposite , and every American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public trust , " he said .
Who 's insured by AIG ? »
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in a letter to Liddy that was distributed to the news media that he was " disturbed to learn " of the bonus plan .
And he threatened to issue subpoenas if the company failed to send him detailed information about who received bonuses and for how much .
Read the letter to AIG ( PDF )
" Previously , AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $ 600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool , " he said .
He said he had already asked for the names and titles of the people who are to receive the payments , " and it is surprising that you have yet to provide this information . "
" Covering up the details of these payments breeds further cynicism and distrust in our already shaken financial system . "
He added that he also is seeking " whatever contracts you now claim obligate you to make these payments " and the names of whoever negotiated them .
" Finally , we demand an immediate status report as to whether the payments under the retention plan have been made , " he said .
The information was needed , he said , to determine whether bonus recipients " were involved in the conduct that led to AIG 's demise and subsequent bailout " ; whether the company is " truly required " to pay them ; whether the contracts " may be unenforceable " because of fraud or other reasons ; and whether " any of the retention payments may be considered fraudulent conveyances under New York law .

All About Timothy Geithner • American International Group Inc .
For our latest mission , 50 Improv Everywhere agents created an art gallery opening on the 23rd Street subway platform in Manhattan .
We put up 30 placards next to objects in the space ( pipes , electrical boxes , signs , advertisements ) , transforming them into works of art .
The gallery included a bar , a coat rack , and a cellist .
Enjoy the video first , and then continue reading for photos , text from our placards , and reports from the agents involved .
Agents Eppink and Small approached me with the idea of holding a gallery opening on a subway platform , and I was immediately excited to make it happen .
There has been tons of really cool unauthorized art happening in the subway system lately , including PosterBoy ‘s fantastic advertisement modifications .
The MTA actually has some great authorized art installations in certain stations as well ( the American Museum of Natural History station comes to mind . )
Despite these wonderful authorized and unauthorized works , the majority of the stations are pretty boring and display nothing but ads .
Well , at least at first glance .
We were able to turn the components of the 23rd Street C/E station into works of art simply by adding placards containing art - speak descriptions .
Agent Eppink created a sign for our gallery that looked identical to the existing “ service changes ” signs .
You had to look twice to notice it was n’t an official MTA sign .
We chose to hold the mission at the 23rd Street C/E station because it ’s located in Chelsea , just a few blocks from the art gallery district .
The mission took place on a Thursday evening , which is the night gallery openings happen in the real galleries nearby .
Ideally , some people getting on and off the train at the station would be coming to or from a real gallery opening .
The 23rd Street station has no authorized art , but its advertisements are frequently improved upon by anonymous artists .
The station also has tons of quirky things about it , including locked up men’s and women ’s restrooms that have n’t been in use for years .
It was the perfect spot for our gallery .
Agent Harms runs the coat rack
We tried to include all of the normal elements you might encounter at a posh art gallery opening .
Agent Harms and Agent Good dressed in tuxedos and managed the coat rack and bar , respectively .
We even had a ticket system for the coat rack , ensuring our patrons would get their garments back correctly .
Agent Good works the bar
We borrowed the bar from the UCB Theatre and brought some silver trays , cups , and a few bottles of ( non-alcoholic ) sparkling cider .
Several people assumed we were serving champagne , and a few high school age kids ran up to get a glass .
We never told them it was cider .
We had around 50 agents participate .
They trickled in to the gallery in small groups , acting like the did n’t know each other .
Everyone was instructed to dress nice , like you would at an actual opening .
Agents Williams , Ace $ Thugg , and Perveen
We found an awesome Cello player , Erin Hall , who was willing to come out and provide lovely background music for the gallery .
Agents Small , Eppink and I quickly placed our placards underneath the “ works of art . ”
There were 27 in total .
Agent Small wrote up hilarious deadpan descriptions for each piece .
Here are some of our favorites .
Brick Window ( 2003 )
Metropolitan Transit Authority in collaboration with Unknown Artists Glass Bricks with Ink marker
This piece inverts the typical window by making it from opaque bricks , set within a larger opaque wall .
This opens the dialogue between the lower spaces of the MTA subway and the upper world where sunlight would necessitate such windows .
The null opacity of the glass is called to attention by the use of ink markers .
Locked Box # 2 ( 1988 )
Metropolitan Transit Authority
This extremely subtle piece reexamines the assumption that art must be visually accessible to be important and identifiable as a creative work .
This artist explores the limitless possibilities of the hidden here , allowing the viewer to reevaluate underlying preconceptions , and to recondition the inner mind to work with the perception of the commonplace outer space .
Telephone Line ( 2002 )
Metropolitan Transit Authority in collaboration with Telecom
This homage to the urgency of communication is meant to highlight the recent necessity , from instant to instant , to maintain the potential for instantaneous , world - wide contact from any location , at any time .
That a conversation from such a location would be abruptly interrupted by an arriving train suggests the artist ’s intent to lampoon the perceived dependence on telecommunication .
Drain ( 1975 )
MTA and unknown artists Mixed Media on Metal and Concrete Describing the irresistibility of natural urges , and situated thematically near the restroom , this drainage grate offers deliverance .
Consequently , here lies an indeliable yellow nitrogen stain , as evidence of the passings of hundreds , if not thousands of strained commuters .
Each straphanger , surreptitiously seeking relief , has helped create this totally organic , revolutionary art piece .
Textured Glass ( 1998 )
Metropolitan Transit Authority
These simple glass blocks , with their textures turned at angles to one another , serve as a reminder that even in similarity , otherwise overlooked backgrounds have vast differences , and that considered as a whole , those differences create a subtle beauty .
The tension between the glass blocks and tiles serves to force the blocks into a separate plane from the surface .
Black Metal Slam Gate with Panic Bar # 367 ( 2004 )
Gricelda Cespedes , Assistant Chief Stations Officer responsible for Maintenance ; Overseer of the panic bar installation at stations system - wide .
The panic bar initiative , including these fashion - friendly safety bars , was launched with the goal of providing a way for customers to safely evacuate a station in an emergency , according to Ken Brown from New York City Transit ’s Office of System Safety .
More than 450 panic bar kits have been installed .
A total of 1,500 will be in place by the end of the year , in all fare control areas where you can enter or leave a station , where feasible , in the system ’s 468 stations .
Convergence ( 1962 )
MTA Electrical Conduit and Fittings , Tile Wall
This work is at once a heroic call to solidarity and a hopeful ode to the future .
The diverse collection of pipes , flocking together chaotically from all across the platform , can only burst through the wall once they ’ve banded together .
Instead of a bright knowable future , however , the pipes – brimming full of power – disappear into the ambiguous dark abyss on the other side of the wall .
The viewer is left in anticipation , hoping the newly - assembled coalition can successfully harness the energy within itself on the other side .
Top Chef , Bottom Mystery ( 2008 )
MTA in Collaboration with Bravo Network
The interleaving of advertisements present in the partial removal of outer ads has been a recent trend in modification from platform users .
This reveals the mystery of previous advertisements hidden just under the current .
The artist implies that the viewer should consider the past placements in this location , stretching back to the inception of the MTA ’s selling of ad space in their subways , and the layering of meaning which can occur in such a small space .
You can see all of the artworks and read their corresponding descriptions by clicking through Agent Nicholson ’s Flickr Set .
The gallery was soon full .
Our agents sipped cider and casually walked around enjoying the art , much to the confusion of those who were just waiting for the train to arrive .
Agents viewing the art

The view from across the platform .
Note the woman from the above photo is now reading about one of the artworks .
Two men read our poster
Unsure what to make of the bar and coat rack
I was especially interested in how we convinced ourselves and those around us to play the game and to believe , for a couple hours , that these everyday objects were actually art .
Agent Small did a fantastic job of setting the tone with the wall text , but everyone who attended the opening was complicit and added tremendously to the collective fiction .
Together we were inventing new meanings and alternate histories , all of which could have been entirely plausible explanations for the objects we were examining .
This may seem like a silly exercise , but I think it can be pretty useful !
It puts you in a position to re-examine the mundane , imagine others ’ intentions , and create new contexts for the objects and ideas you encounter every day .
Usually we would just call that “ acting ” , but in this case , so much of the pretending is internal that maybe it ’s not exactly theater ?
I ’m sure there ’s an argument for both sides .
Regardless , I found the gallery opening to be an exhilarating , tremendously creative experience , and the hundreds of people who passed through , even if they did n’t join , at least encountered a fun , unexpected , disorienting moment .
Read Agent Eppink ’s longer write up here on his site .
Agent Small and the Europeans
The three Europeans who stumbled on to the gallery seemed really tickled .
They took a picture with our cellist , and asked me which art I recommended .
The man was just bubbling with excitement as he went to look at “ Caged Women ” .
In the course of making the art labels , the mundane stuff of the platform really did become weirdly compelling and beautiful .
I was n’t sure if everyone else would have that experience , or if we would be busy consciously pretending that these random objects were art .
In the course of the event , some other friends who came made brilliant observations about the pieces that helped bring my mindset firmly back into of - course - this - is - art , rather than viewing the subway as a collection of quick fixes over time .
It ’s wonderful how we can decide to create a collective reality , and how it can sometimes catch us up within itself .
I ’m glad other folks also got caught up in “ Wow . .
This might really be art ! ” , and that some non-agents got such a kick out of it !
I ’m someone who likes to go to galleries and museums .
Before too long , I had convinced myself I was at an art show , and I was allowing myself to be affected by the artwork .
Service Changes is a reminder that art can be anything .
Art is a state of mind , and if you perceive something as art , then it is .
I think it would be hilarious if we got this mission into the hands of a serious art journalist or critic .
They might take it very seriously and write a piece on it .
The unsuspecting audience reacted in several different ways .
Some of them were confused .
Some of them got the joke and laughed .
I particularly enjoyed the older European party of 3 who stayed for awhile and took about a dozen pictures .
They seemed happy they had stumbled upon some weird wacky New York thing .
My favorites were the ones who showed up , got a drink , signed the guest book , looked around , and never cracked a smile .
Quite a few people understood what was happening , but did n’t get the joke .
The real highlights of the evening were the interactions with bystanders .
The first notable conversation I had was a discussion about someone ’s purchase of one of the works .
The piece was a cabinet embedded into the wall .
This guy was staring at the plaque , trying to decide if this was all a joke , when I approached him and told him that someone had just bought it .
The conversation went roughly like this :
Me : You know , someone just bought this work .
Dude :
They bought this ?
Me : Yeah , probably for a good sum .
Dude :
They bought what ?
Me : [ gesturing to the wall ]
Lock Box #
2
Dude :
They bought this ?
And so on .
I was admiring the trashcan art piece when I finished my complimentary cider and needed to throw away my cup .
I asked a man standing by if he thought it would be OK if I used the trashcan for my trash .
After a long confused look , I explained to him that it was an art piece part of the current MTA exhibit .
He still seemed rather confused , but I got him into a small discussion about art versus function .
I told him it brought me to a deeper understanding of the piece and its unique quality of being functional art .
While I do n’t think the man completely understood , we decided it was OK for me to through away my cup .
I witnessed many spectators enjoying the art and postcard explanations with a laugh .
Anything that can bring a smile to those traveling underground after a long day of work is an achievement .
One time a train came through and it was long enough for the last car to be near the “ gallery ” ( not all of them were ) .
I watched the people in the car as they tried to figure out what was going on , and the looks of interest and amusement on their faces were fantastic .
It did n’t occur to me what effect this might have on people that were not even in the station .
I also thought it was funny when the MTA staff person was trying to get into the women ’s bathroom , the door of which we had blocked with our coat rack .
( We apologized and moved the coat rack for her . )
My favorite part was when an older gentleman was walking by one of the art pieces and exclaimed , “ That ’s a locked box !
How is anybody gonna take that home with him !
It ’s a locked box .
That ’s not art ! ”
Then he walked off laughing hysterically .
I was standing at the lock box by the underpass stairs when a guy came over and started looking at one of the art descriptions of the Paul Rudd poster .
Strangely , when I looked over I realized he was a guy I ’d known when I was 14 and had n’t really seen since .
We shared a strange “ Oh , my god , what are you doing here moment , ” and then he told me that he had literally just come from an art class where he ’d gotten into an argument with a classmate over the question , “ What is art ? ”
He walked into the station with that in mind , and so when he saw the exhibit it just made his week because it was exactly what the argument was about .
He got almost immediately that it was supposed to be “ clever ” and was n’t necessarily real , but liked it even more for that .
We walked around looking at all the pieces , he cracked up at every one .
I would have killed to be inside the station - guard - booth when the station manager called .
He kept looking over at the “ exhibit ” so puzzled .
He was throwing his hands and I could see him saying “ I do n’t know !
I do n’t know ! ”
Agent Williams :
I spent two winters as a coat check at a restaurant , which is why I am particularly ashamed to have forgotten to tip Agent Harms , who was the most authentic coat check anyone could have asked for .
I was the coat check guy wearing the tuxedo .
I did n’t get to read any of the placards until after the event but I was able to see a lot of great reactions and got in plenty of crowd interaction .
All of the Agents were dressed so nicely for the opening – I ’m glad they got to take their coats off and look spiffy for the rest of the crowd .
I asked plenty of subway - goers if they wanted to check their coat and they all politely declined .
One husband and wife that got off of a subway car told me they did n’t really have time to check their coats as their chauffeur was waiting outside .
Most of the other people would then ask me a few questions about the opening : who the artist was , how late the event would be open that evening , who set up the opening in the station , where the art was , etc .
I told them that I was just hired for this particular event , gave them the few details a coat check guy like me would know and directed them to the program / flyer .
The older vacationing European trio were a big hoot taking pictures of themselves next to everything and trying to figure it all out .
Plus Agent Good ( the bartender ) and I made $ 24 in tips !
An appreciative crowd indeed .
At one moment a girl was standing right in front of the pay phone close to the gate trying to get phone reception on her cell phone .
She moved right in front of my site line of the “ pay phone piece . ”
I just kept staring at the pay phone until she realized she was blocking something , turned around and noticed the art display , and give a “ whoa , what ’s happening ? ” look .
And then stepped back and noticed all the other art pieces and gallery patrons .
She seemed to really enjoy it and until her train came was really self - conscious that she was in the way of some other piece of art .
I think my favorite piece of the evening was the performance art titled “ Woman sitting on bench , ongoing . ”
It was great to watch the people not involved in the mission sitting on the bench watching us watch them .
Where did life end , and art begin ?
Where did art end , and life begin ?
The people sitting were totally confused .
Finally , one woman looked up at the placard behind the bench , chuckled a bit and got up .
The look on her face when she discovered that she was a performance artist was amazing !
I think the most interesting result of participating is that it was enlightening to get into the mindset that the pieces were art .
Approaching the subway platform that way allows you to appreciate the details that make any public space great .
Be it the modified subway advertisements , the clock , or the metal gates that seem to go nowhere ( but actually lead to women ’s bathrooms ) .
The reaction of those not expecting to find a gallery showing is one thing , but the enjoyment of the participants was the highlight for me .
I noticed an older couple depart an arriving train wearing formal attire , the woman might have even been wearing a fur coat .
They laughed as they noticed what was happening , and then they went on their way , perhaps to a “ real ” gallery , not out of the realm of possibility .
What I loved most about this mission is that it brought something fun and enjoyable to a place where you do n’t normally see many smiles .
After thoroughly reading all the art descriptions , I started observing what made the people departing the trains stop and view the art .
I found that when someone was reading one of the labels near the exit ( the pay phone or the exit door ones specifically ) the exiting riders would often stop and read it as well , mostly because they thought it was something from the MTA .
After reading , they either figured it out and had a laugh , or just continued on confused .
The opening lasted about an hour .
As we were winding down and folks were starting to leave , a police officer showed up .
I ’m not sure if the MTA booth agent called him or if he just happened to walk by .
He could n’t really figure out who was in charge , so he stared asking questions of Agent Hall , the cellist .
I piped up to let him know that it was almost over anyway , and that people were already packing up .
We had a little conversation about it :
Cop :
You should n’t be doing this .
Me : Oh , really ?
We looked up all the MTA regulations and made sure that we did n’t violate any of them .
Cop :
Well , first of all , you ca n’t be taking photos .
That has to stop .
Me : Actually it ’s legal to take photos on subway platforms .
The MTA discussed banning it a couple of years ago , but it did n’t happen .
Cop : Yes , but you ca n’t have all these people here .
It ’s too crowded .
Me : Like I said we ’ll be gone in a matter of minutes .
Cop :
Thanks .
He was nice about it .
I thought it was funny that he kept changing what it was that we were doing wrong .
Other than putting up the signs ( which could be easily taken down , leaving no mark ) , we did n’t break any MTA rules .
It ’s OK to dress up , drink a non-alcoholic beverage , and walk around a platform .
We packed up and disappeared .
We decided to leave all of the placards up on the walls , continuing the mission for everyone who passed through the station that night .
We figured they would be taken down by the next morning .
I returned the next day and was surprised to see that 12 of them were still up .
A month later 6 remained .
Three months later there was still one up in a hidden corner .
It ’s fun to think of all the people waiting for trains who could have accidentally stumbled onto one of our placards over the past few months .
This afternoon ( March 17 , 2009 ) we put up fresh versions of all of the placards .
Stop by and look for them if you ’re in New York .
Remember to dress up .
Mission Accomplished .

[ Note for TomDispatch Readers : Back in November 2007 , in a post entitled “ As the World Burns , ” I wondered why the mainstream media was n’t connecting the dots on the subject of global drought .

Burning Questions
What Does Economic “ Recovery ” Mean on an Extreme Weather Planet ?
By Tom Engelhardt
It turns out that you do n’t want to be a former city dweller in rural parts of southernmost Australia , a stalk of wheat in China or Iraq , a soybean in Argentina , an almond or grape in northern California , a cow in Texas , or almost anything in parts of east Africa right now .
Let me explain .
As anyone who has turned on the prime - time TV news these last weeks knows , southeastern Australia has been burning up .
It ’s already dry climate has been growing ever hotter .
“ The great drying , ” Australian environmental scientist Tim Flannery calls it .
At its epicenter , Melbourne recorded its hottest day ever this month at a sweltering 115.5 degrees , while temperatures soared even higher in the surrounding countryside .
After more than a decade of drought , followed by the lowest rainfall on record , the eucalyptus forests are now burning .
To be exact , they are now pouring vast quantities of stored carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas considered largely responsible for global warming , into the atmosphere .
In fact , everything ’s been burning there .
Huge sheets of flame , possibly aided and abetted by arsonists , tore through whole towns .
More than 180 people are dead and thousands homeless .
Flannery , who has written eloquently about global warming , drove through the fire belt , and reported :
“ It was as if a great cremation had taken place … I was born in Victoria , and over five decades I ’ve watched as the state has changed .
The long , wet and cold winters that seemed insufferable to me as a boy vanished decades ago , and for the past 12 years a new , drier climate has established itself …
I had not appreciated the difference a degree or two of extra heat and a dry soil can make to the ferocity of a fire .
This fire was different from anything seen before . ”
Australia , by the way , is a wheat - growing breadbasket for the world and its wheat crops have been hurt in recent years by continued drought .
Meanwhile , central China is experiencing the worst drought in half a century .
Temperatures have been unseasonably high and rainfall , in some areas , 80 % below normal ; more than half the country ’s provinces have been affected by drought , leaving millions of Chinese and their livestock without adequate access to water .
In the region which raises 95 % of the country ’s winter wheat , crop production has already been impaired and is in further danger without imminent rain .
All of this represents a potential financial catastrophe for Chinese farmers at a moment when about 20 million migrant workers are estimated to have lost their jobs in the global economic meltdown .
Many of those workers , who left the countryside for China ’s booming cities ( and remitted parts of their paychecks to rural areas ) , may now be headed home jobless to potential disaster .
A Wall Street Journal report concludes , “ Some scientists warn China could face more frequent droughts as a result of global warming and changes in farming patterns . ”
Globe - jumping to the Middle East , Iraq , which makes the news these days mainly for spectacular suicide bombings or the politics of American withdrawal , turns out to be another country in severe drought .
Americans may think of Iraq as largely desert , but ( as we were all taught in high school ) the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers , the “ fertile crescent , ” are considered the homeland of agriculture , not to speak of human civilization .
Well , not so fertile these days , it seems .
The worst drought in at least a decade and possibly a farming lifetime is expected to reduce wheat production by at least half ; while the country ’s vast marshlands , once believed to be the location of the Garden of Eden , have been turned into endless expanses of baked mud .
That region , purposely drained by dictator Saddam Hussein to tame rebellious “ Marsh Arabs , ” is now experiencing the draining power of nature .
Nor is Iraq ’s drought a localized event .
Serious drought conditions extend across the Middle East , threatening to exacerbate local conflicts from Cyprus and Lebanon to Gaza , the West Bank , and Israel where this January was reported to have been the hottest and driest in 60 years .
“ With less than 2 months of winter left , ” Daniel Pedersen has written at the environmental website Green Prophet , “ the region has received only 6 % - 50 % of the annual average rainfall , with the desert areas getting 30 % or less . ”
Leaping continents , in Latin America , Argentina is experiencing “ the most intense , prolonged and expensive drought in the past 50 years , ” according to Hugo Luis Biolcati , the president of the Argentine Rural Society .
One of the world ’s largest grain exporters , it has already lost five billion dollars to the drought .
Its soybeans — the country is the third largest producer of them — are wilting in the fields ; its corn — Argentina is the world ’s second largest producer — and wheat crops are in trouble ; and its famed grass - fed herds of cattle are dying — 1.5 million head of them since October with no end in sight .
Dust Bowl Economics
In our own backyard , much of the state of Texas — 97.4 % to be exact — is now gripped by drought , and parts of it by the worst drought in almost a century .
According to the New York Times , “ Winter wheat crops have failed .
Ponds have dried up .
Ranchers are spending heavily on hay and feed pellets to get their cattle through the winter .
Some wonder if they will have to slaughter their herds come summer .
Farmers say the soil is too dry for seeds to germinate and are considering not planting . ”
Since 2004 , in fact , the state has yoyo - ed between the extremities of flood and drought .
Meanwhile , scientists predict that , as global warming strengthens , the American southwest , parts of which have struggled with varying levels of drought conditions for years , could fall into “ a possibly permanent state of drought . ”
We ’re talking potential future “ dust bowl ” here .
A December 2008 U.S. Geological Survey report warns :
“ In the Southwest , for example , the models project a permanent drying by the mid-21st century that reaches the level of aridity seen in historical droughts , and a quarter of the projections may reach this level of aridity much earlier . ”
And talking about drought gripping breadbasket regions , do n’t forget northern California which “ produces 50 percent of the nation ’s fruits , nuts and vegetables , and a majority of [ U.S. ] salad , strawberries and premium wine grapes . ”
Its agriculturally vital Central Valley , in particular , is in the third year of an already monumental drought in which the state has been forced to cut water deliveries to farms by up to 85 % .
Observers are predicting that it may prove to be the worst drought in the history of a region “ already reeling from housing foreclosures , the credit crisis , and a plunge in construction and manufacturing jobs . ”
January , normally California ’s wettest month , has been wretchedly dry and the snowpack in the northern Sierra Mountains , crucial to the state ’s water supplies and its agricultural health , is at less than half normal levels .
Northern California , in fact , offers a glimpse of the havoc that the extreme weather conditions scientists associate with climate change could cause , especially when combined with other crises .
In a Los Angeles Times interview , new Secretary of Energy Steven Chu offered an eye - popping warning ( of a sort top government officials simply do n’t give ) about what a global - warming future might hold in store for California , his home state .
Interviewer Jim Tankersley summed up
Chu ’s thoughts this way :
“ California ’s farms and vineyards could vanish by the end of the century , and its major cities could be in jeopardy , if Americans do not act to slow the advance of global warming …
In a worst case … up to 90 % of the Sierra snowpack could disappear , all but eliminating a natural storage system for water vital to agriculture .
‘ I do n’t think the American public has gripped in its gut what could happen , ’ [ Chu ] said .
‘ We ’re looking at a scenario where there ’s no more agriculture in California . ’
And , he added , ‘ I do n’t actually see how they can keep their cities going ’ either . ”
As for East Africa and the Horn of Africa , under the pressure of rising temperatures , drought has become a tenacious long - term visitor .
For East Africa , the drought years of 2005 - 2006 were particularly horrific and now Kenya , with the region ’s biggest economy , a country recently wracked by political disorder and ethnic violence , is experiencing crop failures .
An estimated 10 million Kenyans may face hunger , even starvation , this year in the wake of a poor harvest , lack of rainfall , and rising food prices ; if you include the drought - plagued Horn of Africa , 20 million people may be endangered , according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies .
Recently , climatologist David Battisti and Rosamond Naylor , director of Stanford University ’s Program on Food Security and the Environment , published a study in Science magazine on the effect of extreme heat on crops .
They concluded , based on recent climate models and a study of past extreme heat waves , that there was “ a 90 % chance that , by the end of the century , the coolest temperatures in the tropics during the crop growing season would exceed the hottest temperatures recorded between 1900 and 2006 . ”
According to the British Guardian , under such circumstances Battisti and Naylor believe “ [ h ] alf of the world ’s population could face severe food shortages by the end of the century as rising temperatures take their toll on farmers ’ crops …
Harvests of staple food crops such as rice and maize could fall by between 20 % and 40 % as a result of higher temperatures during the growing season in the tropics and subtropics . ”
Not surprisingly , it ’s hard to imagine — perhaps I mean swallow — such an extreme world , and so most of us , the mainstream media included , do n’t bother to .
That means certain potentially burning questions go not just unanswered but unasked .
The Grapes of Wrath ( Updated )
Mind you , what you ’ve read thus far represents an amateur ’s eye view of drought on our planet at this moment .
It ’s hardly comprehensive .
To give but one example , Afghanistan has only recently begun to emerge from an eight - year drought involving severe food shortages — and , as journalist Christian Parenti writes , it would need another “ five years worth of regular snowfall just to replenish its aquifers . ”
Parenti adds : “ As snow packs in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges continue to recede , the rivers flowing from them will diminish and the economic situation in all of Central Asia will deteriorate badly . ”
Nor is this piece meant to be authoritative , exactly because I know so relatively little .
Think of it as a reflection of my own frustration with work not done elsewhere — and , by the way , thank heavens for Google University .
Yes , Googling leaves you on your own , can be time - consuming , and tends to lead to cul - de - sacs ( “ Nuggets end 17 - year drought in Orlando ” ) , but what would we do without it ?
Thanks to good ol ’ G.U. , anyone can , for instance , check out the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Drought Information Center or its U.S. Drought Monitor , or the National Weather Service ’s Climate Prediction Center and begin a self - education .
Now let me explain why I even bothered to write this piece .
It ’s true that , if you ’re reading the mainstream press , each of the droughts mentioned above has gotten at least some attention , several of them a fair amount of attention ( as well as some fine reporting ) , and the Australian firestorms have been headlines globally for weeks .
The problem is that ( the professional literature , the science magazines , and a few environmental websites and blogs aside ) no one in the mainstream media seems to have thought to connect these dots or blots of aridity in any way .
And yet it seems a no - brainer that mainstream reporters should be doing just that .
After all , cumulatively these drought hotspots , places now experiencing record or near - record aridity , could be thought of as representing so many burning questions for our planet .
And yet you can search far and wide without stumbling across a mainstream American overview of drought in our world at this moment .
This seems , politely put , puzzling , especially at a time when University College London ’s Global Drought Monitor claims that 104 million people are now living under “ exceptional drought conditions . ”
Scientists generally agree that , as climate change accelerates throughout this century ( and no matter what happens from here on in , nothing will evidently stop some form of acceleration ) , extreme weather of every sort , including drought , will become ever more the planetary norm .
In fact , experts are suggesting that , as the Washington Post reported recently , “ The pace of global warming is likely to be much faster than recent predictions , because industrial greenhouse gas emissions have increased more quickly than expected and higher temperatures are triggering self - reinforcing feedback mechanisms in global ecosystems . ”
Now , no one can claim beyond all doubt that global warming is the cause of any specific drought , or certainly the only cause anyway .
As with the Texas drought , a La Niña weather pattern in the Pacific is often mentioned as a key causal factor right now .
But the crucial point is what the present can tell us about the impact of a global pattern of extreme weather , especially extreme drought , on what will surely be a more extreme planet in the relatively near future .
If global temperatures are on the rise and more heat means lower crop yields , then you ’re talking about more Kenyas , and not just in Africa either .
You ’re probably also talking about desperation , upheaval , resource conflicts , and mass out - migrations of populations , even — if scientists are right — from the American Southwest .
( And in case you do n’t think such a thing can happen here , remember Steinbeck ’s The Grapes of Wrath or think of any of Dorothea Lange ’s iconic photos of the “ Okies ” fleeing the American dustbowl of the 1930s . )
Burning Questions
Right now , the global economic meltdown has massively depressed fuel prices ( key to farming , processing , and transporting most crops to market ) and commodity prices have generally fallen as well , including food prices .
Whatever the future economic weather , however , that is not likely to last .
So here ’s a burning question on my mind :
We ’re now experiencing the extreme effects of economic bad “ weather ” in the wake of the near collapse of the global financial system .
Nonetheless , from the White House to the media , speculation about “ the road to recovery ” is already underway .
The stimulus package , for instance , had been dubbed the “ recovery bill , ” aka the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , and the question of when we ’ll hit bottom and when — 2010 , 2011 , 2012 — a real recovery will begin is certainly in the air .
Recently , in a speech in Singapore , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , head of the International Monetary Fund , suggested that the “ world ’s advanced economies ” — the U.S. , Western Europe , and Japan — were “ already in depression , ” and the “ worst can not be ruled out . ”
This got little attention here , but President Obama ’s comment at his first press conference that delay on his stimulus package could lead to a “ lost decade , ” as in Japan in the 1990s ( or , though it went unmentioned , the U.S. in the 1930s ) , made the headlines .
If , indeed , this is “ the big one , ” and does result in a “ lost decade ” or more , here ’s what I wonder : Could the sort of “ recovery ” that everyone assumes lies just over a recessive or depressive horizon not be there ?
What if our lost decade lasts long enough to meet an environmental crisis involving extreme weather — drought and flood , hurricanes , typhoons , and firestorms of unprecedented magnitude — possibly in some of the breadbasket regions of the planet ?
What will happen if the rising fuel prices likely to come with the beginning of any economic “ recovery ” were to meet the soaring food prices of environmental disaster ?
What kind of human tsunami might that result in ?
Once we start connecting some of today ’s drought dots , would n’t it make sense to try to connect a few of the prospective dots as well ?
After all , if you begin to imagine what the worst might look like , you can also begin to think about what might be done to mitigate it .
Is n’t that more sensible than looking the other way ?
If the kinds of hits regional agriculture is now taking from record - setting drought became the future norm , would n’t we then be bereft of our most reassuring formulations in bad times ?
For example , the president spoke at that press conference of our present moment as “ the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . ”
On an extreme planet , no such comforting “ since the… ” would be available , nor would there be any historical road map for what was coming at us , not if we had already run out of history .
Maybe the world we knew but scarce months ago is already , in some sense , long gone .
What if , after a lost decade , we were to find ourselves living on another planet ?
Feel free , of course , to ignore my burning questions .
After all , I ’m only an amateur with the flimsiest of credentials from Google U. Still , I do keep wondering when the media pros will finally pitch in , and what they ’ll tell us is on that distant horizon , the one with the red glow .

PROTESTS AND PITCHFORKS : As New Bank Bailouts Seem Likely , There Is More to Speak Out Against
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
There 's a phrase that 's worked its way into the Japanese language : " Lehman Shokku " - translated as Lehman Shock .
It refers to what happened to 460,000 people after Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner let the global Lehman Investment Bank collapse .
A former Lehman executive told me over Matzoh at a Passover seder that she believes the decision reflected a competitive conflict and ego battle between the former Goldman Sachs chief turned Treasury Secretary and the bullheaded CEO of Lehman .
The clash of two power - crats in New York triggered a hard rain across the world .
Bloomberg reports on a forty year old former bank employee , Miki , who " now sleeps in cardboard boxes under the elevated Hanshin expressway in Umeda , Osaka 's central business district ... as the global recession triggered by the implosion of Wall Street banks batters Japan .
...
Miki 's loss of housing shows how Japan 's 2.95 million unemployed people threaten to fuel a rise in homelessness . "
Bloomberg is doing more than reporting bad news ; it is also suing the Federal Reserve Bank for information that the privately run " public institution " wants to hide .
Bloomberg wants the FED to disclose securities the central bank is accepting on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for $ 1.5 trillion of loans to banks .
As the sun creeps through and the weather warms , there 's an expectation that the new season will wipe out the winter 's bad karma and lead to a desperately needed economic recovery .
Obama Advisor Larry Summers , like an evangelist from the Elmer Granty era , sees the signs in small upticks of business activity .
Now , according to the News n Economic blog comes an analyst , Roger Shealy , who has examined the footnotes and available data concluding " The Fed is holding a larger share of risky assets as collateral for its riskless currency and Treasuries lent on the open market . "
Translation :
We are living on Quicksand .
The Fed also admits that its consumer credit plan is faltering .
Reports TIME : " The second round of the Federal Reserve 's attempt to restart the nonbank consumer - lending market , the so - called TALF program , went even worse than the faltering first round did last month .
The poor performance is causing some Fed officials to doubt the entire premise of the effort to restart nonbank credit markets . "
On top of that , as the Treasury Department runs so - called " stress tests on the soundness of the banks , " the Fed wants the banks to stay silent on the results .
Again , Fed watcher Bloomberg is on the case : " The U.S. Federal Reserve has told Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Citigroup Inc. and other banks to keep mum on the results of " stress tests " that will gauge their ability to weather the recession , people familiar with the matter said . "
On this Easter weekend of " He Has Risen , " a lot seems to be still falling .
For the most cogent explanation of what 's going on , visit the Baseline Scenario website run by former IMF exec and MIT Professor Simon Jenkins :
" Just as global financial liberalization created the potential for capital to move violently across countries and greatly facilitated speculative attacks on currencies , so financial deregulation within the United States has made it possible for capital markets to attack - or , in less colorful terms , go short or place massive negative bets on - the credit of big banks and , in the latest developments , the ability of the government to bailout / rescue banks .
" The latest credit default spreads data for the largest banks show a speculative run underway .
As the system stabilizes , it becomes more plausible that a single big bank will fail or be rescued in a way that involves large losses for creditors .
This would like trigger further speculative attacks on other banks , much as the shorting of countries ' obligations spread from Thailand to Indonesia / Malaysia and then to Korea in fall 1997 . "
In other words , them chickens will soon be coming home to roost .
The banks seem confident that having learned the disastrous lessons on Lehman Shokku , the government will keep bailing them out .
Quiet as it's kept , insolvency in many banks suggests another wave of bailouts is coming .
The banks seem confident that they have " captured " the government and can depend on taxpayer monies to pay off their crimes and mistakes .
At the same time , they are worried about something else : US .
JP Morgan Chase overlord Jamie Dimon fears that the public anger will torpedo the schemes the banks are running , saying , '" If you let them vilify us too much , the economic recovery will be greatly delayed . "
Comments Jenkins :
" The ' center vs. the pitchforks ' idea fundamentally misconstrues the current debate .
This is not about angry left or right against the center .
It 's about centrist technocrat ( close to current big finance ) vs. centrist technocrat ( suspicious of big finance ; economists , lawyers , nonfinancial business , and - most interestingly - current / former finance , other than the biggest of the big , particularly people with experience in emerging markets . ) "
If anything , this seems the time to get the pitchforks going , to intensify the pressure , to make noise and press for change .
Paul Krugman tells us that the policy world and the bankers want to rebuild a corrupt system , writing :
" Despite everything that has happened , most people in positions of power still associate fancy finance with economic progress .
Can they be persuaded otherwise ?
Will we find the will to pursue serious financial reform ?
If not , the current crisis wo n't be a one - time event ; it will be the shape of things to come . "
That 's why events like this weekend 's banking protests organized by a new force , A NEW WAY FORWARD , is crucial .
Their three - word phrase , NATIONALIZE , REORGANIZE and DECENTRALIZE sums up the aims spelled out at ANewWay.org
They have issued a call :
Pledge to Break Up the Banks : Tell Obama and Congress , " If it 's too big to fail , it 's too big to exist .
Dismantle the power of the financial elite and make policies that keep a new crop from springing up .
We want our economy and politics restored for the public .
If the protests fail along with the banks , you can bet , the pitchforks will be back .
President Obama faces a heap of crises : a major economic recession , crumbling national infrastructure , and ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Buried in that heap is another war , one less present in public discourse but no less toxic : the drug war .
The concentrated battleground of the drug war has been on domestic soil , with America ’s so - called interdiction efforts spreading the fight across the world , from poppy - rich Afghanistan to the coca- nurturing Andes to the most brutal battlefield of them all , Mexico , which saw more than 5,600 drug - related murders last year , including several that involved publicly displayed decapitations
With the Obama administration , many see an unprecedented opportunity for meaningful criminal justice / drug war reform .
Much of that hope stems from Obama ’s seven - year track record as a state senator in Illinois — a state with one of the nation ’s largest prison populations .
In Springfield , Obama sponsored more than 100 bills on crime , corrections , treatment , re-entry , racial disparities and the death penalty that were mostly ( though not exclusively ) progressive in nature .
He also gained respect among younger voters for his willingness to talk candidly about his teenage drug use , and his present - day battle with nicotine addiction .
During a campaign stop at Northwestern University while running for the U.S. Senate in 2004 , Obama told a crowd of students that he supported decriminalizing marijuana ( a position he no longer supports publicly ) .
More significantly , Obama flatly stated that “ the war on drugs has been an utter failure . ”
“ Most of what Obama has said previously on criminal justice issues has been good , ” says David Borden , director of the Drug Reform Coordination Network in Washington , D.C. “ If he carries some of that into office , we could see an enormous change in the direction of the drug war and sentencing policies .
That said , criminal justice reform , especially when it comes to drugs , has always been the first issue the Democrats drop when it looks like they ’re being called ‘ soft on crime . ’ “
Marc Mauer , director of the Sentencing Project in Washington , D.C. , agrees with this cautious optimism .
“ The political climate on crime issues has shifted significantly over the last 10 years or so , ” says Mauer .
“ At the national level , there ’s a modest but growing bipartisan movement for more rational policies .
We see it most clearly around prison re-entry issues . ”
After years of operating on the margins of political discourse , drug war and criminal justice reform movements have reached a new plateau of recognition and respect .
Conservative lawmakers , law enforcement associations , health professionals and religious groups have joined the call for fiscal , legislative and social changes in our approach toward criminality .
Even mainstream civil rights groups , which often shied away from directly addressing the injustices of the drug war and the class and ethnic disparities in arrest and sentencing rates , have grown more comfortable allying themselves with criminal justice reform .
Yet mainstream Democrats have continued dragging their feet — to the point of pushing the kind of punitive legislation championed by President Reagan .
“ We ’ve seen this for over 30 years now , that Democrats have often been reluctant or even hostile to the idea of embracing criminal justice reform , ” Mauer says .
“ Our strategy is to continue to reach out to Republicans and conservative constituencies to develop broad support for some of these reforms .
We need to give Democrats a comfort zone … a sense that they ’re not being ‘ too out there . ’ “
The Second Chance Act , signed into law in April 2008 , provided just such a comfort zone for Congressional Democrats and Republicans alike .
Introduced by Rep. Danny Davis ( D - Ill. ) and Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - Utah ) in the House and by Sens. Joseph Biden ( D - Del. ) , Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) , and Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) in the Senate , the act was signed into law in April 2008 .
It was a remarkable step forward for a country that had all but turned a blind eye to sky - high recidivism rates for decades on end .
( Of nearly 752,000 people released from U.S. prisons annually , two - thirds will be re-arrested within three years . )
The Second Chance
Act provided an initial $ 362 million in federal grants to government agencies , as well as community and faith - based organizations , for the purpose of providing employment assistance , substance abuse treatment , housing , family programming , mentoring , and other social services known to reduce re-offending and drug addiction relapse .
Unfortunately , the Democratic - controlled Congress has yet to authorize that funding .
States take the lead
In the meantime , state legislatures are n’t waiting for the federal government to provide cues on how to handle criminal justice reform .
Mauer points out that many states have already enacted their own changes .
Connecticut , Iowa , Oregon and Wisconsin have specifically enacted legislation to address racial disparities in arrest and sentencing rates — and to ensure that proposed legislation be reviewed for its potential to exacerbate such disparities .
( Obama and Biden have also placed racial profiling , as well as a federal version of racial impact legislation , on their national agenda . )
Since 2004 , at least two dozen states have enacted policies or legislation that promote alternative sentencing and treatment diversion ; diminish the number of parolees sent back to prison for non-serious violations ; implement gender - responsive strategies to address the unique needs of females in the criminal justice system ; and / or modify mandatory minimum sentencing laws .
And in 2006 , the U.S. Conference of Mayors even passed a resolution opposing all mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and called for “ fair and effective ” sentencing policies .
Legislators and politicians have begun to realize that these kinds of reforms are much more likely to garner public support than ever before — even in red states like Kansas , where an early - release program has been created for prisoners who complete education , counseling or other programming requirements .
With one in 31 Americans now under some form of correctional supervision , mass incarceration is hitting closer to home for urban , suburban and rural residents who never envisioned family members would one day be locked away in remote prisons .
Some have even been shipped off to other states .
( Out - of - state transfers are routine in the federal system , and increasingly common in overcrowded state prison systems that contract with private prison operators . )
While California , New York and Texas have begun to show slight decreases in their bloated prison populations , the South has become the epicenter of the latest incarceration upsurge : Kentucky ( #1 ) , Florida ( # 5 ) , Virginia ( # 6 ) , Alabama ( # 7 ) , and Louisiana ( #8 ) are in the nation ’s top 10 for imprisonment rate increases from 2000 to 2007 .
Drug - related arrests — nearly 2 million in 2007 — continue to play a major role in driving up the numbers of jail and state prison inmates , while the majority of federal prisoners are doing time for drug offenses ( more than 95,000 men and women in 2007 ) .
The human cost of mass incarceration is increasingly visible , and so , too , are the economic costs .
According to the Pew Center on the States , total state general fund expenditures on corrections rose 315 percent from 1987 to 2007 , while 13 states devote more than $ 1 billion per year out of general funds to their corrections departments .
( At nearly $ 9 billion , California ’s annual spending on corrections leads the nation . )
By 2011 , the Pew Center ’s Public Safety Performance Project predicts that the nation ’s prison population will grow by more than 190,000 men and women , at a cost of $ 27.5 billion , while immigration - related detention is likely to increase at an exponential rate .
Already , the U.S. government detains more than 400,000 immigrants at some point during the year , usually within the confines of privately run facilities .
Overall , the progressive think tank Justice Policy Institute estimates that total annual spending on all facets of the criminal justice system — including policing , imprisonment and the judiciary — adds up to a staggering $ 213 billion .
Officially , the government is waging the drug war to combat illicit drugs .
Instead , it has turned into a war against the poor en masse , says Drug Policy Alliance Director Ethan Nadelmann .
People of color , who are disproportionately poor , make up 35 percent of the national population , and yet comprise 69 percent of the national prison population .
Jack Cole , a former narcotics agent and founder of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , says that the frequency of undercover and outdoor buy - bust drug operations in inner-city neighborhoods may make for great arrest numbers , but they do almost nothing to put a dent in illicit drug sales — or use — because they target the poorest and lowest - level drug users and sellers .
LEAP — whose members are current and former police officers and police chiefs , federal agents , undercover operatives and prison wardens — is the first U.S. law enforcement organization to advocate for the full legalization of all drugs .
It recently co-commissioned a study by Harvard University economics professor Jeffrey Miron , who studied the cost - benefit of legalizing and taxing drugs in the same manner as alcohol and tobacco .
According to Miron ’s analysis , released in December , tax revenues nationwide would amount to approximately $ 32.7 billion a year .
Miron also found that , if drugs were legalized , the United States would save more than $ 44 billion annually in costs related to the enforcement of drug laws .
“ The repeal of alcohol prohibition had a great deal to do with the fact that we were going through the Great Depression , ” says Cole .
“ Now that we ’re in the worst recession since the Great Depression , people are finally thinking about the economy when they think about the drug war .
By legalizing drugs , we could go from spending $ 69 billion on the war on drugs each year to realizing total savings and revenue of $ 76.8 billion . ”
Biden ’s record
While LEAP eschews the idea of intermediate steps toward drug policy reform , most other progressive criminal justice organizations and think tanks are reaching for middle ground by appealing to Obama ’s sense of fairness and equity .
Vice President Joe Biden should be a strong asset to Obama in this regard , says the DPA ’s Nadelmann .
The new Congress is likely to take up a bill that Biden sponsored to eliminate the large federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine use enacted during the Reagan years .
( It takes five grams of crack cocaine to trigger an automatic five - year federal prison sentence , whereas it takes 500 grams of powder cocaine to result in the same mandatory minimum . )
Biden has a favorable reputation on criminal justice issues and racial inequities while still remaining a consistent ally to law enforcement , says Nadelmann , which makes him all the more influential with more reluctant members of Congress .
But Biden ’s track record is mixed .
Early in his career , he was a supporter of punitive , drug war - related legislation .
More recently , he touted the RAVE Act — which held club owners and organizers of music gatherings responsible for drug use by participants .
When it failed to pass , Biden attached it as a rider to the law enforcement - supported Amber Alert bill ( a national alert system to help locate missing children ) , which Bush signed into law in 2003 .
Propaganda machine
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to significant drug policy reform will come from the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) and its director , the so - called Drug Czar .
John Walters , the Bush administration ’s drug czar , continued to put most federal funding dollars into law enforcement and interdiction efforts , blithely touting record - high drug arrest numbers as a sign of progress , even as independent surveys indicate rising levels of substance use and abuse among American teens .
Obama has yet to name a permanent drug czar .
( He named Ed Jurith , a long - time ONDCP bureaucrat , its acting director , but Jurith is widely considered a temporary placeholder . )
Much of the speculation has centered around former Rep. Jim Ramstad ( R - Minn . ) , a recovering alcohol abuser who favors some treatment options , particularly faith - based and 12 - step programs .
But Ramstad also opposes decriminalization , legalization and medical marijuna — to the extent that any debate is out of the question .
He also wants to continue the federal ban on needle - exchange funding , a stance Obama does not agree with .
Indeed , word of his consideration has brought together a broad coalition of groups in opposition , ranging from Students for a Sensible Drug Policy , to the National Black Police Association , to medical marijuna proponents to HIV / AIDS prevention groups .
Because of the influence of the drug czar on federal policies , LEAP ’s Cole says that it is unlikely that Obama will have the political will or backing to recognize that “ prohibition has always failed . ”
“ Every two weeks , for the last 20 years , the U.S. has built the equivalent of 900 prison beds , ” he says .
“ Still , our prisons are bursting at the seams .
Over the last 38 years , we ’ve had a cumulative arrest record of 39 million arrests for nonviolent drug offenses .
When are we going to say , ‘ Enough ! ’ ? ”
The big question is how much concern the Obama administration will ultimately show for people ensnared in the criminal justice system .
And what of the plight of prisoners , who collectively constitute the nation ’s most vulnerable , least - educated , sickest , poorest , mentally ill and socially castigated individuals ?
Reformers say they hope the new administration and Congress will take a cue from the U.S. Sentencing Commission , which is examining ways to alleviate massive national jail and prison overcrowding through sentencing alternatives , drug treatment and support for increased judicial discretion .
The commission plans to make its recommendations in May .
During the June 28 , 2007 , Democratic debate , Obama stood his ground on the need for ongoing criminal justice reform by emphasizing that the system “ is not color blind .
It does not work for all people equally . ”
It remains to be seen how far Obama ’s vision for reform will extend and whether it will shine toward the darkest corners of prison cells , far out of sight and therefore all too easily out of mind .

The Dash - 8 Q400 burns after it crashed into a house in Clarence Center , N.Y. ( ( David Duprey / Associated Press ) )
The crew of the commuter plane that crashed into a home near Buffalo , N.Y. , late Thursday night had reported " significant ice buildup " on the windshield and edge of the wings , a spokesman for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said .
According to a cockpit voice recorder recovered from the crash scene , the crew discussed " significant ice buildup , ice on the windshield and leading edge of the wings , " shortly before the crash , said NTSB spokesman Steve Chealander .
He said the flight data recorder revealed that the de-ice system was on the " on " positition .
Smaller planes generally use a system of pneumatic de-icing devices filled with compressed air to crack any ice that builds up during flights .
The plane crashed into a house in Clarence Center , sending flames shooting into the sky and killing 49 people on board and one on the ground .
Canadian Don McDonald , a technical manager at Pharmetics Inc. , a pharmaceutical firm based in Fort Erie , Ont. , was among the victims .
The landing gear was placed down and 20 seconds later the flaps of the aircraft were positioned for landing , Chealander said .
But within seconds of that command , the aircraft went through a " severe pitch and roll , " he said .
The recording ends as the crew attempted to raise the gear and flaps , he said .
The 74 - seat Continental Airlines plane crashed into a home in Clarence Center , northeast of Buffalo .
( ( CBC ) )
Recordings from the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder , which were sent to Washington for examination on Friday , were of excellent quality , Chealander said .
Chealander , who said nothing has been ruled out in terms of the cause of the crash , said he did n't want to comment on the specific dangers of ice buidup .
But he described it as an " aerodynamic impediment " that can change the shape of the wing .
Amy Kudwa , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Washington , said there was no indication terrorism was involved .
It was originally thought that there were only 48 people on the flight — 44 passengers , two pilots and two flight attendants .
But Colgan Air Inc. , a regional carrier for Continental , said another off - duty pilot had also boarded the flight .
The 74 - seat Continental Airlines plane was heading for Buffalo Niagara International Airport from Newark , N.J .
All those on board died , authorities said , and one person was killed in the house hit by the plane .
The plane struck the two - storey , gabled house at about 10:25 p.m. ET and burst into flames , State Trooper John Manthey said .
The flames coming from the crash were shooting up to 30 metres high soon after the crash , eyewitness Bob Dworak estimated , and the home appeared to be reduced to rubble .
" It landed on the house , clearly a direct hit , " emergency services co-ordinator Dave Bissonette said at a news conference early Friday .
" It 's remarkable that it only took one house . "
" As devastating as that was , it could have easily wiped out the entire neighbourhood . "
The wreckage of Continental Airlines Flight 3407 lies amid smoke after crashing .
( ( Dave Sherman / Associated Press ) )
While residents of the neighbourhood where the plane went down were used to planes rumbling overhead , witnesses said this one sounded louder than usual , sputtered and made some odd noises .
Light snow , fog and winds up to 30 km/h were being reported in the area at the time of the crash .
" It was not spiralling at all .
The left wing was a little low , " eyewitness Tony Tatro said of the plane .
Control tower transmission
In a recording from the Buffalo air traffic control tower , captured by users on the Live Air Traffic Control website , controllers are heard talking to a female pilot in the cockpit of the plane .
During a brief exchange , the controller instructs the plane to come into the airport at 2,300 feet .
There is no indication that anything is out of the ordinary .
The controller then tries to get in touch with the flight again and there is no response , after which he asks a nearby Delta Air Lines flight whether they can see the plane .
The male Delta pilot responds " negative . "
" There was an aircraft over the mark and we 're not talking to 'em , " the controller says .
" We have a Dash - 8 over the markers that did n't make the airport .
It appears to be about five miles [ eight kilometres ] away from the airport . "
The controller then says to send out the state police to look for anything on the ground .
The plane crashed about 11 kilometres from the airport .
" I could hear it coming down and it was just like in the movies , where you hear that high - pitched sound , " said Keith Burtis , who lives three kilometres from the crash site but was in a shopping mall parking lot less than a kilometre away when the plane went down .
A Bombardier Dash - 8 Q400 is shown at Pearson International Airport in Toronto in June .
The plane that crashed near Buffalo was a fairly new Dash - 8 Q400 turboprop .
(( Andrew H. Cline / Canadian Press ) )
" But I could feel it more than I could hear it .
And there was a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach .
It did n't take more than a few seconds to know that it was a plane , " Burtis told CBC News early Friday .
The plane 's tail section and rear fuselage were largely intact and burning at the scene .
" There was some superficial damage to the houses around [ the area ] , " said Bissonette .
About 12 other homes in the area were evacuated , he said .
A man who lived in the destroyed home perished in the crash , officials said .
Two others were also in the house at the time of the crash , but sustained only minor injuries .
Family members who gathered at the airport awaiting word on their loved ones were taken to a local seniors centre , where chaplains and grief counsellors were on site .
Airline officials were also meeting with relatives .
Continental released a statement early Friday advising family members of those on board to call a support line at 1-800-621-3263 .
' Really beautiful country town '
Clarence Center is about 35 kilometres from the Canadian border .
The Buffalo airport is a popular destination for Canadians .
It is estimated that about 50 per cent of passengers who fly out of Buffalo are Canadians using the U.S. departure point to get cheaper airfares .
Flights to U.S. destinations are typically $ 100 cheaper out of Buffalo than Toronto .
Firefighters gather next to the burning plane after it hit the house .
( ( David Duprey / Associated Press ) )
Eyewitness Burtis described the neighbourhood where the plane crashed as " a really beautiful country town , and very peaceful . "
The area has big country street blocks and homes on large plots , Burtis said .
The damage could have been much worse , Burtis said , had the plane gone down farther west , on the outskirts of Buffalo 's tightly knit suburbs .
" It would have been much worse on the ground .
It would have been in a more densely populated area . "
It is the first fatal crash of a commercial airliner in the United States since Aug. 27 , 2006 , when 49 people were killed as a Comair jetliner took off from Lexington , Ky .
The more than two - year span between fatal plane accidents is a record for U.S. civil aviation .

A newspaper tonight received a call from a man claiming to be from the Real IRA taking responsibility for the murder last night of two soldiers shot dead in Northern Ireland , the first terrorist attack in the province for more than a decade .
A journalist at the Dublin - based Sunday Tribune 's office in Belfast said that the newspaper took a call claiming responsibility for the attack by the Real IRA 's Antrim brigade .
The caller used a recognised codeword .
The attack at an army base in Co Antrim – in which the gunmen exploited a pizza delivery and were said to have " executed " soldiers lying on the ground after the initial attack – comes days after the Northern Ireland police service 's chief constable , Sir Hugh Orde , said there was a growing threat of violence from dissident republicans .
A huge police manhunt is now under way .
Speaking earlier today before the claim of responsibility , the Sinn Féin leader , Gerry Adams , called the attack " wrong and counter - productive " and , in an unprecedented statement , said his party had a " responsibility to be consistent ... the logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night 's attack " .
It was not until a vote at a special meeting of Sinn Féin in early 2007 that the party ended decades of opposition to the province 's Protestant - dominated police force .
Gordon Brown condemned the killings as " cowardly " , and vowed that they would not stop the peace process : " No murderer will be able to derail the peace process , " he said .
Soldiers at the entrance to the Massereene army base in Antrim , 16 miles north of Belfast , were attacked last night by gunmen lying in wait in a vehicle as a pizza delivery was being made at 9.40 pm .
The gunmen were obviously aware that soldiers followed a regular routine on Saturday nights , when as many as 20 separate orders were made for pizza to be delivered .
They waited until the troops emerged through the gates to pick up the food .
Reports said the gunmen raked the base with automatic fire then shot the soldiers as they lay injured on the ground .
Two other members of the military were injured and two pizza delivery men , were also hurt , one of them , a 32 - year - old Polish national , was in a critical condition .
It emerged today that the soldiers who were shot were dressed in desert fatigues and were due to leave on an early flight this morning for deployment to Afghanistan .
The names of the dead soldiers have been withheld until all their relatives have been informed .
The soldiers were due to fly out of RAF Aldergrove , just a few miles away from their base in the early hours of today .
The plane , which had four empty seats , had to be held up until investigating police officers had finished interviewing soldiers about the attack .
Unionists said the attack brought Northern Ireland to a " defining moment " in its history .
Unionist politicians will be studying the response from Sinn Féin , which may determine the prospects of the fragile power - sharing executive that has former enemies running Northern Ireland together .
Speaking about last night 's attack , Adams said : " Those responsible have no support , no strategy to achieve a united Ireland .
Their intention is to bring British soldiers back on to the streets .
They want to destroy the progress of recent times and to plunge Ireland back into conflict ... the peace process was built against the odds and not least because of the willingness of republicans to take risks and to be strategic and long - sighted .
" There should be an end to actions like the one in Antrim last night .
The popular will is for peaceful and democratic change . "
Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness , deputy first minister of Northern Ireland , said : " I was a member of the IRA , but that war is over now .
The people responsible for last night 's incident are clearly signalling that they want to resume or re-start that war .
Well , I deny their right to do that . "
Last night 's attack was the first time British troops had been killed in Northern Ireland by terrorists since 1997 .
The last soldier to die before the IRA 's second ceasefire was Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick .
More than 500 British soldiers died during nearly 40 years of conflict in Northern Ireland , known as the Troubles .
Chief Superintendent Derek Williamson said : " There is no doubt in my mind that this was an attempt at mass murder . "
The scene of the attack is the current home of the 38 Engineer Regiment , which has only been based at Massereene barracks since August .
Nationalist and unionist politicians arrived at the scene of the shooting this morning on the outskirts of Antrim Town to condemn those responsible for the worst act of terrorism in the province since the Omagh bomb .
At midday , hundreds of churchgoers from churches across Antrim gathered at the police cordon near the murder scene to hold a prayer service .
Traffic was halted as congregations from the Roman Catholic , Church of Ireland , Presbyterian and Methodist churches came together to pray for the victims .
Ian Paisley Jr , a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board and Democratic Unionist assemblyman for North Antrim , said the province had reached a " defining moment " .
He said : " For the last 10 years people believed things like this happened in foreign countries , places like Basra .
Unfortunately it has returned to our doorstep . "
In a swipe at Sinn Féin , who accused Sir Hugh of exaggerating the threat from dissident republican terrorists last week , Paisley added : " If this shooting is attributed to dissident republicans , then it was no exaggeration . "
Sir Hugh told the policing board the threat level from anti-ceasefire republicans was " severe " and the highest since he had taken over running the police service .
Paisley 's party colleague and Northern Ireland 's first minister , Peter Robinson , today postponed a visit to the US alongside McGuinness , his deputy .
Condemning the murders and the attempted murders , Robinson said they were a " terrible reminder of the events of the past " .
Signalling the DUP 's determination not to let the attack destabilise the province 's power - sharing coalition , the first minister added : " These murders were a futile act by those who command no public support and have no prospect of success in their campaign .
It will not succeed . "
Speaking at the scene of the murder , Mark Durkan , the leader of the nationalist SDLP , said : " We know [ the dissidents ] are opposed to peace and we know their capacity to attack , threaten , disrupt and even kill .
" They need to understand that this is not an attack on the British army but the Irish people who have voted for and value above all else peaceful politics and democratic accommodation . "
Since the summer security chiefs have been warning that dissident republicans were reorganising and upping their ability to launch attacks .
Five PSNI officers have been wounded in separate gun and bomb attacks in Derry , Tyrone and Fermanagh .
All police officers are once again wearing flak jackets .
There have also been a number of failed bomb attacks , one of which took place last month when the security forces found a 300 lb ( 136kg ) car bomb in Castlewellan , Co Down .
Security sources said the device " spooked " army technical officers and the wider security community because it was fitted with a type of sophisticated , secondary anti-handling device that they had not come across before .
Sir Hugh will hold a security summit later this week with his counterpart in the Irish republic , the Garda commissioner , Fachtna Murphy .
Top of the agenda will be the dissidents ' escalating campaign of violence .

Mexico 's president given George Orwell 's 1984 by the Queen
The president of Mexico received one of the more unusual gifts given by the Queen during an incoming state visit today - a copy of the classic dystopian novel 1984 .
A spokesperson for Facebook says it has begun removing groups which make threats against accused arsonist Brendan Sokaluk , after reports about the groups were made to the website .
However , it appears the social networking site 's operators cannot keep up with its angry users who continue to create new groups calling for the torture of 39 - year - old Sokaluk .
Sokaluk is accused of starting the Churchill - Jerralang fires in Gippsland which killed 11 people .
He is facing charges of arson causing death , intentionally lighting a bushfire and a count of possessing child pornography .
Earlier today , Facebook groups which were in breach of a suppression order by displaying Sokaluk 's photograph and which made threats against Sokaluk 's life , had been removed .
But new groups have sprung up calling for Sokaluk to " burn in hell " .
Another group has also been started on the site which claims that Facebook has violated its users ' freedom of speech by removing the groups .
A spokesperson for Facebook says the site should be a place for people to discuss their opinions , but it says it removes groups which are reported .
" We want Facebook to be a place where people can discuss issues and current affairs , while respecting the rights and feelings of others , " they said .
" We will remove groups reported to us that are found to express hatred or threaten violence towards people .
" The goal of our code of conduct and policies is to strike a very delicate balance between giving Facebook users the freedom to express their opinions and beliefs , while also ensuring that individuals and groups of people do not feel threatened or endangered . "
However , the spokesperson refused to comment on possible legal ramifications for the site for breaching the court suppression order .
The House Republican chosen to lead the charge against including women , people with disabilities , and gays in America ’s already - existing hate crimes law – existing law already counts violent crime based on the race , religion or national origin of the victim as a “ hate crime ” – just referred on the US House floor to Matthew Shepard ’s murder as “ a hoax . ”
You will recall that Matthew Shepard was the young gay man in Laramie , Wyoming who , a decade ago , was tied to a fence , Jesus - like , pistol whipped in the head some 50 times , then left for dead in the cold fall night , only to be found a day later clinging to life .
Shepard died five days later .
Even though Shepard ’s murderers admitted that they killed him because he was gay , the far - right bigots who control the Republican party could n’t resist the opportunity to gay - bash Shepard one last time .
Now by referring to his brutal murder as a hoax .
Here is what North Carolina ( figures ) Republican had to say about Shepard ’s horrific murder :
If you did n’t vote for this bill — against this bill and against this rule for anything else , you could vote against it because we are spending additional money .
i also would like to point out that there was a bill — the hate crimes bill that ’s called the matthew sheppard bill is named afte a very unfortunate incident that happened where a young man was killed , but we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery .
it was n’t because he was gay .
this — the bill was named for him , hate crimes bill was named for him , but it ’s really a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing these bills .
Now read what really happened :
During the trial , Chastity Pasley and Kristen Price ( the pair ’s then - girlfriends ) testified under oath that Henderson and McKinney both plotted beforehand to rob a gay man .
McKinney and Henderson then went to the Fireside Lounge and selected Shepard as their target .
McKinney alleged that Shepard asked them for a ride home .
After befriending him , they took him to a remote area of Laramie where they robbed him , beat him severely ( media reports often contained the graphic account of the pistol whipping and his smashed skull ) , and tied him to a fence with a rope from McKinney ’s truck .
Shepard begged for his life .
Both girlfriends also testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of drugs at the time .
The beating was so severe that the only areas on Shepard ’s face that were not covered in blood were those where his tears had washed the blood stains away .
Media Matters has lots of links , and quotes , from the mainstream media attesting to the fact that Shepard was murdered because he was gay .
A hoax ?
Belittling the brutal murder of a 21 year old college student ?

Gaming Versus Workstation Performance : Radeon HD 4870 Versus FirePro V8700
After our latest round of OpenGL workstation articles , we received numerous questions about why we did n't include a gaming series in our testing .
It seems that not all of our readers were ready to accept our claims that gaming cards run more slowly than workstation graphics cards , especially where professional applications are concerned .
That 's why we include a comparison with hard numbers instead of vague generalizations in this story .
Performance Comparison : Viewperf 10 Graphics adapter Radeon HD 4870 Fire Pro V8700 Chip RV770 RV770 Memory bus 256 - bit 256 - bit Core Takt 750 MHz 750 MHz Memory clock 900 MHz 850 MHz Driver Catalyst 9.1 FirePro 8.543 3dsmax-04 ( 3D Studio Max ) 23.35 44.23 Catia-02 17.9 44.95 Ensight -03 27.58 46.96 Maya-02 40.12 240.2 Proe - 04 ( Pro / Engineer ) 13.82 45.39 SW - 01 ( Solidworks ) 30.75 103.33 Tcvis-01 ( UGS Teamcenter Visualization ) 8.15 37.78 Ugnx-01 ( UGS NX ) 16.64 56.93
As you can clearly see , the ATI driver programmers have done an amazing job .
The two models ' hardware is 99 % identical , and yet the FirePro adapter completely outclasses the cheaper Radeon gaming card .
The most extreme case in point is Maya , where the FirePro V8700 is six times faster than the Radeon HD 4870 .
We also decided to investigate if there were visible differences in picture quality between the two models .
On a basic Windows desktop we discovered no discrepancies , but as soon as you load a professional graphics application such as Maya or 3ds Max and import a complex 3D model , things change completely .
When using the Radeon , you simply have to accept that wire frames will peek out of shaded surfaces all over the place , and that significant clipping occurs as numerous objects are viewed or animated .
These phenomena simply do n't occur when using the FirePro.
Bottom line : those who seek to be frugal with expensive workstation applications should not fall prey to false economies .
President Barack Obama 's grandfather , Hussein Onyango Obama , must be turning over in his grave .
Winston Churchill — the man who ordered his torture during the Kenyan war of independence — was being praised by his grandson for not using torture .
What a laugh .
Obama cited Britain as a country that never resorted to torture during war during his prime - time press conference on Tuesday night .
“ London was being bombed to smithereens [ and ] had 200 or so detainees .
And Churchill said , ' We do n't torture , ' " Obama said .
" Churchill understood , you start taking shortcuts , and over time , that corrodes what 's best in a people . "
Excuse me , Mr. President : Churchill did condone torture and he did use torture — and advocated using poison gas and concentration camps .
And he was quite proud to do so , writing about it frequently as a means to an end .
I do n’t know whose Kool - Aid Obama was drinking , but it must have been supplied by the British Embassy in bucketfuls .
It was an amazing gaffe , as there is clear evidence that Obama ’s own grandfather , a member of the Mau Mau insurgency in Kenya , was tortured by the British after he was captured .
Recent accounts in the British press note that he was whipped mercilessly every day when he refused to cooperate .
It was good old Winnie , drawing on his experience in similar tactics during the Boer War , who as Prime Minister ordered the savage suppression of the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya in 1952 .
According to historians , “ The ensuing torture caught up many uninvolved Kenyans , and just like many modern ' anti- terror ' campaigns , radicalized them and their friends and family , too .
One earlier victim of this approach was the President 's grandfather . “
This was the same Churchill who drew an arbitrary line in the sand and created the state of Iraq , which has been the cause of all subsequent commotion — but not before writing in a 1919 memo that " I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes " to " spread a lively terror . "
The specific targets were the Kurds , in what was then Mesopotamia .
Then , of course , we come to Northern Ireland — here , torture was definitely used .
Between 1971 and 1975 , more than 2,000 people were interned without trial by the British in Northern Ireland .
Many faced what was euphemistically called “ Interrogation in depth . ”
This was the infamous five techniques , many of which you will recognize from the Guantanamo / Abu Graib / CIA methods ' allegations .
They include sensory deprivation though being hooded , often while naked , forced to stand against walls for over 20 hours , subjected to continuous noise for periods up to six or seven days , deprivation of food and water , and sleep deprivation for up to one week .
Relays of interrogation teams had to be used lest the torturers grew fatigued .
The British media exploded in anger when allegations of torture were made against their government .
They claimed , incredibly , that some of the wounds were " self - inflicted . "
“ One hard - line Provisional was given large whiskies and a box of cigarettes for punching himself in both eyes , ” claimed the hilariously wrong Daily Telegraph on 10/31/77 .
In 1978 , the European Court of Human Rights called the techniques Britain used “ intense physical and mental suffering and acute psychiatric disturbance , ” and said it was cruel and inhuman punishment .
Amnesty International called it what it was : torture .
In his book “ Provos , the IRA and Sinn Fein , ” Peter Taylor noted then Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was told by the army and senior British officials that the techniques had often been used " many times before when Britain was faced with insurgencies in her colonies — Palestine , Malaya , Kenya , Cyprus , the British Cameroons , Guyana , Borneo , Malaysia , and the Persian Gulf . ”
In other words , the spirit , and worse , the torture philosophy of " old Winnie " is alive and well in Britain today .
In fact , the British are as far from " banning torture " as you can get .
After all , they practically invented modern torture .
What the hell was Obama thinking ?
hi , this time the action takes place on distant planet with daring maneuvers in

Staff pick for 15th February 2007
Roe to Rove : ' You guys would n't be in White House without Tom '
So what did he mean by that ?...
Brad Friedman Byon
4/11/2009 , 2:08 pm PT
Late this week , Politico's Anne Schroeder ran details of a purported public showdown , in a D.C. steakhouse , between Karl Rove and Jason Roe , the former Chief of Staff to FL 's former Republican U.S. House Rep ( and alleged vote - rigging conspirator ) Tom Feeney .
During the exchange between Rove and Roe , as reported by Schroeder , Rove tells
Roe that he has a file on Feeney , and Roe , who was angry with Rove for cracks he'd made on Fox " News " at Feeney 's expense just after the extremely corrupt FL Republican had lost his 2008 election , says angrily to Rove : " You guys would n't be in the White House without Tom . "
Given the coverage we 've offered over the years on Feeney , and former Republican computer programmer Clint Curtis ' allegations against him , several folks --- including our friends Marcy Wheeler of emptywheel and Patty Sharaf , filmmaker of Murder , Spies & Voting Lies : The Clint Curtis Story --- sent us the link to the Politico article , asking our opinion on what Roe may have meant by that crack .
In the interest of keeping links to that story from continuing to pile up in our Inbox , here 's our take on Roe 's purported comment to Rove ...
Feeney Shenanigans
On the Record
In truth , the most interesting aspect of the smackdown between Rove and Roe was , if accurate as reported , that it 's yet another example of the Republican Party in rapid disintegration and continuing to eat each other alive .
Other recent examples include the Republican veteran who recently smacked Rush Limbaugh down on air , Laura Ingraham 's attempted smackdown of Megan McCain after she 'd dared to criticize Ann Coulter , and even the salacious internecine battle between the Palins and the Johnsons .
All a sign of a political party in utter disarray .
But as to the " You guys would n't be in the White House without Tom " line , we do n't have any hard evidence of anything newly nefarious in that , given what is already on the public record concerning Feeney 's helping hand to Bush during the FL 2000 democracy abortion .
Amidst the 36 day battle following Election Day 2000 in the Sunshine State , Feeney , who was then Speaker of the FL House and arguably the second most powerful politician in the state ( after Dubya 's brother Jeb , who was Governor at the time ) , made it clear that he was prepared to pass legislation in the Republican Florida House to grant all of Florida 's electors to George W. Bush no matter what the U.S. Supreme Court ended up deciding .
As the state 's Constitution grants the power to determine Presidential Electors to the legislature , and that power has been passed on by them to the voting electorate , Feeney was prepared to take that power back for his buddy Dubya ( Feeney had previously run as Jeb 's running mate in his unsuccessful 1994 bid for the Governorship ) , and select Bush 's electors by government fiat , no matter what the courts had determined .
Sleazy ?
Of course .
We 'd expect no less from Feeney .
But nefariously illegal ?
Not really .
But that , we suspect , is what Roe was most likely referring to in his comments to Rove .
Feeney had other roles to play , of course , in the theft of Florida 's 2000 election , according to the whistleblower Curtis who spoke of " exclusion lists " and the use of armed police at polling places in minority areas which , he says , " Feeney used to brag about " .
Of course , we now know that thousands , perhaps as many as 20,000 legal FL voters were inappropriately removed from the voting rolls vis a vis Jeb 's " Felons List " which succeeded in inappropriately excluding all sorts of voters merely because their names sounded like someone who may have been a felon at some point , in some state .
But as to the implications inherent in the questions from various folks sent to us this week , suggesting that , perhaps Roe 's comment was alluding to a larger , even more insidious theft of the election , perhaps by computer manipulation of election results , that 's probably not likely --- at least according to the information offered to date by Curtis and what we know about how FL ran their elections in 2000 .
If Roe was referring to 2004 , and he could have been , that 's another story .
But on the presumption he was referring to Feeney 's role in helping Bush " win " in 2000 ...
Feeney 's Touch - Screen Vote - Rigging Software
In his now fairly well known allegations against Feeney , first broken here in December of 2004 , Curtis had alleged that Feeney first asked the CEO of the company where they both worked ( Yang Enterprises Inc. ---
Curtis as computer programmer , Feeney as general counsel and registered lobbyist , even as he was also speaker of the FL House ) for what amounted to a touch - screen vote - rigging software prototype , in " late September or October of 2000 " , according to his sworn affidavit [ PDF ] .
That would have been just a month or two before the 2000 FL election , and the short demonstration program that Curtis says he created for him , would n't likely have been in time to use for that November 's election .
Furthermore , though a version of the program could easily have been adapted for use on central tabulating computers ( the main vote counters ) , the progam was allegedly meant for use on touch - screen voting systems , which FL had n't yet been using at the time .
After the 2000 race however --- where paper ballots were allegedly gamed in Palm Beach County , according to the stunning on - camera testimony of 7 former company employees from Sequoia Voting Systems who 'd produced the bulk of the state 's punch - card paper ballots ( broadcast video here ) ---
Florida moved quickly thereafter to touch - screen voting systems across much of the state .
As luck would have it , Sequoia had " successfully " deployed touch - screen voting for the first time , county wide , across Riverside County , CA that year , and they stood to make huge profits from the widespread adoption of such systems , versus the comparable very low profit margins from the continuing sale of punch - card ballots , and inexpensive mechanical punch - card readers .
When Curtis ' story initially broke , one of the points used by critics in their attempted debunking of Curtis ' claims was that , since FL had n't used touch - screens at the time , his allegations made no sense .
But , after the testimony from the 7 Sequoia employee / whistleblowers were aired on HDTV's Dan Rather Reports in 2007 ( subsequently picked up by absolutely nobody in the corporate mainstream media , by the way , despite the myriad of stunning , corroborated claims in that broadcast ) , that purported " hole " in Curtis ' story was also substantially sealed up .
Other Still - Unexplained 2000 Anomalies
Other still - unexplained anomalies from FL's 2000 election were the - 16,022 votes ( that 's negative 16,022 votes ) registered for Al Gore in Volusia County by the optical - scan tabulator made by Global ( which was purchased by Diebold shortly thereafter ) .
The reasons for that " glitch " have never been reasonably explained , to this day , by anyone .
It was that negative 16 k vote count which led to Gore 's initial concession to Bush on Election Night , and the discovery of the problem --- and subsequent restoration of 16 k votes --- which then led to Gore 's now famous unconcession an hour or so later .
That initial concession , however , would prove to be a linchpin in Bush 's eventual " win " , as it was following Gore 's concession that the bulk of the media would call the election for Bush , a point that was later used by Republicans to argue to the U.S. Supreme Court that their client , George W. Bush , would be " irreparably harmed " if Florida were allowed to actually count their ballots and Gore was discovered to be the winner , since the media had already declared Bush the winner .
Of course , as we now know , even with all of the scheming and gaming and voter suppression , Al Gore still received more votes across the state of Florida that year than did Bush , as seen in the exhaustive post- election study of all ballots in the state , as completed by a consortium of news outlets and universities ( here 's that actual study [ PDF ] , as posted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute for you misinformed skeptics out there . )
If Roe meant something more than all of the above in his purported comments to Rove , we 've got no additional light to shed .
Of course , Feeney has never been questioned by investigators , to our knowledge , about Curtis ' allegations , even though Curtis made his allegations via sworn affidavit , during sworn video - taped testimony to a U.S. House Judiciary panel , and via a polygraph test which he successfully passed .
While Curtis has maintained that he has no knowledge of his software prototype ever having been used in an election , and only that he was asked by Feeney to create it , the once powerful , former Republican Congressman , on the other hand , has long refused many years of requests that he take a similar polygraph test to backup his claims that he never asked Curtis to create any such thing .
So that 's what we know .
Perhaps we 're too conservative in our offering
Roe the benefit of the doubt on his comments , but we 're often accused of being too conservative in such matters .
Ironic , that , since even though we try to report nothing here at The BRAD BLOG which can't be independently verified , we 're also frequently accused --- by nefarious opportunists and lazy writers on both the Right and the Left --- of being " conspiracy theorists " around here .
Of course , that may just come with the territory when investigating , and writing about , criminal conspiracies .

Joining the iPhone Application Train February 23 , 2009
My first iPhone game ( Codewords ) was released over the weekend ( which you can see at the Idle Diversions Website .
It joins the rapidly growing list at the Apple App Store ( there are at least 25 new paid games released every day , plus all the free ones ) .
How can one make money in this business ?
What is the development process like ?
The second is much easier to answer than the first .
Once you are familiar with Objective -C , Interface Builder , XCode and the Cocoa Touch frameworks ( and friends ) , development is actually a relatively easy process .
I spent about 3 months writing partial applications , relearning the language ( I used WebObjects 10 years ago before Java ) , understanding the best practices for using IB and the frameworks to create the UI , and working through a number of application designs .
After all that it only took 3 weeks to write Codewords , and then I built a generic application by extracting the common parts of Codewords and adding in some other necessary bits for future applications ( such as dictionary management ) .
With the generic application " framework " I can have a new application running in less than an hour .
I also built an OpenGL - ES shell to make managing the opengl state easier , although lately everything I am working on has been based on Quartz drawing .
With all this learning and canned stuff I think I can build a new game ( in my chosen subcategories ) about every 3 weeks or so .
I have about a dozen original concepts ( Codewords is actually based on an existing puzzle that is unique to the App Store but exists on the web and in paper versions ) .
What I will not do is clone existing ideas outright ; it makes no sense to write yet another tictactoe version .
People on the iPhone may not buy every unique idea , but the odds against a " me-too " app succeeding are pretty high .
The iPhone market is an interesting place , everyone is in the same boat and there is no other boat ( ignoring jailbroken iPhones ) .
However the size of the market today is enormous and it's easy to get lost in it .
I think of the App Store as a huge bazaar with a single entrance : the booths near the entrance get the bulk of the sales , and the folks at the back get very little .
Being in the top 100 ( or even better the top 25 ) assures huge sales .
The developer of iShoot made $ 600,000 in January with a # 1 position ; however the majority of developers barely make beer money .
Unlike the early adopters back in August who all made good money with so little competition , today you have to market your applications any way you can and even then it may not catch fire .
A perfect example of marketing was the iFart application , which really is nothing more than a simple sound player .
The 3 month wait for approval was actually a blessing , as the constant mention of the app being denied and then the final approval generated enormous press and triggered a large number of purchases .
It 's clear the key to sales is eyeballs ; the more people know about your application the better you will sell ; and the more you sell the higher in the lists you go , which lets more people know about your application .
The funny thing is that the market seems blind to reviews ; you can look at the top list of applications and see 1.5 stars alongside 4.5 stars .
The mere presence of an application in front of prospective customers is sufficient to ensure sales .
Likewise if no one sees it , no matter how wonderful it is , sales will be minimal .
Another interesting fact is that most applications are never used beyond the first day .
I think this is indicative of the low price and huge availability of new apps every day .
People constantly look for new shiny apps to buy , with a low barrier to purchase , and thus are attracted to the next big thing .
Buying new applications for only $ 1 or $ 2 is itself " fun " .
Yet there is nothing wrong with this .
If I buy coffee at Starbucks I might spend $ 4 for 10 minutes of sipping .
Going to a movie might be $ 10 for the ticket and $ 8 for the drink and popcorn .
Thats $ 18 for 120 minutes of entertainment , a " fun rate " of $ 9/ hr .
Buying an iPhone application for $ 2 that provides an hours worth of fun is way cheaper .
It 's hard to find a cheaper form of amusement anywhere .
Even music at $ 1/4 minutes is expensive .
Recently Amazon released a downloadable game store at $ 10 per game , and many game companies refused to join as most of them prefer a $ 20 price point .
Most iPhone developers would love to sell things at $ 10 .
It would change the market if the minimum were $ 10 ; people would be more choosy of what they bought and likely the sales would be more even across the market but I do n't expect Apple is going to change .
So the challenge will remain getting to the top of sales lists in order to get to the top of sales lists .
I am also going to convert some of my applications to run under OSX , where the pricing is of course higher .
Even here the key is to create original unique games and puzzles but the market is vastly different and in some ways more complicated .
In any case if it works out , it 's a fun and crazy business to be in .
Even in this down economy people still buy games and entertainment , if for no other reason than to keep from going crazy .
SHAWNEE — A man who thought he was going to die confessed last week to a decades - old slaying .
James Brewer , 58 , did n’t die .
Instead , he found himself Monday in a Tennessee courtroom facing a murder charge .
Authorities say he killed a man he thought was involved with his wife in 1977 .
Brewer , a Shawnee resident , was in an Oklahoma City hospital early last week when his wife called the Shawnee Police Department , saying her husband wanted to confess to a murder .
" He wanted to cleanse his soul , because he thought he was going to the great beyond , ” Shawnee police detective Tony Grasso said .
Grasso interviewed Brewer at the hospital , but Brewer had trouble communicating because of the stroke he suffered .
In the beginning , his wife agreed to translate for him but decided partway through the interview that they needed an attorney , Grasso said .
Grasso photographed and fingerprinted Brewer and contacted authorities in Tennessee .
Brewer surrendered to Tennessee authorities on Thursday .
He appeared in court Monday with the same lawyer he had almost 32 years ago .
He is being held in lieu of bail .
A bail hearing is set for March 30 .
For almost three decades , James and Dorothy Brewer had been living in Shawnee under the name of Michael and Dorothy Anderson , authorities said .
Dorothy was sometimes referred to as " Dolly ” or " Dot . ”
The couple lived in a modest home on the south side of Shawnee .
Brewer had worked at Central Plastics , a manufacturing plant , until a previous stroke about three years ago .
Brewer was arrested after the April 27 , 1977 , shooting death of Jimmy Carroll and charged with first - degree murder .
His $ 50,000 bail was reduced to $ 10,000 .
When he was released on bail , Brewer legally changed his name , and the couple left for Nashville , Tenn .
They later moved to Texas and then to Shawnee , where Brewer worked as a machinist for 17 years and where they raised their daughter .
" It was easy to legally change your name in 1977 , ” Lewis County , Tenn. , Sheriff Dwayne Kilpatrick said .
Brenda Buie , Carroll ’s younger sister , said she hopes this is the beginning of the end .
" I never thought this day would come , ” she said .
Buie was at the hearing Monday and said James Brewer and his wife did n’t show any remorse or speak to the Carroll family .
Buie said Dorothy Brewer was at the center of the dispute between the two men .
There were rumors that James wanted to kill Jimmy , rumors that Jimmy never took seriously , she said .
Buie said the Carroll family will meet with the district attorney ’s office this week about charges against Dorothy Brewer .
Carroll was a divorced father of twin 5 - year - old boys at the time of his death .
" They do n’t hardly remember their daddy , ” Buie said , referring to her nephews .
" I was 20 at the time — it ’s imprinted in my mind . ”
What happened ?
About 4 p.m. on April 27 , 1977 , James and Dorothy Brewer pulled up in front of a service station in Hohenwald , Tenn .
Carroll was inside the store waiting for his mother to pick him up , Buie said .
Carroll learned Brewer wanted to talk to him , but friends warned the man as he approached Brewer ’s vehicle , she said .
Carroll was shot twice — once in the abdomen and once below the left shoulder — with a handgun .
After the shooting , Carroll walked back into store , fell down and died at the scene , Buie said .
" He left him ( Carroll ) lying in a pool of blood , ” said Kilpatrick , the Lewis County , Tenn. , sheriff .

If anyone was living " beyond their means " during the 2000s , it was Corporate America and the rich .
" THERE IS no magic that can transform our situation into something other than what it is : A time for shared sacrifice , dedicated to a vision of a brighter future for this city . "
That 's what Philadelphia Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter said as he delivered his new budget proposal to the City Council in March - - a " people 's budget , " he called it , even though it requires deep cuts to city services and givebacks from city workers on health care , pensions and work rules .
" This is the time , " Nutter said , " for all of us to either stand up and be counted , or sit down and be quiet . "
Nutter , of course , is n't the only one talking " shared sacrifice . "
Similar calls can be heard at all levels of government , from the Obama administration on down , and throughout Corporate America .
But wherever you hear the phrase , you can be sure that the intention is to make sure that workers are the ones to " share " the sacrifice .
The Obama administration 's late March announcement that it was rejecting more federal funds for the Detroit Three auto companies is a case in point .
( Top ) Former GM CEO Rick Wagoner , ( Bottom ) auto workers leaving a GM plant
White House officials insisted that workers at General Motors and Chrysler would have to make further sacrifices -- coming on top of years of concessions already -- for the carmakers to receive more federal assistance .
Meanwhile , GM CEO Rick Wagoner was forced by the administration to resign his top post -- but he wo n't have to sacrifice any of the $ 63.3 million he 's raked in during his career at GM .
Of course , the auto giants are n't the only companies demanding cuts in hours , wages and benefits -- and using the rapidly rising unemployment rate , now at its highest point since 1983 , to threaten workers with shutdowns and layoffs if they do n't get their way .
A Watson Wyatt survey released in March found that 56 percent of the 245 corporations surveyed had a hiring freeze in effect , 42 percent had salary freezes , 12 percent had reduced 401 ( k ) matching contributions , and 13 percent had instituted a shortened workweek .
State and local governments are following the same strategies .
The New York Times gave the example of Vallejo , Calif. , where city officials just filed for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy , allowing the city to tear up its existing contracts with firefighters and other city workers .
THE ARGUMENT in all cases is that the only way we 'll make it through the crisis is for everyone to tighten their belts .
The thing is , some people have already been cutting back for a very long time -- and others have n't .
According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Frank Levy , median family income in the U.S. has stayed flat for the last 25 years .
During the Bush years , it actually fell .
But for the top 1 percent of U.S. households , their median income rose by about $ 250,000 between 1986 and 2005 .
Corporate America called them the " boom years " for good reason -- CEO pay and benefits took off .
In 1980 , the average CEO made 42 times the average worker 's salary - - a fairly outrageous difference .
But by 2007 , CEOs were getting 364 times what an average worker makes .
If many workers are seeing their wages and working hours disappear , their mountains of debt are n't .
The conventional wisdom in the media and among politicians is that the American people were living " beyond their means " -- using credit to buy things they could n't afford .
But for many Americans , credit filled the gap between what they earned and what it costs to live .
If anyone was living " beyond their means " during the 2000s , it was Corporate America and the rich .
As Financial Times columnist Michael Skapinker wrote :
Special treatment that passes unnoticed when times are good provokes rage when they are not , as the fury over bonuses paid at AIG shows .
Warren Buffett said : " You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out . "
You also find out who has been wearing diamond - studded flippers .
People are taking notice , though - - and taking action .
Like the people who protested the bailout of Citigroup and AIG , or the students and teachers protesting educations cuts in California and elsewhere .
In France , Caterpillar workers facing layoffs took their managers hostage at the end of March - - the fourth " boss - napping " in less than a month .
While the Obama administration tries to portray its economic policies as benefiting working America , they fall far short of what 's needed to fundamentally improve ordinary people 's lives .
On the contrary , they leave the burden where it 's always been , on workers and the poor .
Countering conservative accusations that Obama 's bailout of the banks amounts to " nationalization , " economist Joseph Stiglitz , in a column for the New York Times , called the administration 's policy " ersatz capitalism , the privatizing of gains and the socializing of losses .
It is a ' partnership ' in which one partner robs the other . "
It 's no surprise that Corporate America is n't being asked for much sacrifice by the Obama administration -- since many of them are old friends of big business .
Obama 's top economic advisor Larry Summers , for instance , collected $ 5 million last year from the hedge fund D.E. Shaw and $ 2.7 million in speaking fees from Wall Street firms , including many of the companies now expecting bailout money .
How can Summers -- the person that advised Wall Street in the first place -- be expected to mete out " shared sacrifice " ?
The crimes of Corporate America and their allies in Washington have been exposed for everyone to see .
We should tell them it 's their turn to sacrifice .

Oh look , the Metro reports today :
Eyewitnesses today described how protesters came to the aid of a man who collapsed and died during G20 demonstrations at the Bank of England .
Police were involved in running battles with protesters in central London when the man , believed to be in his 30s , fell to the ground and stopped breathing .
…
“ One or maybe two plastic bottles were thrown , but it was by people further back in the crowd who did not know what was going on .
There definitely was n’t a rain of bottles .
There were lots of us gathered around him telling people to give him space .
The idea that protesters did not care is completely false . ”
This contrasts with the Evening Standard ’s disgusting piece yesterday stating the police were ‘ pelted with bricks ’ when trying to help him – a story they quietly changed on their website later .
The paper is a stain on London .
RIP Ian Tomlinson , a guy who was just walking by , and got caught in the Met Police ’s delightful strategy of ‘ kettling ’ people in .

Re : Follow - up Action to the CMAG Meeting 2009 and Deepening Humanitarian Crisis in
Sri Lanka
Dear Ministers :
Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative ( CHRI ) and Human Rights Watch are writing to you following CHRI 's submission to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group ( CMAG ) meeting held on 4 March 2009 , in which CHRI had urged CMAG to place Sri Lanka on its agenda .
Since January 2009 , the fighting in the northern Vanni area of Sri Lanka between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) has resulted in at least 3,000 civilians killed and thousands more wounded .
Recently the Sri Lankan government announced that its military had captured the entire stretch of territory held by the LTTE , and that the group 's senior leaders and remaining fighters had now merged with displaced civilians in a government declared ‘ No Fire Zone . '
Since the CMAG meeting , the situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated and there is mounting international concern .
While welcome , the two day ceasefire , brokered by United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , has not provided enough time to address the plight of trapped civilians , who continue to face a crisis .
On 24 March 2009 , the United Kingdom House of Commons debated the Sri Lankan crisis .
On April 8 , 2009 , John Holmes , Under Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator , who had earlier briefed the UN Security Council about the current humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka , warned that " a bloodbath on the beaches of northern Sri Lanka seems an increasingly real possibility . "
A European Parliament Resolution of 12 March 2009 , also expressed concern about the danger to civilian population in the afflicted area .
Walter Kaelin , Representative of the UN Secretary - General on the human rights of internally displaced persons , made a visit to Sri Lanka from 2 to 6 April 2009 at the invitation of the Government .
After his visit , he had stated that there would be a bloodbath in Sri Lanka unless government and rebel forces stop fighting for long enough to allow tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the war zone to flee .
He added , " It 's absolutely necessary to avoid a bloodbath .
If the Sri Lankan army would try to go into there , if the LTTE would not be ready to let these civilians go , then we 'll end up with a bloodbath , and this must by all means be avoided " . [ 2 ]
We are particularly concerned about the plight of civilians caught in the fighting , the strong likelihood of serious violations of international humanitarian law by both sides , the refusal of the Sri Lankan government and LTTE to allow independent observation or reporting on the situation in the conflict zone , and the limited access of humanitarian organisations to provide assistance .
It is critical for the government , LTTE and international community to establish a way in which to ensure safe evacuation , passage and treatment for trapped civilians .
It is in this respect that we are writing to you now .
The Commonwealth should urgently address this humanitarian emergency and push for a solution to assist trapped civilians .
We urge the Secretary General to use his Good Offices ' mandate to engage directly and urgently in the crisis in Sri Lanka .
In particular , we urge the Secretary General to speak out publicly and in private meetings with Sri Lankan authorities and other concerned officials on the situation in northern Sri Lanka and insist that the government adhere to its international legal obligations on human rights and humanitarian matters .
We urge the CMAG to engage in the crisis and keep it under review until the next meeting .
We continue to urge the CMAG not to self limit its mandate , but to proactively examine all " serious or persistent violations of the Harare Declaration , " wherever they may occur .
As the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative noted on 5 March 2009 :
.... CMAG has in the past limited its mandate to scrutinising countries where there has been coup d'etat or refusals to follow the rule of law and democracy .
However , it has not operationalised its mandate to protect the human rights of citizens of Commonwealth countries .
In a situation of mounting human tragedy , the body 's silence raises serious questions about its credibility .
CHRI reiterates its urgent call to the International community and to the Commonwealth in particular , to take immediate notice of the situation in Sri Lanka in order to ensure the safety and security of civilians , uphold democracy and the rule of law , and to promote and protect human rights in Sri Lanka - the Commonwealth and the wider international community must act urgently in a meaningful way , placing human rights principles at the forefront of their response to the growing humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka .
The Sri Lankan government defends its record by saying that it is a democracy and that it is fighting terrorism .
Neither should be a green light for human rights abuses or failing to protect civilians caught between warring parties .
Democracy requires more than elections .
At a minimum , it must include good governance ( with civil society participation ) , rule of law and human rights .
Furthermore , measures conducted for the purposes of countering terrorism , while a duty of all states , must also protect human rights , as specified in UN General Assembly Resolution ( A/ RES/60/288 ) ( 8 September 2006 ) , [ 3 ] which requires that States reaffirm " that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the rule of law is essential to all components of the Strategy , recognizing that effective counter - terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals , but complementary and mutually reinforcing , and stressing the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism " .
Furthermore , reaffirming General Assembly resolution 60/158 of 16 December 2005 , which provides the fundamental framework for the " Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism " , in which , amongst other things , States :
Must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with their obligations under international law , in particular human rights law , refugee law and international humanitarian law ; and
Consider becoming parties without delay to the core international instruments on human rights law , refugee law and international humanitarian law , and implementing them , as well as to consider accepting the competence of international and relevant regional human rights monitoring bodies .
In addition , Security Council Resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) , [ 4 ] which called for States to " take appropriate measures in conformity with the relevant provisions of national and international law , including international standards of human rights , before granting refugee status , for the purpose of ensuring that the asylum seeker has not planned , facilitated or participated in the commission of terrorist acts [... ] " .
In this context , Sri Lanka must uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law , including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and customary laws of war , even in the face of violations by the LTTE .
For the above reasons , CHRI and Human Rights Watch urge that the Commonwealth :
Seek assurances that civilians are given the highest protections ; that international humanitarian law is being complied with in full .
Call upon the Sri Lankan government to cease all attacks that violate the laws of war , including artillery bombardment and aerial bombing that does not discriminate between military targets and civilians , or that causes expected harm to civilians and civilian objects that is disproportionate to the anticipated military gain .
Violations of the laws of war by the LTTE do not justify attacks by government security forces in violation of the law .
Call upon the LTTE to stop the use of civilians as " human shields , " take all feasible steps to avoid placing military targets near civilians , stop preventing civilians from leaving areas under its control , respect and facilitate the right to freedom of movement of civilians , including the right of civilians to move to government - controlled territory for safety and end all deliberate attacks on civilians , such as on civilians who are seeking to flee LTTE - controlled areas .
State its concern for the trapped civilians , call upon both parties to facilitate the immediate creation of humanitarian corridors to allow trapped civilians to escape and offer neutral assistance to ensure safe evacuation of civilians , as well as providing aid for humanitarian camps for relocated civilians .
Consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement , ensure that camps for displaced persons respect the basic rights of those residing there .
The camps should be under civilian authority , residents should enjoy the right to freedom of movement due to all Sri Lankan citizens , and impartial humanitarian agencies should have access to the centres without unnecessary restrictions .
Call upon the Sri Lankan government to allow independent observers , including journalists , access to conflict zones so that accurate and timely information about the situation of civilians in such areas is publicly available .
Call upon the government to immediately lift the September 2008 order barring humanitarian agencies from the conflict area in northern Sri Lanka and allow humanitarian agencies to return to assist at - risk individuals and reach all civilians in need .
Restrictions on relief should be made on a case - by - case basis and only when there is a specific and justifiable security reason for the restriction .
Refusals for valid security reasons should only be for as long as necessary and should not block legitimate humanitarian assistance .
Call upon the government to ensure that nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) are able to perform their work without arbitrary government interference : regulation of NGO activities should comply with international standards , be transparent , and follow clearly defined procedures .
Registration should ultimately facilitate the work of NGOs and should neither disrupt legitimate NGO activities nor put NGO workers at risk .
And ,
Strongly urge all CMAG members to collectively advance action on Sri Lanka as a positive way in which to engage the crisis and such situations in the future , whilst also giving full adherence to the Harare Declaration amongst the Commonwealth 's membership .
We believe that a Commonwealth statement would offer encouragement and carry weight towards the development of a solution for the humanitarian crisis and would go a long way toward the fuller realization of CMAG 's potential as a protector of the fundamental principles of the Commonwealth .
Yours sincerely ,

The best image we have so far of Ceres , a ( dwarf ) planet located between Mars and Jupiter , which we 'll be seeing up close for the first time in 2015 .
When it comes to manned exploration the human race has yet to decide on just where we intend to begin human settlement outside of Earth , and for good reason : each and every location within reach of us has its positives and negatives , and there is no perfect destination within reach of us that is the obvious choice .
The Moon , Mars , Venus ( Venus ?
I 'll explain why in a bit ) , simply building a colony in LEO ... but there 's one other possible destination that gets almost no attention at all , even though it should : Ceres .
Before explaining why Ceres should be given more attention as a destination though , it 's good to have some background on the positives and negatives of other proposed destinations , so let 's go over them quickly .
The first proposed destination is obvious : the Moon .
The biggest advantage for the Moon can be summed up in one word : location .
The Moon is only 384,000 km away from us and takes about 3 days to reach , and even more important than this is the fact that it orbits us instead of the Sun , meaning that we do n't have to wait phenomenal lengths of time for launch windows in order to reach it as we have to do with other destinations .
In fact , it 's so close that even an image of our planet and the Moon made to scale still shows a fair amount of detail .
It looks like this :
However , there are some serious negatives about colonizing the Moon : elementwise , it 's lacking in pretty much everything we need to colonize it ( carbon and nitrogen ) , meaning that humans would have to take everything they need from Earth - almost nothing can be made on site .
The Moon also has a weird day and night cycle with 14 days of day followed by 14 days of night , and so anything on the Moon needs to be able to keep itself powered for a full 14 days without the Sun .
In short , there really is n't anything on the Moon that we particularly want or need .
The Moon is kind of like a barren and rocky island located nearby that is easy to get to but does n't have any soil or resources worth exploiting .
Next destination : the cloudtops of Venus .
This is actually quite a simple concept : 50 km or so above the surface of Venus the temperature and atmospheric pressure is about the same as that on Earth , and Venus ' atmosphere is much heavier than ours , meaning that breathable air floats similar to the way helium does here .
An aerostat carrying breathable air for humans would then float , and thus it would be possible to stay afloat for as long as one needs .
Venus is also the second - closest object to us after the Moon , and launch windows are more frequent than a destination like Mars .
Gravity on the " surface " of Venus is also about the same as that on Earth , so there would be no need to worry about the physiological effects of extremely low gravity .
For a pdf giving more detail on exploration of Venus ( from a lecture given by Geoffrey A. Landis at MIT last year ) , see here .
Here 's a quick chart of the temperature and atmospheric pressure on Venus ( from here ) that shows how the temperature and atmosphere lower until they reach a very earthlike level by the time you reach an altitude 50 km above the surface :
Height
( km ) Temp .
( °C ) Atmospheric
pressure
(x Earth ) 0 462 92.10 10 385 47.39 20 306 22.52 30 222 9.851 40 143 3.501 50 75 1.066 60 − 10 0.2357
This 100 km - thick mantle ( 23 –28 percent of Ceres by mass ; 50 percent by volume ) contains 200 million cubic kilometres of water , which is more than the amount of fresh water on the Earth .
This result is supported by the observations made by the Keck telescope in 2002 and by evolutionary modelling .
getting there
Once a launch window has opened up it does take longer to reach Ceres than Mars , but since at the moment a journey even to Mars takes around 6 months , we 're talking about a very long - term journey in any case .
With new propulsive technologies like
Also bear in mind that human exploration of Mars at the moment just is n't possible with our current technology and funding , so any assumptions on exploring these planets should be made keeping in mind the fact that any human exploration of these objects will necessarily require better technologies than the ones we have access to now .
So in short , once we have reached a level where we can seriously think about exploring one or the other we 're looking at a tradeoff of a few extra weeks in space when going to Ceres instead of Mars , but with launch windows every 467 days instead of 780 days ... which means that Ceres is the destination we 'll be able to get to and from more frequently .
Next : getting back .
Ceres is much smaller and less massive than Mars :
... which gives it a much lower escape velocity .
To escape the gravity of Mars you need to be moving at a velocity of 5.027 km / s ( almost half that of Earth ) , but for Ceres this is a much much lower 0.51 km /s .
With a much lower escape velocity not only do you need much less fuel to escape the planet to return to Earth , but the initial mission from Earth ( since the vessel and fuel needed to get back also needs to be launched from Earth in the first place ) will then require that much less fuel to launch from Earth , which lowers costs dramatically .
To show how big a difference this makes , I 've made up a very quick and rough example .
It does n't take into account delta v , wind resistance or anything else , but even as rough as it is it serves a purpose in showing just how huge the difference is in the velocity needed to escape Ceres vs. Earth , Mars and the Moon .
Edit : apparently the rocket images below are somewhat inaccurate , but inaccurate in the right direction ( I 'm happy with that as that was my intent in the first place , merely to show how ridiculously small a rocket you send off from Ceres would be ) ; they could all break the gravity of their respective bodies with a fairly smaller size than that shown below .
Keep that in mind as you look at the images .
Let 's take the Delta II rocket on the launch pad before it sent up the Kepler telescope in early March .
It 's one of the most reliable rockets we have .
This rocket is capable of sending spacecraft either into or out of Earth orbit , and it 's around 38 m in height .
There are people milling about below in this picture , but you can barely see them .
So let 's take a closer look at some of the people at the bottom there .
They look like this :
Next we 'll use that guy in black next to the tower to show the size of the rocket required as we reduce the size by location .
First let 's take a look at Mars .
Escape velocity is 45 % that of Earth , so we 'll shrink the rocket to 45 % of its size but leave him as is :
So there he is standing next to a rocket about the size one might need to break Mars ' orbit .
It 's still a pretty hefty rocket , 17 metres in length so just a bit smaller than SpaceX's Falcon 1 .
Something akin to this ( in size / heft ) would need to be available to a group of humans on the surface of Mars to get back .
Now let 's take the Moon as the next example .
You need 21.25 % of the velocity you would need on Earth to break the Moon 's orbit .
Now the rocket is only 8 metres in height .
Much smaller than the last one .
Now how about Ceres ?
Escape velocity is 4.6 % that of Earth , so we 'll shrink the rocket down to 5 % its size and now we have this :
With this it's now barely larger than the person standing next to it .
For one more example of how easy it is to reach escape velocity from Ceres , take this rocket for example in the video below .
It was launched by a private team in 2004 and reached a velocity of 1.5 km /s .
That 's far below the velocity needed to escape Mars , still not quite enough to escape the Moon ... but three times the velocity needed to escape Ceres .
So for a rocket to escape Ceres you would n't even need the velocity of a fairly small rocket that a group of private space enthusiasts can construct all by themselves .
That 's a huge difference .
Furthermore , looking
Day length , climate , seasons , and gravity :
- A day on Ceres lasts 9 hours compared to 24.6 hours for Mars .
- Mars has a thin atmosphere whereas Ceres ( probably ) has none
- Mars has an axial tilt similar to that of the Earth , giving it seasons similar to our own
- The gravity of Ceres is only 3 % that of Earth whereas Mars is 38 % .
Granted , Mars may feel more like Earth given all that .
However , considering ease of exploration Ceres wins out on all three .
A shorter day means equipment does n't need to be built to withstand longer nights .
Mars is closer to the Sun and so the amount of power that can be gathered during the day is greater , but the thin atmosphere is actually no help here : it 's thin enough that Mars is a void in terms of human physiology ( i.e. take off your helmet and you still die ) but still enough that dust storms can and do often blow up for weeks at a time , obscuring the Sun and suddenly making it harder to gather power .
To illustrate this point even better here 's a video showing the planets from Mercury to Mars , Ceres , and Jupiter just on the outside , as they orbit the Sun .
This makes it pretty easy to see why launch windows to Ceres ( and everywhere else ) are much more frequent than to Mars .
Once a launch window has opened up it does take longer to reach Ceres than Mars , but since at the moment a journey even to Mars takes around 6 months , we 're talking about a very long - term journey in any case .
With new propulsive technologies like VASIMR , travel time to a destination like Mars will eventually apparently be brought down to something on the order of 3 weeks or so , and if we have reached this point technologically then even a trip to Ceres should take less than 3 months , half the time it takes to reach Mars now .
Also bear in mind that human exploration of Mars at the moment just is n't possible with our current technology and funding , so any assumptions on exploring these planets should be made keeping in mind the fact that any human exploration of these objects will necessarily require better technologies than the ones we have access to now .
So in short , once we have reached a level where we can seriously think about exploring one or the other we 're looking at a tradeoff of a few extra weeks in space when going to Ceres instead of Mars , but with launch windows every 467 days instead of 780 days ... which means that Ceres is the destination we 'll be able to get to and from more frequently .

That 's a huge difference .
Furthermore , looking here you can see a list of rockets built by some other rocket enthusiasts , some of which have maximum velocities over half that required to break orbit from Ceres .
These rockets as well are usually only 1 - 3 metres in height .
In short , the difference between the velocity needed to escape Mars vs. Ceres really is the difference between night and day . - A day on Ceres lasts 9 hours compared to 24.6 hours for Mars . - Mars has a thin atmosphere whereas Ceres ( probably ) has none -
Mars has an axial tilt similar to that of the Earth , giving it seasons similar to our own -
The gravity of Ceres is only 3 % that of Earth whereas Mars is 38 % .
Granted , Mars maymore like Earth given all that .

A shorter day means equipment does n't need to be built to withstand longer nights .

A dust storm in 2007 darkened the sky in almost the entire southern hemisphere and almost doomed the rovers there , so these dust storms are nothing to take lightly .
Mars has an axial tilt of 25.19° , giving it seasons similar to those on Earth - summer with more sunlight and higher temperatures , followed by winter with weaker sunlight and lower temperatures .
What about Ceres ?
Its axial tilt is a mere 3° , meaning there 's almost no variation whatsoever .
So when planning electricity gathering for a mission to Mars one has to take into account yearly changes in sunlight depending on the season as well as the possibility of bad weather over months at a time , whereas on Ceres there 's very little variation at all .
Finally : terraforming .
Yes , Mars
On a slightly off - topic note , could Ceres ever retain an atmosphere ?
The short answer is no : even though it 's farther from the Sun than Mars is , it 's much too small ( in terms of mass ) to retain its own atmosphere , although remember that this is over a long period of time ; that is , were Ceres to suddenly be given an atmosphere tomorrow it would n't just be blown away by the solar wind the next day .
I 've seen some estimates on forums before that Ceres should be capable of retaining an atmosphere for a few hundred years ( tinier than tiny in geologic terms , but not quite so tiny from a human colonization point of view ) , but those were unsourced so take that number with a large grain of salt .
There are some pretty creative ideas out there on giving Ceres an atmosphere such as constructing a coil around the equator to give it a false magnetic field , and using a lot of SF6 (
Back on topic : so where to start ?
That 's easy - we 've already begun .
A probe called
And finally , the lower gravity may have some negative effects on human physiology in the long term , and we 're still uncertain as to whether even the 38 % gravity of Mars is sufficient .
But we 're still capable of living for months at a time with no gravity at all , and there are other possible solutions to this such as building centrifuges .
The lower gravity also makes the crucial initial robotic exploration that much easier as well .
Robotic rovers on the surface of Ceres ( depending on the terrain ) could hop about the surface and cover a lot more terrain than rovers on Mars can .
Finally : .
Yes , Mars can be terraformed , eventually .
However , terraforming is an extremely long process though that is so completely beyond us at this point that it 's not even worth talking about .
That is , by the time we 've obtained the ability to completely terraform a planet we 'll have long since surpassed our current problems re : launch windows , fuel to get to and from a destination , protecting astronauts from radiation during the journey , etc .
Besides , terraforming can also be started without a human presence .

There are some pretty creative ideas out there on giving Ceres an atmosphere such as constructing a coil around the equator to give it a false magnetic field , and using a lot of SF6 ( sulfur hexafluoride ) in place of nitrogen considering how heavy it is in comparison .
Some have proposed just a tiny atmosphere ( perhaps with an atmospheric pressure just 1 % or 0.1 % that of the Earth ) to keep colonists safe from micrometeorite impacts .
The technology to do any of this though is way beyond us though , so the possibility of terraforming or the creation of an atmosphere does n't really have anything to do with the potential for colonization in the short term .
Back on topic : so where to start ?
That 's easy - we 've already begun .
A probe called Dawn is on its way right now and will arrive at Ceres in 2015 after orbiting Vesta for a few months .
Once Dawn arrives and we are able to see Ceres close up then we 'll be able to determine whether it's worth exploring in further detail with rovers and eventually with humans .
Since there is no perfect destination near the Earth to explore there will naturally be differences of opinion over where we should explore first , but Ceres thus far has been more or less ignored by the public at large , and deserves more attention than it has gotten .
So in the meantime as we wait for Dawn to arrive , just keep in mind that there 's a ( dwarf ) planet out there called Ceres that is likely a very worthwhile candidate for us to explore , and deserves our consideration as well .
For more info on Ceres , see here ,
For more info on Ceres , see here here , and here ( this last one is a pdf ) .
If you 're interested in seeing some other informal discussions on the subject check out here here , and here , and finally there 's a fairly interesting discussion on the subject on the space.com forums here as well that actually goes into a fair amount of detail on exactly what steps we could begin taking over the next few years to begin the process .
Negatives : these are obvious .
The first is that any colony is necessarily limited to the air , and so no exploration of the surface could be done .
Also , we still do n't know enough about the atmosphere at that level , regarding important aspects like the frequency of lightning .
The air is also acidic , and the winds are extremely high due to something called super - rotation , and they reach speeds of 400 kph .
The environment there is perfect for an unmanned solar flyer which could stay in the sun for 24 hours a day ( because of Venus ' slow rotation ) , but for manned exploration we 're not ready yet .
Finally , there seems to be quite a bit of resistance to the idea of exploring a planet without being on terra firma .
Perhaps psychologically the idea of staying above the surface in an artificial aerostat all the time is a little bit depressing .
The logical next destination would then seem to be Mars .
It 's the next farthest out , it has an atmosphere ( but a very thin one ) , the length of day and night is almost the same as our own , water exists to a certain extent .
But Mars has some serious drawbacks for human exploration and since we 're comparing the two it's best to begin with a quick introduction to Ceres .
Ceres : Ceres is an object of some 950 km in diameter ( since it orbits a star and has hydrostatic equilibrium I believe it should be called a planet without all the nonsense about " clearing its orbit " , but that 's a different subject ) located in between Mars and Jupiter .
Here 's what its orbit looks like : Ceres has one important detail that makes it much more interesting than one might expect : apparently it has lots and lots of water
When you take a look at Ceres compared to some other bodies like the Earth it seems like quite a small place to explore , such as in this image : ( that 's Ceres on the bottom left ) This looks tiny , but there 's still a lot to explore : the actual surface area of Ceres is some 2.8 million km , which is the equivalent of the surface area of either Argentina or Kazakhstan , or the total surface area of the largest three states in the US put together : Alaska plus Texas plus California .
Ceres is n't just some tiny asteroid with nowhere to explore .
Now let 's compare Ceres with Mars as a destination for colonization .
How do they stack up ?
First of all , in the first place .
Mars is closer to us , Ceres is farther out .
It would seem that this would result in us not being able to send missions to Ceres as frequently as to Mars ... but in fact the opposite is true .
Keep in mind that the only time we can reach a destination is when a launch window opens up , and frequency of launch windows is determined by the synodic period ( basically the amount of time it takes for an object and the Earth to line up with each other ) .
This image of Spirit 's flight path to Mars shows how a launch to a destination like Mars works .
The launch window opens up when the two planets are fairly close to each other but the outside object is ahead , then the probe launches , and meets up with the destination planet a few months later on .
So you can see that launch windows occur when two objects are fairly close to each other but not at their closest point , and the frequency in which two objects approach each other ( the synodic period ) determines how frequent they will be .
Here are the synodic periods for some destinations in the Solar System ( : Notice something about Mars ?
That 's right , it has the longest synodic period of them all .
On one extreme with an extremely fast object like Mercury it catches up with us in no time at all , and on the other extreme objects far out at the edge of the Solar System have extremely slow orbits which means that every time the Earth moves around the Sun it has almost " caught up " with the other object ( since it has only moved a tiny bit around the Sun during that time ) and we have an opportunity to make use of this to launch a probe to the planet .
But Mars ' orbit is exceptionally badly placed in that even though it moves more slowly around the Sun than Earth does , it still moves fast enough that it takes Earth a long time to pull away and finally catch up with Mars again .
Since Ceres is located farther away and thus has a slower orbit , launch windows are much more frequent .
780 days vs. 467 days is a huge difference in terms of frequency .
And now to an electronic immigrant who ought to be illegal , but apparently is n't .
You can find him doing his stuff at 3 am on Channel Nine :
God has used Reverend Peter Popoff throughout his entire life and ministry to bring miraculous deliverance to hundreds of thousands of people around the world .
— Channel Nine , ' Peter Popoff Ministries ' , 21st April , 2009
It 's not clear - and the Nine Network would n't tell us - whether Peter Popoff is paying to have his half - hour message aired .
But whether he is , or he is n't , it 's clearly an exercise in spruiking a product : " miracle spring water " :
We 're going to share the miracle spring water with you .
And I 'm going to tell you how a Russian pastor found the miracle spring water , not on his own but through divine leading and direction and God miraculously spared , prospered , delivered him and God wants to do the same for you as you use the miracle spring water .
— Channel Nine , ' Peter Popoff Ministries ' , 21st April , 2009
And as you can see , this miracle water is ABSOLUTELY FREE !
Which is clever of the Reverend Popoff .
Because if he were selling you the miracle water , which he says has the power to transform your life , he'd be engaging in trade or commerce .
And under the Trade Practices Act , a person or corporation ...

Peter Popoff has form .
Back in the early 80's , he was a celebrated faith healer , who miraculously knew the names and addresses of individuals scattered through his congregations ...

Audience member :
That 's right ! —

And without asking , he knew their ailments too ...

But , thanks to the detective work of an American sceptic called James Randi , the hoax was exposed - on camera :
Elizabeth Popoff : Jodi Dean .
Jodi Dean Peter Popoff : Jodi ... Dean ?
Jodi Dean ?
Elizabeth Popoff :
No , she should be right there on your right side .
Ok .
She lives at 4267 Masterson ...

The female voice was that of Peter Popoff 's wife Elizabeth , prompting him via a wireless earpiece from information she 'd garnered before the service .
Shortly after that was aired on national TV , Popoff filed for bankruptcy .
But for the last decade he and Elizabeth have been back in the game .
Matt Meagher : According to tax returns , Popoff 's Ministry took in more than $ 23 million in 2005 ... — American Broadcasting Corporation , Inside Edition , web video , February 2007
In February 2007 , reporter Matt Meagher , of the US TV program Inside Edition , described how Popoff made his money ...
Matt Meagher : Our miracle water came with what Popoff calls a bag of sacred Dead Sea salt .
I 'm supposed to sprinkle it over a cheque , made out to Popoff , for $ 27 dollars ...
As for the miracle water , I 'm supposed to drink it , wait five days , and I 'll be blessed with riches .
Of course I 'm supposed to send Popoff another cheque .
— American Broadcasting Corporation , Inside Edition , web video , February 2007
And once the demands started , they did n't stop .
As Peter Popoff knows , the world is full of desperate and gullible people .
The Western Australian Department of Commerce runs a website called ScamNet .
It pulls no punches about Peter Popoff :
There is nothing more evil then using people 's faith to line your own pockets !
— WA ScamNet psychic scam
In the UK , the Advertising Standards Authority banned Popoff 's infomercials two years ago .
But in Australia , so far , the regulators have done nothing .
Perhaps because it 's not clear which regulator should act .
If Popoff is paying Nine , it 's an advertisement , and should comply with the Australian Advertisers ' Code of Ethics , which says :
Advertising or Marketing Communications shall not be misleading or deceptive or be likely to mislead or deceive .
— AANA Code of Ethics , section 1.2
Read the AANA Code of Ethics .
If Popoff is n't paying Nine , but just giving this guff to the Network for free , it becomes a program .
In fact Nine has the gall to refer to it as :
Peter Popoff Religious program — Channel Nine online schedule
Religious program !
I prefer what ScamNet calls it - a :
psychic scam .

We know of one Australian network that 's refused to put Peter Popoff to air .
But Nine , apparently has no such qualms .
The NASA STEREO mission ( my mission ! ) is visiting L4 and L5 .
These are the Lagrange points are where the Earth and Sun gravitationally balance each other out .
SOHO hangs out at L1 , between Earth and Sun ( but very near Earth ) .
L4 and L5 are about 60 degrees ahead and behind the Earth 's position in its orbit .
Since L4/L5 gather material , we expect more dust .
Dust , of course , can damage our detectors should there be a significant fluke hit directly on a camera .
Already , we ' see '-- as in , get hit by -- regions of dust in Earth 's orbit .
STEREO
B suffers more than its sibling A , as B's HI detector is oriented in the ram direction .
And no , windshield wipers wo n't help .
To summarize the article : the twin STEREO satellites ( one leading Earth 's orbit , one trailing ) are going to pass through the L4/L5 regions .
There is thought there 's unformed planet material , or perhaps the remains of an early proto - planet nicknamed Theia .
In one scenario , Theia was perturbed from L4 enough to slam into the Earth , knocking off a chunk of material to create our Moon !
Whether Theia exists , the L4 and L5 points are attraction wells for interesting space clutter .
Early planet material from before the Earth formed , later material that drifted in , dust , entire asteroids , there is a lot there .
We do n't know what , we just know that a ) there should be stuff there and b ) when we rolled STEREO for a 6 - hour peak , we saw stuff .
What stuff , we 'll find out when we get closer .
STEREO is going there by happy chance .
Ostensibly STEREO is a pair of sun-observing satellites in interesting 1 AU orbits .
Already , though , the wide - field HI detectors have shown us wide starfields and even a comet being stripped by a CME , and the coronagraph have shown us Jupiter and , of course , the sungrazer comet observations started by LASCO.L4 and L5 are stable Lagrangian points .
Unlike L2 , L3 or even L1 , where SOHO hangs out , they do n't require fuel to stay there , just luck .
Venus in particular can disturb material out of L4/L5 , but material can also accumulate there .
They are , in a word , interesting .
And risky .
Stuart Clark in New Scientist called them gravity holes harboring ' planetary assassins ' .
How to handle the L4/L5 passage has been debated .
As the earlier articles show , Mike Kaiser at GSFC ( STEREO's PI ) considered burning most of STEREO 's fuel to remain at L4/L5 , but that had too much of an impact on the overall STEREO science .
L4/L5 are broad enough that STEREO will pass there around Sept - Oct of this year , so there will be time to examine them .
The only instruments really able to see are those aforementioned wide - field HI detectors .
To view L4/L5 , STEREO will rotate 180 degrees so the HI ( normally pointing ' out ' ) look along the orbit .
Informal discussion within the team suggests we 'll do this for a half a day several times a month , both approaching and while in the L4/L5 points .
During the roll , the in - situ detectors on STEREO ( PLASTIC and IMPACT ) simply do n't work ( they expect a certain field orientation ) , so this is a trade - off .
One detector wins , some other science is put on hold .
It 's a fair trade .
You can spin this story several ways .
The tourism bureau just tells us STEREO will visit L4 / L5 .
The engineers talk about risks due to impacts and dusts .
The project managers decide to temporarily repurpose this solar mission for planetary work .
The scientists muse about what might be lurking in L4 / L5 .
The science writers find speculation on planet - killers .
However we talk about it , for now we plan and wait .
Soon , L4 and L5's secrets will be ours .

PlayStation marketing boss John Koller has been talking to Wired about the PSP and PlayStation Network , where he has revealed that digital distribution is the future of Sony 's handheld device .
It 'll be Sony 's " big push " this year as the company focuses on simultaneous UMD and PSN releases for PSP games .
" Not to say that retail is n't of extreme importance , because it is , " Koller explains , " but the idea of offering content to consumers , to make it easy , you can wake up in the morning , download something and go , it 's very appealing .
So one of our big pushes this year is to be sure that the right kind of content and the right kind of games in particular are placed on the PlayStation Network for download on the PSP . "
Koller also talked about how the American PS Store lacks when compared to Japan , where all manner of PSOne Classics are available : " What 's coming out of Japan echoes the way that we look at the world here in North America .
They have decided to go full - bore with digital content , and we have as well .
All of that 's going to happen .
We look at that as a big opportunity for us . "
The idea of the PSP as a digital download hub could be the angle that the system really needs to go over in America , and also entice more third party interest .
I can see publishers looking at the PSP almost as a testing ground to see how digital distribution of full games could work on a grander scale .
It 's a clever idea , and I hope Sony does n't stuff it up .
The platform holder has a golden opportunity to capitalize on portable downloadable gaming before the competition .
Fingers crossed that it takes that opportunity and does n't get complacent .

This unusual artifact was discovered at 2:30 am in the 7 - 11 convenience store at the corner of Valmont and Folsom , in Boulder , CO .
¡ Sponch ! seems to be a Mexican snackfood cake produced by Marinela brand of the massive Bimbo Bakeries Group .
¡ Sponch ! is a strange concotion .
It starts with a graham crackery biscuit base .
This is then topped with four round marshmallows , two pink and two white .
These marshamallows are coated in dry coconut flakes and the orifice between them is injected with strawberry jam .
A friend noted that this recipe “ sounds like the kind of candy you invent when you ’re five . ”
Despite ( or because of ) this novel combination of flavors , eating ¡ Sponch ! is a strenuously unpleasant experience .
My expedition colleagues ’ reactions were “ Mmf …. this is very disppointing ” and “ I can ’t … I ca n’t eat this . ”
In the name of research , I finished my cake item and I regret the experience .
I catalog the failures of ¡ Sponch ! as follows :
When the cake is pressed against the transparent package , the blood - red filling oozes out from the fleshy marshmallow surface , striking a unsettling resemblance to an open wound .
The moisture from the jam and marshmallows is absorbed by the graham cracker base , transforming the crisp biscuit into a soggy mass of paste reminiscent of the breadcrusts that did n’t quite make it down the sink drain while you were washing the breakfast dishes .
The marshmallow texture is all wrong .
Instead of the light foaminess of campfire marshmallows , or the sugary crisp of Lucky Charms ‘ marhsmallows ’ , ¡ Sponch !
marshmallows are dense , rubbery , and spongy ( sponchy ? ) .
¡ Sponch ! is simply too much .
Too many different flavors , too many textures , too many exclamation marks .
And the cake is about 30 % too large .
Like pizza and ice cream , great flavors do n’t neccesarily taste great together .
All of this leads us to an interesting question : “ Why , if ¡ Sponch ! is so unappetizing , does it continue to be produced , sold , and , judging by internet research , widely popular ? ” I believe there are 4 possible explanations .
Incidental : The ¡ Sponch !
we tried was a bad sample .
It had sat on the shelf too long and was manhandled in delivery Personal : Most people find ¡ Sponch ! delicious .
My research colleaques and I have peculiar tastes and are overly picky .
Cultural : As a Mexican product , ¡ Sponch ! is designed for Hispanic cutural tastes , and is considered to be quite tasty in that culture .
Much like menudo , we have diffiulty appreciating ¡ Sponch ! with our Anglo - Saxon Americans palettes .
Actual : ¡ Sponch ! is truly unappetizing , and most people agree .
Like Spam and Twinkies , the product is desired purely out of tradition , novelty , nostalgia , and morbid curiosity .
And then there ’s the name .
“ ¡ Sponch ! ” almost certainly sounds less bizarre in Spanish .
It instantly reminded me of “ SBlounskched ! ” , a fictional candy bar featured in this episode of a popular web cartoon .
Interestingly , S.P.O.N.C.H. is an acronym used by biochemists to refer to the key elements that comprise living organisms : Sulphur , Phosporus , Oxygen , Carbon , Nitrogen , and Hydrogen .
Perhaps these are also the key components of ¡ Sponch !.
For one , I do n’t think the name accurately describes the experience of eating the product .
I suggest “ Spliidge … ”
Note the lack of exclamation marks .
Continuing Research : Investigation of the Marinela and Bimbo websites and company literature .
I will return soon with more information on this peculiar discovery .

Thought :
When used in packaging , what images and experiences does the color pink conjure ?
How important is the role of texture ( as opposed to flavor ) in your enjoyment of food ?
Which foods or flavors in your culture must seem bizarre to to others ?

By the time Sue Woodcock came to retire from her career as a policewoman , she 'd had enough of Hampshire , where she was based and longed for a more traditional and natural way of life – one where she could " live by [ her ] own rules " .
In her old life , back in what she calls " that England " , she had become disillusioned by politics , by society as a whole .
So she moved north to become a crofter in the Yorkshire Dales .
In 2004 she bought Mire House : a deserted heap of stones with no running water , no electricity and not much of a roof .
What remained of her savings she spent on rare - breed sheep and an old Rayburn cooker .
Before long she was installed in her leaking hermitage along with a family of dogs , cats , chickens , sheep , goats and Henry the turkey .
Her plan had been to do all this with the man she was seeing at the time , though that did n't work out .
Instead of wallowing in heartbreak , she discovered she was excited by the idea of solitude .
Surrounded by " bats , owls and plenty of animals " she says she never gets lonely .
Sue Woodcock is a modern - day hermit .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I love it , " she explains , from the unplastered interior of her home , which smells of stone and damp and where everything in sight is functional and worn .
" It means I can fart and belch as I like .
I can wander round in my pyjamas , make as much mess as I like , go to bed when I want , and there are no arguments . "
Being a hermit is about much more than just living an uninhibited , single life .
As well as being someone who lives alone , a hermit is seen to have gone back to nature , leading a life of asceticism free from materialism .
With the prediction that , by 2010 , up to 46 per cent of UK households will be lived in by only one person , perhaps the hermit is about to come back into vogue .
For Woodcock , there is more to it than just the freedom of living alone : " I have no morals , see , " she continues , " personal principles – but not morals .
They 're things others impose on you . "
Her desire for a people - free existence was perhaps formed in her youth .
" At school I was the fat , red - haired girl with freckles and no parents – they decided they did n't want me and moved to Australia , which led to bullying .
I 've always been the odd one out .
When everyone else was mad about the Beatles , I liked Frank Ifield .
He could really sing . "
For centuries , Englishwomen beyond child - bearing age who lived alone would arouse suspicion .
As recently as the early 20th century women were sectioned for offences such as living by themselves , not cutting their hair or not tidying their kitchen .
Historically , our understanding of what is eccentric or threatening has been articulated by masculine elites threatened by female non-conformity .
" There 's no way I could have done this 100 years ago , " Woodcock says .
" They would have called me insane . "
Which is not to say she has escaped persecution .
Less than two years after moving in , the local park authority decided they wanted her out , claiming the house that she had bought legitimately should remain a ruin and that by patching her roof with tarpaulin she had altered its state illegally .
Arguably , it was her lifestyle that was deemed unacceptable .
An eviction notice was pinned to her door , which she chose to ignore and she has since – after a hearty battle – won the right to stay put .
As a result , Woodcock became something of a local hero .
Amid all the suspicion , the English have always had a peculiar affection for hermits .
Lawrence Durrell once called us a nation of islomanes who are drawn instinctively towards islands .
With the hermit a human island , it makes sense that the English find something inherently admirable about them .
Hermits are embodiments of doing your own thing , knowing your rights , minding your own business , my house is my castle ; 18th - century landowners would even employ " ornamental hermits " to live in grottoes on their estates .
Charles Hamilton of Painshill Park advertised for a hermit who was not to cut his beard or nails , leave the grounds , talk to the servants , attack the guests , or wear anything other than a camel - hair robe .
The only known applicant was sacked after three weeks when someone spotted him at the local pub .

Tom Leppard is by no means an ornamental hermit .
I interviewed him , along with Sue Woodcock , for my book on English eccentrics .
After a brutal convent education , and retired from the armed forces , Tom Leppard moved to London , which he loathed .
It made him realise that every time in his life he'd been unhappy people had been involved .
So Leppard vowed to become a hermit and moved to a remote part of the Isle of Skye .
Before leaving London he had 99.2 per cent of his flesh tattooed with leopard spots , projecting his acute sense of apartness on to his skin .
That was more than 20 years ago .
Tom is 73 now and – when we finally meet , after I track him down in his remote lair with the help of a local fisherman – he is wearing a woolly hat , a fleece with a flap that covers his groin , and very little else .
His home , Paradise , as he calls it , is very neat .
Most of his daily chores are aimed at keeping it that way .
At the heart of his encampment is a cave made from the remains of a sheep pen and bits of timber from nearby beaches .
He survives on tins of food he buys with the pension he picks up when he kayaks over to the mainland .
Before we can chat , he has to find his dentures .
" Have n't spoken to anyone in a while , see , " he explains .
Leppard says he was lonely in London but never gets lonely now .
But why choose such an extreme path ?
Leppard puts it simply : " I 'm selfish .
I 've got all this , " he nods at the view that sweeps past a flank of Scottish scarp .
" And I want to keep it .
I do n't want to share it with anybody . "
As well as reminding us that it 's possible to live without material possessions , by their example Woodcock and Leppard remind us not to confuse the words " alone " and " lonely " .
Companionship is not always a prerequisite to fulfilment .
As our population gets older and we grow increasingly fond of living on our own , this is more relevant now than ever before .

British hermits : a history
Richard Rolle , 1290 - 1349
A Christian recluse who lived in isolation in Yorkshire and wrote The Fire of Love , including descriptions of the music he'd hear in his head when he sang psalms .
Roger Crab , 1621 - 1680
After being sentenced to death by Cromwell for being an " agitator " , Crab was reprieved .
He then gave all his money to the poor , gave up meat and alcohol and lived a life of solitude near Uxbridge .
Locals came to him for prophecies .
Henry Cavendish , 1731 - 1810
Any of his servants who acknowledged him were dismissed .
As well as disliking company , Cavendish was a brilliant scientist .
The 5th Duke of Portland , 1800 - 1879
An eccentric who did not like being outdoors and had 15 miles of tunnels built beneath his home , Welbeck Abbey , so he could get about without being seen .
James Lucas , 1813 - 1874
After his mother died he had her corpse embalmed and refused to let it be buried , barricading himself in his home .
The police eventually broke in provoking lasting paranoia .
Lucas never left the house again , wearing only a horse - rug and refusing to wash or cut his nails .
His body turned grey , then black .
Józef ' Fred ' Stawinoga , 1920 - 2007
Stawinoga lived in a tent on an island in the Wolverhampton Ring Road for almost 40 years .
Local
Sikhs came to revere him as a holy man .
There is talk of a monument being erected in his honour .

It was an obscene ritual we practiced while taking turns screening each other from the road .
Fall River in August has a pretty decent evening grab – but to get to it you ’d donate a quart of blood and scratch for days .
Gary Warren and I would take turns dropping trousers while frantically smearing our entire body with 100 % DEET , then we ’d spray each other with the aerosol version and make a dash through the grass for the river .
Generously slathered DEET fixed us and the mosquito problem , ensuring neither of us would reproduce – and leading to its removal from store shelves .
Heat and harsh sunlight was the other issue for us guides – me being the junior ensured I ’d get a respite every three or four days , but the primary and secondary guides often endured two and three week stints of 100 degree weather and 14 hour days .
They always wore long sleeve shirts and broad brim hats – which despite the heat burden would assist in keeping the sun off tender flesh - avoiding burns and potential for skin cancer .
Most fabrics offer little protection from the sun and wearing both shirt and tee shirt is not much better .
Researchers are linking coffee ( caffeine ) with skin protection and have discovered how caffeine blocks mutant cells from becoming cancerous .
“ But , Nghiem added , people should n’t increase the amount of coffee or tea they drink to prevent skin cancer .
“ You are talking a lot of cups for a lot of years for a relatively small effect , ” he said .
“ But if you like it , it ’s another reason to drink it . ”
If the human trials prove convincing , we can all stop apologizing for slopping coffee down our shirt fronts – it ’ll be essential gear akin to fly floatant on your dry fly .
It ’s mostly “ teeth floatant ” at the moment , but while you ’re running for the underbrush wishing you had zipper - front waders , cursing both bacon and eggs – you can be confident your skin looks radiant .
Teaching about intolerance in my high school Ethics class in a small town in Oklahoma lead to a real life lesson for my students when I was forced to resign for insubordination .
Teaching
about intolerance in my high school Ethics class in a small town in
Oklahoma lead to a real life lesson for my students when I was forced
to resign for insubordination .
Conflicts had escalated between the superintendent
of schools , my students and me over his biased decision to suspend my
class because I was teaching The Laramie Project .
I
had sought and received approval from the principal to teach the tragic
story of Matthew Shepard , a gay young man brutally murdered in Laramie ,
Wyoming by two young men who " hated " gay people .
I chose The
Laramie Project because of its prevailing themes of intolerance
and hate crimes .
The students and I studied the criminal investigation
and examined how different citizens of Laramie responded when they learned
Matthew ’s murderers – Aaron " A.J. " McKinney and Russell Henderson –
were life - long residents of the rural Wyoming community .
One thing is
for sure , I did not use The Laramie Project to teach about gay
rights or to teach a unit on gay lifestyles , as the superintendent Mr .
Turlington has alleged .
It is not necessary to teach about gay lifestyles
to my students ’ generation .
Several students have gay family members ;
some of the family members have been in long - term , same - sex relationships .
In
truth , I was challenging them to examine where and how the two young
men – McKinney and Henderson – learned to hate ; because hate , like
love , is learned behavior .
I wanted them to understand where the lessons
of hate and intolerance are typically learned : parents , teachers , members
of the community , even in churches .
I had hoped that by using The
Laramie Project each student would examine their prejudices and
form healthier practices of tolerance , compassion and advocacy .
The
irony is that the students learned the lesson well , but not inside the
walls of a Grandfield High School classroom .
They had their classroom
moved into the real world where they have experienced the real life
lessons of intolerance ; witnessed acts promoted by homophobic fears
and ideology and yes , encountered hatred .
Even in this small town of
1,100 people , it ’s not all black and white .
As one local resident
told Hunter Stuart , a video journalist , " We do n’t live in the fifties
anymore . "
Another told him , " I know people who are gay .
I do n’t
like what they do , but I treat them with respect . "

But as one thing led to another ,
I asked a member of the school board to get involved .
I was accused
of insubordination by Superintendent Turlington and felt I had no alternative
but to accept the superintendent ’s agreement of resignation .
As the
editor of the local newspaper admonished in an editorial " it was wrong
to question the decisions of your superiors . "
I
am humbled by the fact that people across the country find the story
of my students and me important .
The media has become our courtroom .
The more people advocate for us against the injustices we have experienced ,
the better I feel about losing my job .
No matter where we live or go
to school we need to promote attitudes of compassion and tolerance for
all students , all people – gay or straight .
I would be naïve to think
what has happened to my students and me is an isolated incident .
Unfortunately ,
those in charge of the school just do n’t get it .
I know any gay student
at Grandfield High School has been taught a dubious lesson .
They have
learned they better keep quiet until they are old enough to leave town .
With the cause of a rampantly deadly bat illness still unknown , biologists have no solution to the problem but have proposed at least a quick fix that may be able to slow it down .
At least half a million bats throughout the northeast United States have died from white - nose syndrome ( WNS ) , a fungal infection that was first observed only two years ago .
The fungus is thought to grow on bats ' facial skin and flight membranes , possibly causing them to starve .
No one knows where the fungus came from , or if it is what is directly killing the bats .
But in caves where it has been observed , bats have suffered morality rates ranging from 75 to 100 percent [ Scientific American ] .
With the cause of the fungus not yet determined , researchers worry about the fate of bats , which play an important role in controlling the populations of insects that can damage wheat , apples and dozens of other crops [ AP ] .
While it wo n't solve the problem , a temporary stop - gap is now being considered that would place battery - operated heated boxes inside bats ' hibernation caves , and may give the animals the energy they need to fight off , or at least survive , the fungal infections [ Scientific American ] .
The idea is based on the fact that the bats with WNS appear emaciated , as if they 've starved to death during their winter hibernation ; researchers theorize that afflicted bats rouse from hibernation more often than normal bats and thus burn more fat to stay warm [ AP ] .
When they temporarily stir , the bats ' body temperature and metabolism spike .
To test how the heated box tactic might work , biologists Justin Boyles and Craig Willis created computer models to look at how disrupted hibernation patterns may have created the high mortality rate caused by WNS .
They then added artificial warming zones within hibernation caves ....
In the model , the bats that were provided with additional heat were able to retain enough energy to fight the fungal infection , and survival rates increased by up to 75 percent [ Scientific American ] .
The researchers ' proposal , published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment , will be tested initially in Manitoba , Canada , far from the affected area so as to avoid any risk of accelerating the spread of the disease .
Researchers emphasize that the measure is not a solution , and note that there are potential problems with a mass deployment of heaters that go beyond the logistics and cost .
Willis concedes that such an intervention could backfire if white nose is spread from bat to bat in the summer , since it would prolong the survival of infected bats .
But .... given the magnitude of the problem , it makes sense to at least test the hypothesis [ AP ] .

Viewers of the Ohio State - Siena game may have noticed a proselytizing attention whore with a John 3:16 sign .
But did you see an NCAA security guard snatch it ?
One eagle - eyed viewer did ; roll the tape .

Now , before anyone gets all bent out of shape about the NCAA hating your magical best friend in the sky , I 'll remind you that the NCAA prohibits from waving ANY signs at tournament games .
It does n't matter if you 're promoting Jesusism , alfalfism , or good old - fashioned heavy metal ; the NCAA pooh - poohs it .
The First Amendment , that old standby of any healthy uninformed internet argument , does n't apply here .
NCAA Tournament games are private events put on by a private organization .
They can ban pretty much anything they want .
Unless , of course , you give the NCAA a few million bucks to be a " corporate partner " .
Then you can plaster your signs anywhere you damn well please .

If Friday the 13th is unlucky , then 2009 is an unusually unlucky year .
This week 's Friday the 13th is one of three to endure this year .
The first came last month .
The next is in November .
Such a rare triple - threat occurs only once every 11 years .
The origin of the link between bad luck and Friday the 13th is murky .
The whole thing might date to Biblical times ( the 13th guest at the Last Supper betrayed Jesus ) .
By the Middle Ages , both Friday and 13 were considered bearers of bad fortune .
In modern times , the superstition permeates society .
Here are five of our favorite Friday - the - 13th facts :
1. Fear of Friday the 13th — one of the most popular myths in science — is called paraskavedekatriaphobia as well as friggatriskaidekaphobia .
Triskaidekaphobia is fear of the number 13 .
2 . Many hospitals have no room 13 , while some tall buildings skip the 13th floor and some airline terminals omit Gate 13 .
3. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would not travel on the 13th day of any month and would never host 13 guests at a meal .
Napoleon and President Herbert Hoover were also triskaidekaphobic , with an abnormal fear of the number 13 .
4. Mark Twain once was the 13th guest at a dinner party .
A friend warned him not to go .
" It was bad luck , " Twain later told the friend .
" They only had food for 12 . "
Superstitious diners in Paris can hire a quatorzieme , or professional 14th guest .
5 . The number 13 suffers from its position after 12 , according to numerologists who consider the latter to be a complete number — 12 months in a year , 12 signs of the zodiac , 12 gods of Olympus , 12 labors of Hercules , 12 tribes of Israel , 12 apostles of Jesus , 12 days of Christmas and 12 eggs in a dozen .
Pythagorean legacy
Meanwhile the belief that numbers are connected to life and physical things — called numerology — has a long history .
" You can trace it all the way from the followers of Pythagoras , whose maxim to describe the universe was ' all is number , ' " says Mario Livio , an astrophysicist and author of " The Equation That Could n't Be Solved " ( Simon & Schuster , 2005 ) .
Thinkers who studied under the famous Greek mathematician combined numbers in different ways to explain everything around them , Livio said .
In modern times , numerology has become a type of para - science , much like the meaningless predictions of astrology , scientists say .
" People are subconsciously drawn towards specific numbers because they know that they need the experiences , attributes or lessons associated with them , that are contained within their potential , " says professional numerologist Sonia Ducie .
" Numerology can ' make sense ' of an individual 's life ( health , career , relationships , situations and issues ) by recognizing which number cycle they are in , and by giving them clarity . "
However , mathematicians dismiss numerology , saying it lacks any scientific merit .
" I do n't endorse this at all , " Livio said , when asked to comment on the popularity of commercial numerology .
Seemingly coincidental connections between numbers will always appear if you look hard enough , he said .
A quick search on the topic showed that many people over the last few years have been banned from Amazon , receiving the same e-mail almost verbatim .
Although this is a little disheartening , there are plenty of places on the Internet that already cover the topic .
What made this user 's tale stand out was the fact that he was also a Kindle owner .
As you may already know , Amazon 's electronic reader , the Kindle ( and newer Kindle 2 ) is linked to the owner 's Amazon account where the inventory of purchased books is managed .
In addition , although there are a few other sources , it is primarily the only way to buy books for the device .
When this user 's Amazon account was closed , he also lost access to all the books he had purchased , as well as the ability to shop for new material .
This situation brings the bigger picture of Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) to the forefront .
When you purchase any form of media from a company , do they have the right to deny you access in the future ( presuming it was not purchased on a subscription basis ) ?
The above mentioned user ended up with a $ 360 device that was totally worthless to him .
He could n't even access books he had already paid for .
Furthermore , it seems that Amazon 's policies and user agreements allow for this kind of action ( although there are no specific policies for its canceling an account in the first place ) .
So , is this now a case of buyer beware ?
Will all those people who read the agreement and warned of such possibilities end up having the last " I told you so " laugh ?
Ultimately , the user appealed to Amazon and it reinstated his account noting that " if a higher - than - acceptable number of concession incidents occur in the future " they will ban him again .
Although this particular incident worked out for the user , it is still a bit frightening that a company can unilaterally make such a decision .
Of course , it would be technically possible for Amazon to allow banned users to continue accessing their Kindle accounts , but they chose not to go that route and , based on its user agreement , Amazon does n't have to .
We 're sure someone will eventually challenge situations such as this in the courts but , in the meantime , it might be worthwhile to read that small print closely and think twice about giving a company total control over what you can and can't do with purchased media .
Otherwise , you may find yourself with a $ 360 brick .
An Amazon spokesperson could not be reached for comment .

In the small English town of Ashbourne during 2 days a year the people divide to play a sport with the purpose of scoring the “ toughest goal ” .
Sure kicking a ball into the net takes some skill , but even these people would say scoring in a sport such as rugby is only for the weak .
Imagine thousands of people , divided by a river , with 2 days to get a ball across town with one simple rule : no murder .
That is only the beginning in Royal Shrovetide Football .
The Time :
The game of Royal Shrovetide is played annually on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday in Ashbourne , which is located in Derbyshire , England .
The pitch begins at 2:00 pm and lasts until 10:00 pm .
If a ball is goaled before 5:00 , then a new ball is released in the town centre and play continues .
Otherwise , play is over for the day .
The Teams :
Through the middle of Ashbourne runs a river called the Hanmore Brook .
People born north of the river are on the Up ’ Ards and people from the south are called Down ’ Ards .
On opposite ends of the town are two goal posts that are located 3 miles apart .
The Up’Ards attempt to score at Sturston Mill , and the Down ’ Ards at the Clifton Mill , each located in a river .
In order to score , the team must move the ball from the town centre , to their mill , and then bang the ball on the wall 3 consecutive times .
The Game :
There is no limit to the number of players the Up or Down ’ Ard teams can possess .
The teams ( composed of thousands of people ) are encouraged to stay within the confinements of Ashbourne .
As a precaution all stores and shops board up their windows and all cars are parked miles away .
The crowd gathers at a specially designed plinth in the middle of Town Square to begin the game .
Prior to the beginning , they sing Auld Lang Syne followed by God Save the Queen .
Shortly after , town ( or in some cases actual royalty ) figures throw the custom painted ball into the crowd .
From there , the chaos begins .
The “ Rules ” :
The only real official rule to the game is no murder or manslaughter .
But a good way to find you in a sticky situation during the game is to :
1 ) Carry the ball by motorized vehicle .
2 ) Hide the ball under your coat or in a bag .
3 ) Run into a cemetery , churchyard , or memorial .
Also , unnecessary roughness is heavily frowned upon , although a common occurrence during the 2 day game .
The Roll of Honor :
The roll of honor is an official document , which keeps history of each scorer and the turner - up ( the person who threw the ball ) during each of the game .
If you are a visitor wishing to score on either of the two teams , you are out of luck .
Each part of town usually predetermines who will score the goals and thus keep the ball .
It is usually respected members or families of the town , for they frown upon visitors getting their names placed in the Roll of Honor .
Here are a few videos of this great brute of a sport unfolding :

And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and
Our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our woman
Why we rape our woman
Do we hate our woman ?

As if you needed any more proof .
But here it is anyway , two more stories demonstrating once more ( and once and for all ) the joy of tradition , the jubilation of superstition and , most of all , the glory - and glorious compassion - of organized religion .
Oh , and not to forget the awesome ability of men to take their beloved misogyny and sexism and make it an integral part of just about every major religion worldwide .
Seriously , what 's up with that anyway ?
Nauseating Nepalese Nonsense
In the first case we have the " confined women " of Nepal .
That is , menstruating woman and ( I believe uniquely to Nepal ) women who have just given birth .
These " dirty " women and girls are forced to sleep in cow sheds , tool sheds , wood sheds .
They can lay their heads in any old shed they want , but : " Just stay out of the house goddamn it - do n't you get it , you 're filthy ? ! "
You see , God says that these women are simply too unclean during their time of the month and , especially , after that whole nasty , dirty business of giving birth , so they ( and their newborn child ) need to stay in the shed and away from all the clean people ( i.e. men ) .
It almost sounds like a Monty Python skit , does n't it ?
And it'd be pretty hilarious too ... if only it was n't actually going on right now .
In fact , this past summer a 15 - year - old girl died ( from diarrhea ) while stuck out in one of these sheds - no one would go near her to take her to get medical help .
They just let her die , not wanting to piss off God .
What we 're talking about here is the traditional Hindu chhaupadi system , still followed in much of the Nepalese countryside .
It 's been that way for centuries , so it must be good , right ?
You know , the wisdom of the established order and all that .
Interestingly , there 's no time when God wants men to be shunned into the shed .
But , hey , God works in mysterious ways , right ?
The Trinity of Asininity
Now that story 's way off in " backwards Nepal " , I hear some of you saying .
" Nothing that uncivilized would ever happen in the modern world " .
Well , how about this ?
In Brazil a young 9 - year - old child who was repeatedly raped by her step - father from the age of six onwards recently became impregnated with twins .
What was the official Catholic Church line on this ?
Well , it was really quite simple : " Let her die " .
Literally .
You see , the doctors say her uterus simply is n't big enough to carry one baby , let alone two .
She would most likely die if the fetuses were not aborted .
And this does n't even involve the mental torture of forcing a child to give birth at age nine .
But the local archbishop was having none of it .
He not only opposed the abortion , even in this life - saving case , he actually excommunicated the girl 's mother and the doctors involved for going through with the operation .
Yes , excommunication for the girl 's mother and her doctors ... but not for the rapist .
Rape , it seems , is not really a serious enough crime ... though , clearly , an operation to save the life of the victim is .
This is almost as compassionate as the fundamentalist Muslims and their so - called " honor killing " response to the very same situation , though they 'd , of course , actually get it over with much more quickly and deliberately .
Either way , from the mindless doctrinaire hard - line religious point of view , it 's clear :
The kid 's gotta die .
Doctrine over common sense .
Canon over compassion .
Ideology over humanity .
That 's right , it 's the Trinity of Asininity .
Seriously , can you imagine any of this ridiculous nonsense if it were men , rather than women , who menstruated and / or got pregnant ( through rape or otherwise ) ?
I think not .
Let It Go Already
These are , of course , only two cases out of thousands , but I 'm not going to focus on any others here right now , as I think they 're all well enough known already .
No , I 'm not going to delve into the whole nonsense surrounding the worship of the Blessed Virgin and its implicit message to all non-virgin females out there that they 're simply not pure enough in the eyes of God .
Nor am I going to get into the barbaric imprisoning of women for being raped in places like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan .
Nor do I want to linger on the glorious tradition of female genital mutilation ; nor the burning of witches in Africa ( today ) and in the West ( in days gone by ) ; nor the discarding and lifelong banishment of widows in Hindu India ( though , of course , it is better than burning them alive on their husband 's burial pyre as in the recent past ) .
No , I 'm not even going to get into the whole issue of the Catholic Church telling Catholics in AIDS - ravaged sub -Saharan Africa , including women who know their husbands have been sleeping around , that they can , under no circumstances , ever use a condom .
I mean , come on people , is n't it finally time we left all this woman - hating , pathetically patriarchical , small - minded , superstitious , nonsensical gibberish behind and just let everyone relax and enjoy their lives ?
And , if not , could we at least agree to let the 9 - year - old rape victims live and the " filthy " menstruating women and new moms come back into the house and out of the cow sheds ?
Seriously now , almost everyone treats their pets better than most religions have historically treated women .
It 's time to recognize the inherent misogyny in all these archaic millennia - old belief systems and stop rationalizing all this Bronze Age - era nonsense .
It 's not relevant to the modern world and has n't been for centuries .
It 's time to move on already .

Interestingly , programming languages vary in how much precision they allow in printed floating - point fractions .
You would think they ’d all be the same , allowing you to print as many decimal places as you ask for .
After all , a floating - point fraction is a dyadic fraction ; it has as many decimal places as it has bits in its fractional representation .
Consider the dyadic fraction 5,404,319,552,844,595/253 .
Its decimal expansion is 0.59999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359375 , and its binary expansion is 0.10011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011 .
Both are 53 digits long .
The ideal programming language lets you print all 53 decimal places , because all are meaningful .
Unfortunately , many languages wo n’t let you do that ; they typically cap the number of decimal places at between 15 and 17 , which for our example might be 0.59999999999999998 .
I can guess why this is so .
We view printed values as decimal numbers , not binary approximations .
0.59999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359375 looks like 0.6 , and in fact is what ’s stored in a double - precision floating - point variable that is assigned the value 0.6 ( it ’s the closest double - precision approximation of 0.6 ) .
If you print this variable , you can live with it being 0.59 , or a finite version thereof .
But all those digits after the last 9 look like garbage , and in fact they are with respect to 0.6 .
Now change your perspective .
Assume you care about binary approximations .
You might want to see which dyadic fraction a decimal fraction rounds to .
You might want to print a variable that has been assigned a dyadic fraction explicitly .
You might want to know the value of a small negative power of two .
In these cases , you ’ll want to see the entire decimal expansion , “ garbage ” and all .
Let ’s see how good various programming languages are at giving you this precision .
Summary of Results
I tested the printing precision of eight different languages , some on both Windows and Linux , for a total of twelve environments .
I determined the maximum precision each language allows when printing a double - precision floating - point value ( AKA double ) .
I picked two cases for each , the smallest and largest ( positive ) dyadic fractions that could be printed in their entirety .
The smallest fraction is a negative power of two .
The smallest negative power of two that fits in a double is 2 -1074 .
In decimal , it is 323 0s followed by 751 other digits .
In binary , it is 1073 0s followed by a 1 ( of course all those digits do n’t fit in a double — they are implied by the exponent ) .
The largest fraction is of the form ( 2n – 1 ) / 2n , or 1 – 2 - n .
For a double , the largest value possible is 1 – 2 - 53 .
In decimal , it is 15 9s followed by 38 other digits .
In binary , it is 53 1s .
Here ’s a summary of what I found ( striked out text reflects updated versions — see below for details ) :
Longest Dyadic Fractions Printed in Full Precision Language OS Smallest Fraction Largest Fraction GCC ( C ) Linux 2-1074 1 – 2-53 Visual C++ Windows 2 - 24 1 – 2-17 Java Windows 2 - 24 1 – 2-16 Visual Basic Windows 2-21 1 – 2-15 PHP
Windows 2-40 2-53 1 – 2-40 1 – 2-53 JavaScript ( Firefox ) Windows 2-100 1 – 2-53 JavaScript ( IE ) Windows 2-20 1 – 2-16 VBScript ( IE ) Windows 2 - 21 1 – 2-15 ActivePerl Windows 2 - 24 1 – 2-17 Python Windows 2-24 2-1074 1 – 2-17 1 – 2-53 Perl Linux 2-1074 1 – 2-53 Python Linux 2-117 1 – 2-53
The GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) , and specifically its C compiler , is what I ’ll call the gold standard .
It prints all dyadic fractions to full precision .
Perl on Linux , which presumably is built using GCC and glibc , does the same .
JavaScript in Firefox is curious .
It prints the largest double fraction , 1 – 2 - 53 , but only prints powers of two up to 2-100 .
It seems like an arbitrary maximum , perhaps due to a buffer size limit .
PHP is similar .
It picks an arbitrary maximum of 40 53 decimal places , regardless of the fraction .
Python on Linux also has an interesting limit — it prints powers of two up to 2 - 117 .
What follows are the details of how I determined the values in the table .
For each value , I show two pieces of code : one that prints the longest fraction , and one that fails to print the next longer fraction .
In other words , I determine the maximum by going beyond it .
1. GCC C ( Linux )

This code prints all 1,074 decimal places of 2-1074 :

This code does not print 2-1075 .

Should They All Be Like GCC ?
Should all languages allow printing to maximum precision like GCC ?
I do n’t see why not .
Granted , there ’s probably not much floating - point being done in scripting languages , but why not support it if it ’s easy to implement ?
One unknown is compatibility .
Are there programs that depend on the current imprecise output ?
I tested the waters by submitting bug reports for Visual C++ and PHP .
Microsoft took over ten months to consider my request but they acknowledged the problem and said they would change it in a future release ( it seems to apply to all of Visual Studio by the way ) .
On the other hand , PHP took only three hours to reject my request without a good explanation ( Update : Rasmus reopened the bug . )
I do n’t plan on submitting more bug reports at the moment , but if you decide to , let us know so we can track it .
Other Languages and Environments
There are lots of things I did n’t try , like Fortran , Java on Linux , JavaScript in Opera , Safari , and Chrome , etc .
If you are so inclined , please experiment and let us know what you find .
I do a lot of copyediting , both of books and advertising collateral .
I ’ll let you in on a secret that still surprises me , although I ’ve seen it hundreds of times now .
If you looked at the raw work of most professional writers , you ’d be pretty underwhelmed .
Professional writers get work because they hit their deadlines , they stay on message , and they do n’t throw too many tantrums .
Some pros have a great writing voice or a superb style , but as often as not , that gets in the way .
When you know that the best word is “ prescient , ” it ’s hard to swallow when an account manager tells you the client wo n’t know what it means .
Professional writers rely on editors to fix their clunks .
Like good gardeners , sensitive editors do n’t hack away — we prune and gently shape .
When we ’ve done a great job , the page looks just like it did before , only better .
It ’s the page the writer intended to write .
Editing , like writing , takes time to learn .
But here are five fixes I make with nearly every project .
Learn to make them yourself and you ’ll take your writing to a more professional , marketable , and persuasive level .
1. Sentences can only do one thing at a time .
Have you ever heard a four - year - old run out of breath before she can finish her thought ?
I edit a lot of sentences that work the same way .
You need a noun , you need a verb , you might need an object .
Give some serious thought to stopping right there .
Sentences are building blocks , not bungee cords ; they ’re not meant to be stretched to the limit .
I ’m not saying you necessarily want a Hemingway - esque series of clipped short sentences , but most writers benefit from dividing their longest sentences into shorter , more muscular ones .
2. Paragraphs can only do one thing at a time .
A paragraph supports a single idea .
Construct complex arguments by combining simple ideas that follow logically .
Every time you address a new idea , add a line break .
Short paragraphs are the most readable ; few should be more than three or four sentences long .
This is more important if you ’re writing for the Web .
3 . Look closely at - ing
Nouns ending in - ing are fine .
( Strong writing , IT consulting , great fishing . )
But constructions like “ I am running , ” “ a forum for building consensus , ” or “ The new team will be managing ” are inherently weak .
Rewrite them to “ I run , ” “ a forum to build consensus , ” and “ the team will manage . ”
You ’re on the right track when the rewrite has fewer words ( see below ) .
( If for some insane reason you want to get all geeky about this , you can read the Wikipedia article on gerunds and present participles .
But you do n’t have to know the underlying grammatical rules to make this work .
Rewrite - ing when you can , and your writing will grow muscles you did n’t know it had . )
4. Omit unnecessary words .
I know we all heard this in high school , but we were n’t listening .
( Mostly because it ’s hard . )
It ’s doubly hard when you ’re editing your own writing — we put all that work into getting words onto the page , and by god we need a damned good reason to get rid of them .
Here ’s your damned good reason : extra words drain life from your work .
The fewer words used to express an idea , the more punch it has .
Therefore :
Summer months
Regional level
The entire country
On a daily basis ( usually best rewritten to “ every day ” )
She knew that it was good .
Very
( I just caught one above : four - year - old little girl )
You can nearly always improve sentences by rewriting them in fewer words .
5. Reframe 90 % of the passive voice .
French speakers consider an elegantly managed passive voice to be the height of refinement .
But here in the good old U.S. ( or Australia , Great Britain , etc. ) , we value action .
We do things is inherently more interesting than Things are done by us .
Passive voice muddies your writing ; when the actor is hidden , the action makes less sense .
Bonus :
Use spell - check
There ’s no excuse for teh in anything more formal than a Twitter tweet .
Also , “ a lot ” and “ all right ” are always spelled as two words .
You can trust me , I ’m an editor .
Easy reading is damned hard writing .

Erin Burnett hides behind a viewer email to question whether or not the United States should be extending unemployment benefits for workers who have lost their jobs since so many people are " asking about it " .
I guess in Burnett 's world , our country would be better off if we were more like China .
I 'd like to know if Burnett has ever questioned whether these overpaid Wall Street a - holes she sucks up to every day deserve the golden parachutes they 're walking away with - after destroying our economy .
How about that for a random thought to come out of that head of yours ?
And of course Scar can't help himself , trying to one - up her for the day 's biggest " compassionate conservative " - he even manages to get a shot in at single mothers before the segment is over .
These people have no souls .

Trivia
Actor William H. Macy at the time this film was made and first released had collaborated with writer - director Mamet for about some thirty - five years .
Macy said : " Dave is a great storyteller and he tells big and brave stories .
His writing is shockingly blunt and to the point , yet it contains poetry , it is poetry , it has meter . "
As an example , he cites the Mamet play ' American Buffalo ' ( 1975 ) , in which Macy originated the role of Bobby .
" Any time I run into an actor who has played that role we start running the lines together .
It 's like singing a song , you just start humming the words . "

With multi-core processors sitting idle most of the time and workloads always increasing , it 's important to have easy ways to make the CPUs earn their money 's worth .
My colleague Georgios Gousios told me today how the Unix xargs command can help in this regard .
The GNU xargs command that comes with Linux and the one distributed with FreeBSD support a - P option through which one can specify the number of jobs to run in parallel .
Using this flag ( perhaps in conjunction with -n to limit the number of arguments passed to the executing program ) , makes it easy to fire commands in parallel in a controlled fashion .
Georgios sent me an example , where he sped up a job by almost seven times through this technique .
$ ls -l *.eps|wc 192 1537 17651 $ time find .
- type f|xargs - Istr epstopdf str real 0m54.395s user 0m42.539s sys 0m12.645s $ time find .
- type f|xargs -n 8 -P 8 - Istr epstopdf str real 0m8.189s user 0m43.363s sys 0m13.273s
The xargs - P flag can also be useful for parellelizing commands that depend on a large number of high - latency systems .
Only a week ago I spent hours to write a script that would resolve IP addresses into host names in parallel .
( Yes , I know the logresolve.pl that comes with the Apache web server distribution , and the speedup it provides leaves a lot to be desired . )
Had I known the - P xargs option , I would have finished my task in minutes .

As the folks at Apartment Therapy noted , it appears as though this savvy apartment dweller has stretched two cables between eye hooks on the ceiling and floor , then strategically affixed an L bracket to the cable at the desired bike - hanging heights .
Update :
As a couple of astute readers point out , it looks like it's one cable looped through each hook and tightened .
Even better :
The parts necessary to pull off this attractive bike rack are probably cheaper than the previously covered DIY IKEA bike rack .

Spring is in the air and that can only mean one thing - a new uber 3D chip from AMD 's graphics subsidiary , the ATI Radeon HD 4890 .
Well , that or widespread rioting in old London town courtesy of our mate Barry from across the pond .
The Radeon HD 4890 was officially announced this morning – although its imminent arrival has been expected for a few weeks .
It 's AMD 's fastest single - GPU graphics card , but is more of a mild overhaul of an existing GPU than an all new architecture .
The chip itself is new , but functionally it 's identical to the existing Radeon HD 4870 .
Of course , with no less than 800 shaders and 40 texture units , that 's no bad thing .
It also sports the same 1GB frame buffer and 256 - bit bus as the top version of the 4870 .
Indeed , physically it's also very much a case of move along , nothing to see here .
However , the exciting news is that we managed to overclock the chip 's core operating frequency from 850MHz to 965MHz .
It 's still slightly behind the raw graphics grunt of the Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 then , but at around the £ 200 mark , the 4890 offers astounding value for money .
We 've been testing the ATI Radeon HD 4890 for the last few days .

The Obama administration , having retained the basic elements of Bush ’s disastrous n ational security policies , and having applied a similar political approach to the economy , has set the stage for the collapse of the U.S .
The number of laws that tangle us all continues to multiply .
At this point it is probably impossible for us to survive , let alone prosper , without breaking one or more laws on a weekly basis .
People seem to be helpless in the face of these out of control laws .
Some people wonder how far people can be pushed before violent revolution takes place .
There will be no violent revolt .
People have too much to lose , and we are not a violent people .
Nor should there be – we can look to the fall of the communist states of the old Warsaw Pact , where the state collapsed and freedom spread with hardly a shot being fired .
Violent revolution , such as that which led to Caucescu and his wife being gunned down by a firing squad , were the exception rather than the rule .
How did these states collapse ?
Simply put , the people stopped respecting the state , and began to ignore its edicts .
They ignored the laws forbidding certain economic activity .
They ignored the laws demanding the payment of taxes .
They ignored the laws demanding people acquire licenses to take up certain professions .
They ignored the laws mandating that young men report for mandatory military service .
Our salvation lies through systematic disobedience to the state .
In a way , Obama is doing us – those who love freedom – a favor .
His policies will push the people to the ragged edge .
Many people will come to hate and distrust the state .
Like bitter soviet citizens , they become cynical , and develop a visceral understanding of public choice theory .
And when a sufficient number of people recognize that the problem is not a conflict between Democrat and Republican but between the government and the market , between the alliance of politicians and rent - seeking big businessmen and the people , then the true revolution will begin .
New information sheds more light on GOP IT guru 's tragic death Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Tuesday January 13 , 2009
Print This Email This New information surrounding the December plane crash which killed GOP internet consultant Michael Connell casts doubt on some of the rumors and speculation surrounding his death but does n't close the books on the circumstances surrounding the Republican technology star 's tragic end .
Michael Connell , a high - level IT guru for the Republican National Committee and the US Chamber of Commerce , died Dec. 19 , 2008 at 5:53 PM ET when his airplane crashed near Ohios Akron - Canton airport .
Although there has been speculation in the media about the possibility of sabotage in Connell death , authorities do not suspect foul play .
The official investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) has not yet determined the cause of the crash ; their final report is required to be produced within a year .
Connells ten year - old , seven - passenger , single engine Piper Saratoga II crashed into an empty house on Charolais Street in Lake Township , Ohio .
The planes right wing clipped a flagpole in the front yard before it broke up , set fire to the garage , and tumbled some 5060 feet along the ground toward the back yard of a neighboring home .
Connell was thrown from the burning plane and killed instantaneously by massive blunt force trauma , according to the Stark County coroner 's report .
Although the body was not burned , fingerprints were required to confirm identity , according to Captain Lorin Geisner of the Greentown Fire Department .
According to Geisner , Connells personal items recovered from the crash site included a passport , a driver 's license , a rosary and a laptop computer .
The coroner 's office confirmed that these were among a longer list of personal effects collected by the authorities .
The Greentown Fire Department was alerted at 5:54 PM , just one minute after the crash , following 911 calls by area witnesses to central dispatch .
At 5:58 , according to Geisner , fire department units arrived on scene and suppressed both the garage and plane fires within several minutes .
Connells case has drawn particular attention because he had recently testified in a case alleging that Ohios votes were tampered with during the 2004 presidential election .
However , Connell  who was compelled to testify  denied the allegations in his Nov. 3 , 2008 deposition .
Connell is also alleged to have been involved with the scrubbing of emails from White House staff which had been sent through an alternate system hosted on Republican National Committee servers .
Information " Lockdown "  Details Withheld from Fire Department Capt .
Geisner expressed considerable frustration during several Raw Story interviews over what he alleges was the withholding of critical details by authorities .
" While en route to the fire , I asked dispatch to learn the size of the plane and the number of souls on board , " Geisner explained .
 This was not provided us . "
Such details allow fire department officials to determine whether additional equipment is needed and if a wider search and rescue is required .
Within fifteen minutes of the crash , after officials from Akron - Canton Airport had arrived on the scene , Geisner again sought to confirm the number of passengers .
" After calls were made I was told that the ATC [ Air Traffic Control ] was ' all in lockdown , ' and that they said ' we can't release that information , ' " Geisner said .
Todd Laps , Fire Chief of the Akron - Canton airport fire department and a liaison to the Transportation Security Administration and the Air Traffic Control , echoed Geisners account .
" I had some phone calls placed to see if I could get that number [ of people on board ] .
It did n't come in a timely enough fashion , " Laps said .
But Laps says that the words lock down were not used .
When asked to clarify his earlier comments , Gaisner insisted that the words lock down had been used in reference to information .
" That info was not available , " Gaisner said .
 It was secured -- not given out -- locked down . "
The North Canton Post of the State Highway Patrol received a call from the 911 call center at 6:04 PM EST .
According to the incident report prepared by the state highway patrol and examined by Raw Story on site , Sgt. Leo Shirkey was the first law enforcement officer on the scene at 6:22 .
Off duty Post Commander Lt. Eric Sheppard and Trooper McCarthy , a plain - clothed investigator from the Canton Post , arrived within an hour .
The incident report lists the Stark County Examiner Harry Campbell as arriving at 7:03 PM to collect the body .
Not mentioned in the report is the role of two members of the local Civil Air Patrol squadron .
According to Lt. Sheppard and Captain Geisner , the Air Patrol was tasked to help locate and turn off the Emergency Locating Transmitter ( ELT ) , which was still transmitting from the partially intact tail of the plane .
An FAA Aviation Safety Inspector arrived at the scene several hours later , and a clean up crew worked through the night to prepare the plane for transport and storage .
Connell on Re-Approach According to a preliminary report authored by NTSB investigator Mitchell Gallo , Connell drifted left of course during a radio- vectored instrument approach to an Akron - Canton runway and air traffic controllers began to direct a re-approach .
Before Connell could affect the re-approach , he declared an emergency and disappeared off radar .
The Akron - Canton Air Traffic Control declined to comment .
Gallo , however , told Raw Story that the declaration of emergency was not Connell 's final words .
He would not elaborate but said that Connell did not describe the nature of the emergency .
Neither the radar data nor tapes of the radio transmissions have been released by the authorities to the general public or the media .
The only known eyewitness to the crash spoke to the Ohio State Highway Patrol but wished to remain unnamed in press accounts .
This witness told Raw Story in December that he heard a very loud small plane engine seconds before seeing the lights of the plane emerge from the clouds heading nearly straight down .
" When the lights disappeared and the engine stopped I anticipated a crash but a couple of seconds went by before I heard the engine again , enough time for me to think , ' he 's pulled up , ' " the witness said .
Moments later he heard the crash and saw an orange glow some distance from where he'd last seen the lights of the rapidly descending plane .
On Dec. 20 , the plane wreckage was moved by Belden Village Towing to a hangar owned by Summit Aviation at Akron - Fulton International , a non-commercial airport which houses a large Lockheed Martin facility .
The State Highway Patrol said that hangar space at nearby Akron - Canton Regional Airport was not available .
Raw Story visited Summit Aviation Dec. 24 and located the wreckage , which was being held in a building without gated security or security camera surveillance .
NTSB officials had examined the wreckage the day before .
Last week , Summit Aviation said that Connell 's insurance company had arranged for the transport of the plane to another longer term facility .
Allegations Relating to two Previous Flights Since Connells tragic death , much confusion has resulted in speculation and erroneous reporting relating to two previously aborted flights .
On Dec. 21 , for example , Channel 19 , a local CBS affiliate in Cleveland , Ohio reported that an anonymous source had warned Connell not to fly and that two separate flights had been canceled
" Connell , " the reporter said , " was apparently told by a close friend not to fly his plane because his plane might be sabotaged .
...
And twice in the last two months , Connell , who is an experienced pilot , canceled two flights because of suspicious problems with his plane . "
The friend to whom this statement was attributed has not been identified .
Raw Story has not been able to independently confirm that Connell had been warned specifically not to fly .
It s also unclear if the reference to Connell canceling " two flights because of suspicious problems with his plane " was confused with one actual aborted flight and a second flight suspected to have been aborted , or if these cancellations are in addition to the those two flights .
One Aborted Flight Confirmed On Sept. 18 , 2008 , just a day before a stay was lifted in the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell case - which alleged vote tampering in Ohio during the 2004 election - Connell embarked on a flight from the Akron - Canton airport .
According to flight data obtained by Raw Story , he was heading to the College Park , MD airport , which he often used when attending meetings and functions in DC .
Connells trip lasted only 23 minutes before he turned around and returned to the Akron - Canton airport .
( See flight data below ) :
King Lincoln Bronzeville On Sept. 22 , Connell was subpoenaed to testify in the King Lincoln Bronzeville case .
During a Sept. 25 , 2008 meeting with Connells wife Heather near their home in Akron , Ohio , Ms. Connell explained to this reporter that her husband had aborted his Sept. 18 flight " due to engine trouble . "
Ms. Connell also stated that her husband " then took a commercial flight instead " to make " his DC meeting . "
She did not know with whom he was meeting in Washington .
Raw Story met with Ms. Connell several months prior to Connells death as part of another , but related investigation .
Neither Ms. Connell , nor anyone else close to her husband interviewed at that time , claimed that any tampering was involved or expressed suspicions about this flight .
However , if Connell himself was suspicious , he might not have shared those suspicions with his wife .
Connell had not , apparently , shared with his wife the news that he'd been subpoenaed in King Lincoln Bronzeville Sept. 22 .
Ms. Connell expressed shock at learning that her husband had been called to testify and expressed doubt when informed that her husband was a witness in a federal case .
" I dont believe it , " Ms. Connell told Raw Story .
" He is a good man .
He has done nothing wrong . "
The case known as King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell was initially filed against former Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell on Aug. 31 , 2006 by Columbus attorney Clifford Arnebeck on behalf of several Ohio residents .
The original filing alleged that there had been civil rights violations by Blackwell during the 2004 election , involving racially discriminatory practices such as the selective purging of voters from the election rolls and the unequal allocation of voting machines to various districts .
The filing asked for measures to be taken to prevent similar problems during the November 2006 election .
On Oct. 9 , 2006 , an amended complaint was filed that added various forms of ballot - rigging as also having the effect of " depriving the Plaintiffs of their voting rights . "
A motion to dismiss the case as moot was filed following the November 2006 election , but instead it was stayed to allow for settlement discussions .
That stay was later extended , and the case dragged on for almost two years for lack of detailed evidence .
Connells lawyers fought the subpoena and refused to furnish the plaintiffs with IT network schematics relating to the 2004 and 2006 elections .
His attorneys asserted that the request for documents was burdensome because the information sought should be " readily ascertainable through public records request " - but also , paradoxically , because " it seeks confidential , trade secrets , and / or proprietary information " that " have independent economic value " and " are not known to the public , or even to non-designated personnel within or working for Mr. Connell 's business . "
In calling for the judge to compel Connell to testify , plaintiffs cited recent security breaches in the computer system at the office of Ohio's Secretary of State , which were preceded by a barrage of threatening phone and email messages and death threats and which led to the state website temporarily being taken down Oct. 20 .
The plaintiffs used these events to suggest the possibility of Trojan horses or back doors in the system , which Connell had designed .
In addition , the plaintiffs  attorneys provided information of alleged threats against Connell .
These alleged threats and the alleged threats against the Ohio Secretary of State , resulted in the court issuing another subpoena compelling Connells testimony .
The second subpoena was served Oct. 8 at the College Park Airport office when Connell flew in for the day for a meeting in DC .
On Nov. 3 , 2008 , Connell was finally deposed in the case .
It is uncertain what , if anything , Connell was prepared to confirm relating to alleged threats against him .
Sources close to the case said that even if Connell had denied being threatened under oath , he would have had good reason to do so .
That part of the testimony is still sealed .
Connells attorneys have not commented and forwarded all inquires to Ms. Connell .
Second Possible Aborted Flight  Unconfirmed On November 21 , roughly three weeks after Connells court testimony , a second flight appears to have been aborted .
Unlike the Sept. 18 flight , there is no confirmation .
The flight lasted 10 minutes before Connell turned his plane around .
As with the earlier aborted flight , Connell returned to the Akron - Canton Regional airport after a short time in the air .
There has been no confirmation that this second flight was interrupted due to any suspicions on Connells part or any issues around the plane itself .
If this second flight was aborted , it may have been due to the alleged previous engine troubles that Mrs. Connell mentioned .
On the other hand , a close friend of Connells who wished to remain unnamed explained that Connell could have simply taken someone for a ride that day or had a meeting , which was not uncommon .
It 's this flight , however , that caused talk among Connells friends and family after his death , because no explanation has been provided as to if and why the flight was aborted .
Radar data shows almost a perfect circle , which bolsters the theory that Connell was taking someone for a ride .
The Nov. 21 flight was the last flight Connell made prior to his Dec. 19 crash .

Now walk across the room .
Suddenly , he morphs into Marilyn Monroe .
Trippy , right ?
Aude Oliva , an associate professor of cognitive science at MIT , uses images like this one to study how our brains make sense of sight .
Our eyes pick up resolutions with both high spatial frequencies ( sharp lines ) and low ones ( blurred shapes ) .
By blending the high frequencies from one picture with the lows from another , Oliva creates images that change as a function of distance and time — allowing her to parse how humans absorb visual information .
Turns out that we perceive coarse features quickly , within the first 30 milliseconds , and then home in on details at around 100 milliseconds .
We also focus on the higher frequencies close up and register softer shapes from afar .
" It 's something we never think about , " Oliva says .
" But we still do n't know how our brains digest new images so seamlessly and so rapidly . "
The answer could help treat cognitive disorders or assist in the development of more - perceptive bots .
Because , let 's be honest :
What good is a robot if it can't tell the difference between a sexy , troubled icon and Marilyn Monroe ?

Remember how in the original UK cut of The Descent no one made it out of the cave and it was bleak and unsettling but in the American cut , one girl made it out and they ended on a lame jump scare ?
Well , if you ’re going to be paying any mind to the sequel , The Descent 2 , then it looks like that American ending was the way of it and it ’s being used for a jumping - off point for a film that looks … well … rather dumb .
Much of the earlier segments of the trailer deal with the police investigation for the girls and then , all of a sudden , one of them shows up , looking like hell and understandably traumatized .

Ashcroft : Some forms of waterboarding might be legal David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

Is it any surprised that a man who spends free time making sculptures out of barbed wire still does not believe his approval of torturing prisoners was wrong ?
" I think history will be very kind to the President , " said former Attorney General John Ashcroft , speaking recently at the University of Texas at Austin .
" I do n't have a mark on my conscience . "
Speaking with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean on Thursday night , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann tried to make sense of Ashcroft 's justification for signing off on waterboarding .
" There are things that you can call waterboarding that I am thoroughly convinced are not torture , " said Ashcroft in a video shot by an attendee at the UT lecture .
" There are things that you can call waterboarding that might be torture .
And the point that ought to be understood is that throwing a term around recklessly for its emotional content does n't really get you anywhere . "
" Are there multiple forms of waterboarding that I do n't know about ?
One that 's legal and one that 's illegal ? " asked an incredulous Olbermann .
" Maybe this is a defense that John Yoo came up with , the memo has n't been released yet , that says how much water you pour may make it waterboarding or not waterboarding , " said Dean .
" But , this is pretty silly , actually . "
Olbermann wondered aloud whether Ashcroft had joined the Bush legacy tour and if this appearance was an attempt to soften the blow from allegedly pending memo dumps by the Obama Justice Department .
The first series of Bush - era memos to be released by the Obama administration pertained to legal justifications of torture that were rescinded in the final days of Bush 's second term .
" These memos provide the very definition of tyranny , " Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told Olbermann on March 5 .
" These memos include everything that a petty despot would want . "
" General Ashcroft was read into these activities and did approve these activities ... from the beginning , I believe , from the very beginning , " Ashcroft 's predecessor , Alberto Gonzales , told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July , 2007 .
" ... Must be great to go through life without a conscience or without embarrassment , " concluded Olbermann .

Thirty billion tons of carbon dioxide waft into the air from the burning of fossil fuels each year .
About half stays in the air .
The other half disappears .
Where it all goes , nobody quite knows .
With the Orbiting Carbon Observatory , a NASA satellite scheduled to be launched on Tuesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , scientists hope to understand better the comings and goings of carbon dioxide , the main heat - trapping gas behind the warming of the planet .
The new data could help improve climate models and the understanding of the “ carbon sinks , ” like oceans and forests , that absorb much of the carbon dioxide .
Annual variations  in some years , all of the excess carbon dioxide disappears ; in some years , all of it stays in the air  indicate that some of the sinks may fill up and spill some of the absorbed carbon dioxide back into the air .

Sarah Palin may have to start a legal fund to pay for her attorney ’s fees that came from the Troopergate scandal .
Palin blamed the media and Barack Obama for causing her to run up a half a million dollar legal bill while defending herself against 10 ethics charges in Alaska .
The Anchorage Daily News reported that the scandal will cost Palin big money , but she is blaming everyone but herself , “ Shortly after CNN reported that the Obama campaign had spoken with the Alaska State Troopers ’
Union concerning the reassignment of Walt Monegan , I recognized that this was no longer a fair and impartial discussion , but rather a political ploy during a vice presidential campaign .
I felt it would not be fair to Alaskans to sacrifice public monies to defend against something that was so politically charged .
Was I surprised ?
Did anyone know the extent to which the opposition would take this matter ?
It is shocking to realize that the personal burden is so great . ”
Palin also used the phrase politically motivated to describe Troopergate 4 times .
The problem with Palin ’s explanation is that her ethics problems started before she added to the McCain ticket .
If she did n’t want to run up a half of a million dollars in legal debt , then perhaps her and her husband should not have tried to get her former brother in law fired then misused her office to punish Walt Monegan .
The easiest way for Palin to avoid the legal bill would have been for her not to get in trouble in the first place .

Palin said that she can’t afford the legal bills , “ Obviously we cannot afford to personally pay these bills — and really no future governor should feel the sense of financial vulnerability at the hands of those with a political vendetta bent on personal destruction .
Some have suggested a legal fund to pay these bills .
We ’ll have to pursue that . ”
Of course , her supporters will pay her legal bills .
Palin is still the darling of many Republicans and has no problem with drawing a crowd and raising money .
If she is going to blame the Obama campaign , then she also has to blame the McCain campaign too , because if McCain would not have added her to the ticket , a small state scandal would have never become a national story .
This is all typical Sarah Palin , because someone or something else is always to blame .
She blamed her poor performance on the campaign trail on the idea that she was mishandled and misadvised by the McCain campaign .
She blamed her terrible television interviews on the media .
She does not take responsibility for anything .

A rare chance to buy a Frank Lloyd Wright house 1 / 12 Back to Gallery
The southern edge of Los Banos ( Merced County ) , where only dusty roads and distant silos interrupt the endless landscape of tilled Central Valley soil , seems an unlikely place to happen upon the work of America 's architectural icon .
But past the cattle feedlot and leaning hay barn , deep in a field where winter wheat and cantaloupe mark the seasons , sits a ranch house designed by an aging Frank Lloyd Wright .
It is the third - to - last California residence drawn by the master of suburban homes , and one of only two currently on the market .
Obscured from the road by a cluster of walnut trees , the cinderblock structure forms an angular , shallow U .
The living room at the base looks onto the garden through a wall of windows and French doors .
Twin wings swing open to 120 degrees , a row of bedrooms radiating outward on the north side , the kitchen and play room on the south , before giving way to a palm - shaded swimming pool .
The original owners , Randall " Buck " and Harriet Fawcett , met Wright while taking an architecture course at Stanford University , according to a memoir of the home by Henry Whiting II , an architectural writer and husband of the couple 's daughter Lynn .
Buck Fawcett was a star college football player , drafted to play for the Chicago Bears in 1946 .
Instead , he returned to work the Los Banos farm that his father had homesteaded , after the patriarch became seriously ill with valley fever .
Less than a decade later , the couple , by then in their early 30s , sought out the world - famous architect to design their family home .
The Fawcetts met with Wright in 1954 at Taliesin West , his Scottsdale , Ariz. , studio , taking along pictures of the proposed site , Whiting wrote .
Thumbing through them , Wright commented : " Not much beauty there . "
Fawcett responded : " Actually , Mr. Wright , the Central Valley of California contains the most fertile agricultural land in the world , and you should consider it an honor to build a house there ! "
It 's impossible to know whether the architect , then 87 and still at the height of his fame , was miffed by the young man 's cheekiness or impressed by his gumption .
What is clear is that the designs , completed in 1955 , honor the landscape that Fawcett had so passionately defended .
Wright was known to tell clients selecting home sites to go as far away from cities as they could - and then go 10 miles farther .
That advice stands at sharp odds with modern planning , which stresses the environmental benefits of dense urban design .
But in the Fawcett house , one of the few still as remote as it was the day Wright glimpsed the setting , one can understand what he had in mind , at least from an aesthetic point of view .
The elongated structure and the lines of the low - pitched roof , banded with a copper fascia , echo the flatness of the fields around it .
The wings stretch out like open arms to the Coast Range in the distance .
Where the sections of typical homes feel squared off and self contained , the obtuse angles , walls of windows , loggia and terrace open up the space , blurring the boundaries between interior and exterior .
" He softened the whole effect of the place on that barren center of a valley by using the 120 - degree angles , " said William Storrer , author of " The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion . "
" It just seemed to be right for the space . "
The centerpiece of the family room is a 6 - foot - high , 12 - foot - wide fireplace , a veritable cave where Randall Fawcett would tend massive walnut logs that burned for days .
Built - in mahogany cabinetry and furniture accent corners and spaces throughout the home .
The concrete floor slab is scribed with perfect equilateral triangles , whose angles reappear in fixtures throughout , including cut - out wood screens , lighting fixtures and the patterned fascia .
They 're similar enough to provide a sense of continuity and theme , but sufficiently varied to provide pleasant surprises from one room to the next .
" Every aspect of the design of the house fits within the architectural language that Frank Lloyd Wright set up , " Whiting said .
Storrer and other observers say the building , while not among Wright 's best known , is an articulate expression of his design philosophy at the latter stage of his career .
He was attempting to create a uniquely North American architectural lexicon , free from classical and European influences , that also eliminated unnecessary elements to ensure homes were within reach of the middle ( or at least upper - middle ) class .
" It 's kind of the ultimate statement of his innovative idea of creating what he called a purely American - style architecture , " said Ron Scherubel , executive director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy in Chicago .
" This one is all angles and glass and concrete blocks .
At the time , it was clearly an expression of ultra-modern design . "
Construction was completed in 1961 , two years after Wright 's death .
Buck Fawcett , the young man who sought out Wright a half century ago and routinely proclaimed his home the architect 's best , died in 2006 , more than a decade after Harriet .
The couple 's two daughters , who live in other parts of the country , decided to sell the house and to find a buyer who could care for it properly .
Lynn Fawcett
Whiting and her husband already own and reside in a Frank Lloyd Wright artist studio near the banks of the Snake River in Idaho , and are only too aware of the special requirements involved .
The Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy generally prefers that the architect 's homes end up in private hands , Scherubel said .
Short of a hefty endowment , institutions typically do n't have the resources to properly maintain them .
An individual who lives in the home and sought it out for its historical value , on the other hand , has all the necessary motivation to perform upkeep in a way that respects the intrinsic character .
The price tag alone - $ 2.7 million for a roughly 3,700 - square - foot home in Los Banos - is likely to eliminate anyone who is n't a full - fledged architecture buff .
" It 's not like a normal house , " Henry Whiting said .
" It requires a lot of love and maintenance .
We just want to see it get to somebody who really loves it , and I know that that 's what Mr. Fawcett wanted . "
I believe that George Monbiot , in rubbishing the concept of biochar , misrepresents my work ( Woodchips with everything .
It 's the Atkins plan of the low - carbon world , 24 March ) .
" The great green miracle works like this : we turn the planet 's surface into charcoal .
Sorry , not charcoal ...
Now we say biochar . "
I coined the word about four years ago .
It does n't mean charcoal like you burn on the barbecue , but finely divided pyrolysed ( OK , George , " cooked " if you like ) biomass prepared for soil improvement .
Monbiot says that I propose " new biomass plantations of trees and sugar covering 1.4bn hectares ...
Read says the new plantations can be created across ' land on which the occupants are not engaged in economic activity ' " .
But this degraded land is former forest that has been logged over and abandoned - not , as Monbiot says , " land occupied by subsistence farmers , pastoralists , hunters and gatherers " .
Given the chance , impoverished people often opt for a waged income .
Does Monbiot wish to keep them impoverished for ever ?
In reality there is not the shortage of land Monbiot implies but a desperate shortage of investment in the land .
His " global total " of 1.36 bn hectares of arable land does not include 2.38bn of unused potential arable land reported by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation , into which such investment , eg irrigation , might go .
Moreover , the productivity of the 1.36bn could be raised with biochar pyrolysed from currently wasted agricultural residues , thus linking carbon removal with increased food supply and incomes .
Monbiot misses the point that the need for land - use improvements comes from the threat of climatic catastrophe .
With too much carbon in the atmosphere and oceans , some of it has to be removed and put somewhere safer .
Using the gift of nature - photosynthesis which enables green plants to use the sun 's energy to absorb atmospheric carbon - is the only economic way .
One threat arises from the accumulation , summer after summer , of melt - water flowing down crevasses in Greenland 's ice sheet to the rock surface under the ice , lubricating glacial flows into the oceans .
Studies of pre-historic climate show that this happens suddenly , when the last sticking point gives way , raising sea levels by a metre or so , possibly in a decade .
Arctic temperatures have to be brought down , not just stabilised .
Emissions reductions alone , however drastic , cannot do that job .
The remedy is not " an easy way out " but needs hard work and good policy resulting in , to quote last year 's Sustainable Biofuels Consensus , " a landscape that provides food , fodder , fibre , and energy ; that offers opportunities for rural development ; that diversifies energy supply , restores ecosystems , protects biodiversity , and sequesters carbon . "
I do not want my grandchildren to be conscripted into the food , land and water wars that will break out unless an effective plan is devised and implemented .
This would not involve usurping the rights of existing occupiers of the land but , since their rights and livelihoods will be extinguished anyhow in such wars , such usurpation would , if necessary , be preferable to catastrophic climatic change .
Get your priorities sorted , George .

During yesterday 's unveiling of its accelerated roadmap for 12 - and even 16 - core processors , an AMD executive said he did not believe the licensing situation between his company and Nvidia would enable Nvidia to produce chipsets that support future AMD platforms .
Specifically , it appears Nvidia is not yet licensed to produce motherboard chipsets that support AMD 's next - generation processors , reducing the likelihood for multi-GPU SLI support for AMD's " Istanbul " and future generations .
" For 2010 moving forward , the solutions coming out from AMD will be AMD and on AMD at this time , " stated server business unit vice president Pat Patla .
" We do n't expect to see new chipsets from Nvidia or Broadcom for server implementations in 2010 .
But they will continue to support all existing platforms moving forward through 2010 . "
Anyone spreading the rumor that Nvidia is looking to invest in Via Technologies may be thinking Nvidia could use a friend -- any friend -- about now .
Its ability to produce chipsets for Intel 's Nehalem platform remains on hold , perhaps permanently now that it has countersued Intel over its rights to say it supports Nehalem in interviews to the press .
Perhaps Patla 's statement that Nvidia will " support existing platforms " can be interpreted as the closest thing to an olive branch it 's going to get , especially from the CPU maker that now owns its principal competitor .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The Washington Post will stop publishing a business section six days out of the week and move business news to the front section of the paper at a time when finance stories dominate world headlines .
The decision , which the Post ’s editors explained in a memo obtained by Reuters , means that the paper will save money on newsprint when newspaper advertising revenue is plunging .
The cost - cutting would allow the paper to keep providing readers with what they say they want , according to the memo signed by Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli and other editors .
“ We remain absolutely committed to the strongest , in - depth and authoritative coverage of business locally , economics and economic - policy nationally , and the hugely important intersection of government , politics and money , ” the memo said .
Brauchli , former top editor of The Wall Street Journal , the preeminent U.S. business newspaper , said in a press release that the move “ reflects the centrality of economic news , as well as the increasing overlap of political and economic events , in today ’s world . ”
Brauchli did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment , but Post media reporter Howard Kurtz wrote in a story on washingtonpost.com that Brauchli did not dispute the fact that the loss of a stand - alone section would mean less prominence for many business stories .
The Post did not say if the changes would result in layoffs , and a company spokeswoman did not return a telephone call seeking comment .
The decision to cut the section comes as the financial crisis puts an ever brighter spotlight on how the federal government , traditionally The Washington Post ’s strongest turf , has managed and in some cases failed to regulate business conditions that led to the financial crisis .
The Post will stop running full listings of daily stock - price movements on Tuesdays through Saturdays .
Instead , it will offer a half - page package of statistics and graphics showing how major national and local stocks fared .
The paper will run an enhanced Sunday Business section that will include new financial tables and graphics along with more personal finance stories aimed at helping people and small businesses survive the downturn .
In the Style section , the Post will move some comics online .
It also will end one of its crossword puzzles and its weekly chess and poker columns .
Many U.S. papers have cut their stock listings and business sections to save money as ad revenue falls and they buy out or lay off staff to reduce expenses .
The Post has cut other sections since Brauchli joined the paper last year , including the Sunday Source section and Book World .
it also has combined its Sunday Arts and Styles sections .
Washington

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday would not rule out impeachment hearings against federal Judge Jay Bybee over accusations he misled Congress about his role in shaping Bush administration policy that condoned harsh interrogation techniques that critics say amounted to torture .
Mrs. Pelosi , California Democrat , said lawmakers must determine whether Mr. Bybee lied during his 2003 confirmation hearings , which won him a lifetime appointment to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
“ I would not call for his impeachment without knowing what the facts are , ” Mrs. Pelosi said .
“ But I do think that the legal opinions , as we are learning now , that were issued by the [ Justice Department ‘s ]
Office of Legal Counsel did not serve our country well and were not based on our country ’s values . ”
“ In terms of his particular situation , I think the important place to look is what he said about that at the confirmation hearings , ” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters at a breakfast round table hosted by the Christian Science Monitor .
Judge Bybee , who as a top Justice Department lawyer signed memos in 2002 giving the legal green light for the CIA to use harsh interrogation techniques , has faced calls for impeachment or his resignation from the bench since the Obama administration made the memos public last week .
The memos still were classified when President George W. Bush nominated him to the bench .
He was not asked about the memos at his confirmation hearing , but he was asked about the administration ’s policy concerning detained terror suspects and other policies related to the war on terror .
Mrs. Pelosi also endorsed a proposal for a South African - style “ truth commission ” to get to the bottom of how the Bush administration formed its interrogation policy .
Sen . Patrick J. Leahy , Vermont Democrat and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman , first floated the idea , though President Obama has been cool to the panel .
The nonpartisan commission envisioned by Mr. Leahy would investigate the Bush administration ’s anti-terrorism programs , treatment of terrorism suspect detainees and use of electronic eavesdropping inside the United States .
The probe also could extend to matters such as Iraq pre-war intelligence and possible misdeeds by the Defense and Justice departments .
“ I ’m not out just to hang a lot of scalps on the wall .
I want to know exactly what happened so that it wo n’t happen again , ” Mr. Leahy told reporters Wednesday at the Capitol .
Mrs. Pelosi said the truth commission or impeachment hearings for Judge Bybee would not conflict with Mr. Obama ’s stated desire to move the country forward rather than focus on the past .
Mr. Obama on Tuesday opened the door to prosecuting former Bush administration officials over the interrogation policies , saying top officials who approved the harsh techniques , including waterboarding and sleep deprivation , could be subject to criminal charges .
He has pledged to defend CIA agents who conducted interrogations of top terror detainees using techniques authorized in the memos .
Mrs. Pelosi said she shared Mr. Obama ’s commitment to moving forward but that lawmakers also have a responsibility to determine whether members of the previous administration — Judge Bybee or others — lied to Congress .
“ This is something that has to be cleared up , ” she said .
Mr. Leahy has called for Judge Bybee to resign .
He said stepping down would be the honorable course of action because the judge and the Bush administration had misled the Judiciary Committee at the confirmation hearing .
The 18 - page memo signed by Judge Bybee was one of four “ torture memos ” released last week .
The other three were penned in 2005 by Steven G. Bradbury , who succeeded Judge Bybee as head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
Judge Bybee was a professor at the Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , before Mr. Bush tapped him in 2001 for the Justice Department and in 2003 for the 9th Circuit , which has jurisdiction over federal district courts in Alaska , Arizona , California , Hawaii , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , Oregon and Washington .

Part IIIn yesterday 's post I told you about economist Edward C. Harwood 's 1928 prediction of the 1929 Great Depression , in published and unpublished articles .
He saw imbalances in the banking sector that were going to lead the country into a quagmire ( although he could not have predicted the depth to which it would sink through government and global mismanagement ) .
In his unpublished article entitled " A Sharp Distinction Should be Made Between Capital Funds and Commercial Credit , " written in mid-1928 , he gives us a layperson 's understanding of sound commercial banking by explaining the relationships among the various participants as though they were characters in a play .
Let me introduce you :
The Earners , the Investor , the Manufacturer , the Retailer , and the Bank . - Earners - all who are entitled collectively to a share in a country 's GDP , i.e. those who participated in its production .
In other words , all of us who work for a living .
In reality , all of the characters are Earners , but some have different functions . -
Investor - the risk - taker who lends his capital funds to the Manufacturer in exchange for a piece of the profits .-
Manufacturer - the producer of all products , agriculture , and services . -
Retailer - the selling agent for Manufacturer .-
The Bank - the financial intermediary between Manufacturer and Earners , between Retailer and Manufacturer , and between Earners who save at the Bank and the Retailer or Manufacturer , to name a few of the relationships .
[ Thanks to JohnDClare.net for the photo .
]
In Act I , all goes well .
Manufacturer receives a loan ( capital ) from Investor with which to buy his building , equipment , and raw materials .
Then he plans an amount of production based on expected sales .
With the help of Earners , he produces goods ( or services ) to ship to Retailer for selling to the public .
Retailer promises to buy the products and signs the purchase order .
At shipping time , the Manufacturer wants to be able to pay Earners even though he has n't received payment from Retailer for his products , because Retailer will need to sell the products first , and guess who are his customers ?
Why , Earners , of course .
( What goes around , comes around . )
Here is the first point to remember about a healthy monetary system : Manufacturer always distributes 100 % of his gross sales among his expenses , his profit , his Investor , and his Earners ; and the only way he can do this at this point is to get a loan at the Bank , and give each Earner a claim for the value of that portion of the products each has helped to produce , so that the claimant can claim it ( or its equivalent ) when he wants it .
A particular Earner may not want the five cars his annual work entitles him to ; he may want down payment on one car , some bread , some meat , rent money -- any number of things .
Money is , in essence , a claim -- no more , no less , and it is generic , accepted everywhere , .
( More about that later . )
So to give the claims ( we could have named them " purchasing power " ) to each participant , the Manufacturer goes to the Bank with Retailer 's order for the goods .
On the basis of the order the Bank grants Manufacturer a loan by creating credit out of thin air , so to speak , and puts the credit representing almost the total future sales in a checking account to allow the Manufacturer to pay Earners .
( The rest is Bank 's income . )
Once the goods are ready for shipment , Manufacturer pays himself and the Earners , including the Investor , in cash or equivalent ; and everyone accepts these claims ( paper cash bills , a check , or an electronic transfer ) representing a piece of the production .
It is important to retain the notion that the income from the wholesale sale of the product is divvied up between the Manufacturer and the Earners , because they each are entitled to a share of the whole production , down to the last penny .
There can be no more or less money ( claims ) handed out than the total wholesale price of the things manufactured .
This is an essential point .
Also realize that the wholesale sale value is only a part of the final retail sale value .
This is normal , because there are others who are going to participate in the distribution process who will also have a right to claim a share representing the work they have done to get the product to market .
Next , the Manufacturer will require Retailer to make good on his signed purchase order and pay the wholesale price before the items are sold .
So Retailer too goes to the Bank as soon as he receives the title to the goods in shipment ; and the Bank , on the basis of the title , grants a loan ( credit ) and deposits the sum in a checking account so that the Retailer can pay Manufacturer for the goods , who in turn pays back his own loan from the Bank .
The Bank then destroys Manufacturer 's loan document and finds itself with a new loan document signed by Retailer for a higher amount .
The Manufacturer 's loan account is zeroed out , all sums being paid .
Remember , the credit previously issued to Manufacturer and paid out is now claims in the hands of those who produced the products and who deserve their share of its value .
Retailer , who now owes the Bank , sells the products within a few months and pays back his loan .
The Bank then destroys the Retailer 's loan document .
The Retailer , like the Manufacturer , pays the remaining sales proceeds to cover expenses , then himself , his own employees ( earners ) , and investor ( another earner ) , and they all become owners of claims to a piece of the production value .
Soon , someone will have bought all the products that were manufactured , ending the cycle .
A few of the paper claims will end up in a savings account at the Bank .
Let 's stop the carousel here and take stock of things .
What I have described above is the commercial relationship of every company in the world with its bank 's commercial department .
In the past , banks created credit ( in the form of checking accounts ) that was , as described here .
To do so would have been risky unsound banking , proven in the past to lead to trouble .
In Part III of this series on sound commercial banking , I will delve into how banks dealt with savings .

( CNN ) --
The World Health Organization raised the swine flu alert to level five Wednesday indicating it fears a pandemic is imminent .

On Wednesday , the outbreak grew in terms of confirmed cases , people killed and countries with infections .
Health officials are scrambling to get more information about the virus for which there is no vaccine .
" All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans , " said Dr. Margaret Chan , the World Health Organization 's director - general .
She added : " We do not have all the answers right now but we will get them . "
Earlier , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said : " It 's a virus that we 've never seen before .
There 's no background immunity in the population and it is spreading from human to human , all of which has the potential for a pandemic . "
iReport.com :
Do you think we should be worried about swine flu ?
Germany and Austria became the latest European countries to report swine flu on Wednesday , while the number of cases increased in the United Kingdom and Spain .
There are 148 confirmed cases in 11 countries , the majority in the United States , according to the WHO and national governments .
Those figures include seven deaths in Mexico and one in the United States .
The virus spread to five more U.S. states , and the number of people in the United States infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain grew to 91 , the Centers for Disease Control reported on Wednesday .
That number includes the country 's first swine flu fatality : a 22 - month - old child from Mexico who died of the illness at a Houston , Texas hospital on Monday .
President Barack Obama called on schools in the United States with confirmed or possible swine flu cases to " strongly consider temporarily closing so that we can be as safe as possible . "
In Mexico , where the outbreak originated , health officials suspect the swine flu outbreak has caused more than 159 deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses .
So far , 26 cases -- including the seven deaths -- have been confirmed .
Watch as CNN tracks down " patient zero " »
More than 2,700 other patients worldwide are believed to be suffering from the virus .
" It 's clear that the virus is spreading , and we do n't see it slowing down at this point , " said Dr. Keiji Fukuda , assistant director - general of WHO , at a news conference .
The apparent spread of swine flu was not unexpected , CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser told CNN .
" Flu is a very serious infection and each virus is unique , and so it 's hard to know what we 're going to be seeing , " Besser said .
" But given what we 've seen in Mexico we have expected that we would see more severe infections and we would see deaths . "
WHO ALERT LEVELS
In Phase 1 no viruses among animals reported to have caused infections in humans .
In Phase 2 animal flu virus is known to have caused infection in humans and is potential pandemic threat .
In Phase 3 , animal or human - animal flu virus has caused small number of cases in people , but not sufficient for community - level outbreaks .
Phase 4 is characterized by verified human - to - human transmission of animal or human - animal flu virus , indicating greater but not inevitable risk of pandemic .
Phase 5 means human - to - human spread of virus is confirmed in two countries in one WHO region and pandemic is feared imminent .
Phase 6 characterized by community - level outbreaks in at least one other country in second WHO region .
This phase indicates global pandemic is under way .
The United States is taking precautionary measures to stem the spread of the disease , of which most cases are not severe .
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Wednesday that the federal government would be releasing nearly 13 million doses of antiviral medications to try to stem the spread of the virus .
Health officials stress the medications are only effective if taken in the early stages of the infection .
In the meantime , scientists are working on developing a vaccine with hopes of having a pilot version ready for testing in a few months , Fauci said .
In Mexico City , however , there is a shortage of antiviral medication .
And it became impossible to find protective surgical masks , which the government had handed out to one out of every five residents .
Watch as Mexico City falls quiet »
Mexican authorities believe they may have found " patient zero " in the global outbreak in the small village of La Gloria in the mountains of Mexico .
Five - year - old Edgar Hernandez -- known as " patient zero " by his doctors -- survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in the current outbreak .
He lives near a pig farm , though experts have not established a connection between that and his illness .
Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better .
Researchers do not know how the virus is jumping relatively easily from person to person , or why it 's affecting what should be society 's healthiest demographic .
Many of the victims who have died in Mexico have been young and otherwise healthy .
The deadly outbreak in Mexico has prompted authorities to order about 35,000 public venues in Mexico City to shut down or serve only take - out meals as health officials tried to contain spreading of the virus .
Governments around the world are scrambling to prevent further outbreak .
Read what steps countries are taking
Some , such as China and Russia , have banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico , though the World Health Organization says the disease is not transmitted through eating or preparing pig meat .
Several others countries , such as Japan and Indonesia , are using thermographic devices to test the temperature of passengers arriving from Mexico .
Swine influenza , or flu , is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs .
When the flu spreads person - to - person , instead of from animals to humans , it can continue to mutate , making it harder to treat or fight , because people have no natural immunity .
Symptoms include fever , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea .
Common seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year worldwide , far more than the current outbreak of swine flu .

If undergrads seem an irresponsible bunch these days , excelling in the
extra -curricular subjects of dorm - hopping , beer - swilling , and the
squandering of parental cash , they pale in comparison to their medieval
ancestors at Oxford .
The accounts from England ’s first and most
hallowed University read like Animal House in Latin .
The university had sprung up during the medieval intellectual explosion of the early 10th century in the model of Europe ’s first great academies , Paris and Bologna .
We do n’t know exactly when the first classes were given , but by the early 11th century , the university was an indelible feature of Oxford , then a busy riverside market town .
It had none of the grand ivy - covered buildings we associated with the university today ; the lectures were not held in purpose - built theaters but in hired halls or the professors ’ own homes , filled with stuffed birds , shells , fossils , and astrolabes .
And the pioneer students were a diverse bunch .
Although many were from rich and noble families , the medieval roster included the progeny of ambitious merchants and even battlers like the sons of Clement Paston , a farmer who afforded the high tuition fees by plowing his fields “ both wyntr and somer . ”
While most were destined for careers in the Church as scribes or administrators — they were generally called “ clerks ” ( clerics ) and wore their hair trimmed in the monk - like tonsure , with the top of the head shaved — this did not mean they had any commitment to celibacy or the edicts of the Bible .
They were n’t even given religious instruction .
In fact , the students ’ day - to - day lives were marked by an utter lack of discipline .
The university had no residential colleges , so students lived in rented houses around the town , often four or five to a room , and could easily elude supervision .
Arriving in Oxford very young — usually at the age of 15 or 16 , although many kept going until their early 30s — they quickly grew into privileged roughnecks .
These “ learned imps , ” as the poet Sir Philip Sidney politely called them later ( we might call them juvenile delinquents ) , devoted their time to whoring and brawling , frequenting the taverns and brothels outside the town walls after curfew , terrorizing the local townsfolk by throwing stones and pouring water on their heads , vandalizing property , singing obscene songs , and in return being terrorized and beaten by the townsfolk .
It did n’t help that the Oxford masters , chancellors , and professors , who had gone through the same college system , were worse reprobates than their pupils .
The Oxford students would eventually be domesticated , but those early days in the 11th century were the heyday of the half - savage scholar .
They prowled the town in gangs based on their “ Nation ” — the Northern English , Southern English , Welsh , Irish , and Scottish had loyalties as intense , and rivalries as bitter , as British soccer clubs today .
Life was punctuated by random outbursts of violence against townsfolk and other Nations , and no student ever ventured into the streets without his sword , pole - axe , or mace .
But punishments were lenient , even when there were fatalities involved ; usually , the worst that could happen to a miscreant was to be expelled and forced to study in Cambridge .
Imagine a New York public high school where every kid is provided a weapon and told to study Joyce , and you begin to get the idea of the feral ambiance .
The same wanton excess characterized the students ’ many celebrations .
Every stage of the scholar ’s progress was celebrated by feasts and carousing .
There were parties at registration , parties for the hazing of freshmen ( newcomers were forced to kiss seniors ’ shoes and sometimes be led through town on asses ) , and boozy teaching parties called “ Aristotle Banquets ” that mimicked the Symposia of the Greeks .
There were parties for the dozens of religious festivals on the calendar , which began at Mass and ended in the taverns , and were often marked by fancy dress .
There were parties after the many violent feuds around town , when the two sides made up with a solemn kiss at the so - called “ love days . ”
There were parties to mark the end of every academic year and parties before oral examinations , in order to bribe the attending professors with food and presents of fine gloves , precious rings , or sweetmeats , not to mention cold cash .
But the happiest event of all was one ’s “ inception , ” when after seven years of study and mischief , a student became a Master of Arts .
These , if a wealthy student was graduating , were truly spectacular medieval pageants , up there with royal weddings and homecomings from war .
The process was somewhat more complicated than our modern university graduations .
Some months earlier , the successful students had , on bended knee , received their licenses , or degrees , by the chancellor , proving they had slavishly learned the ancient texts and memorized their principles by rote .
But the graduation process was not complete until the public exam and inception , a procedure that ended in a wonderful banquet for the student , as well as his professors and closest allies .
The young men ’s families regarded the event as part and parcel of their tuition fee , a splendid opportunity to impress their peers .
If the Middle Ages has been dubbed by culinary historian Nichola Fletcher “ the golden age of feasts ” for its elaborate presentations and inventive , even bizarre , dishes , the university graduation feast was where the art was at its peak .
Scoring an Invitation :
On the days leading up to the event , the graduating students would have been riding exuberantly around town with their servants , shouting out the announcement to their friends , knocking over peasants ’ carts and generally causing mayhem .
Many of their fellow students were chronically short of funds — living in icy garrets without candlelight , singing hymns at rich men ’s doors for alms , and certainly unable to afford such expensive academic luxuries as books — so they leapt at the chance for a sumptuous free meal .
The guest list would easily reach 100 people , and you could count on being included if you were from the same Nation .
The inception banquet was also one of the few university events where women were invited , which further aroused the enthusiasm of the lusty young clerics - to - be .
Party Preparation : Inceptions were held at the beginning of the school year , so that new Masters could start teaching in Michaelmas Term in October .
The scholar would hire out a special hall for the event , with a connecting kitchen and a fireplace to warm the autumn evening .
( A welcome asset at a time when most windows were without glass ) .
Preparations for the banquet would have begun weeks beforehand ;
Oxford was a market town , so livestock and vegetable produce were , thankfully , readily available .
What to Wear :
There were no special gowns for undergrads , but everyone loved color and loud , contrasting patterns were particularly popular .
Student guests wore belted tunics in garish blues , reds , and yellows , sometimes with hooded capes that were lined with rabbit fur .
In fact , unless their heads were covered , the fresh - faced clerks could only be distinguished from the Oxford townsfolk — who were generally young , given that the average life expectancy in the Middle Ages was only about 35 — by their distinctive monastic haircuts .
Professors wore the official academic dress of the Masters , a somber black robe called a cappa , with a red hood lined with ermine .
Women wore close - fitting , elaborately embroidered silk gowns , also as blindingly colorful as possible ; their faces would be thick with lead - based makeup , which slowly poisoned the wearer .
The ideal female figure was rather different from today : the medievals favored ample “ love handles , ” showing a woman ’s well - fed prosperity , and small , “ apple - like ” breasts .
Party Progress : First , the formal ceremony had to be dispensed with :
Unlike modern graduations , the scholar had to give a lecture of his own , symbolizing his elevation to teacher ’s status ; receive his Master ’s biretta ( a square black cap with a tuft on the top , which is today replaced by a tassel ) ; and then join his former professors .
We know that in the University of Bologna , passionate Italian students would erupt into applause and carry their friend in triumph through the town , preceded by pipers and trumpeters , and there is no reason to think that the high - spirited Oxford students would do any different .
But the real party began when they converged on the banquet hall .
Guests found the room decorated with multi-colored banners , gilded columns , gold - trimmed canopies , and sumptuous cushions — a splendid , if slightly over - the - top , effect that is far more inviting than the cold stone interiors we see in Gothic chambers today .
The pitch of the revelry increased as the cup - bearers dashed back and forth with the wine .
Music and dancing were officially discouraged at Oxford — those young clerks were supposedly heading for holy orders , after all — but the prohibition was largely ignored .
Diners were entertained by minstrels with their lutes , while couples at the banquet would stand spontaneously and perform intricate dance routines .
Actors , fools , dwarves , and storytellers all tried to make themselves heard above the din ; even household dogs jumped onto the tables and joined the revelry .
Eventually , the whole table would burst into raucous verse .
The most beloved student drinking songs were imported from French universities by roving scholars , including such perennial classics as “ To die in the pub is my life ’s ambition , ” and ditties that celebrated student freedom :
We in our wandering ,
Blithesome and squandering ,
Tara , tantara , teino !
Jesting eternally ,
Quaffing infernally :
Tara , tantara , teino !
The Menu :
The banquet table was laden with food before the guests arrived to accentuate the visual effect .
The eye feasted on a sea of ornamental meat platters , succulent pies , bejeweled chalices brimming with sugared fruits and bonbons , as well as decorative “ subtleties ” — goblets made of sugar that could later be eaten .
Medieval cooks loved to make the food itself colorful and patterned , adding bright dyes made from herbs , flowers , saffron , and gold leaf , and using pomegranate seeds scattered like gems .
Although England did not have the range of fruits and spices available in the Mediterranean , the feast was a carnivore ’s paradise .
There was boar and deer to be had , succulent bear steaks and pyramids of seasoned pigeons , plovers and quails , mutton and swan , rabbit and venison , goose and pork .
As the party progressed , whole roast beasts were brought in from the kitchen — the wealthier the host , the more exotic the animals .
Meat - carving was considered a nobleman ’s skill , so the guest of honor or his father would get busily to work .
Supplementing the red meat would be a wonderful array of seafood : Oysters , herrings , stockfish , plaice , lampreys , pickerels , and eels .
There were English favorites like blancmange — a mix of rice and fine chicken meat blended into a thick paste .
There were even a few token vegetables dishes like asparagus .
( Of course , before the discovery of the Americas , there were no tomatoes , corn , or potatoes ) .
The meal ended with delicious desserts — thin sweet wafers , strawberries , luscious jams , and candied fruit .
Improbably enough , a good medieval host also had to ensure that the meal should be “ healthy ” by the standards of the day :
He was obliged to give enough variety that a guest could choose meals that suited his particular humor – a food could be hot or cold , dry or wet , which matched an individual ’s body , dominated as it was by black bile , phlegm , blood , or yellow bile .
At Oxford , where the great medical minds of the day had studied the Greek dietary texts , professors happily gave advice on nutrition .
Drinking Notes : Students in the Middle Ages had never heard of tea , coffee , or cigarettes , let alone iced frappuccinos , but alcohol was an integral feature of Oxford life , guzzled continually by students and teachers alike .
Statutes even provided that students supply their professors with a decent amount of wine during examinations .
At a banquet , adventurous guests might be treated to Hypocras , a supposedly aphrodisiac ( and insanely expensive ) cocktail of Burgundy , sugar , ginger , cinnamon , cloves , pepper , and cardamom .
Table Etiquette :
There were no individual plates at a medieval feast :
Each guest ’s meat portion was laid on a thick slice of bread called a trench , which soaked up the juices and would be devoured in turn .
Those unaccustomed to genteel feasting could consult one of the many self - help books on medieval table manners with titles like The Book of Urbanity .
To modern ears , the advice is fairly straightforward .
Wash your hands on the morning of the banquet — and your face , if you have time .
At the table , use only your thumb and two first fingers to eat , with the pinky clean to dip into the salt ( forks did not arrive in Britain from Italy until 1608 ) .
Do n’t pick your teeth with your knife .
Wipe dirty hands on the table cloth , not your clothes .
Do n’t start arguments with fellow guests .
Do n’t stare hungrily at other people ’s food .
Do n’t criticize the cooking .
And remember to throw your scraps and bones beneath the table .
Conversation Tips : Every Oxford student was obliged to speak Latin even in a casual social setting like this .
Since their vocabulary and grammar were ( as one professor complained ) “ villainous , ” conversation manuals were published to provide phrases that might be useful in daily life .
One survivor of the genre is the anonymous Scholar ’s Manual .
Although appearing first in Heidelberg in 1481 , its humorous scenes give insights into how Oxford students might have bantered .
It includes everything from the agonies of puppy love ( “ What plague is more virulent than a woman ? ” ) to the best way of weedling money out of reluctant fathers .
One chapter heading involves the pleasures of hazing : “ Two young men … harassing a beanus ( freshman ) ; pretending that they do not know he is a beanus , but that he is an offensive smell . ”
And the section on how to prepare for exams includes some timeless phrases : “ I ’m worried and scared out of my wits .
I have n’t completed my work properly , and many masters dislike me . ”
The After - Party : Following dessert , many of the young men lurched off in search of less respectable female company .
Records show that scholars regularly visited prostitutes beneath the town walls , kept local mistresses , or tried vigorously to seduce their married landladies .
The more intrepid would travel to the nunnery at Godstow , where scholars boasted they could find “ all kinds of good cheer with the nuns , to the hearts desire . ”
But most guests simply repaired to the town taverns .
Here , the tone of the evening quickly degenerated , with students inevitably getting into brawls with one another and the locals , who resented them bitterly .
Medieval life was filled with casual violence : Typical is the 1231 dispute between students and a tavern cook that led to scalding water being poured on an Irish scholar ’s head and the cook being shot dead with an arrow .
Other “ Town and Gown ” clashes were even more dramatic .
After one St. Scholastica ’s
Day feast in 1398 , a trio of inebriated students in Swyndlestock Tavern complained about the “ indifferent wine ” and threw their mugs at the tavern - keeper ’s head in disgust .
Three days of bloody riots followed , with the townsmen sacking the student ’s homes while chanting “ Slay , Slay , Havoc , Havoc , Smite Fast , Give Good Knocks , ” resulting in numerous dead and mauled on both sides .
But just as common were the brawls between the student Nations , which could escalate into pitched battles ; in 1258 , when the Northern and Welsh students took on the Southern , pennants were flown to identify each side and “ divers ( many ) on both sides were slain and pitifully wounded . ”
But on a quiet night , partygoers sat around savoring beer , gossiping about professors , singing songs , and even sometimes debating Aristotle until the autumn sun broke through the mist .
In short , they would “ sitt bousynge and drynkynge so late in the nyght that in the mornynge they be so slogguysh they cannot holde up their hedys . ”

Bloggery - pokery by Matt Brooker , comic artist and cat botherer ; because ev 'ry day's a holiday in the wacky world of comics !
When she first burst onto the Republican scene , we wrote a few posts about the Religious Right ’s newfound love of the idea of Sarah Palin as Vice President even though they would have opposed the idea of allowing her to be a leader in their churches .
For those right - wing leaders who did n’t outright oppose the idea that Palin might have an “ unbiblical ” career outside of the home , their explanation was that so long as her husband Todd approved of her candidacy it was okay .
So I wonder what these Religious Right leaders think now that they are finding out that Palin was n’t even planning on asking Todd if it was okay until John McCain suggested that she should at least run it by him :
PALIN : Just looking right in my eyes and saying , Are you ready for this ?
Would you like to do this ?
And I said , I would be honored to run with you .
Absolutely . [… ]
VAN SUSTEREN : Todd was n’t with you .
Did you call
Todd then ?
PALIN : Well , before I said yes .
That was Senator McCain ’s recommendation .
He says , Why do n’t you call your husband and find out , you know , if he ’s good with this also .
I called Todd , and Todd , too , was no hesitation .
He was like , Absolutely .
This will be good .
Yes , do this .
And just good confirmation that , of course , we were to say yes .
It must come as something of a shock for Richard Land , who was advocating for Palin months before McCain chose her , to find out that Palin had to be reminded to talk to her husband about it – especially since Land believes that her husband ’s approval was a fundamental requirement , saying the “ only thing that would disqualify Gov. Palin from being governor or vice president … would be if her husband did n’t want her to do it . ”
Interestingly enough , the public relations industry does indeed have a code of ethics .
It would be nice to see environmental groups push to have those who took part in this campaign ejected from any professional associations .
As to the officials of those companies ?
Decent people should shun them - but only because I 'm a pacifist and would never advise you to storm their houses with pitchforks :
For more than a decade the Global Climate Coalition , a group representing industries with profits tied to fossil fuels , led an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign against the idea that emissions of heat - trapping gases could lead to global warming .
“ The role of greenhouse gases in climate change is not well understood , ” the coalition said in a scientific “ backgrounder ” provided to lawmakers and journalists through the early 1990s , adding that “ scientists differ ” on the issue .
But a document filed in a federal lawsuit demonstrates that even as the coalition worked to sway opinion , its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted .
“ The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied , ” the experts wrote in an internal report compiled for the coalition in 1995 .
The coalition was financed by fees from large corporations and trade groups representing the oil , coal and auto industries , among others .
In 1997 , the year an international climate agreement that came to be known as the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated , its budget totaled $ 1.68 million , according to tax records obtained by environmental groups .

Tonight we said goodbye to the most significant science fiction series on television .
Great sci - fi like this only seems to come around one or twice a decade .
It wo n’t be easily replaced now that it ’s gone .
The finale was n’t perfect , but it was an amazing way to say goodbye to the characters who have , if you ’ve had the good sense to be watching , so deeply impacted all of our lives .
For a detailed recap of the finale , go here .
I ’m not here to rehash it , I ’m here to eulogize it , to laud it , to celebrate one of the greatest things ever to grace your television , and remember all the wonderful ways in which we ’ll miss it .
BSG is gone and there ’s no replacing it .
We ’ll miss … drinks with Adama and Tigh .
Sure Starbuck could really knock them back but when Adama and Tigh got together to hash something out over a bottle of scotch it was an event .
Their late night drink sessions were symbols of what it really means to be a man .
Their friendship was unbreakable and in those rare times when it seemed about to break nothing cured it like a bottle full of sweet nectar , maybe take a few swings at each other , and then spend a night passed out on the floor .
If you ’re a real man , then grab a bottle of whiskey and guzzle it down in honor of Admiral William Adama and Colonel Saul Tigh .
We ’ll miss … the battlestar Galactica .
She ’s one of the great design and imagination marvels of science fiction .
While almost every other starship ever created was designed with either firepower or exploration in mind , the grand old Battlestar was designed with one true purpose : Dispensing deadly Viper fighters .
She ’s the first properly realized aircraft carrier in space and she ’s beautiful in all her creaking , aging , rusting glory .
There ’s never been a ship like Galactica , with her endless metal halls , her dimly lit bar , her vast cargo holds filled with techs and refugees and soldiers .
She was for a time both a protector and a home .
She gave her life to give the people aboard her a future .
We ’ll miss …
Six ’s red dress .
And not just the dress but the way Tricia Helfer fit into it .
We sci - fi geeks have had our share of outer space babes to lust over but seriously , none of them can hold a candle to Six in that frakking red dress .
Or better still on the none too rare occasions when Six stepped completely out of it .
For a show as dark and gritty as BSG was , it was at times also incredibly sexy .
This was televised science fiction made , for perhaps the first time in history , entirely for adults .
Adults have sex and BSG was never afraid to jump in the sack .
We ’ll miss … riding a Viper straight into hell .
BSG made space combat exciting , frenetic , and full of energy .
It felt like real combat .
The camera was used to suck you in , bring you in alongside the Galactica ’s half - mad space jockeys and let you feel the out of control danger of what they were doing .
In BSG ’s hands space had an edge .
While the show was focused primarily on drama and character , it never shied away from blasting the frak out of everything in the general vicinity when the moment called for it .
It refused to be hemmed in by the small screen , never has anything on television felt bigger and more cinematic .
We ’ll miss … the chemistry between Starbuck and Apollo .
I never really bought into the whole love triangle thing the show ’s writers tried to force them into , but there ’s no denying that whenever they got together , whether to kiss or punch each other in the head , something special happened .
Their relationship , in whatever state it happened to be in at the time , always seemed to be the center of the show .
Over time other dynamics grew up around them but it ’s always been Starbuck and Apollo .
The next time you see them together Lee will talk with a British accent and Kara will call him Jamie as they reminisce about old times together on the set .
That ’s just not going to cut it .
I like my Apollo American and with a ridiculously chiseled chin , and I like my Starbuck pissed , drunk and ready to frak the world .
We ’ll miss … wondering whether we ’re cylons .
For the first few seasons especially , it seemed like anyone at any minute could turn out to be a murderous robot .
Later in the show things got taken even further , until Ron Moore had us , the viewers wondering if even we , sitting at home in our living rooms wearing Snuggies , might actually be cylons ourselves .
Worse , even after we knew who the cylons were you could never be sure which ones you could trust .
Is that Boomer walking towards me with a gun or is it Athena ?
And if it is Athena are we sure she does n’t share the same thoughts as Boomer ?
How did Helo deal with this crap ?
Now the mysteries is solved and the next time you encounter a cylon it ’ll probably while watching reruns of Xena : Warrior Princess .
Though I do have this friend named Daniel …
We ’ll miss … politics … in space !
Somehow political intrigue gets more interesting when it ’s surrounded by an airless void .
While America ’s political process puts most people to sleep , watching Laura Roslin battle it out on the political playing field against the likes of Gaius Baltar and devious Tom Zarek was a thrill .
The fascinating thing about BSG ’s political landscape is that it always came in so many shades of grey .
Even now I ’m still not sure whether Gaius Balter was a villain or a hero .
Most of the characters in BSG ’s world , even the worst ones like Cavill , were a little bit of both .
That kind of moral complexity is something you ’ll almost certainly never get anywhere else .
We ’ll miss … the perfect score .
Before BSG began it ’s run on television I had no idea who Bear McCreary was .
Now he ’s in regular rotation on my iPod .
His music , as much as the show ’s visuals , had a hand in giving this small screen product such a big screen , cinematic feel .
Episode in and out , BSG soared on music worthy of Hollywood ’s biggest , longest epics , but compacted down into under an hour .
Every piece of music is more unique and different than the next , yet they all scream indelibly : Battlestar Galactica .
We ’ll miss … imaginary friends .
Gaius Baltar made talking to yourself cool again .
Of course it ’s only cool if your imaginary partner is as ridiculously sexy as Caprica Six .
His weird and often hilarious conversations with a non-existent entity were from the beginning , a hallmark of the show .
Even after so much of the mystery around BSG had been solved we were still left wondering what the frak was going on inside Baltar ’s head .
Now the show ’s over and we still do n’t really know ?
Doe it matter ?
Who would n’t want a Caprica Six inside their head ?
We ’ll miss … the Sci Fi Channel
Now that BSG is over with the channel has little else worth watching left .
They seem to know it , since in the near future they ’re changing their format and their name to become something else .
Unless you ’re some sort of Stargate nut odds are that most of us will simply tune out , at least until the spinoff show Caprica finally shows up .
Should you tune in , you ’ll have to endure their intentionally misspelled new name on flashy , all - genre compassing logos .
Even if the channel never really delivered on the promise of dedicated itself to Science Fiction , having a place like that out there was at least , fun while it lasted .
Rest in peace SciFi , SyFy just is n’t going to cut it .
Beasts Associated , der ( ehemalige ) Provider von Wikileaks .de hat heute eine Stellungnahme ( PDF ) zum Zensur - Vorwurf veröffentlicht und klärt die Lage auf :
Auf Grund von nicht vertragsgemäßen Verhalten des Herrn Reppe wurde bereits Anfang Dezember 2008 der Vertrag fristgerecht und mit entsprechendem Vorlauf zum 30 .

Der Kündigung wurde nicht widersprochen und es ist keine Klage gegen die Kündigung anhängig .
In dem Kündigungsschreiben wurde ebenfalls darauf hingewiesen , was mit Domains , welche bis zum Kündigungsdatum nicht umgezogen wurden , passieren würde .
„ Domains , welche bis zum 31.03.2009 nicht umgezogen sind , werden von uns an die Vergabestelle zurückgegeben oder entsprechend gekündigt . “
Die DENIC eG sieht in solch einem Fall den Transit vor .
Mit anderen Worten : Der Domainbesitzer hat es verpeilt ( * ) , die Domain ist noch da ( aber im Transitmodus ) und an den Zensurvorwürfen ist nichts dran .
Das ist leider etwas unglücklich und unprofessionell von Wikileaks gelaufen , als sie in einer Pressemitteilung am Freitag die ganz große Zensur - Rhetorik auspackten .
Ich bin eigentlich davon ausgegangen , dass man bei einer solchen Rhetorik mit diesen Vowürfen vorher einige Fakten checkt , um die eigene Glaubwürdigkeit nicht zu gefährden .

Advertisement May Day revellers jumped off Oxford 's Magdalen Bridge after it was reopened following an overnight closure .
The bridge has been closed for the past three years during the traditional celebrations to stop people jumping into the River Cherwell .
In 2005 when the bridge was last left open , 40 people were injured when about 100 jumped off it .
Several people leaped off on Friday morning .
One one person was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence .
Naomi Stokes , 20 , a student at Oxford Brookes University , took the plunge with a friend , Christopher Wortom , also 20 , and from the same university .
It is irritating when people try to portray the bridge jumping nonsense as a tradition that goes back for decades
Mark Blandford - Baker Standing on the bridge afterwards , she said : " We really wanted to celebrate May Day somehow but unfortunately we missed the first bit which is a shame .
" But I think we got here for the best bit - it was great .
I want to come back and jump every year .
" It was fun , a bit cold , but definitely worth it , " said the English and Drama student .
Mark Blandford - Baker , home bursar of Magdalen College , said the bridge jumping only started in the early 1980s .
He said : " It is irritating when people try to portray the bridge jumping nonsense as a tradition that goes back for decades .
" People in years gone by had more sense than to want to throw themselves several feet in to a shallow river and run a high risk of broken bones and sprains . "
In 2005 the ambulance service said treating those injured after they jumped from the bridge cost it £ 50,000 .

March 5 , 2009  --
More than a year after developing a mysterious neurological disorder eventually linked to their inhalation of aerosolized pig brains , 24 pork plant workers have regained their health .
Their recovery , described Tuesday in a presentation scheduled for the American Academy of Neurology 's annual conference , ends a story that began in November 2006 , when three workers at a Quality Pork Processors plant in Austin , Minnesota reported strange and similar symptoms : fatigue , numb and tingling legs , pain , difficulty walking .
Doctors did n't know what caused the problem , but tests found severe spinal cord inflammation , suggesting an autoimmune disorder : the patients ' immune systems no longer recognize their bodies ' nerves , and attacked them .
Over the following months , the number of cases rose to 24 , and past cases of a similar condition were uncovered at a meat processing plant in Indiana .
Doctors scrambled to find a common clue .
Both plants were among a total of three in the country to process pig brains for consumption -- and each of the 24 workers at the Minnesota plant worked in the " head table " room .
At the head table , pig heads were cut open and the brains forced out with a burst of compressed air .
In the process -- a process that took place about 1,400 times an hour -- some of the brains were blown into a fine mist .
Not everyone in the room got stick , but the closer people stood to the table , the more likely they were to be afflicted .
" When you 're breathing in pig brain tissue , your body develops an antibody against it , " said Mayo Clinic neurologist James Dyck , who helped treat the workers .
Antibodies are chemicals used by the immune system to tag foreign bacteria and substances .
" There 's enough overlap between pig brains and human brains that it was a problem . "
The workers ' immune systems mistakenly targeted their own nerves .
Fortunately , most responded to treatment with immunotherapy and steroids , and six improved without any treatment at all .
None of the workers , however , have recovered fully .
Exactly why the rash of cases emerged so suddenly is n't known .
The factory shut down the pig brain processing center soon after the disease emerged , and no new cases have been reported .
According to Dyck , the near - tragedy has a silver lining : doctors had a chance to study the emergence of autoimmunity -- a phenomena underlying dozens of diseases , many of which are barely understood and difficult to treat -- in a manner impossible inside a laboratory .
" This is an experiment that occurred by accident , " he said .
" What is an immunodeficiency ?
How does that autoimmune process happen ?
What 's getting attacked ? " he said .
" This is teaching us about how the body and the immune system works . "

Such concern for the taxpayers …
I ’d bet that the choreographers of this scam assume that the average person does n’t know the difference between million and billion .
That ’s the first bet .
The second bet I ’d make is that this entire spectacle has been concocted to shift the focus away from where the really big money is going .
( Hint : Goldman Sachs . )
So , while the drama is happening over $ 165 million in bonuses , another roughly $ 30 billion goes down the gugrler .
The strategy that the Obama regime is using , over and over again , is called a confidence trick :
A confidence trick or confidence game ( also known as a bunko , con , flim flam , gaffle , grift , hustle , scam , scheme , or swindle ) is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence .
See !
We ’re going after the bonuses !
We ’re going to , “ Make the American taxpayers whole . ”
Holy shit , what a racket .
People thought they were dialing 911 near the end of the Bush years .
Save us .
Save us .
Under the Obama regime , the cops roll up and rob you in your living room .
This is called Change .
Via : New York Times :
President Obama on Monday vowed to try to stop the faltering insurance giant American International Group from paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to executives , as the administration scrambled to avert a populist backlash against banks and Wall Street that could complicate Mr. Obama ’s economic recovery agenda .
“ In the last six months , A.I.G. has received substantial sums from the U.S. Treasury , ” Mr. Obama said .
He added that he had asked Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner “ to use that leverage and pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . ”
Later in the day , a White House official disclosed that the administration would use a pending $ 30 billion installment for A.I.G. to recoup the $ 165 million in retention payments to A.I.G. employees in the business unit that brought the company to the brink of collapse last year .
“ Treasury will be using this facility to address the excessive retention payments made to the A.I.G. Financial Products employees , which Treasury found to be completely unacceptable given that A.I.G. is already surviving on taxpayer funds , ” said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ Treasury will be adding provisions to its new facility aimed at making taxpayers whole for the amounts of the offensive payments . ”

What do we have to show for these 30 years + of investigations , smart tests , cunning double ratios , global fits , and the like ?
Let me try and summarize - despite I am sure I am going to do a very incomplete job :
- Neutrinos mix and have mass .
Ok , that is something .
But it does not change by much the physics of electroweak interactions .
- Rb is off , but by less than three sigma .
- the gluon distribution function is larger than it used to be at high x .
- low - energy QCD has made big steps forward , but it also did not change the picture much .
- Radiative corrections imply the existence of the Higgs boson , or something else yielding the proper effect on measurable electroweak parameters .
Ok , but the Higgs is part of the SM .
What else ?
In Run I , CDF did have a few inconsistencies to keep hope alive , but they died one by one under the blows of merciless re-analysis or more data .
HERA had these leptoquark signals , but they died away .
Aleph had fancy signals at some point , but it also bubbled down … .
One could make this list much longer , but things would not change much .
the suggestion of a departure from SM expectations of a parameter - the " strong - CP phase " - extracted from Bs mesons at the Tevatron ; this is an anomaly staying at about 2 - sigma away from the SM ;
the intriguing Anomalous Muon signal unearthed by CDF in a controversial paper : this effect has so far not been confirmed nor ( it is my opinion ) disproven ; it is however quite unlikely ( again , my personal opinion ) to constitute new physics beyond the Standard Model .
only a W boson can change the flavor of quarks
the W boson in the diagram is positively charged :
The top - like events observed in the data at high values of the discriminant lead to observed limits that are weaker than the expected limits . [...]
Extracting a production cross section from the discriminant distributions gives for all channels combined sigma( ep -> etX ) = 0.11+-0.07 pb .
This value is compatible with zero within two standard deviations .
These are hard times for evil guys like me , who are always willing to speculate wildly on particle physics results - only to secretly chuckle at the ripples their extrapolations make , knowing for a fact that the Standard Model is as solid as it has ever been .
Suggestive new results which offer themselves as the first hint of a breakdown of the Standard Model are indeed quite rare nowadays .
In a famous post which originated a $ 1000 bet ( taken up in part by Prof. Gordon Watts and in part by Prof. Jacques Distler ) , no less than 32 months ago I was writing in my old blog :
So , you can well see that during the additional 32 months that passed since September 2006 nothing much has happened in particle physics .
That is , if we exclude no - news setbacks such as the continuous delay of the LHC startup .
As far as hints of new physics beyond the Standard Model , I can only think at two things :
A similar , yet more complete and deeper , list can be found e.g. at the Resonaances blog .
In any case , you can well understand that under such shortages , speculative sons - of - a- bitch like me have to cling to whatever sticks its butt above a statistical significance of two standard deviations , or even less .
So I cheer up at the new preprint published a few days ago by the H1 collaboration at the HERA facility in Hamburg : they searched for top quark events where none were expected , and found some !
Now , just a moment before I start receiving ugly phone calls , let me qualify that : they do not observe any signal , and thus set upper limits on single top - quark production in electron - proton collisions .
However , there is a lot of water between observing a signal and ruling it out .
Indeed , what H1 finds is that there is a 2 - sigmaish like upper fluctuation which does indeed look like a top signal in their data .
A handful of events , to be sure .
So let me discuss the result in some detail for you below .
HERA is a quite atypical particle accelerator : it combines some of the strenghts of both electron - positron and proton - antiproton colliders - and a few of the weaknesses - in mixed electron - proton collisions .
The collision of 920 GeV protons with 30 GeV electrons ( or positrons ) produces the release of up to 320 GeV of energy , which can materialize into new states of matter .
320 GeV is less than the total mass of a pair of top quarks , but it definitely is more than the mass of a single one ( the most recent Tevatron measurements set that fundamental parameter of the Standard Model at ) .
So it is energetically possible that a HERA collision yields a top quark .
But are there reactions capable of yielding such events ?
The question is not a vacuous one .
The interaction between an electron and a quark within the proton is mediated by electroweak gauge bosons - W or Z particles , or photons - but the Standard Model dictactes that .
And since top quarks are not contained in the proton ( well , theoretically a proton may be found to contain pairs of those for vanishingly short instants , but it is a really remote possibility ) , two distinct possibilities are left .
an electron emits a W boson and thus turns into an electron - neutrino ; the W boson interacts with a down - type quark ( a down , a strange , or a bottom quark ) found in the proton , and turns it into a top quark .
This process is really rare , and utterly unobservable in the present H1 dataset .
an electron emits a Z or a photon , retaining its identity ; the Z boson interacts with a up - type quark ( a up , or a charm quark ) , and magically turns the latter into a top .
Now the most alert of you will be about to object : have n't you just said that only W bosons can change a quark 's flavor ?
Yes , I did .
In fact , the second possibility would be a anomalous process , one which is not possible in the Standard Model until one considers complicated loop diagrams which have ridiculously small probability to occur .
So here is a clean process worth searching for : if HERA finds top quarks , they must be due to a so - called " Flavor - changing neutral current " interaction ( FCNC ) , a very striking case of Physics Beyond the Standard Model ( BSM ) !
A
Feynman diagram of FCNC top quark production is shown on the left .
You may notice that the signature includes an outgoing electron , a W boson decay , and a b - quark - originated hadron jet .
Those are the bodies one needs to measure to collect top - quark candidates at HERA .
Also , the red blob has a specific function : it hides our ignorance of what might produce a change of the flavor in the quark line .
There is another thing to note here .
The most acute of you might have observed thatthat is because producing anti-top quarks is much , much harder , because that would imply that the parton interacting with the photon or Z boson is a antiquark .
Now , antiquarks do exist in the proton , but it is really difficult to find them with a large fraction of the proton 's momentum - which is really called for if the collision is to release an energy of at least 173 GeV.H1 ( see right ) is endowed with a particle tracker embedded in a uranium - liquid argon calorimeter ; both systems are immersed in a 1.16 - Tesla solenoidal magnetic field , which allows the measurement of transverse momentum of charged particles .
Electrons are well - measured in the calorimeter , and muons can be detected by streamer tubes and drift chambers .
The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 474 inverse picobarns .
Luminosity is a measure of collisions since to get the number of collisions producing a given reaction you just have to multiply luminosity by the " cross section " of any given process : cross section is like a probability , but it is measured in units of area : squared centimeters .
A square centimeter contains 10^36 picobarns : a billion of billions of billions of billions of them .
Oh well : better just say that for a very rare process , one with a cross section of one picobarn , the H1 data should contain about 474 of them .
H1 selects events containing a leptonic W decay - yielding an identified positron or a positive muon - plus missing energy due to the escaping neutrino ; a hadronic jet , resulting from the b-quark hadronization , must also be present .
The colliding electron which emitted the photon or Z boson is not always detected .
After suitable preselection of these objects , with a positron are found in the data , with a prediction offrom background sources ; more with a positive muon are found with a background expectation of .
At this level , it seems top quarks are not needed to explain the data - and in fact , the Standard Model does not predict any from the sought FCNC process .
Three reconstructed kinematical quantities are now studied to better discriminate the possible single top signal from the concurring background processes - which have quite different characteristics :- the transverse momentum of the b- jet candidate ;- the invariant mass of the top quark , reconstructed from the lepton , the neutrino , and the b- jet ; - and an angle describing the W decay properties .
The three observable quantities above are used to construct a multi-variate discriminant based on a Neural Network .
The output of the neural network is shown for electron and muon events in the two graphs on the right ( electrons on top , muons on the bottom ) .
Data are shown as black points with error bars , while expected background is shown with a black histogram with blue shaded uncertainty ; the pink hatched histogram instead shows the shape of the discriminant expected for FCNC top decays .
As I saw these plots I almost fell off my chair .
There is a distinct signal - like excess in both distributions !
The paper is adamant in explaining that they do see some top - like events , but such signal has an insufficient statistical significance to be interesting :
Two standard deviations , no more .
Rats !
But those few outliers in the plots above do look like a nagging signal ...
If those were the tip of an iceberg just waiting to be digged out , we would be sitting on top of a massive new discovery .
Unfortunately , I must get back to sobriety , and assure you that they are indeed , in all probability , no more than a unfortunate statistical fluctuation .
Sure , unfortunate : because of those events , H1 extracts a limit twice higher than it expected on the rare FCNC process .
That result is summarized in the graph shown below .
The figure is a bit too technical for the level of this post , but in summary what is plotted is the value of two " anomalous couplings " , numbers which parametrize the possibility that the Standard Model needs to be extended with interactions connecting a flavor - changing quark line with a photon ( on the horizontal axis ) or with a Z boson ( on the vertical axis ) .
The name of the game is restricting these two parameters to be as close as possible to zero - zero being the prediction for the Standard Model : no FCNC interactions .
Several experiments have set limits on these couplings : CDF , ZEUS ( the experiment competing with H1 at HERA ) , and even L3 - one of the experiments working at the large electron - positron collider at CERN .
The H1 result is an exclusion of the yellow area , which extends down to the blue area if the top quark mass is assumed to be smaller - a lighter top quark would be produced more frequently by HERA , and the constraints are in that case stricter .
In conclusion , H1 does slightly narrow the allowed range of FCNC coupling parameters for single top production .
But the experiment also sees a small , nagging top - like signal !
Enough to excite all of us HEP perverts .
Face of a monster : Self - portrait of Hitler painted when he was just 21 revealed at auction
A solitary figure sits on a bridge , dreaming no doubt of one day invading Poland .
This watercolour is thought to be the earliest self - portrait by Adolf Hitler , painted in 1910 when the future Fuhrer was 21 and a struggling artist .
Kept in storage since it was discovered during the Second World War , it has been placed on public view before it is auctioned next month .
Monster :
The unmistakable hair parting shows this is Hitler sitting on the old stone bridge
Wider view :
The full painting from Hitler showing his signature in the bottom right corner of the painting
The painting , along with 12 others by the Nazi monster , was found by Company Sergeant Major Willie J McKenna when he was stationed in Essen , Germany in 1945 .
They were sold direct to the present unidentified vendor and kept out of sight for decades .
The small portrait has no nose or mouth , let alone a postage - stamp moustache .
But it appears Hitler was keen to identify himself by daubing a cross and the initials AH above the figure .
Amateurish : Hitler was rejected twice by the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1907 and 1908
Landscape :
This is one of 13 paintings by the dictator to go on sale at auction
The 13 paintings will be auctioned at Ludlow racecourse in Shropshire on April 23 and are expected to fetch tens of thousands of pounds .
The others are of flowers and landscapes .
Richard Westwood - Brookes , Mullocks auctioneers ' historical documents expert , said : ' It 's curious to say the least how an artist , whose interests at this stage of his life should be in such peaceful and bucolic subjects , could turn into the monster he became in later life .
' There 's absolutely nothing here to suggest how his mind could have turned in such a way . '
For sale : A 1926 pencil sketch by Hitler was bought by a British buyer for £ 1,050 in 1999
He added : ' One can see why Hitler did n't exactly make a success of his career as an artist .
' These are at best the standard of a reasonably competent amateur and some might consider them downright crude in execution .
Saying that , there is a tremendous fascination in Hitler these days and this sale will provide bidders with a rare opportunity of obtaining a work by Hitler at a time long before he started his campaigns of mass murder and world domination . '
Hitler was rejected twice by Vienna 's Academy of Fine Arts in 1907 and 1908 after being told he was not a talented enough artist .
He resorted to copying scenes from postcards and selling them to tourists .
The two sides of Hitler : The Fuhrer greeting the masses - and his painting of a bunch of flowers
The bomb went off during a Muslim procession
At least 14 people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack in southern Sri Lanka , police say .
The telecoms minister was among about 35 people injured in the blast at the town of Akuressa , 160 km ( 100 miles ) south of the capital , Colombo .
Government officials were attending a function at a mosque to celebrate an Islamic holiday at the time .
The defence ministry said the blast was carried out by Tamil Tiger rebels but no - one has yet admitted responsibility .
The Sri Lankan government has strongly condemned the attack .
It urged people to remain calm and not to be provoked .
' Ministers targeted ' " An LTTE [ Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ] suicide bomber has attacked a mosque at Godapitiya , in Akuressa , in the Matara district , " the defence ministry said on its website .
I heard a huge sound and then I saw people had fallen everywhere .
They were covered with blood and flesh
Ahamed Nafri , witness
Bombing brings new fear Sri Lanka 's oil minister AHM Fowzie , who was at the site , told Reuters news agency the bomber appeared to have targeted six ministers as they walked in a procession toward the mosque .
" This is an area where nobody expected a thing like this to happen , " he said .
The ministers were attending a ceremony to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad when a bomber on a bicycle set off the explosion behind them , officials told the BBC .
Post and Telecommunications Minister Mahinda Wijesekara was injured in the attack and is said to be in intensive care .
A helicopter has airlifted the critically wounded back to Colombo .
One witness , Ahamed Nafri , told Associated Press he was walking toward the mosque at the time of the blast .

The blast comes as Sri Lanka 's military continues its operation to defeat the Tamil Tigers in the north - east .
Fears have been rising over the safety of civilians in rebel - held areas in recent weeks , with reports hundreds of deaths .
A senior health official told the BBC Tamil Service that over 1,000 casualties were brought to a temporary government hospital functioning in the rebel - held village of Pudumatalan hospital over the last 10 days .
Dr T Vartharaja said that 218 bodies were brought to the hospital in addition to 1,205 injured people since 1 March .
Dr Vartharaja said that 277 injured civilians were brought to the hospital on Tuesday alone .
" There were 66 children among the injured - and 45 people from those brought to the hospital earlier died today as a result of lack of medicine , " he said .
He said sicknesses and diseases has been worse because of heavy rainfall over the last few days .
On Tuesday the military said it had restricted the rebels to an area of less than 50 sq km ( 19 square miles ) but that heavy fighting was continuing .
Also on Tuesday , the government announced it had appointed the former deputy leader of the Tamil Tigers - known by his nom de guerre , Col Karuna - as a minister .

More from BBC World Service Vinyagamoorthi Muralitharan is the new non-cabinet minister for national integration and reconciliation .
The Tamil Tigers have been fighting for a separate homeland for the ethnic Tamil minority in the north and east of the country for a quarter of a century .
Government officials say they are confident the entire north - east can be brought under control soon .
But the rebels have vowed to carry on their fight , and correspondents say the latest blast shows they have maintained their ability to launch attacks far from their traditional strongholds .
On 20 February , two planes belonging to the Tamil Tigers attacked Colombo , killing two people and injuring about 45 .
About 70,000 people have died in the conflict in the past 25 years .

FRIDAY , March 20 , 2009 ( HealthDay News ) --
Doctors around the United States are reporting a sharp increase in the number of vasectomies performed since the economy soured last year , with one noting that many of his clients are from the beleaguered financial industry .
Their best guess is that the trend is due both to a decreased desire to have children because of the expense involved , and an increased desire to get such medical procedures done before their jobs -- and health insurance -- disappear .
Since November , Dr. Marc Goldstein , surgeon - in - chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine in New York City , said his practice has seen about 48 percent more vasectomy consultations compared to the same time the previous year .
Nearly 50 percent of the patients in 2008 were employed within the financial industry , and more than 36 percent were seen since September , according to unpublished data from the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Microsurgery at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
Goldstein said his appointment secretary was the first to notice the uptick in the number of men requesting vasectomy consultations .
" I used to do one to two every Friday , " he said .
" Now I 'm doing three on Fridays .
There 's been a significant increase . "
" Nobody came in and said they were having a vasectomy because the [ stock ] market crashed , " Goldstein added .
" Most are saying , ' We 've been thinking about it for a long time , ' and [ the crash ] influenced their decision .
They 're saying with the cost of private school for three kids , they can't afford to have another one . "
Dr. Harry Fisch , a professor of clinical urology at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center , in New York City , said : " The issue about kids is often a financial one , and , if finances are low , it makes sense that people would be less likely to have more kids .
And if they 're thinking about it , this is the time . "
Dr. Stephen Jones , chairman of the department of regional urology at the Cleveland Clinic , noticed a trend toward more vasectomies in late November , with a 75 percent increase in the past few months .
" We were doing 40 to 45 a week , and then it went to 70 to 75 each week , " he said .
" Some patients were concerned about losing their insurance , but it seems to me more of it is the idea of ' I can't commit myself to raising another child in uncertain times . ' "
Dr. Charles Lynne , professor of urology at the University of Miami School of Medicine , remembers a similar trend back in 1991 , when Miami - based Eastern Airlines shut down , and he saw a rise in vasectomies in his practice .
" Eastern was one of the biggest employers , and employees still had insurance , " he explained .

Stardock says Gas Powered Games ' recently - launchedis struggling severely under the burden of hundreds of thousands of illegitimate users on its online servers .
That 's according to a blog post from Stardock CEO Brad Wardell , who says it 's been " a pain " to get the game running , and that a flood of over 120,000 users is yielding " horrific results . "
" Sadly , most of the ~ 120,000 connections are not customers but via warez , " writes Wardell .
" About 18,000 are legitimate . " " Our stress tests had counted on having maybe 50,000 people playing at once at peak and that would n't be reached for a few weeks , " he adds , " by which time we would have slowly seen things becoming problematic . " 's release has already been beleaguered by a broken street date .
Wardell recently told Gamasutra that Stardock is in talks with retailer GameStop to find out how the early release slip - up happened -- and resulted in support staff having to work Easter weekend to configure the servers .
At the time Wardell also told us that the broken street date " maximized " the opportunity for piracy .
In the recent blog post Wardell now says the team is " trying to isolate out the warez users from the legitimate users " in order to cope .
I have lived through three monumental historical events .
I remember only two of them .
I do not remember the dropping of the two atomic bombs in August of 1945 .
As symbols of scientific world transformation , this constituted the most momentous event of the 20th century .
This breakthrough , so far , has not led to nuclear war , even though on several occasions , it looked as though nuclear war was a distinct possibility .
Nevertheless , the arrival of the nuclear age heralded a transformation of the modern world .
We have not yet seen the end of that transformation .
Martin van Creveld , the great military historian in the State of Israel , has argued that the nuclear age ruined the plans of empire for large nations .
They could no longer risk a war with each other .
Yet spending on empire increased .
Today , large states face resistance from non-State groups .
The Soviet Union went down when the Afghans beat them by using Stinger missiles .
The USSR was an empire , and an empire that loses to insurgents has lost its reason for existence .
We are about to experience a similar defeat in the same country .
There have been two other major events since 1945 .
I suppose most people would agree on at least one of them : the collapse of the Soviet Union on December 31 , in 1991 .
While the collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989 was the symbolic evidence of the collapse of the Soviet empire , that did not become clear until August of 1991 .
Historically , there has been nothing to match that disintegration .
No empire that large ever collapsed that fast without bloodshed .
I was here to see it .
There are old - line anti-Communists who still insist that it was all fake , that it is all a deception , that the Communists are still running the show in Russia .
They do not understand the difference between fascism and Communism .
The Russian system is fascist to the core : State - run capitalism .
We are now seeing what hard - core liberals always predicted would happen : the economic convergence of the two systems , USA and USSR .
The system of economic convergence is fascism .
That was what the liberals always wanted , but called it something else : “ economic democracy ” or “ the government - business alliance . ”
SEPTEMBER /OCTOBER 2008
The second event that I regard as almost comparable in importance to the collapse of the Soviet Union was the collapse of the American banking system that took place in September and October of 2008 .
No one saw that collapse coming in August .
The senior rulers of the United States — I do not mean politicians — have watched in horror as institutions that had survived since the mid-19th century went down : investment banks .
These were banks that did not take deposits from the general public .
They pooled large quantities of capital from private , wealthy investors .
Within a matter of weeks , that business model collapsed .
The investment banks scrambled to restructure their legal operations so as to be defined as commercial banks and therefore become eligible for the Federal bailout money .
Meanwhile , huge commercial banks almost went bankrupt .
They did not go bankrupt only because of government intervention and because larger banks absorbed them .
Wachovia went down .
Washington Mutual went down .
The share prices of the two largest banks in the United States , the Bank of America and Citigroup , are still close to penny share status .
Anyone who does not understand the magnitude of what is taking place is an economic ignoramus .
I have plenty of these ignorami contacting me , telling me it was all planned by the insiders .
The conspiracy has won again !
In their worldview , the conspiracy always wins .
That is because they believe that the conspiracy has the attributes of God .
It is omniscient , omnipotent , and omnipresent .
Here is their intellectual problem .
They do not believe in the free market .
They cannot conceive of a social institution based on voluntarism that can break the backs of government planners and central bankers .
They will believe anything but this .
They think of themselves as defenders of the free market .
But they do not grasp the power of the free market to enforce consumers ’ decisions .
The conspiracy of well - placed insiders is now tottering .
The whole structure of the national American political system has rested on the solvency of the largest American banks .
These banks have all been called into question .
They are now gutted .
The thought that commercial bank insiders actively demolished trillions of dollars of their own equity as part of a conspiratorial plan is so imbecilic , so outrageous , so ludicrous , that I am convinced that these conspiracy worshippers have lost whatever remained of their minds .
They have been gutted intellectually , just as the banks have been gutted financially .
Some of them probably think that Communists still run Russia .
Ex-Communists do : bureaucrats , mobsters , and KGB agents .
But Communism is dead .
How do I know ?
Look at a map of Russia .
Look for the old names : Stalingrad and Leningrad .
Gone .
Maps tell a great deal about a civilization .
Russian maps tell us that Communism is dead .
The American conspirators have lost the one thing that they thought they had : control over the nation and the nation ’s finances by means of the fractional reserve banking system .
That system is coming unglued , just as Ludwig von Mises said it would , just as Murray Rothbard said it would , and just as those other Austrian economists who understand the enormous weakness of the fractional reserve system had said would eventually take place .
I wonder sometimes if there is anything coherent remaining in what is generally called the conservative movement .
Do any of these people have a clue as to what has been taking place ?
We are seeing the disintegration of the fractional reserve banking system all over the world .
It is being held together by bailouts , which are the government equivalent of bailing wire and chewing gum .
The only thing holding the whole structure together is an enormous residual faith in the State and a naïve faith that deficits do n’t matter .
That phrase is associated with supply - side conservatives and the vast majority of those people who call themselves Chicago School economists .
Supply - siders said it , and Chicago School economists cautiously chimed in , “ Someday , maybe deficits will matter , but not soon .
At the margin — this year , next year , and until I am dead — deficits do n’t matter . ”
It has been the Austrian School economists who have warned , decade after decade , that the increase in the Federal debt would eventually threaten the solvency of the government and the stability of the dollar .
Now that this is visibly coming true , we still do not hear from professional economists cries of warning regarding trillion - dollar annual Federal deficits .
They say nothing , except when they say it is a good idea , because it is necessary , because we have got to save the banks , because we have got to regulate the economy , and , most of all , because the unhampered free market system really does not work .
This is what we are getting from people who have generally been known as free market economists .
They are lining up as cheerleaders as the banks go to the Federal trough .
The Federal deficit soars into astronomical regions , and the monetary base soars just as fast , yet the academic economists are silent .
This is not the silence of the lambs ; this is a silence of unindicted co-conspirators , most of whom teach in tax - supported universities and spend their careers writing unreadable articles in unread academic journals in order to get tenure , so that the taxpayers can never fire them .
These people are apologists for the State .
Most of them have been on a public payroll all of their lives .
These are the people who , in the name of conservative free - market principles , are supposed to stand in the gap to warn us that the ship of state is going over the falls .
Do n’t hold your breath .
WHAT IS TO BE DONE ?
What can be done about it ?
Politically , nothing .
The American political system has been soft - core fascist for almost a century .
Liberals love to call conservatives fascists .
The problem is , the liberals are right .
Of course , well - informed conservatives like to call liberals fascists , and they are correct , too .
Everyone who believes in the efficiency of the so - called government - business alliance is a fascist .
The fascist State was always an attempt to control private industry by means of inflation , taxation , and regulation .
Fascism was always a system of keeping the big boys alive and happy at the expense of the taxpayers .
Of course , the faces changed .
The system was always one gigantic system of cartels , regulation , and fiat money .
It was , in short , everything that the critics of modern capitalism say is wrong with capitalism .
This is why John Maynard Keynes wrote this in his Foreword to the German edition of his General Theory ( 1936 ) .
The theory of aggregated production , which is the point of the following book , nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state [ eines totalen Staates ] than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez - faire .
This is one of the reasons that justifies the fact that I call my theory a general theory .
The modern economic system is one gigantic interlocking system of promised bailouts , beginning with Social Security .
In commerce , it is a system designed to keep large producers protected from consumers .
It has never been anything else ever since the national political triumph of the Progressive movement in the fateful year of 1912 .
In that year , the three candidates for President were statists to the core , all followers of the Progressivist doctrines , all advocates of central banking , and all happy to see the Federal government expand control over business throughout the country , and throughout the world .
This is not the story we get in the history textbooks , because the textbook writers love what was done in 1912 and subsequently .
The public school system has taught that this was the salvation of capitalism ever since .
We are now seeing the unraveling of the entire system , all over the world .
Whatever happens from this point on , economic production will be hampered by ever - increasing regulation .
The government is now intervening to save the banks , which means that the banks are beholden to the government .
President Obama has said that senior bank officials are not going to be able to receive more than $ 500,000 a year .
They are not going to get money from stock options until the government gets its money back .
I think this is great .
My only regret is that he did n’t say it was $ 250,000 year .
Or maybe $ 100,000 year .
Or maybe about $ 50,000 a year .
Let them live in New York City on that !
The whole crew should resign and go into some decent line of work .
Fractional reserve banking has been a con job from the beginning .
Rothbard and Mises pointed this out , and they were hated for it .
The economists trust bureaucracy .
They trust people with Ph.D. ’s , just like themselves .
But , except at the Federal Reserve , the agencies are run by lawyers and by appointees who hope to get a fat lobbying salary when they leave the government .
Why should we think that a bunch of Harvard - and Yale - educated lawyers , who were recruited by New York City banks that were always protected by the Federal Reserve System , would have any idea of how to run an economy ?
We now know how well they could run the economy .
They stripped off million - dollar bonuses for running the system over the falls .
Is not going to get much better .
The banks are gutted .
The best and the brightest graduates will not be going to go into banking for as long as there is a $ 500,000 cap on salaries , if Obama gets his way .
As far as I am concerned , the pay cap should be forever .
And when the bank - created inflation comes , the government should not change this salary cap to let them benefit by getting a cost - of - living escalator clause .
Their predecessors knew how to get rich under a manipulated currency .
A far as I ’m concerned , their replacements should get poorer the same way .
For over a century , the best and the brightest of the students graduating from the senior universities of the country have been recruited into big government and fractional reserve banking .
In other words , they relied on coercion to get rich personally and to direct the growth of American capitalism .
They got rich , and capitalism grew , but it grew in terms of malinvestments .
It grew because the fiat money was used to lower interest rates , and these lower interest rates led to malinvested capital .
Mises showed how this system operated as early as 1912 .
Ever since September of 2008 , we have seen the fruits of the fiat money roots that Mises warned against almost a century ago .
But modern free - market economists are as hostile to Mises ’s theory of the business cycle as they were hostile to Mises ’s theory of the economic irrationalism of socialism . . . until the Soviet Union fell .
Then , they got religion , but they still never mention Mises .
It was as if he had never lived .
Mises ?
Who is Mises ?
Yes , the Soviet Union went bankrupt .
We did n’t think it would in 1986 .
Except for that lucky guesser Judy Shelton , nobody predicted that it would .
We told people that the Soviet Union had remarkable economic growth .
Yes , it turned out that the Soviet Union was nothing but Bangladesh with missiles , just as journalist Richard Grenier said in the 1980’s .
We did not see this at the time .
Still , we will take credit for its collapse anyway : the new capitalism defeated it .
We will continue to praise the regulated fascist economy that the United States has been over the last hundred years , and call for more of the same .
We love economic efficiency , because efficiency lets the State get larger .
When people get richer , they can pay more taxes .
This is why academic economists are demanding even more Federal spending to bail out the banks and the other institutions associated with high finance .
Almost to a man , they are saying that the bailouts are necessary .
Why ?
Because they have been great proponents of the mixed economy ever since John Maynard Keynes wrote The General Theory in 1936 .
More than this : ever since the real mentor of American fascist banking , Irving Fisher , back in 1911 .
Fisher almost went bankrupt in the Great Depression , yet he is still revered as the greatest economist in American history .
He was a fiat money man from day one .
He believed that the government and the central bank could control the economy by means of monetary policy .
He was the great apologist of the corrupt monetary system which we now suffer from .
An academic , he was the high priest .
Milton Friedman was little more than an acolyte to Irving Fisher on the money question .
NOMINAL RECOVERY
There is real recovery and nominal recovery — recovery in terms of rising prices .
Rising wages and rising prices give the illusion of prosperity .
Always in the past , there has been a recovery after a recession .
Always in the past , the bailouts have worked to cover up the underlying malinvested capital .
Always in the past , the Federal Reserve has inflated , and the economy revived .
This economy will revive , but it will revive on a new basis .
It is no longer possible for someone who understands Austrian School economics to look at this economy as anything remotely resembling a free - market economy .
At the very core of the free - market economy , as Mises said in 1912 , is the monetary system .
That system is now completely and openly run by a cartel that is now trapped by the Federal government .
The Federal Reserve System is soon going to have to bail out the Federal government .
The Federal government is bailing out the commercial banks , and if the Federal government cannot bail out the banks , the Federal Reserve has got to do it directly .
In either case , the banks are busted .
The capital is gone : wasted .
The money is still in people ’s bank accounts , but the fiat - money - funded projects have turned out to be losers .
The skyscrapers are empty .
The recovery is going to be a nominal recovery , based on the digits known as dollars .
These digits are going to be produced in such massive quantities that prices will shoot up as never before in peacetime America .
It is going to be the destruction of the dollar .
Austrian School economists have been predicting this for years , but now we have the Federal Reserve on our side .
We can look at the adjusted monetary base , and we can see what is going to happen .
Unless the Federal Reserve System raises the reserve requirement , thereby undermining the profitability of the entire banking system , and thereby busting hundreds of banks , including some big ones , the adjusted monetary base is going to be translated into real money .
That real money is going to get spent .
When it gets spent , it is going to raise prices .
We are seeing the culmination of a century of bad economic policies .
Academic economists never sounded the alarm after 1936 .
They did not sound the alarm because they are the paid agents of the State , certified by earlier generations of paid agents of the State .
The State has paid for the services of these men and women , and they perform accordingly .
They understand the fundamental rule : “ When you take the king ’s shilling , you do the king ’s bidding . ”
The next college - level economics textbook that exposes the Federal Reserve System as the commercial bank cartel ’s enforcement arm will be the first one .
There is no academic hue and cry against the massive deficits of the Federal government and the massive bailouts by the Federal government .
Economists are silent because they have been cheerleaders for the Federal Reserve System from day one .
For these people , the Federal Reserve can do no wrong today , because it did wrong from 1929 to 1933 , and Milton Friedman exposed this for all to see .
What was a great evil of the Federal Reserve during that period , according to Friedman ?
It did not inflate to offset the contraction of money due to collapsing banks .
Friedman hated free market banking .
He disparaged the gold standard .
He believed in government control over money .
At the core of the free market is money .
At the core of Friedman ’s economics was the State .
He just wanted to make the State more efficient .
The academic economists never mention the fact it was the expansionary policies of the Federal Reserve during the 1920 ’s that led to the collapse of the banking system in the early 1930’s .
The FED had been set up so as to prevent any such collapse , and yet that collapse was the worst collapse in American history .
Then what is the right approach ?
What do the economists say should be done ?
Give more power to the Federal Reserve System .
That is exactly what has been done over the last five months , and the academic economists cheer .
The academic economists say that things will recover .
They tell us that it will again be business as usual .
They tell us that once we get through this crisis , the American economy will boom once again .
They believe in the fascist economy .
They believe that government regulation is better than the free market .
They believe the government - run , bankruptcy - protected banks , which we now openly have , are better than private , profit - seeking institutions that are not protected by a government - created cartel called the Federal Reserve System .
They believe in fascism , and they are going to tell you that everything is fine as the fascist State extends power over every aspect of our lives .
BROKEN PROMISES , WANING FAITH
Do I see this as the end of freedom ?
No , I see it is the end of the fascist State .
The monstrosity came close to going belly - up last October .
It is on its last , tottering legs .
It has lost respect of the public .
The politicians are even convinced the banks were run by a bunch of corrupt , self - serving men , which was in fact the case .
What government - protected industry is n’t ?
But that was not why the bankers lost money .
They were lured by Alan Greenspan ’s policies of easy money and low interest rates into believing that the boom was real , and that they could leverage themselves 30 to one or 40 to one and get paid for their wisdom .
They were high - paid suckers .
The Austrian School economists warned all through the period that this was going to happen .
We were all dismissed as cranks .
As the Internet grows in its influence , alternative views can get to a minority of educated people .
The success of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in getting Austrian School economics in front of hundreds of thousands of young people , all over the world , who would never have heard about Mises or Rothbard had it not been for the World Wide Web , indicates that the foundations of the modern fascist economy are being undermined where it counts , which is in the minds of bright people who are no longer buying into the system .
In the long run , Keynes was right : the economic policies of politicians today are based on the writings of some obscure economist in the past .
Those two economists were Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes .
Their world is now toppling .
Through their disciples , they are like a pair of drunks staggering along , holding up each other .
Keynes wanted deficit spending .
Fisher wanted a banking system that would cover these deficits .
The money from the central banking system funds the Treasury , and the Treasury in turn bails out the big commercial banks — no longer nearly so big .
Everything is based on a daisy chain of digits .
Meanwhile , unemployment is rising , production is falling , fear is spreading , loss of faith is spreading , and tens of thousands of formerly highly paid specialists in finance are looking for jobs .
This is not a matter of a conspiracy ; this is a matter of the free market finally voting no against the conspirators .
There are conservatives who think that all is lost because of the conspiracy .
These are people who never did anything anyway .
They do not see that we are at the end of an era .
We are seeing the culmination of a 500 - year era .
Jacques Barzun titled his great history of this era , From Dawn to Decadence .
We are seeing what Martin Van Creveld called the fall of the state , meaning the nation - state .
These scholars agree : we are seeing the bankruptcy of every Western government that has made too many big promises to too many voters regarding free healthcare and guaranteed retirement .
All of it will collapse .
The tatters of the promises will point to the tatters of those who made the promises — politicians — and the tatters of the system that supposedly was going to guarantee delivery of the promises .
The academics still believe in the healing power of the State .
The voters still believe this , too .
But voters are catching on more rapidly than the academics that the State is running out of wiggle room .
Millions of voters have figured out that they are going to get stiffed .
They do n’t know what to do about it , but at least they understand that they really are going to get stiffed .
The academics say “ no . ”
They keep telling all of us that everything is okay , that a few more trillion - dollar deficits will solve the problem .
The doubling of the monetary base in 2009 will have no more disruptive effects than the doubling of the monetary base did in the second half of 2008 .
They tell us all this , but the public is either oblivious , or else is growing suspicious .
We will have another round or two of centralized government , and probably more than one or two rounds of increased monetary expansion .
But what we will not have is a restoration of anything resembling the financial world that existed prior to September 2008 .
That world is gone .
The insiders will not get it back .
They may get an imitation of it , based on fiat money that does not buy very much , but they will not see the world of 2007 restored .
The power base of the modern fascist State is unraveling rapidly .
This is why it is important for you to preserve your assets by not believing the official assurances .
Put your money where the experts tell you that you should not put your money .
You should take your money out of those segments of the economy into which the experts say you should put your money , and will soon boom .
They have ignored the fact that the stock market has been a losing case since March of 2000 .
They would not admit it then ; they will not admit it now .
Anybody who bought and held a portfolio of indexed American stocks in March of 2000 has lost well over half of his money .
Investors will learn , even though academic economists will not .
CONCLUSION
What I am saying is this : this time it ’s different .
This time , the fractional reserve banking system has shot its wad .
It is begging for ever - larger handouts from the Treasury Department , which needs central bank fiat money to bail out the economy .
The public is accepting this grudgingly , and the academic economists are cheering , but the reality is this : this time it ’s different .
You had better adjust your portfolio , your career plans , and your retirement plans accordingly .

Upon Brigitte 's return , the woman immediately said to her ( paraphrasing ) , " This is probably inappropriate and he [ gestures to husband ] thinks I 'm crazy , but I 'm sure I saw him [ gestures to John ] put something in your drink while you were gone . "
Brigitte confronted John and then left the bar ; the woman went after her to make sure she was okay .
When they returned , Brigitte told John the date was over while the woman stood beside her and nodded supportively .
John yelled at the woman for getting involved and at Brigitte for ditching him and believing the woman , then John eventually left .
At that point , the scenario was revealed to the woman , and she was asked why she decided to help .
She burst into tears , and said she did it because she hoped someone would have done the same for her .
The camera panned to Brigitte , who was also crying .
The women embraced each other tightly .
The reporter said , " Why are you crying ?
You 're an actress ! "
Brigitte , the real woman , had had her drink spiked two years earlier — and no one had told her until it was too late .

So , has a recurring hidden camera segment called " What would you do ? " in which actors stage various scenes and people 's reactions are filmed without their knowledge and broadcast so we can allfeel morally superior to reprobates who majorly fail the test and allow people to step in dogshit or get ripped off by a conman or fall victim to whatever other scenario the producers have cooked up .
This morning 's " What would you do ? " positioned a man ( " John " ) and a woman ( " Brigitte " ) at a bar in the late afternoon , pretending to be on a date , with John putting a powder into Brigitte 's drink when she went to the bathroom .
First up were two guys , who were sitting just on the other side of Brigitte and had their faces blurred , which was n't a good sign .
When she got up to go to the bathroom , John engaged the two men and they did a little male bonding over Brigitte being hot and " a handful . "
The two guys watched as John poured the powder into her drink .
They said nothing to discourage him .
When Brigitte returned , they said nothing to her — even when she took a drink of the now - contaminated wine .
Then John got up to go to the bathroom .
They still said nothing .
While he was gone , Brigitte said she started to feel ill .
They still said nothing .
John suggested they go back to his place and relax in the pool .
They still said nothing .
She agreed , got up , and left with him .
They said nothing .
By the next day , usually after the boy has done something stupid , all bets are off on whether the relationship was ever meant to be .
Yelling , screaming , and a blatant rejection of the boy 's physical advance are telltale signs that there is “ trouble in paradise . ”
Unfortunately , it seems the United States is playing the part of the boy in a similar scenario with its economic partners .
It is no secret that the Federal Reserve and / or the Treasury Department has printed or committed over $ 12 trillion to “ stimulate ” the economy .
Of course , no one should expect that the government is done with its spending binge .
All signs point to more massive expenditures , albeit in more creative ways , in the future .
Janet Yellen , president of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member of the U.S. central bank 's policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2009 , told the Forecasters Club of New York , “ I 'm convinced this is no time to relax our efforts . ”
In fact , recently , Bernanke and his central economic planners , announced that the Fed would purchase ( print money ) more than $ 1.25 trillion in government bonds and mortgage backed securities – all in an effort to lower interest rates further , unfreeze credit markets , and get Americans to spend like drunken sailors again .
Naturally , the Keynesian 's believe this is the award winning recipe to produce a prosperous economy .
Apparently , they have not been paying attention to the world economy since the 1930s .
But , some folks have been paying attention to that economy for the last eighty years or so and know that the answer to solving our current crisis is not more of the same Keynesian policies that got us into this mess .
Ironically , some of these folks know more than our policymakers even though they come from traditionally command economy societies .
Take Czech Prime Minister and current European Union president , Mirek Topolanek for instance .
Last week , at an EU gathering he characterized U.S. government economic plans as “ a road to hell ” claiming that Washington 's massive stimulus packages and banking bailouts “ will undermine the liquidity of the global financial market . ”
According to Topolanek , “ We need to read the history books and the lessons of history and the biggest success of the EU is the refusal to go this way . ”
These remarks , coming from a man who use to live in a centrally planned society , speaks volumes about how Washington is pursuing the wrong course of action by attempting to spend our way out of the economic crisis .
In any event , the sharp comments of Toplanek may indicate trouble in paradise ahead for the U.S. and her European trading partners
The slights to U.S. economic policy did not stop there .
While Topolanek railed against overuse of the printing press by the Fed , the Chinese central bank proposed replacing the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency with a new monetary unit not connected to any country .
The Chinese have become very concerned about what American inflation will do to the value of their assets ( $ 800 billlion in reserves ) and they are also sick and tired of the reckless fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government in the last year but also since President Nixon closed the gold window thirty - eight years ago .
It is obvious that Uncle Sam has become addicted to the Chinese financing our never ending debts .
This was made abundantly clear when Secretary of State Clinton practically begged the Chinese government to continue buying treasury bonds on a recent trip to that country .
Make no mistake about it , the Chinese have performed the role of enabler to the U.S. government 's spending sprees for some time .
Only now have they realized the peril they put their economy in doing so .
Given Washington 's penchant for spending and Beijing 's apprehension that the plan will work to revive the economy , the relationship between the world 's two superpowers seems to be headed for a falling out – trouble in paradise .
By agreeing to accept the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency through the Bretton Woods agreements , the whole world essentially bought into a Ponzi scheme known as the U.S. government .
With authority granted by the U.S. government , the Federal Reserve Bank has always been there for us .
It has artificially lowered interest rates to keep phony booms from ending .
It has bailed out insolvent banks to protect our assets .
It has printed money and issued bonds to foreigners in order to preserve our standard of living .
Never mind that we have piled up a mountain of debt in the meantime .
Keynesians tell us that huge debts do n't matter anyway .
Tell that to our trading partners .
It might restore the peace and end the trouble in paradise .
" I will pose as Jimmy Hoffa , back from vacation .
All labor leaders will bow before me , and help me utilize the giant industrial complex to build this : The Forced Vertoconvector .
It will create millions of tiny steaming geysers that will actually lift people several inches off the ground , immobilizing them . "

WASHINGTON - The Obama administration advised federal agencies yesterday to release their records and information to the public unless foreseeable harm would result .
Attorney General Eric
Holder issued new guidelines fleshing out President Obama 's Jan. 21 order to reveal more government records to the public under the Freedom of Information Act , whenever another law does n't prohibit release .
The new standard essentially returned to one Attorney General Janet Reno issued during the Clinton administration .
It replaced a more restrictive policy imposed by the Bush administration under which the Justice Department defended any sound legal argument for withholding records .
" We are making a critical change that will restore the public 's ability to access information in a timely manner , " Holder said in a written statement .
Obama had given Holder until mid-May to issue these guidelines , but the attorney general acted much more quickly .
They came out during Sunshine Week , an annual observation by journalists and other groups to promote freedom of information .
Some open - government advocates had suggested such timing to the new administration and applauded its fast action .
" I am pleased that the attorney general has moved quickly , " said Senator Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a longtime proponent of the Freedom of Information Act .
Leahy called the new policy " a fresh and welcomed start to the new era of government responsibility . "
Holder also directed that the new standard be used to reevaluate the government 's position in some , but not all , pending lawsuits challenging prior decisions to withhold records .
He said the new guidance should be applied to those cases " if practicable when . . . there is a substantial likelihood " that would make more material public .
Many of the outstanding lawsuits challenge the Bush administration 's refusal to release the legal arguments supporting its antiterrorism tactics , such as wiretapping Americans in this country without a warrant and its detention and treatment of terror suspects .
In a handful of those pending lawsuits , while the guidelines were still being drafted , the Obama Justice Department opposed or informally rejected delays suggested by the document requesters for the very purpose of giving Obama officials time to reevaluate the government position .
With guidelines now out explicitly authorizing such review , the government position might change in some cases .
An attorney in several pending lawsuits , David Sobel , of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a digital rights advocate , was pleased by Holder 's decision to review some existing cases and said it should open more records to public view .
" Both the president and the Attorney General have now articulated an extremely pro-disclosure policy for the federal government , and that is a very positive development , " Sobel said .
" If there is really a new presumption in favor of disclosure , one would expect to see the outright reversal of many Bush - era decisions to withhold information . "

I got pissed off today .
Ok , I get easily pissed off , but that is what drives me , what keeps me going ( a topic for another post , on another day ) ..
At noon time , we were sitting in a presentation of a dude who introduces the main trends in the world and tries to explain how it influences our work .
The guy is external to our organisation , so his ignorance is forgiven .
Five seconds into the presentation , " BAF ! " , I get mad .
The first line on the first slide of the presentation , and I get mad .
It sets the tone for the rest of the two hours ( OK , I walked out after an hour , but that is besides the point ) .
The first line on the first slide stated " the digital divide " ( the indicator between the use and penetration of ICT - Information and Communication Technology - in developing versus developed countries ) becomes smaller .
Unfortunately it was the first of many points where I did not agree with the speaker and thought the whole presentation was based on a series of outdated , hollow and superficial quotes from news articles without sourced facts , a clear analysis or any interpretation .
But hey , even the worst of presentations gives people the opportunity to think .
And to discuss .
So .... let 's think and discuss ....
Let 's first really look at the digital divide and then broaden that dynamic .
This is not the digital divide itself .
It is more " why we all like to believe the digital divide is getting smaller " .
But mostly it is about honesty .
About our daily professional lives .
What can we learn out of this .
1. The Digital Divide : Bigger or smaller ?
The ITU 2009 year report just came out .
While in its summary they state the divide is ' status quo ' or ' slightly improving ' , checking their own data , it is clear you have to look really far for any sign of improvement .
In gross numbers , yes , the subscribers of Internet , mobile phones has gone up in the developing world ( and that is good ) , but not by far as quick and with as deep a penetration as in the first world .
global
Based on the IDI values , statistical methods were applied to measure the changes in ICT developments by groups of countries at different ICT levels , from 2002 to 2007 .
Although results have to be interpreted with caution , they suggest that globally the digital divide is as prevalent as before , but is slightly closing between countries with very high and low ICT levels .
" I am mad as hell ,
and I am not going to take this anymore . "
" Are they yelling in Atlanta yet ? "
In 1998 the " digital divide " in mobile phones was ( 20 % - 0 % = ) 20 % .
In 2007 ( the most recent data ) , it is ( 100.3 % - 39.2 % = ) 61.1 % .
Now prove to me the digital divide is getting smaller , hein ?
Hein ?
Hein ? ;-) How about Internet penetration ?
There the digital divide went up from 13 % to 42.6 % in 8 years .
Sure enough , we all have seen the really interesting pictures of the farmers in the bush getting SMSes with market prices etc . .
We read articles about it .
Hey I wrote and published some of them myself ...
BUT how much of that has a real and true impact ?
Still a positive balance ?
OK , so how how much of that is really having a positive impact on thescale .
Still a positive balance ?
I doubt it , but then hold whatever is left against the massive increase of hunger and poverty in the world .
The progress on the farmer SMSing his crop data disappears in the void if you compare to all the rest of the bad news .
Where did I read again that Ban - ki Moon stated we are further away from the MDGs than five years ago ?
Here is what I really have on my mind .
What really makes me mad .
The worse thing that can happen in the humanitarian world ( according to me ) is the ' make believe ' .
It is such a the self - justification and self - preservation pitfall it is not funny anymore .
We , all humanitarians alike , like to believe we make a difference , and that the world is becoming a better place tralala .
While we * have * an impact , and do save lives , and do make progress , but ... the progress is not half as much as we think it is , or like them to be , or make them believe to be .
It is not half as much as what we , humanitarians , could do .
I challenge anyone to prove me wrong .
The ITU report is the living proof of that .
Read carefully what they state in their introduction .
And HOW they say it : I have toand even then .
To me this is as much as That is ITU ..
And how far have we indulged into this make believe within the aid world ?
Within each of our own organisations ?
In our daily lives ?
How many times have we not given numbers a positive spin ?
Or not shown the negative numbers ?
Or given the negative numbers a positive explanation ?
I can somewhere understand , but not justify , why this is done towards the outside world .
But least internally , within the aid world , within our own organisations , and between me - and - myself , we should be honest .
And we hardly are .
The reality of aid work , accepting the hard facts that things are not rosy are hard to accept .
The negative spin of poverty , the fact we hardly see any impact anymore on poverty ( and the ' we ' stands for the humanitarian world as a whole ) , touches the core of our ' raison d'etre ' .
If we - aidworkers - believe we suck at what we do , we will lose motivation .
If we tell donors we suck at what we do , we will lose funding .
And suck even more .
But , hey , there is a balance between " loosing motivation " and " loosing sight of reality " .
And this is where we are today .
We have been fooling others and ourselves for so long , we started to believe our own fairy tales .
If anything , this is a plea for more openness , for more frank discussions .
For taking down the silos .
And for having the guts standing up in those useless meetings where everyone is looking at each other , knowing everyone is bullshitting , and start shouting : A quote from the movie " Network " ( which has marked many moments in my life ) .
Watch this :
Even if you are not an aidworker , do you see this applicable to your life ?
How many times have you stood up and yelled " I am as mad as hell and I am not going to take this anymore " or are you complacent with the bullshit ?
So , Hahahaha .

Long Live Aid !
PRINCETON , NJ --
The percentage of Americans who identify with some form of a Christian religion has been dropping in recent decades , and now stands at 77 % , according to an aggregate of Gallup Polls conducted in 2008 .
In 1948 , when Gallup began tracking religious identification , the percentage who were Christian was 91 % .
Christian America comprises those who in response to a basic religious identity question say they are Roman Catholic or some form of a non-Catholic Christian religion .
The latter group consists of those who identify themselves as Protestant or as Christian in some other way .
An analysis shows that it is this group of non-Catholic Christians that has , on a percentage basis , dropped the most over the decades .
As seen in the accompanying graph , the percentage of Americans identifying as Protestant or another non-Catholic Christian religion has been declining since the mid-1960s .
When Gallup began tracking religious identification , the percentage of U.S. adults identifying with some non-Catholic Christian religion was routinely in the high 60 % - low 70 % range .
The percentage fell below 60 % for the first time in 1979 , and since 2000 has been between 55 % and 57 % .
The percentage of Americans identifying as Roman Catholic has stayed within a range between 20 % and 30 % over the last 60 years .
Catholics were 22 % of the U.S. adult population in 1948 , according to Gallup 's estimates .
That percentage rose over the years and reached its high point in the 1970s and 1980s , when the U.S. population was nearly 30 % Catholic .
In the last several years , Gallup 's estimate of the percentage Catholic has been 22 % to 23 % .
The relative shrinkage of the Christian percentage of the U.S. population in recent years means that other groups by definition have expanded .
The Gallup trend data show that the most significant expansion has come among the group that does not identify with any religion , followed by a more modest expansion of those who identify with another , non-Christian , religion .
The accompanying graph shows Gallup trends since 1948 in the percentage of Americans saying they have no religious identity .
In 1948 , 2 % of Americans interviewed by Gallup volunteered that they had " no religion . "
The number stayed in that range until about 1970 .
By 1972 , Gallup had measured 5 % with " no religion . "
Gallup trends show the percentage gradually increasing since that time , with a very modest decline from an average of 8 % in the early 1990s to 6 % from 1993 - 1995 , and then some fluctuation in the late 1990s , with the percentage settling in the 9 % to 12 % range since 2002 .
( Additionally , in 2008 , an average of 3 % of Americans did not answer the question on religious identity .
Whether these people truly do not have a religious identity , or were confused or had several religious identities , is unknown . )
The group of Americans who are classified as " Other " includes the less than 1 % who are estimated to be Muslim , and small percentages who are Buddhist , Hindu , or other non-Christian religions .
The percentage of Americans classified in this Other category was near 0 % in 1948 , but was at 3 % in 1949 and was generally in the 2 % to 3 % range through the 1950s and 1960s .
It has risen in recent decades to as high as 8 % in 1997 , and is 7 % today .
Implications
The United States remains a dominantly Christian nation .
More than three - quarters of all Americans identify as Christian .
And the vast majority of those who identify with any religion say they are Christian in some form or another .
Yet , the percentage of Americans who in theory could celebrate Easter this weekend as part of their religion is down significantly from where it was 50 or 60 years ago .
There are many theoretical explanations for the increase in those with no religious identity at the expense of those identifying with a Christian religion .
Two social scientists at the National Opinion Research Corporation , Tom W. Smith and Seokho Kim , contemplating similar data from the General Social Survey in 2004 , concluded : " In sum , an array of social forces from cohort turnover , to immigration , to reduced retention rates , indicate that the Protestant share of the population will continue to shrink and they will soon lose their majority position in American society . "
The share of the population held by any religious group is based on a complex set of factors relating to internal reproduction ( births ) , in - migration ( from converts and from people moving into the country who have a particular religious identity ) , and out - migration ( people who leave the religion and people with a particular religious identity who leave the country ) .
In - migration from other countries in recent years may have helped boost the percentage of non-Christians in the population .
In -migration from Catholic Mexico and Catholic Central American countries has also , at the same time , helped keep the percentage of Catholics as high as it is .
The big shift has apparently been the out - migration of those whose parents may have identified with a specific Christian religion , but who upon growing up have become more likely to tell a survey interviewer that they have no specific religious identity .
Gallup ( and other survey researchers ) measure religious identity by asking Americans to name their religion .
It is possible that Americans who previously would have identified themselves with the religion of their upbringing now feel freer to tell a survey interviewer that they have no religious identity .
It is important to note that basic religious identification says little about the relevance of that identify to the person 's life .
Identifying with a religion does n't indicate how actively the individual practices the religion .
It does n't indicate whether the person rigorously adheres to that religion 's beliefs .
It simply states that the person has some connection to and some identity with a specific type of religion .
Data from measures of religious intensity or commitment are needed to flesh out the portrait of the ways in which Americans ' religiosity may have changed over the years .
Gallup survey data on religious identification extend back only to 1948 , about a quarter of the life of the country .
Obviously , this evidence speaks only to the recent history of religious identity in the United States .
There is no real scientific way of putting recent survey history of religious identity into a longer time frame going back much before World War II .
( Some scholars argue that , in fact , Americans were not very religious by some measures at the time of the Revolution in Colonial America . )
It is thus important to keep in mind that the trends reviewed in this analysis are only part of the portrait of the ebb and flow of religion in the United States since the nation 's founding well over two centuries ago .
Survey Methods
These results are based on aggregates of Gallup Poll surveys for each year from 1948 through 2008 .

Houston - area drivers may have to dig deep for new tolls Signs point toward more toll roads
83 miles of HOV lanes could be converted
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Houston - area drivers may have to dig deep for new tolls 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Metro officials are moving forward with plans to convert 83 miles of HOV lanes to high - occupancy toll lanes that solo drivers could pay to use .
At its monthly meeting Thursday , the Metropolitan Transit Authority ’s board of directors will consider converting 83 miles of high - occupancy vehicle lanes along the North , Northwest , Southwest , Eastex and Gulf freeways into so - called HOT lanes .
Under Metro ’s plan , which would use federal stimulus funds , vehicles with more than one passenger still could use the lanes for free , but single - occupant vehicles would pay a toll that varies by the time of day and amount of traffic congestion .
Toll rates have not been set .
Metro President and CEO Frank J. Wilson estimated the cost at between $ 40 million and $ 50 million .
In its request for federal stimulus funds earlier this year , Metro estimated the project would cost $ 70 million .
Metro is slated to receive $ 92 million in stimulus funds .
Wilson said that he learned last week in discussions with Federal Transit Administration officials that the monies cannot be spent on the North and Southeast light rail lines , as Metro had planned , because those projects have not received the FTA ’s final funding approval .
The entire HOT lanes project would take about two years , Metro officials said .
Wilson said the conversion to HOT lanes was intended to help ease congestion on the freeways lanes and improve air quality , not as a way for Metro to generate revenue .
“ What we ’re trying to do here is to make sure it ’s self - sustaining , ” he said .
“ The rates to use the lanes are set only high enough to cover operating costs of the system and are not meant to make a profit . ”
Metro would have to reach an operating agreement with the Harris County Toll Road Authorityfor the use of EZ Tags on the HOT lanes .
Jump in use expected
Metro Executive Vice President John Sedlak said roughly 36,000 vehicles use the HOV lanes daily .
“ We expect that to go up by an additional 18,000 vehicles that will use the lanes , ” he said .
Christof Spieler , a board member of the local advocacy group Citizens ’ Transportation Coalition , questioned whether the project would offer much relief from congestion along those freeways .
“ The busiest freeways also are the ones where the HOVs are the busiest already , ” he said .
Mark Burris , a researcher with the Texas Transportation Institute , agreed that some of the HOV lanes may not be able to accommodate many more vehicles .
Houston traffic , however , has become increasingly congested beyond rush - hour periods , he said .
“ During off - peaks , like at 10 in the morning and 9:30 , the main lanes are still congested , but there ’s still some room on the HOV lanes , ” Burris said .
Wilson said Metro would monitor the high occupancy lanes and close them to solo drivers , should speeds drop below 50 mph .
There are similar lanes in California , Washington , Minnesota , Florida and Colorado .
Metro ’s project would involve more miles than all of those systems combined .

This is because it is a picture being moved sideways to simulate an ocean ./

We are talking about robots that milk cows .
Dutch company Lely is introducing the Astronaut A3 robot for milking cows .
The new robot sports easier cleaning and an improved management system over older models .
Using a robot to milk cows means the farmers can get more milk as the cows can be milked 24 hours a day .
See the movie about the Astronaut A3 here or the full press release here .

I wonder how the cows feel about all this ?

This past weekend marked the 30th anniversary of the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island .
If you are old enough you may remember where you were at that time and what it was like .
I remember VERY well because I was on my way to the crippled plant near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
Our President at the time , Jimmy Carter , was also a micro-manager and a former nuclear engineer : he wanted his own eyes and ears on the scene .
Our little group eventually coalesced into the Presidental Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island , led by Dartmouth College president John Kemeny , who was also the co-author of BASIC .
The lessons of Three Mile Island have been , for the most part , forgotten .
The nuclear industry changed and improved somewhat , but the deep understanding of what went wrong was lost on the public in general and the real lessons that we could have learned as a society were , too .
The financial mess we are experiencing right now is n’t all that different from Three Mile Island .
If we ’d taken better to heart the true lessons of TMI we might not be in our present jam .
I spent a year of my life coming to understand TMI and even wrote a book about it , now long out of print .
I was there .
There was a partial nuclear core meltdown at TMI .
We all knew what that meant because , ironically , The China Syndrome , had just swept through American movie theaters six weeks before .
Years later there was a much more severe accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union .
Some people argue that TMI was actually worse than Chernobyl in terms of the actual core damage .
I do n’t know .
There ’s no doubt that Chernobyl killed a lot of people and TMI did n’t .
The difference was that TMI had a concrete containment vessel and Chernobyl had none .
Building nuclear power plants without containment vessels was insane and Chernobyl proved that .
Looking back at the accident with the benefit of knowing what it took to clean it up and what the workers found when they were finally able to send robots inside the containment , the TMI accident was very bad indeed .
There were pressure spikes during the accident that would have cracked an average containment vessel , releasing radioactive gases into the atmosphere .
Fortunately the Unit 2 containment was n’t average .
TMI - 2 was built on the final approach path to Harrisburg International Airport , a former U.S. Air Force base , and was therefore beefed - up specifically to withstand the impact of a B - 52 hitting the structure at 200 knots .
A normal containment would have been breached .
TMI was n’t caused by a computer failure but the accident was made vastly worse by an error of computer design .
Specifically , TMI - 2 had a terrible user interface .
We had a confluence of bad design decisions at TMI , some of them made by the U.S. Congress .
U.S. law specifically prohibited using computers to directly control nuclear power plants .
Men would do that and nearly all of those men would be former nuclear reactor operators from the U.S. Navy .
Computers could be used to monitor the reactor and in fact it would probably have been close to impossible to monitor it without the help of computers .
There were just too darned many valves and sensors for any team of humans to keep track of reliably , 24/7 .
So the computer ( there was one ) monitored the plant and raised an alarm if specific parameters changed .
Then a guy would flip a switch to open or close some valve , solving the problem .
Here ’s how it was supposed to work .
Something went wrong .
The computer noticed what went wrong , set off audible and visual alarms , then sent a description of the problem to a line printer in the control room .
The operator would read the print - out , check the trouble code in one of many manuals , then make the adjustment specified in the manual .
Simple , eh ?
Too simple , it turned out .
What happened at Unit 2 was a little more complex .
A cascading series of events caused the computer to notice SEVEN HUNDRED things wrong in the first few minutes of the accident .
The ONE audible alarm started ringing and stayed ringing continuously until someone turned it off as useless .
The ONE visual alarm was activated and blinked for days , indicating nothing useful at all .
The line printer queue quickly contained 700 error reports followed by several thousand error report updates and corrections .
The printer queue was almost instantly hours behind , so the operators knew they had a problem ( 700 problems actually , though they could n’t know that ) but had no idea what the problem was .
So they guessed .
Not good .
U.S. Navy reactor operators , the sort who served under Jimmy Carter in the 1950s , were selected primarily for their temperament .
This was a nuclear device , remember , so having trustworthy operators was most important .
Besides , their Navy job – as at TMI – was to follow the manual .
All knowledge was inside the book .
So knowing the book was everything .
Unfortunately knowing the book is n’t the same as knowing the reactor .
This approach was extended to most civilian U.S. reactors , where knowing the book meant passing the test on the book NOT really understanding the guts of the machine .
Civilian reactor operator training in those days was nearly all about how to pass the test , not how to operate the reactor .
So when a real accident happened the operators were n’t prepared to handle it .
Their superiors at General Public Utilities were n’t prepared to handle it , either .
Nor were the experts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
And do n’t even get me started about FEMA .
The outcome of Hurricane Katrina was no surprise to me .
Every level of command waited too long to ask for help at TMI .
Sometimes this was because they thought they were on top of the situation , but more often it was to avoid embarrassment or – in the case of General Public Utilities – to avoid hurting the stock price .
The FEMA guys were just plain stupid .
Nobody died , eventually the reactor was brought under something like control , and a lot of lessons were learned in the process .
Reactor operators learned better how their reactors worked , for one .
The NRC generally gave up the job of promoting atomic power that had been its primary calling as the old Atomic Energy Commission , for another .
Reactor control rooms everywhere were dramatically improved and line printers banished as interface devices .
And for the next 29 years we did n’t build another nuclear power plant , leaving that mainly to the French and the Japanese .
Now nuclear energy can be mighty dangerous and is not something to be messed with lightly , but another irony in this story is that nuclear power is actually pretty simple compared to many other industrial processes .
The average chemical plant or oil refinery is vastly more complex than a nuclear power plant .
The nuke plant heats water to run a steam turbine while a chemical plant can make thousands of complex products out of dozens of feedstocks .
Their process control was totally automated 30 years ago and had an amazing level safety and interlock systems .
A lot of effort was put into the management of chemical plant startup , shutdown , and maintenance .
The chemical plant control system was designed to force the highest safety .
So when manufacturing engineers from chemical plants looked at TMI , they were shocked to see the low - tech manner in which the reactors were controlled and monitored .
To the chemical engineers it looked like an accident waiting to happen .
The folks at TMI did not really know how to manage the technology of a nuclear power plant , and that led to a huge mess .
The same thing has now happened to our economy .
Congress changed the banking and mortgage lending rules without regard to their purpose .
Many firms bought derivative securities without the slightest thought to the math behind them or the risk they were incurring .
Nuclear power plants run on a chain reaction process of atomic decay .
Our government and investment community created a chain reaction of economic decay .
Chemical plants were better designed than nuclear power plants in part because Congress did not legislate how the chemical industry designed their plants .
But more importantly most chemical firms of that era had CEO ’s with engineering degrees .
They had respect for the technology and the risk of misusing it .
But that does n’t make the chemical industry blameless .
With the off - shoring of manufacturing a lot of chemical production is now being done in places where there is little respect for the dangers of technology .
The chemical industry ’s TMI was Bhopal .
There will be more Bhopal ’s coming because those companies are now being managed by bean counters , not engineers .
There is a place for nuclear power in our energy future .
I say this not as a particular nuclear advocate but as a realist .
The end of the Cold War has left us with a legacy of weapons grade nuclear materials that must be dealt with .
Thanks to the 1950s we ’re stuck with all the issues of storing this stuff no matter what Obama or any other U.S. President does .
It just makes sense to me to take this stuff that used to be bombs and degrade it into something that can no longer make bombs but , oh by the way , can power millions of homes with no CO2 emissions .
It seems like making lemonade to me .
Yes , there are other renewable power sources that are even better than nuclear , but I seriously doubt whether they will add up to enough total watts in the time available .
We ’ll need all of them .
Just as we neglected the economy for the last decade or more , we have also neglected nuclear energy .
We do n’t have a national storage system for spent fuel .
We do n’t have a spent fuel recycling process .
We do n’t have a standard national reactor design .
We add incredible costs to power plants for an amazing list of things , many of which contribute nothing .
Life does n’t get simpler , it gets more complex .
TMI led us to repudiate nuclear power as a nation – something in the long run we probably can’t afford to do .
We just have to find ways to manage technology – all technologies – more responsibly .
Sadly , we tend these days to put the wrong people in charge .
Two weeks after the murder of Moshe Yaish Nahari , the brother of Yemen 's Jewish community 's head , the country 's president Ali Abdullah Saleh pledged to build a secured Jewish ghetto in the outskirts of the capital San'a .
The new neighborhood will house the 300 Jews of the Umran province where the murder took place .
Yemen 's president has informed human rights organizations and the heads of the Jewish community in the country of his decision to allocate an area in Sana 's northern suburb for the construction of a residential neighborhood for Jews on the state 's expense .
Any family who decides to move there from Umran will receive $ 10,000 in compensation .
According to President Saleh , the Jewish neighborhood will be guarded by security forces at all hours .
Since Nahari's murder dozens of Jews in Umran have reported receiving death threats and falling victim to violent harassment in the streets of the Umran province .
A Yemeni judge on Monday ordered the man accused of murdering Nahari to go for a medical checkup to determine if he was competent to stand trial .
At the opening of the trial , lawyers for defendant Abdel Aziz Yehia Hamoud al - Abdi appealed to the judge that he was mentally unfit to stand trial and asked for a medical examination .
" Every one who knows him , knows he is insane , " lawyer Khaled al - Shalali told the court , describing the defendant as a retired pilot in the Yemeni army .

TWO QUITE DIFFERENT BOOKS on the economic crisis share the same one - word title : Meltdown .
The first is a collection of articles from The Nation -- " America 's leading progressive weekly . "
The second was written by Ludwig von Mises Institute senior fellow Thomas E. Woods Jr. , and includes a foreword by libertarian Rep. Ron Paul of Texas .
I found Meltdown II a must - read .
Writing with remarkable clarity and occasional mordant humor , Thomas Woods makes a compelling argument for a radical turn to the free market as the only way to prevent meltdowns from recurring .
Not that The Nation reporters do n't contribute a few nuggets .
For example , their general feeling that something radical should be done about the way the Federal Reserve operates -- that we should no longer be " subservient to the Fed mystique " -- is surely progressive in spirit .
But when they go on to urge that the Fed make itself subservient to " democratic discourse , " we have to remind ourselves that the term " progressive " is a code word for greater government control of the economy , which generally leads to retrogression .
As Woods says , in creating the housing bubble , the Fed was already far too subservient to pressure from Democratic congressmen like Barney Frank , mentioned favorably in Meltdown I .
At the same time Frank was disavowing " any kind of financial crisis , " Ron Paul was warning of " the long - term damage " from " the government 's interference in the housing market . "
What Paul understood , and The Nation reporters clearly do n't , is that the Fed is n't a product , as they declare , of " market ideology , " but of a very different way of thinking .
" Instead of planning the production of steel and concrete , " writes Woods , the central bank " plans money and interest rates , with consequences that necessarily reverberate throughout the economy . "
According to Austrian business - cycle theory , boom - and - bust is caused by the feckless expansion of money and credit that can come only from government intervention .
By beginning his story with the Panic of 1819 , nearly a century before the Fed was created , Woods makes it clear that government - initiated credit expansion can also occur without the Fed .
But the central bank does help systematize the process .
The Fed operates in the dark , in precisely the way any planning agency would that sets prices in the absence of a market .
When the interest rate is set too low , " malinvestment " results , eventually leading to bust .
One key difference in the case of malinvestment in housing was that the credit mania was actively supported by government - sponsored enterprises , most notably Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , underwritten by the central bank .
Some now see more regulation as the ultimate solution .
And in the abstract , certain forms of regulation might have helped .
But , Woods asks rhetorically , with George W. Bush in league with Democrats to push the " ownership society , " what regulator " would have ... dared tell the regime something other than what it obviously wanted to hear ? "
Besides , more regulation wo n't prevent boom - and - bust ; only true free - market banking can accomplish that .
Woods again : " If you believe in the free market , you cannot support the Fed , one of the most intrusive interventions into the market . "
Now , there is a truly progressive idea .
Longtime character actor Lou Perryman , a familiar face whose film credits include The Blues Brothers , Boys Don't Cry , Poltergeist , and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 was found dead Thursday in Austin , the victim of an apparent homicide .
The suspect in custody , a 26 - year - old man with no immediate connection to Perryman , turned himself in at an Austin courthouse and told officers to investigate Perryman 's address .
There the actor was discovered , reportedly the victim of multiple stab wounds .
Perryman was 67 .
If I may be allowed to comment on a personal note : Regular readers of The A.V. Club may remember an interview I conducted with Perryman and his friend Sonny Carl Davis about their work with filmmaker Eagle Pennell , a creative partnership that spawned the cult films The Whole Shootin ' Match and Last Night At The Alamo .
That interview remains a career highlight for me : Perryman especially was hilariously candid about his experience with being fed through the gears of the moviemaking machine ( you might recall that he had no qualms about calling Chuck Norris a " pussy motherfucker " ) and he was cautiously optimistic about what the future held for both he and Davis , including a possible sequel for Shootin '
Match that he was scripting and a long - in - the - planning adaptation of The Hawkline Monster .
Since our interview , Perryman had remained a somewhat avuncular presence in my life , dropping the occasional e-mail or phone call to check in and chat with me about the state of this or that , or to compliment or chide me about something I 'd written , and it goes without saying that I 'm really , really going to miss him .
I consider myself lucky to have met Lou , even in the august of his career , and to have discovered his work in the first place .
Here 's hoping that everyone else will do the same .
If you want to raise awareness of what Sys - Con are doing , please Digg this ! , also Reddit .
Updates : Since I published this post , Sys - Con published two articles aiming to defame me .
Read more about the first one , titled " Turkish Fags Living in London " in which they call me a " homosexual son of a bitch " , and the second one , titled " Turkish Web Designer Declares Death on Twitter " wherein they state that I am " said to be organizing an underground group to kill or bodily harm the company representatives " and wherein they compare me to the gunman who shot Pope John Paul II .
The Story
Yesterday , I got a Google Alert in my inbox informing me , based on a post that is being spammed into Google , that I was an author on something called Ulitzer .
The only problem was , I had no clue what Ulitzer was and I sure as hell had n't signed up as one of their authors .
Regardless , they had created a subdomain using my name ( aralbalkan.ulitzer.com , now down ) and I was listed on the site as one of their authors .
I called them up and asked for my name and content to be removed .
To their credit they removed it almost immediately .
However , I 'm not alone in this .
Ulitzer proudly proclaims that they have more than 6,000 authors .
Who are these authors ?
Apparently David Heinemeier Hansson writes for them at http://davidheinemeierhansson.ulitzer.com/, as does Tara Hunt at http://tarahunt.ulitzer.com/
( her page looks a little quiet , I 'm thinking maybe an outdated RSS URL ? - Update :
They removed Tara 's page after I tweeted the URL to it but you can still find her name in this post . ) .
From the Flash World , Peter Elst was one of their authors until he asked to have his name removed and Rich Tretola is still listed as an author ( which must make it difficult for him to find the time to also write for InsideRIA ) .
Seriously , though , wtf ?
Ulitzer and illusions of grandeur
So what is Ulitzer ?
According to the press release / blog post , " Ulitzer is designed to replace Wikipedia with Its [ sic ] three dimensional live content offerings and dynamic topic structure " .
Ah , so it 's a new , open wiki project ( in VRML perhaps ? ) to further human knowledge ?
How noble .
Umm , no , not really .
It 's apparently a " media website " with " more than 1 million original stories , contributed by more than 6,000 authors . "
Wow , that sounds like a real coup !
How did they get " more than 6,000 authors " to contribute " more than 1 million original stories ? "
In short , they did n't .
I 'd like to know exactly how many of those authors , like me , have had their names used without their permission by Ulitzer , Inc .
I 'd also like to know how Ulitzer / Sys - Con defines " original " .
According to Ulitzer , " Within the next five years , TIME Magazine , Harvard Business Review , Scientific American , Condé Nast Traveler , and Wikipedia will be replaced by Ulitzer . "
The fact that they have the audacity to even compare themselves with Wikipedia and those other well - respected publications speaks volumes towards their general level of cluelessness .
But there 's more here than a mere disconnect with reality .
Ulitzer , a Sys - Con company , appears to be a symptom of the Sys - Con business model which smells like it is built on a total lack of respect for authors and content creators and a disregard for any sort of journalistic integrity .
Rude awakenings
To illustrate , after I had twittered about Ulitzer yesterday , their CEO Fuat Kircaali called me up today on my mobile phone to ask me to explain why I was kicking up a fuss about Ulitzer on Twitter .
Speaking to him in English ( I know Turkish too but I feel more comfortable with English ) , I explained how several of us were pissed off because Ulitzer had used our names without permission .
His response was " it 's Sys - Con , Ulitzer is Sys - Con " ( which , when you think of it , does make sense in an ironic way ) .
He also told me " but we removed you " and followed it up with , " we do n't need you " .
( Apparently , content creators are a dime a dozen according to Sys - Con and are simply a commodity to be mined . )
As I went on , he interrupted me , in Turkish , to say something along the lines of " stop being a dick and talk to me in Turkish " ( I can't really translate it , because if I do , it translates literally to " stop your whoring and talk to me in Turkish " which does n't make much sense in English ) .
Anyway , I do n't take that sort of language from anyone so I promptly alerted him , in English , that our conversation was now over and hung up .
Doing some research , I realized that I should n't have expected anything more from Mr. Kircaali .
I came across this page , strangely ( and proudly ? ) posted by Sys - Con , in which he calls the woman he 's having an email coversation with , Jame Ervin , a " bitch " and asks her " Who the fuck you think you are , lady ? " .
It also appears that Sys - Con is not beyond using its editorials to smear those that it does n't like .
After their email conversation , Sys - Con 's Symbian Developer Journal News Desk posts a " news " article titled Jame Ervin of StoneFly a Crackpot ?
in which they refer to her as " this crazy woman " and insinuate that she should be fired as she " has no place in " real " corporate management " .
Sys - Con : who shall we attack today ?
And , to prove that they 're still the same company , this morning Sys - Con posted an " article " attacking Ted Patrick .
Ted is a respected member of and a long - time cornerstone of the Flash community .
The " article " attacks
Ted for his of - the - moment Twitter remarks on Ulitzer ( Ted 's Ulitzer site is still up , no doubt they did n't get round to taking it down yet : http://tedpatrick.ulitzer.com/).
In the " article " , they insinuate that Ted was drunk at the time and talking for Adobe ( he was talking for himself ) :
Because Twitter is out there under your finger tips , it makes it even more difficult to draw the line between you as the Friday night drunk private person Ted and Ted Patrick , who is in charge of Adobe 's community relations .
When I first read the article this morning , it concluded with the following paragraph , emphasis mine :
I hope Ted sobered up this morning or I should say he wakes up sober when he gets out of bed , and thinks about his late night Tweeting activity of " this company needs to die " directed to one of Adobe 's most important media partners among the Global tech media .
After I called them out on it on Twitter , they changed it to the following :
I hope Ted sobered up this morning or I should say he wakes up sober when he gets out of bed , and thinks about his late night Tweeting activity of " this company needs to die " directed to one of the most infulential [ sic ] tech media companies in North America .
Infulential [ sic ] , indeed .
I could use some far better words to describe Sys - Con right now too , Ted .
By the way , you can still see the original article if you search for it on Google ( image , below , in case it changes ) .
What Mr. Salvatore Genovese , the author of that " article " , needs to realize is that Ted is a beloved member of the Flash community as well as a valuable part of Adobe .
If anything , I agree that Ted should change his Twitter handle to something else to make it clear that his words on Twitter are his own and not Adobe's .
And his words yesterday were his own , not Adobe's , as anyone with half a brain and without a malicious agenda would plainly understand .
If Mr. Genovese believes that his vicious vitriol will harm Ted 's standing in any way at Adobe , he will be sorely disappointed because I can guarantee you that the Flash community will not put up with it .
Update :
And it gets even better : Robert Hall just discovered that Mr. Salvatore Genovese is no other than Dolce & Gabbana supermodel David Gandy .
You can't make this shit up !
( And I 'm left wondering when Sys - Con will be publishing my own personal smear " article " . )
Why are we putting up with Sys - Con ?
I 'm pretty sure Sys - Con is n't still around because of all the warm and fuzzy feelings it gets from the community ( especially not the Flash community , that 's for the sure ) .
So how are they , and their attitude , still around ?
Unfortunately , companies appear to support their business model when it fits their short - term purposes .
I know Adobe did by advertising with them for the Coldfusion Developer 's Journal and funding " them over and above advertising " as Ben Forta stated two years ago .
In short , when it suited them , Adobe did n't see anything wrong with trading a few dollars for a seemingly independent magazine .
When the dollars stopped flowing what did Sys - Con do ?
They abruptly changed the magazine to " Silverlight Developer 's Journal " .
That 's right , they did n't just stop publishing one magazine and start publishing another .
Instead , they made a horse and pony show of relaunching a magazine about a proprietary server - side technology from one company as a magazine about a proprietary client - side technology from a different company .
What reasons did Sys - Con state for doing this ?
" We have seen a rapid trend and move from ColdFusion to other emerging rich web technologies such as AJAX , Flex , and Silverlight , " said Engin Sezici of SYS - CON Media .
Oh , right , people were moving from Coldfusion to AJAX , Flex , Silverlight .
Reminds me of the time I moved from C++ to 3D Studio Max .
I have n't looked back , really , it was better than when I moved from MySQL to Flash .
And where is journalistic integrity in all this ?
Probably crying its eyes out in a corner somewhere .
It 's essential to understand that Sys - Con could not continue to exist without those companies that continue to sponsor it and its business model by funding their so - called " independent " magazines and conferences .
It also could n't continue to exist without people who , unaware of their practices , buy their magazines and attend their conferences .
So educating the public is important here and it may just be time for those companies that sponsor Sys - Con to look beyond their short - term greed and ask themselves whether aligning their companies with an entity that does n't appear to respect the rights of content creators is going to give the right message to their audience .
Is purchasing an " independent " magazine or conference worth it ?
Are you listening Adobe ?
Microsoft ?
I would love to hear of your experiences with Sys - Con and what your thoughts are on this Ulitzer mess .

And some previous articles about Sys - Con that hint that their behavior appears to be rather chronic :
The UK security firm Prevx has released details into a major botnet shutdown that netted the firm an unusual find — a command - and - control server loaded with the private details for some 160,000 individual
computers and / or persons .
Although that server has since been shut down and the appropriate authorities notified , the server 's repository of data is a first - rate example of how data from a
melting pot of sources ends up indiscriminately fused together .
The report in question comes courtesy of the Associated Press ; the private information Prevx found may or may not have been drawn from computers infected by the Zeus malware the company details in a blog report from Sunday , March 15 .
In its blog entry , Prevx describes Zeus as brand - new ; the company tracked the malware in action as it spread across a number of locations worldwide , as shown below :
Based on the fact that both the AP story and blog post make reference to a data breach at a " mid- size financial institution " ( possibly Metro City Bank ) , both seem focused on the same threat .
In many cases , breaching a personal or work PC is merely one step towards a larger prize ;
Prevx security researchers recovered login / password data to banking credentials and personally identifiable information ( PII ) for customers at the aforementioned Georgia bank as well as login / access details for state health insurance systems in Texas and a government human resources site in North Carolina .
The company states it notified appropriate authorities in all cases , including state government officials and the FBI .
As for Zeus , Prevx describes it as available for just $ 4,000 , a price which also buys you an incorporated rootkit .
The new Olympian malware has multiple tricks up its sleeve , and leverages its rootkit to do end - runs around current antivirus / antimalware solutions .
Zeus also includes what Prevx calls " advanced ' form injection capabilities , " which can be used to modify or seamlessly insert seemingly authentic requests for additional data .
Such capabilities could be used , for example , to make a banking website appear to request one 's login , password , and social security number rather than simply the login / password .
Prevx 's blog post makes the rather disheartening claim that " today no single vendor ( ourselves included ) and no single product , maybe even all security vendor and products together , will stop more than 60 % or so of modern malware . "
The number may or may not be accurate , but it 's definitely true that stories of payment processor data breaches are just one example of how customers are left wondering if they can trust the system that supposedly serves them .
Joe Stewart of SecureWorks told the AP that the threat such malware poses is growing all the time .
" The level of amateurness [ of the malware ] speaks to how widespread it is , " Stewart said .
" Literally anybody with a little bit of computer knowledge at all , if they have the criminal bent , can get access to one of these Trojans and get it out there and start stealing people 's data . "

Justice Department drops charges against ex-senator Stevens Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday April 1 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Holder releases statement The Justice Department will move to dismiss the corruption conviction it obtained last fall against former Sen .
Ted Stevens , according to a motion filed in federal court , because evidence was withheld from his defense lawyers by prosecutors .
NPR reported early Wednesday morning that Attorney General Eric Holder will order the case against the former Alaskan senator dropped rather than continue to try to defend the government 's conviction in the face of mounting criticism from the judge in the case over prosecutorial misconduct .
NPR legal affairs correspondent , Nina Totenberg reported that Holder was driven to his decision to ask for a dismissal of the corruption conviction against Stevens because he " was horrified by the failure of prosecutors to turn over all relevant materials to the defense . "
From NPR , " A jury convicted Stevens last fall of seven counts of lying on his Senate disclosure form in order to conceal $ 250,000 in gifts from an oil industry executive and other friends ...
Since then , charges of prosecutorial misconduct have delayed his sentencing and prompted defense motions for a new trial . "
Holder was also reportedly moved to drop the conviction on account of Stevens advanced age ( he is 85 ) , the fact that he is no longer a senator ( he lost his re-election bid to an eighth full term in the Senate just days after his October conviction ) .
Adds AP : " The reversal is an embarrassing black eye for the Justice Department , which won a conviction against the Alaska Republican in October and is now asking to overturn it .
" Stevens , 85 , the patriarch of Alaska politics since before statehood , lost his re-election bid in November and has been awaiting sentencing .
He was the longest serving Republican senator .
" He was convicted of seven felony counts of lying on Senate financial disclosure forms to conceal hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and home renovations from a wealthy oil contractor . "

Holder says Office of Professional Responsibility will conduct review of case
Holder statement by way of TPMuckraker :
" In connection with the post - trial litigation in United States v. Theodore F. Stevens , the Department of Justice has conducted a review of the case , including an examination of the extent of the disclosures provided to the defendant .
After careful review , I have concluded that certain information should have been provided to the defense for use at trial .
In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial .
" The Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility will conduct a thorough review of the prosecution of this matter .
This does not mean or imply that any determination has been made about the conduct of those attorneys who handled the investigation and trial of this case .
" The Department of Justice must always ensure that any case in which it is involved is handled fairly and consistent with its commitment to justice .
Under oftentimes trying conditions , the attorneys who serve in this Department live up to those principles on a daily basis .
I am proud of them and of the work they do for the American people . "

[ / caption ] Another asteroid is set to make a close approach of 79,000 km according to NASA , a distance twice that of geosynchronous orbit around the Earth .
Although the 15 - 20 metre - wide rock is not expected to cause any problems to Earth or satellites , some observers may be lucky to spot the faint light from 2009 FH as it passes .
Interestingly , this new object comes only two weeks after a larger ( 50 metre wide ) asteroid was spotted passing the Earth at a similar distance .
So it begs the question , why are we seeing so many asteroids lately ?
“ This asteroid flyby will be a good viewing opportunity for both professional and amateur astronomers , ” said Don Yeomans from the Near - Earth Object Office at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
“ The asteroid poses no risk of impact to Earth now or for the foreseeable future . ”
NASA is always very quick to point out these objects are harmless , passing the Earth at a very safe distance , often beyond the Moon ’s orbit .
However , 2009 FH will pass at a similar distance to the 50 metre - wide 2009 DD45 on March 2nd .
In this case , 2009 FH will pass through the constellation of Gemini , as bright as a 14th magnitude star .
Unfortunately there appears to be some fuzziness as to the time of observing opportunity .
SpaceWeather.com reports that the best time to observe the asteroid has already passed ( after sunset on March 17th , over North America ) , however , the NASA JPL news release states that close approach occurs at 5:17 am PST Wednesday morning .
There is little more information available .
However , check the 2009 FH ephemerides for more information .
This discovery was made by NASA ’s Near Earth Object Observation Program , known as Spaceguard , to detect and track potentially hazardous asteroids that stray close to the Earth .
It appears the Spaceguard team are getting better and better at spotting these chunks of rock .
Although it might seem there are a lot more asteroids than before , this is n’t the case , we ’re just getting better at finding them .

This is why kids having kids usually does n’t end up very well .
Stripper poles , sex caves , rum for teens , bare - chested online photos , cheerleaders on said stripper pole and Facebook photos .
Yesterday ’s news out of Bethlehem , Pa. had a 36 - year - old dad being accused of throwing a liquor bash after a December high school basketball game .
Steve Russo ’s son ( age : 17 ) was allowed to invite a few friends over to dad ’s house for a drunk - fest , according to court documents .
The kids got freakishly wasted and even say there were sex acts in Russo ’s “ cave . ”
Then Mr. Russo goes into “ party dad ” mode according to authorities .
The teens allegedly listened to Russo spin tales about his sexual exploits and drank vodka , rum and beer he gave them .
They also mingled in the basement while he played music and shouted , “ Get on that pole , ” according to a criminal complaint .
Seems like dad has n’t grown up since his high school days because there are photos of him being kissed by cheerleaders that ended up on Facebook .
And it gets better .
Russo seems to be a hot piece of ass around the Lehigh Valley .
Our investigators found Steve posing for a “ Hot Bartender of the Week ” profile for a local Web site .
In that feature , this cool dad says that he prefers sexy thongs and trips to Antigua .
The other question that caught our attention was this one :
What is the worst pick - up line you ever heard ?
â€ œCan I sign your ass with a Sharpie ?â€ 
Hmm , that ’s strange , we figured “ get on that pole ” was worse , but we ’re not a hot bartender who tells high school cheerleaders to do such things .
Sadly one of the cheerleaders was wearing her Freedom High School uniform in photos that were posted on Facebook .
A teacher was alerted , the cheerleading coach got involved and the teen was kicked off the team .
The girls said Russo did not try anything with them , but encouraged one 16 - year - old as she removed her shirt during the Dec. 12 party .
There was only one other thing the girls did in the house to help out dad .
The 14 - year - old also told police after Russo ’s 4 - year - old son — asleep upstairs during the party — wet his bed , she and another girl changed the sheets .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp BAC.N Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said the largest U.S. bank could repay the $ 45 billion of government capital it has taken by late 2009 or early 2010 , depending on the economy , according to an interview published in the Charlotte Observer .
The bank could repay the infusion now , Lewis said , if it were not maintaining higher - than - normal capital to account for the “ fragile ” state of the financial system .
He also expects the Charlotte , North Carolina - based lender to be profitable in 2009 absent an “ unexpected meltdown . ”
Lewis made his comments in an interview on Tuesday .
Five days earlier , he had said Bank of America was profitable in January and February , after the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N made similar comments .
These outlooks contributed to broad gains in U.S. stocks over the last week - and - a - half .
Some critics have called for Lewis ’ removal as a result of Bank of America ’s troubled January 1 acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co .
This led to a government bailout that included a $ 20 billion infusion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , on top of $ 25 billion earlier , and a loss - sharing agreement on $ 118 billion of assets .
Lewis became chief executive in 2001 .
In the interview , Lewis said that three years and more from now , Merrill “ will prove to be one of the best acquisitions we ’ve ever made . ”
He said the bank has made about one - fourth of a planned 35,000 job cuts related to the purchase , and expects 45 percent of overall cost savings in 2009 .
Lewis said his job status did not come up at a January board meeting .
He turns 62 next month , and said he expects to remain chief executive at least until the bank repays the government and makes $ 30 billion a year after taxes .
“ I would think that 2011 could be the year that you have a shot at doing that , ” he said .
Separately , Lewis again said there have been no talks and there is no need to nationalize Bank of America .
He declined to discuss New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s lawsuit over $ 3.62 billion of bonuses paid hurriedly in late 2008 to Merrill employees .
Merrill lost $ 15.84 billion in the fourth quarter .
Analysts on average expect 2009 profit of 50 cents per share at Bank of America , according to Reuters Estimates .
Bank of America shares closed Tuesday at $ 6.27 .
They traded at $ 33.74 before the Merrill merger was announced last September 15 , and subsequently fell as low as $ 2.53 on February 20 .

The technological advancements we continue to make , especially in sustainable innovation , never cease to amaze me – especially when they ’re as strange and weird as the green ideas featured in this post !
Could a tornado be the source of your electricity in the future ?
Will we wash our dead straight down the drain ?
Read on to learn more strange ideas that could improve the planet …
Power Our Cities With Tornadoes
A tornado generates enough energy to power a small town .
They ’re widespread and frequent these days , but no one can harness all that potential natural energy they hold .
Canadian engineer Louis Michaud solved the problem – he made his own tornado , the Atmospheric Vortex Engine .
Michaud ’s man-made tornado generates enough electricity to supply a small city and would cost less than other traditional power plants .
Will every town have its own tornado one day ?
Michaud ’s prototypes have all proved successful but no investors have expressed an interest as of yet .
Dissolving the Dead
Traditional burials raise a lot of environmental concerns – the vast amount of land required , dangers of embalming fluid , and more .
Cremation is n’t too hard on the planet if enclosed incinerators are used and a number of eco-conscience individuals are choosing green funerals and biodegradable coffins to improve the planet when they ’re gone .
A funeral director in New Hampshire would like to offer alkaline hydrolysis to his clients .

Originally developed to get rid of animal carcasses , the body is placed within a stainless - steel vat with extremely hot water and lye .
High - pressure allows the fat and tissue to dissolve , leaving a powdery bone residue as the remains .
The liquid portion of the body can be safely poured down the drain , raising ethical concerns among many .
The same process , developed in Scotland and called Resomation , is already in use in parts of Europe .
Snow Powered AC
An airport in Japan will start collecting snow in 2010 to keep the terminals cool during the hot summer months .
It sounds a bit crazy , but the small agricultural community of Funagata has been using snow technology since 1987 .
The airport ’s snow - based cooling system is expected to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 2100 tons per year .
Reusable , Erasable Paper
Even with all the digital technology we have at our fingertips , paper is one of those things we seem to inevitably waste .
It seems a big percentage of us have a need for printed , tangible information – Xerox estimates that about 40 % of the printer paper we use each day is to print out emails , web pages , and single use reference materials .
Their scientists are working on a new concept that could cut typical paper consumption at home and at the office in half – reusable paper that erases itself after 16 hours .
Carbon Sequestering Rocks
Columbia University scientists doing field work in Oman discovered a large field of carbonate materials formed by an “ interaction of carbon dioxide and a rock known as peridotite ” .
The area is located within a large desert area near a region that burns a great deal of fossil fuel .
It seems that the exposed peridotite naturally sequesters carbon in the atmosphere to create the solid material .
Peridotite can only be found on the earth ’s surface in certain areas and usually occurs in the mantle below the earth ’s crust , meaning extensive and expensive drilling and pipelines would be necessary for this to help curb emissions in the US .
( Updates with Arrington post on the Crunchpad )
Quixotic Web 2.0 personality Michael Arrington has been on a quiet quest for the past few months to create an inexpensive web tablet .
Now photos of the device , called Crunchpad , have leaked online .
Dustin Curtis , a user interface designer , posted four photos of a sweet - looking machine that could potentially compete with netbooks .
Arrington first wrote about the idea of a tablet in June last year .
He suggested a touchscreen device that would run Firefox and maybe Skype on top of a
Linux kernel .
" The machine is as thin as possible , runs low end hardware and has a single button for powering it on and off , headphone jacks , a built in camera for video , low end speakers , and a microphone , " wrote Arrington .
The Crunchpad would also have Wi -Fi , 512 MB of memory , 4 GB solid state hard drive and no keyboard .
The latest photos of the Crunchpad show that Arrington and his team may be getting closer to a finished product .
The candy - colored packaging and the Apple - like rounded edges design should be enough to draw in users .
Add to that the $ 200 price tag — if they can stick to it — and it could seal the deal for many users .
Arrington has said he ultimately wants to make the specs available under an open source license so other manufacturers can build on it .
In a post on Techcrunch Arrington said the initiative was often called " Mike 's Science Project , " that the device " can be built for less than $ 250 " and described some of the specs :
The last version had a full install of Ubuntu Linux with a custom
Webkit browser .
This version has a bottom - up linux operating system and a new version of the browser .
We also switched from Via to the Intel
Atom chip .
The total software footprint is around 100 MB total , which is a solid achievement .
Arrington did not say where in the lifecycle the project is now .
The fact that a Web 2.0 media mogul can turn into a hardware entrepreneur in mere months confirms that the time is ripe for hardware startups , as Wired.com reported recently .
The combination of easily outsourced industrial design , overseas manufacturing and accessible online distribution means that it costs surprisingly little to create a new hardware product than it did before .
Meanwhile , as with most things Arrington - related , the latest leaked photos come with their share of drama .
The photos were posted to Curtis ' blog , then taken down briefly — ostensibly at Arrington 's request — and are back online now .
In any case we have saved them for your fill of crunchy product .
Several more on on Techcrunch .
Read on for more photos of Crunchpad .
That is hardly reason to indict such funds for the next collapse .
L.T.C.M.'s had more to do with its aggressive , leveraged portfolio than with anything intrinsic to its hedge - fund form .
But it is human to look for a recurrence , and since Sept. 11 , fear of things going drastically wrong has become a national instinct .
The reason L.T.C.M. shook Wall Street was that many investment banks held the same positions that the fund did , setting the stage for chain - link losses .
But most hedge funds today neither rise nor fall in synchrony .
As my colleague Joseph Nocera observes in this issue , they invest in distinct asset types ; they are the bits of the chain without the link .
People worry about hedge funds , I think , because of a Galbraithian prejudice that easy money is bad money .
At a dinner in Palm Beach , Fla. , in March , I casually inquired of one hedge - fund steward how much he controlled .
Came the reply , " Six and a half billion dollars . "
I whistled and replied that 1 percent of $ 6.5 billion would be a decent living .
( Hedge - fund managers often charge 1 percent of assets plus a fifth of any profits . )
He smiled and held up two fingers : 2 percent .
Do the math ; this gentleman 's firm will earn , annually , $ 130 million a year for switching on the lights each morning -- $ 260 million if his fund attains a ho - hum return of 10 percent .
No wonder that the London Business School boasts a " Hedge Fund Center " and , according to a recent graduate 's informal survey , Harvard Business School sent 60 percent more of its graduates to hedge funds last year than to the much bigger mutual - fund industry .
But hedge funds are less an expression of risk - taking than of people 's aversion to risk .
Most funds deliberately try to hedge their bets ( thus the name ) by going both long and short -- that is , betting that one asset will rise while a related one falls .
They are thus designed to be less volatile than ordinary stocks , which is why they are so fashionable .
The risk is n't meltdown but mediocrity , a glimpse of which may be seen in the industry 's recently lackluster returns .
Real estate , the runner - up to hedge funds in the anxiety sweepstakes , could be another matter .
A recent Lehman Brothers report , " The Changing Landscape of the Mortgage Market , " observed that U.S. homeowners have been " very willing to increase their leverage . . . through products like IO loans and MTA ARMs . "
This refers to interest - only mortgages , and to those in which the rate begins at an alluring , below - market level but after an interim floats according to the yield on Treasury bills .
Who in his right mind would take an " IO - MTA ARM " ?
Hmmm , come to think of it , I did .
Although my bank did not describe it this way , an adjustable - rate mortgage is a bet between the bank and the homeowner .
If rates fall or remain stable , I win ; if rates rise , I lose .
Of course , if I lose , the bank might also lose .
I might , heaven forbid , default .
Why would a bank finance a home that under a conventional mortgage the borrower could not afford ?
Some computer in its vault was evidently mollified by the variability of the rate .
What makes this bet rather interesting is that millions of other people have the same kind of loan that I do .
If rates should take a sudden upturn , it is conceivable that a good many will default , in which case an instrument ( a floating - rate mortgage ) conceived to help the bank manage interest - rate risk will have resulted in increasing the bank 's losses .
The saving grace is that home loans generally are the last thing people default on .
But imagine how scary it would be if , say , businesses extended floating - rate contracts to one another -- if virtually every company were dependent on making the right calculation about how these risk - avoidance vehicles would function .

Recycable Office – Made Completely Of Cardboard
Imagine how much money you could save , if you made an office completely Â out cardboard .
Impossible ; I hear you say .
But these images say otherwise .
Yes , it is possible and it even looks really cool .
I believe it would be a perfect option for all companies that want to show their care for the nature , and the headquarters of save the nature activists .
This , light and fully recyclable office , looks good and perfectly functional .
The only thing you need to worry about is your employees bringing a lighter to work .
I would buy a good supply of fire extinguishers along with it

Tommy is an unemployed mechanic who spends most of his time in a bar ( Trees Lounge ) in a small blue collar town .
He seems to always be thinking , " If only X then I could stop drinking " .
Imagine if , on the day in early April when Jiverly Voong walked into the American Civic Association Building in Binghamton , New York , and gunned down 13 people , you read this headline in the news : " Binghamton in shock as police investigate what some critics call ' mass murder . ' "
If American newspapers , as well as the TV and radio news were to adopt that as a form , we would , of course , find it absurd .
Until proven guilty , a man with a gun may be called " a suspect , " but we know mass murder when we see it .
And yet , in one of the Bush administration 's lingering linguistic triumphs , even as information on torture programs pours out , the word " torture " has generally suffered a similar fate .
The agents of that administration , for instance , used what , in the Middle Ages , used to be known bluntly as " the water torture " -- we call it " waterboarding " -- 183 times in a single month on a single prisoner and yet the other morning I woke up to this formulation on National Public Radio 's Morning Edition : " ... harsh interrogations that some consider torture . "
And here 's how Gwen Ifill of the News Hour put it the other night : " A tough Senate report out today raised new questions about drastic interrogations of terror suspects in the Bush years . "
Or as USA Today typically had it : " Obama opened the door for possible investigation and prosecution of former Bush administration officials who authorized the ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' that critics call torture . "
Or , for that matter , the New York Times : " ... the Bush administration 's use of waterboarding and other techniques that critiques say crossed the line into torture ... "
Torture , as a word , except in documents or in the mouths of other people -- those " critics " -- has evidently lost its descriptive powers in our news world where almost any other formulation is preferred .
Often these days the word of choice is " harsh , " or even " brutal , " both substitutes for the anodyne " enhanced " in the Bush administration 's own description of the package of torture " techniques " it institutionalized and justified after the fact in those legal memos .
The phrase was , of course , meant to be law - evading , since torture is a crime , not just in international law , but in this country .
The fact is that , if you can't call something what it is , you 're going to have a tough time facing what you 've done , no less prosecuting crimes committed not quite in its name .
What we call things , the names we use , matters .
How , for instance , we imagine our past affects how we see the present and future , as Andrew Bacevich makes clear below .
It 's little wonder that Bacevich 's book , The Limits of Power , officially published in paperback today , became a bestseller .
He has a way of hacking through the verbiage of our world , always heading for reality ; he also has a way , as the Chinese used to put it , of " rectifying names " -- that is , bringing reality and naming practices back into sync .
Here , for instance , is how , at the end of Limits , he frames Washington 's consensus urge to respond to two failed wars and a failing global mission by expanding the U.S. military :
" America does n't need a bigger army .
It needs a smaller -- that is , more modest -- foreign policy , one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities .
Modesty implies giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the Cold War and then 9/11 gave rise . "
Now , let him go to work in the same fashion on our truncated " American Century " ( and catch a video of him discussing the subject as well ) .
Tom
In a recent column , the Washington Post 's Richard Cohen wrote , " What Henry Luce called ' the American Century ' is over . "
Cohen is right .
All that remains is to drive a stake through the heart of Luce 's pernicious creation , lest it come back to life .
This promises to take some doing .
When the Time - Life publisher coined his famous phrase , his intent was to prod his fellow citizens into action .
Appearing in the February 7 , 1941 issue of Life , his essay , " The American Century , " hit the newsstands at a moment when the world was in the throes of a vast crisis .
A war in Europe had gone disastrously awry .
A second almost equally dangerous conflict was unfolding in the Far East .
Aggressors were on the march .
With the fate of democracy hanging in the balance , Americans diddled .
Luce urged them to get off the dime .
More than that , he summoned them to " accept wholeheartedly our duty and our opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world ... to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence , for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit . "
Read today , Luce 's essay , with its strange mix of chauvinism , religiosity , and bombast ( " We must now undertake to be the Good Samaritan to the entire world ... " ) , does not stand up well .
Yet the phrase " American Century " stuck and has enjoyed a remarkable run .
It stands in relation to the contemporary era much as " Victorian Age " does to the nineteenth century .
In one pithy phrase , it captures ( or at least seems to capture ) the essence of some defining truth : America as alpha and omega , source of salvation and sustenance , vanguard of history , guiding spirit and inspiration for all humankind .
In its classic formulation , the central theme of the American Century has been one of righteousness overcoming evil .
The United States ( above all the U.S. military ) made that triumph possible .
When , having been given a final nudge on December 7 , 1941 , Americans finally accepted their duty to lead , they saved the world from successive diabolical totalitarianisms .
In doing so , the U.S. not only preserved the possibility of human freedom but modeled what freedom ought to look like .
Thank You , Comrades
So goes the preferred narrative of the American Century , as recounted by its celebrants .
The problems with this account are two - fold .
First , it claims for the United States excessive credit .
Second , it excludes , ignores , or trivializes matters at odds with the triumphal story - line .
The net effect is to perpetuate an array of illusions that , whatever their value in prior decades , have long since outlived their usefulness .
In short , the persistence of this self - congratulatory account deprives Americans of self - awareness , hindering our efforts to navigate the treacherous waters in which the country finds itself at present .
Bluntly , we are perpetuating a mythic version of the past that never even approximated reality and today has become downright malignant .
Although Richard Cohen may be right in declaring the American Century over , the American people -- and especially the American political class -- still remain in its thrall .
Constructing a past usable to the present requires a willingness to include much that the American Century leaves out .
For example , to the extent that the demolition of totalitarianism deserves to be seen as a prominent theme of contemporary history ( and it does ) , the primary credit for that achievement surely belongs to the Soviet Union .
When it came to defeating the Third Reich , the Soviets bore by far the preponderant burden , sustaining 65 % of all Allied deaths in World War II .
By comparison , the United States suffered 2 % of those losses , for which any American whose father or grandfather served in and survived that war should be saying :
Thank you , Comrade Stalin .
For the United States to claim credit for destroying the Wehrmacht is the equivalent of Toyota claiming credit for inventing the automobile .
We entered the game late and then shrewdly scooped up more than our fair share of the winnings .
The true " Greatest Generation " is the one that willingly expended millions of their fellow Russians while killing millions of German soldiers .
Hard on the heels of World War II came the Cold War , during which erstwhile allies became rivals .
Once again , after a decades - long struggle , the United States came out on top .
Yet in determining that outcome , the brilliance of American statesmen was far less important than the ineptitude of those who presided over the Kremlin .
Ham - handed Soviet leaders so mismanaged their empire that it eventually imploded , permanently discrediting Marxism - Leninism as a plausible alternative to liberal democratic capitalism .
The Soviet dragon managed to slay itself .
So thank you , Comrades Malenkov , Khrushchev , Brezhnev , Andropov , Chernenko , and Gorbachev .
Screwing the Pooch
What flag - wavers tend to leave out of their account of the American Century is not only the contributions of others , but the various missteps perpetrated by the United States -- missteps , it should be noted , that spawned many of the problems bedeviling us today .
The instances of folly and criminality bearing the label " made - in - Washington " may not rank up there with the Armenian genocide , the Bolshevik Revolution , the appeasement of Adolf Hitler , or the Holocaust , but they sure do n't qualify as small change .
To give them their due is necessarily to render the standard account of the American Century untenable .
Here are several examples , each one familiar , even if its implications for the problems we face today are studiously ignored :
Cuba .
In 1898 , the United States went to war with Spain for the proclaimed purpose of liberating the so - called Pearl of the Antilles .
When that brief war ended , Washington reneged on its promise .
If there actually has been an American Century , it begins here , with the U.S. government breaking a solemn commitment , while baldly insisting otherwise .
By converting Cuba into a protectorate , the United States set in motion a long train of events leading eventually to the rise of Fidel Castro , the Bay of Pigs , Operation Mongoose , the Cuban Missile Crisis , and even today 's Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
The line connecting these various developments may not be a straight one , given the many twists and turns along the way , but the dots do connect .
The Bomb .
Nuclear weapons imperil our existence .
Used on a large scale , they could destroy civilization itself .
Even now , the prospect of a lesser power like North Korea or Iran acquiring nukes sends jitters around the world .
American presidents -- Barack Obama is only the latest in a long line -- declare the abolition of these weapons to be an imperative .
What they are less inclined to acknowledge is the role the United States played in afflicting humankind with this scourge .
The United States invented the bomb .
The United States -- alone among members of the nuclear club -- actually employed it as a weapon of war .
The U.S. led the way in defining nuclear - strike capacity as the benchmark of power in the postwar world , leaving other powers like the Soviet Union , Great Britain , France , and China scrambling to catch up .
Today , the U.S. still maintains an enormous nuclear arsenal at the ready and adamantly refuses to commit itself to a no - first - use policy , even as it professes its horror at the prospect of some other nation doing as the United States itself has done .
Iran .
Extending his hand to Tehran , President Obama has invited those who govern the Islamic republic to " unclench their fists . "
Yet to a considerable degree , those clenched fists are of our own making .
For most Americans , the discovery of Iran dates from the time of the notorious hostage crisis of 1979 - 1981 when Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran , detained several dozen U.S. diplomats and military officers , and subjected the administration of Jimmy Carter to a 444 - day - long lesson in abject humiliation .
For most Iranians , the story of U.S. - Iranian relations begins somewhat earlier .
It starts in 1953 , when CIA agents collaborated with their British counterparts to overthrow the democratically - elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh and return the Shah of Iran to his throne .
The plot succeeded .
The Shah regained power .
The Americans got oil , along with a lucrative market for exporting arms .
The people of Iran pretty much got screwed .
Freedom and democracy did not prosper .
The antagonism that expressed itself in November 1979 with the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran was not entirely without cause .
Afghanistan .
President Obama has wasted little time in making the Afghanistan War his own .
Like his predecessor he vows to defeat the Taliban .
Also like his predecessor he has yet to confront the role played by the United States in creating the Taliban in the first place .
Washington once took pride in the success it enjoyed funneling arms and assistance to fundamentalist Afghans waging jihad against foreign occupiers .
During the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan , this was considered to represent the very acme of clever statecraft .
U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen caused the Soviets fits .
Yet it also fed a cancer that , in time , exacted a most grievous toll on Americans themselves -- and has U.S. forces today bogged down in a seemingly endless war .
Act of Contrition
Had the United States acted otherwise , would Cuba have evolved into a stable and prosperous democracy , a beacon of hope for the rest of Latin America ?
Would the world have avoided the blight of nuclear weapons ?
Would Iran today be an ally of the United States , a beacon of liberalism in the Islamic world , rather than a charter member of the " axis of evil ? "
Would Afghanistan be a quiet , pastoral land at peace with its neighbors ?
No one , of course , can say what might have been .
All we know for sure is that policies concocted in Washington by reputedly savvy statesmen now look exceedingly ill - advised .
What are we to make of these blunders ?
The temptation may be to avert our gaze , thereby preserving the reassuring tale of the American Century .
We should avoid that temptation and take the opposite course , acknowledging openly , freely , and unabashedly where we have gone wrong .
We should carve such acknowledgments into the face of a new monument smack in the middle of the Mall in Washington :
We blew it .
We screwed the pooch .
We caught a case of the stupids .
We got it ass - backwards .
Only through the exercise of candor might we avoid replicating such mistakes .
Indeed , we ought to apologize .
When it comes to avoiding the repetition of sin , nothing works like abject contrition .
We should , therefore , tell the people of Cuba that we are sorry for having made such a hash of U.S. - Cuban relations for so long .
President Obama should speak on our behalf in asking the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for forgiveness .
He should express our deep collective regret to Iranians and Afghans for what past U.S. interventionism has wrought .
The United States should do these things without any expectations of reciprocity .
Regardless of what U.S. officials may say or do , Castro wo n't fess up to having made his own share of mistakes .
The Japanese wo n't liken Hiroshima to Pearl Harbor and call it a wash .
Iran 's mullahs and Afghanistan 's jihadists wo n't be offering to a chastened Washington to let bygones be bygones .
No , we apologize to them , but for our own good -- to free ourselves from the accumulated conceits of the American Century and to acknowledge that the United States participated fully in the barbarism , folly , and tragedy that defines our time .
For those sins , we must hold ourselves accountable .
To solve our problems requires that we see ourselves as we really are .
And that requires shedding , once and for all , the illusions embodied in the American Century .
Andrew J. Bacevich is a professor of history and international relations at Boston University .
His most recent book , The Limits of Power : The End of American Exceptionalism , is just out in paperback .
The following passages are excerpts from Charles Kindleberger ’s book " The World in Depression . "
The Creditanstalt
Just as in May 1873 and July 1914 , with tension growing among Germany , France , and Britain , the crack , when it came , appeared in Austria .
In the early spring of 1931 , a Dutch bank wrote a polite letter to the Creditanstalt in Vienna saying that it was obliged to raise the charge on its acceptance credits from 0.25 percent a month to 0.375 percent .
It was a timorous letter , says Beyen , not a prescient one , and the bank was somewhat surprised when the Creditanstalt chose to pay off the loan rather than renew at the higher rate .
Three months later the Creditanstalt could have used the money .
The Austrian economy had been in disarray since the Treaty of St. Germain of 1920 .
Its finances had required League of Nations loan assistance , which entailed international supervision between 1922 and 1926 … Industrial capital was consumed in the postwar inflation , and financial capital in the unsuccessful bear speculation against the French franc in 1924 that produced failures of the Allgemeine Industriebank , the Austro - Polnische Bank , and the Austro - Orientbank , as well as the private Union Bank owned by one Bosel , with grave difficulties for Kolmar& Co. , Kettner , and the Brothers Nowak .
Maerz calls this episode " the opening shot of a series of bank failures culminating in the breakdown of the Creditanstalt seven years later . " …
In May 1931 losses were still at 140 million schillings , and capital at 125 million plus disclosed reserves of 40 million for a total of 165 million .
Under Austrian law , if a bank lost half its capital it had to " turn in its balance sheet , " or close down .
In an effort to rescue the Creditanstalt , the government , the National Bank , and the House of Rothschild , the last with help of the Amsterdam branch , furnished 100 million , 30 million , and 22.5 million schillings , respectively .
But the announcement of the support operation on May 11 , 1931 , started a run , partly foreign , partly Austrian …
By June 5 the credit [ for the entire country ] was exhausted and the Austrian National Bank requested another .
Still under pressure , the bank raised its discount rate to 6 percent on June 8 and 7.5 percent on June 16 .
The new credit was arranged by the BIS , by June 14 this time , but subject to the condition that the Austrian government should obtain a two - to - three year loan abroad for 150 million schillings .
At this point the French interposed the condition that the Austrian government should abandon the customs union with Germany .
The Austrian government refused , and it fell …

Virus Alarm in Switzerland Swine Flu Container Explodes on Train
When a container holding swine flu exploded on a Swiss train on Monday , it could have led to a nightmare scenario .
Luckily the virus was not the mutated swine flu that has killed around 150 people in Mexico and that has already spread to parts of Europe .

WASHINGTON , March 3 , 2009  --
The crash of a Marine fighter jet in San Diego that killed four people was " clearly avoidable " if the pilot and officers on the ground assisting him during the emergency had followed proper procedures , a Marine general said today .
As a result of a Marine Corps investigation into the F / A - 18 Hornet crash in December , 13 Marines have been disciplined , including four who were relieved of their duties .
The investigation concluded that the fighter was brought down by a rare double - engine failure , but it also found that the second engine failure could have been prevented , according to a report released today .
If checklists had been followed , the plane would have continued on course to the nearest available airstrip at Naval Air Station North Island , Calif. , instead of being redirected to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , which was further away and also took the disabled plane over heavily populated neighborhoods , the report said .
Audio recordings also released today by the Federal Aviation Administration show air traffic controllers twice offered the F / A - 18 pilot a chance to land his plane at North Island .
That airstrip was not only closer , it also offered a flight approach over open water , but the pilot continued toward Miramar .
Besides the four Marine officers who were relieved of duty for the series of bad decisions that led the malfunctioning plane to crash short of the runway at Miramar , nine other Marines have received administrative reprimands .
The plane 's pilot , who safely ejected just moments before the plane crashed , has been grounded ever since and will receive a further review to determine if he should keep his wings .
In releasing the report at a news conference in Miramar , the 3rd Marine Air Wing 's Brig .
Gen. Randolph Alles apologized to the families of people killed in the crash .
" The tragedy was clearly avoidable , " he said .
Col .
John Rupp , who presented the report , said the crash resulted from " a complex emergency that was compounded by a series of well - intentioned and incorrect decisions " by the pilot and the other officers that " ultimately led to the fuel starvation of the aircraft 's sole remaining engine . "
The missteps were compounded by a decision by maintenance staff to continue flying the plane for five months even though it had a faulty fuel transfer system .
But at the time of the crash , technical manuals did not explicitly require the grounding of aircraft that had this problem .
Since the investigation , those problems must now be fixed before an aircraft can fly again .
The tragic series of events began shortly after the F / A - 18 fighter took off from the deck of the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for a routine training flight .
At the time , the carrier was located 90 miles southwest of San Diego , off the coast of Mexico .
Five minutes into the flight , a warning light indicated low oil pressure in the right engine .
The pilot received instructions not to return to the carrier , but to head north and land his plane at North Island in San Diego .
A short time later , he shut down his right engine .
Marine investigators concluded that diverting to North Island was the right call , because returning to the carrier could have posed a greater risk , even though the twin - engine plane was now flying with only one engine .
The errors began when the pilot failed to take out his pocket checklist , even though asked to do so by an instructor pilot aboard the carrier who was going to help him go through an emergency checklist .
The instructor did not read all of the cautions on the checklist either , so when a second warning went off indicating low fuel , the pilot did not realize the checklist called for him to make a landing at the nearest available possibility .
It was the first indication that the plane was also having trouble moving fuel from its tanks to the left engine .
Although the pilot radioed back to the carrier that a second warning light had gone on , his garbled message was never heard .
A short time later , the pilot made contact with his squadron 's ready room at Miramar .
It was these operations officers who are faulted by the report " for making well - intentioned , but incorrect decisions " and who instructed the pilot to instead head toward Miramar , which they believed offered the pilot a longer runway and a familiar landing field .
The ready room duty officer who first made contact with the pilot did not mention the second warning light to senior squadron officers who took over communications with the pilot .
They based their decision to land at Miramar only on how much fuel the pilot had left and misidentifying his actual location .
Rupp called this " bad decision - making " and said , " No one understood the severity of the low fuel caution . "
Rupp said that if the officers in the ready room had consulted their checklists , they would have seen it required a plane with a low fuel warning to land immediately at the nearest available airstrip , which in this case was North Island .
Rupp also faulted the pilot for not being " emphatic " in mentioning his low fuel warning to the officers in the ready room .
The FAA recordings show the pilot was also given opportunities to head toward North Island , if needed .
Asked if he wanted a visual approach to North Island or if he had something else in mind , the pilot replied , " I 'm actually going to try to take it to Miramar if possible . "
Later , the controller is heard telling the pilot that he will keep him on a heading to Miramar that will still take him toward North Island if he wants to land there .
The pilot again indicated he wanted to head to Miramar .
The investigation determined the best and safest option was to bring the aircraft down at North Island .
As the jet approached Miramar , two more warnings indicated the left engine was not getting enough fuel .
Ultimately , the engine shut down , leaving the plane without power just three miles from the runway at Miramar .
The pilot tried to aim the plane away from houses below toward a nearby canyon and ejected " at the last possible moment " with the plane continuing its freefall , the report said .
Despite the pilot 's effort , the plane crashed 250 feet from the canyon , and plowed into three houses , killing four members of one family who were in one of the homes -- Young Mi Yoon , 36 ; her daughters Grace , 15 months , and Rachel , 2 months ; and her mother , Suk Im Kim , who was visiting from South Korea .
After the crash , the sole remaining family member , Dong Yun Yoon , said he had no hard feelings toward the pilot .
The Marine officers relieved of duties include the squadron commander , operations officer , standardization office and maintenance officer , Rep. Duncan Hunter , R - Calif. , one of a group of lawmakers who received a closed - door briefing today on the investigation , said in a statement .

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On either side of the long straight road to La Gloria scrawny horses pull ploughs across flat sandy fields , sending up clouds of dust that mingle with the early morning mist .
For the final mile , the tarmac turns to gravel as the road begins to wind on its way into the village in the southern Mexican state of Veracruz .
Here , in an unassuming little white house , lives Edgar Hernández Hernández .
A neat five - year - old with a shy smile , he might just turn out to be key to understanding why swine flu is slowly shutting down Mexico and keeping health officials around the world locked in emergency meetings .
As the number of confirmed infections rose above 100 on four continents and anxiety gripped corners of the globe thousands of miles from La Gloria - from California , where officials last night said they were investigating two deaths , to Britain , where some tour operators said they were stopping flights to Mexico , Edgar told the Guardian about the illness that laid him up in bed for a week at the end of March : " My head hurt a lot ... I could n't breathe . "
Local nurses took a swab from Edgar 's throat on 3 April and two weeks later this found its way into a batch sent to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia .
By this time the Mexican government was getting increasingly concerned about a spike in atypical and fatal flu cases .
Within hours they were informed that many of the samples tested positive for a new strain of swine flu and Edgar 's was the earliest .
The authorities have not explained why the disease 's first stop in Mexico should be a boy in La Gloria .
But the villagers , who believe they suffered the disease before Edgar , blame a huge pig farm in the area belonging to a multinational , Smithfield Foods .
" We are not doctors , but it is hard for us not to think the pig farms around here do n't have something to do with it , " says Anselma Amador .
" The flu has pig material in it and we are humans , not pigs . "
The pigs at the heart of the village 's angst live in modules around the valley in long metal buildings with large rectangular tanks attached .
The closest one to La Gloria is a few miles back down the paved road and then a couple more down a cactus - lined track , where the wind whips up dust clouds that travel across the plain .
The tank lies open , apparently unattended , a putrid odour emanating from it - which is probably why the farmer herding his goats past is wearing a mask .
Residents in La Gloria say the prevailing wind invariably blows the fetid air their way , where it gets stuck because of the hills that rise just behind the village .
The company has vehemently denied that its pigs had anything to do with the outbreak and has shown journalists around pristine installations .
The federal government has also said that it has no reason to believe there is any link .
" I think it is foolhardy to make such a link , " the Mexican health minister , José Ángel Córdova , said on Monday .
He added that the agricultural ministry had regularly tested the pigs and found nothing to indicate an association .
Córdova also insisted Edgar was the only case of swine flu in La Gloria - although residents say his illness came after weeks during which most of the village fell ill .
In February a seven - month - old baby died of pneumonia , and in early March a two - month - old died .
The parents were told both children had died of bacterial pneumonia .
Then , around 21 March , dozens of people started suffering high fevers , terrible aches and sore throats that led to trouble breathing .
Worried , Bertha Crisostomo , a local community leader , called the authorities in the city of Perote , and doctors were sent in with antibiotics and painkillers .
But still the illnesses persisted .
" Eventually we began to get better , but it was truly terrible while it lasted , " Crisostomo remembers , sitting in her living room surrounded by artificial flowers and china figurines of elephants and giraffes .
" They told us that it was just an atypical cold that was nothing to worry about , that was probably caused by the flies from the pig farms , so they sent in fumigation teams to get rid of the flies . "
Then she got ill and was out of action herself for more than a week .
The community was gradually beginning to put the illness behind them when they started seeing the outbreak of the flu that has brought Mexico City to a partial standstill , with schools and restaurants closed , and people being told to stay at home if they possibly can .
" I watch what is going on in Mexico City and we say to each other that is exactly what happened to us , " says Rosa Jimenez , as she walks down the road holding her toddler 's hand with a filthy mask around her neck .
She notes that many families in La Gloria have relatives who work in Mexico City but came back to the village for the Easter week celebrations .
" Could that be how it spread to the capital ? " she asks .
Meanwhile , there is much fear in La Gloria ; not so much that the illness will come back , but that the company will get angry at suggestions that it might have had something to do with it all .
Many people will only talk on condition of anonymity , like one man raking rubbish outside his home .
" I was ill , my wife was ill , my children , my aunt .
We were all in bed with exactly the same symptoms as we are now being told are swine flu , " he says .
" But I do n't want to speak out , because I am afraid .
This is a company with lots of power and lots of dollars .
They have always been protected by the government and there is not much we can do about it . "
Some conspiracy theorists think that Obama 's team is infested with shadowy elitists members .
Bilderbergers excite conspiracists
The highest levels of the Obama administration are infested with members of a shadowy , elitist cabal intent on installing a one - world government that subverts the will of the American people .
It sounds crazy , but that ’s what a group of very persistent conspiracy theorists insists , and they point to President Obama ’s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary , Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , as the latest piece of evidence supporting their claims .
Advertisement
It turns out that Sebelius – like top administration economists Timothy Geithner , Larry Summers and Paul Volcker , as well as leading Obama diplomats Richard Holbrooke and Dennis Ross – is a Bilderberger .
That is , she is someone who has participated in the annual invitation - only conference held by an elite international organization known as the Bilderberg group .
The group , which takes its name from the Dutch hotel where it held its first meeting in 1954 , exists solely to bring together between 100 and 150 titans of politics , finance , military , industry , academia and media from North America and Western Europe once a year to discuss world affairs .
It does n’t issue policy statements or resolutions , nor does it hold any events other than an annual meeting .
Past participants have included Margaret Thatcher , who attended the 1975 meeting at Turkey ’s Golden Dolphin Hotel , former media mogul Conrad Black , who has been to more than a dozen conferences , and Bill Clinton , Tony Blair , Condoleezza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands , King Juan Carlos of Spain and top officials of BP , IBM , Barclays and the Bank of England .
It is precisely that exclusive roster of globally influential figures that has captured the interest of an international network of conspiracists , who for decades have viewed the Bilderberg conference as a devious corporate - globalist scheme .
The fulminating is aggravated by Obama 's preference for surrounding himself with well - credentialed , well - connected , and well - traveled elites .
His personnel choices have touched a populist , even paranoid nerve among those who are convinced powerful elites and secret societies are moving the planet toward a new world order .
Their worldview , characterized by a deep and angry suspicion of the ruling class rather than any prevailing partisan or ideological affiliation , is widely articulated on overnight AM radio shows and a collection of Internet websites .
The video sharing website YouTube alone is home to thousands of Bilderberg - related videos .
“ I do n’t laugh at the people who claim that they understand the connections , but I ’ve never really spent much time tracing that through , ” said Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , a former presidential candidate whose libertarian sensibilities have made him a darling of the Bilderberg conspiracists .
“ The one thing that concerns me is that the people who surround Obama or Bush generally come from the same philosophic viewpoint and they have their organizations – they have the Trilateral Commission , the CFR [ Council on Foreign Relations ] and the Bilderbergers , and they ’ve been around a long time .
And my biggest concern is what they preach : Keynesian economics and interventionism and world planning , ” he said .
While it 's easy to dismiss the Bilder - busters as cranks , these voices have a way of making themselves heard on the margins of the debate in ways that can prove to be a real , if minor , distraction to Obama ’s political team .
Bill Clinton had trouble shaking rumors that he was behind a shady criminal syndicate operating out of the Mena airport .
George W. Bush was sometimes portrayed as the puppet of clandestine Middle Eastern oil interests .
Obama ’s selection of numerous Bilderbergers for key posts “ certainly would verify their suspicions , ” said Paul , referring to fears of the group ’s influence .
“ And I do n’t think it ’s just Obama .
Whether it ’s the Republicans or the Democrats – Goldman Sachs generally has somebody in treasury .
And the big banks generally have somebody in the Federal Reserve .
And they ’re international people , too .
And they ’re probably working very hard this weekend , with the G20 .
And they get involved in the IMF .
But that is their stated goal .
They do believe in a powerful centralized government and we believe in the opposite . ”
One popular website , “ Prison Planet , ” greeted Sebelius ’ nomination with the headline “ Obama Picks Bilderberger for Health Secretary . ”
It ’s obvious why Bilderberg is a frequent target of conspiracy theorists , who ’ve credited it with anointing aspiring presidents , selecting their running mates , creating the European Union and instigating the war in Iraq and the bombing of Serbia , among other coups .
Bilderberg meetings are closed to the press , participants are asked not to publicly discuss the proceedings and the attendee list is only occasionally released .
As a result , the group has come to be viewed as a more publicity - shy cousin to the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations – other influential international think tanks that are staples of fringe group conversation .
Unlike Bilderberg , though , those organizations have opened their proceedings to public scrutiny , maintain websites and have long listed their members .
The Bilderberg group , in a rare press release last year , laid out a benign if vague mission : creating “ a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations . ”
“ Bilderberg is a small , flexible , informal and off - the - record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced , ” read the press release , which noted that a list of participants would be available by phone request between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on the second and third days of the conference .
The Bilderberg conspiracists first pounced on the Obama connection during the 2008 campaign , when news leaked in May that the candidate , who at the time was closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination , had initially tapped former Fannie Mae chairman Jim Johnson , a top Bilderberger , to help him select a running mate .
IRS filings show that Johnson as recently as 2006 was the treasurer of a non-profit group called American Friends of Bilderberg .
The group has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to pay for meetings -- including $ 125,000 in total contributions from Bilderberg stalwarts Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller in 2005 and 2006 plus $ 25,000 in 2005 from the Washington Post , whose chairman Don Graham has attended in the past .
Johnson did not return a message inquiring about his role at Bilderberg .
“ The news further puts to rest any delusions that Bilderberg is a mere talking shop where no decisions are made , ” reported Prison Planet .
“ It also ridicules once again any notion that an Obama presidency would bring ‘ change ’ to the status quo of America being ruled by an unelected corporate and military - industrial complex elite . ”
One month later , in June , Johnson was joined at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting by Geithner , Holbrooke , Summers and Ross , as well as Obama ’s first choice for HHS secretary , Tom Daschle , and Sebelius , who at the time was included on some short lists of prospective Obama running mates and who also attended the 2007 meeting in Istanbul , Turkey .
According to the Bilderberg press release , the meeting was designed to “ deal mainly with a nuclear free world , cyber terrorism , Africa , Russia , finance , protectionism , US - EU relations , Afghanistan and Pakistan , Islam and Iran . ”
Approximately two - thirds of the 140 expected attendees came from Europe , according to the release , and the rest from North America .
Had the meeting been held outside the United States , that might have been the end of the Obama angle .
But the conference , which took place from June 5 through 8 , was held at a heavily guarded hotel in Chantilly , Va. in suburban Washington — coincidentally overlapping with an Obama campaign event in the area .
While Obama ’s schedule indicated he was to fly home to Chicago for the weekend — and journalists were herded on a campaign plane under the impression they were headed there along with Obama — the future president slipped away for a private meetings and never actually boarded the flight .
As it turned out , Obama secretly met that evening with Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington , D.C. , but not before raising alarms among the Bilder - busters , who were convinced something was rotten in Chantilly .
Prison Planet connected the dots and concluded Obama and Clinton met at the Bilderberg meeting , declaring that “ the complete failure of the mainstream media to report on the fact , once again betrays the super - secretive nature and influential reputation that the 54 - year - old organization still maintains . ”
“ It is now seems increasingly likely that the secret meetings with Bilderberg this weekend will herald the decision to name Hillary Clinton as Obama 's VP candidate , ” predicted a sister site , Infowars.net .
Even the snarky D.C. - based Wonkette blog weighed in , half - seriously positing that “ really , it sounds like ” Obama and Clinton rendezvoused “ at that creepy Bilderberg Group meeting , which is happening now , and which is so secret that nobody will admit they ’re going , even though everybody who is anybody goes to Bilderberg . ”
Curiously , though , the episode was n’t the first time a Bilderberg meeting intersected with vice presidential selection machinations .
In 2004 , both Time magazine and the New York Times noted that then - Sen .
John Edwards ( D - N.C ) had impressed Bilderbergers at that year ’s conference in Stresa , Italy — roughly one month prior to his selection as Sen.
John Kerry ’s ( D - Mass . ) running mate -- when Edwards debated Republican Ralph Reed .
Then , as in 2008 , Jim Johnson led the vice presidential vetting .
Time reported that then - Sen. Jon Corzine ( D - N.J. ) and Holbrooke attended and called Kerry “ with rave reviews ” about Edwards ' debate skills .
In its tick - tock of the vice - presidential selection process , the New York Times also noted the Bilderberg effect .
'' His performance at Bilderberg was important , '' a friend of Kerry told the Times .
'' He reported back directly to Kerry .
There were other reports on his performance .
Whether they reported directly or indirectly , I have no doubt the word got back to Mr. Kerry about how well he did . ''
An attendee of the 2004 meeting dismissed the notion that Edwards ’ Bilderberg performance helped land him on the Democratic ticket .
“ It was n’t because of his performance at the meeting – he was at the meeting because he was going to get picked ” said the attendee , who did not want to be identified breaching Bilderberg ’s off - the - record rule .
“ He was there as a surrogate for Kerry ” and to boost his foreign policy bona fides , said the attendee .
Either way , the attendee contended , the Bilderberg conspiracy theories do n’t make sense on their face , if only because the wide array of ideologies represented would make it difficult to reach consensus .
“ There were so many different people there with so many different viewpoints that it belied the opportunity to really conspire , because obviously a Kissinger and a [ prominent neoconservative Richard ]
Perle are going to come down in a very different place than say a Holbrooke or a Johnson , ” the attendee said .
Besides , the attendee observed , it ’s almost impossible to name a Bilderberger - free Cabinet .
“ You ’d be hard pressed to find an administration that has n’t reached into those ranks into the last 20 , 30 , 40 years . “
U.S. opposes ' harm reduction '
From the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna : Germany and other European countries could not convince others to include the contentious term " harm reduction " in the text , which refers to a variety of measures such as drug substitution and needle exchange programmes , or providing rooms where addicts can safely inject drugs .
After the text was adopted by consensus , the German ambassador said his country and a group of 25 mostly European countries would interpret the term " related support services " to mean harm reduction .
His statement drew criticism from Cuba , Russia , Pakistan , the United States and others .
The US was opposed to the term " harm reduction " as it includes measures that would make the government seem to condone drug use , US diplomats explained earlier .
However , Washington was not opposed to specific programmes such as needle exchange , they said .
" The document means what it says , " the US Assistant Secretary of State David Johnson said .
Some 80 countries currently implement harm reduction policies .

Many of Britain 's biggest companies are preparing year - end accounts that show their pension schemes moved into surplus last year despite the collapse in world markets , which wiped hundreds of billions from their assets .
The latest figures from the pensions advisers Aon Consulting show that a steep decline in the FTSE 100 over last year and a sharp drop in commercial property values has sent most final - salary schemes into crisis and pushed fund deficits to new lows .
According to government figures , company pension fund deficits rose in the 12 months to November from £ 58bn to £ 155bn .
Aon Consulting warned that the figures underestimated the problem and pension funds had suffered a £ 226bn loss on their investments in the year to October .
However , accounting rules - which critics argue distort company pension scheme fund values - will show a rise in assets .
For the top 200 companies in Britain , that will mean a £ 13 bn surplus at the end of 2008 .
Aon says the top 100 firms have seen a £ 5 bn improvement over the last year , based on current accounting rules .
Auditors must calculate deficits using the IAS19 accounting method , which assumes pension funds are invested entirely in corporate bonds and ties the value of the fund to current bond yields .
Calculations under IAS19 put pension deficits at £ 2bn in December 2007 .
Figures from
Aon show that a subsequent rise in bond yields turned that small deficit into a surplus of £ 3bn .
Marcus Hurd , of Aon , said when bond yields were low IAS19 exaggerated deficits , but now it was hiding them .
In 2007 , yields were 5.75 % whereas last November they stood at 6.8 % .
He said that while a handful of schemes were heavily invested in corporate bonds , most had a mix of assets and tended to rely heavily on stockmarket investments .
" They will be invested in stocks and shares , commercial property and bonds , which have all gone down in value , but the accounting rule says it is only the bond yield that counts . "
In the battle over the future of company pension schemes , it is expected unions will use IAS19 to argue that employers must honour existing commitments because the accounting figures show schemes remain in a healthy state .
Union leaders have already fought several high - profile disputes over cuts in pension benefits and in most cases forced employers to backtrack .
In May , workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery went on strike to keep its final - salary pension scheme open to existing members and new entrants .
Final - salary schemes typically promise to pay a retirement income worth two - thirds of a worker 's last wage slip after 40 years of employment .
About 80 % of schemes in the UK are closed to new entrants .
Unions fear employers are planning to close the remainder and may halt accruals for existing staff .
Hurd said employers and scheme trustees were well aware that the underlying assets in their funds had collapsed in value .
In a report last month Aon said companies could be forced to pay up to £ 45 bn a year for the next five years into their final - salary pension schemes to make up for the £ 226bn loss this year on their investments .
The Obama administration wants to reduce oil consumption , increase renewable energy supplies and cut carbon dioxide emissions in the most ambitious transformation of energy policy in a generation .
But the world ’s oil giants are not convinced that it will work .
Even as Washington goes into a frenzy over energy , many of the oil companies are staying on the sidelines , balking at investing in new technologies favored by the president , or even straying from commitments they had already made .
Royal Dutch
Shell said last month that it would freeze its research and investments in wind , solar and hydrogen power , and focus its alternative energy efforts on biofuels .
The company had already sold much of its solar business and pulled out of a project last year to build the largest offshore wind farm , near London .
BP , a company that has spent nine years saying it was moving “ beyond petroleum , ” has been getting back to petroleum since 2007 , paring back its renewable program .
And American oil companies , which all along have been more skeptical of alternative energy than their European counterparts , are studiously ignoring the new messages coming from Washington .
An Essay by Timothy McVeigh
As you read the essay , understand why I have always felt that McVeigh lit the fuse , but is not guilty of a crime .
At this past weekends Jubilation 98 , I met James Nichols and Bob Papovich { Freedom 's End} .
While speaking with Bob , and he , having glanced at my writings on the subject Oklahoma City Bombing , wondered why I could say that McVeigh lit the fuse , but was NOT GUILTY .
Quite simply , the answer lies in each of our respective states of mind with regard to our relationship with the US government .
McVeigh had determined that he was at war with the US government .
I can empathizes with his feelings , for I judge my circumstance to be the same .
It is only those who have not come to the point of that recognition that have difficulty in understanding this perspective .

Media Bypass Editor 's note : Timothy McVeigh , sentenced to death for his role in the April 19 , 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City , penned the following essay , dated " March 1998 , " from his cell in the administrative maximum section of the federal prison in Florence , Colo .
In a preface , McVeigh wrote " I have chosen Media Bypass as a possible forum for this piece because , frankly , I realize that it is quite provocative -- and I rather doubt that any mainstream media would touch it .
[ Note that although the enclosed is very provocative , it was written to provoke thought -- and was not written with malevolent intent . ] "
McVeigh apologized for the essay being handwritten , but noted his " current ( unique ) environment does not provide access to a typewriter , a word processor or a copier .
( hell , I 'm lucky they let me have a pen ! ) , so I hope you understand why this is being submitted handwritten -- and I hope you can overcome this shortcoming . "
McVeigh , whose interview with Media Bypass [ February 1996 ] was picked up and dissected by the New York Times and major media outlets across the nation , also expressed concerns that reporting subsequent to this essay might be " printed out of context ... but at least the original can be accurate . "
A decorated U.S. Army veteran of the Persian Gulf War , McVeigh hereby offers his contribution to the debate over U.S. policy toward Iraq , a policy that McVeigh says is marked by a " deep hypocrisy . "

An Essay on Hypocrisy
By Timothy McVeigh
The administration has said that Iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons ( " weapons of mass destruction " ) -- mainly because they have used them in the past .
Well , if that 's the standard by which these matters are decided , then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent .
The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons ( and more ) for over 40 years .
The U.S. claims that this was done for deterrent purposes during the " Cold War " with the Soviet Union .
Why , then is it invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason ( deterrence ) -- with respect to Iraq 's ( real ) war with , and the continued threat of , its neighbor Iran ?
The administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past .
We 've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons .
But , have you ever seen these pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki ?
I suggest that one study the histories of World War I , World War II and other " regional conflicts " that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of " weapons of mass destruction . "
Remember Dresden ?
How about Hanoi ?
Tripoli ?
Baghdad ?
What about the big ones -- Hiroshima and Nagasaki ?
( At these two locations , the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants -- mostly women and children -- in the blink of an eye .
Thousands more took hours , days , weeks , or months to die . )
If Saddam is such a demon , and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation , why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of " mass destruction " -- like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above ?
The truth is , the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction .
Hypocrisy when it comes to death of children ?
In Oklahoma City , it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day - care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building .
Yet when discussion shifts to Iraq , any day - care center in a government building instantly becomes " a shield . "
Think about that .
( Actually , there is a difference here .
The administration has admitted to knowledge of the presence of children in or near Iraqi government buildings , yet they still proceed with their plans to bomb -- saying that they cannot be held responsible if children die .
There is no such proof , however , that knowledge of the presence of children existed in relation to the Oklahoma City bombing . )
When considering morality and mens rea [ criminal intent ] in light of these facts , I ask :
Who are the true barbarians ?
Yet another example of this nation 's blatant hypocrisy is revealed by the polls which suggest that this nation is greatly in favor of bombing Iraq .
In this instance , the people of the nation approve of bombing government employees because they are " guilty by association " -- they are Iraqi government employees .
In regard to the bombing in Oklahoma City , however , such logic is condemned .
What motivates these seemingly contradictory positions ?
Do people think that government workers in Iraq are any less human than those in Oklahoma City ?
Do they think that Iraqis do n't have families who will grieve and mourn the loss of their loved ones ?
In this context , do people come to believe that the killing of foreigners is somehow different than the killing of Americans ?
I recently read of an arrest in New York City where possession of a mere pipe bomb was charged as possession of a " weapon of mass destruction . "
If a two pound pipe bomb is a " weapon of mass destruction , " then what do people think that a 2,000 - pound steel - encased bomb is ?
I find it ironic , to say the least , that one of the aircraft that could be used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed " The Spirit of Oklahoma . "
When a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people , this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise .
What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake .
Unfortunately , the morality of killing is not so superficial .
The truth is , the use of a truck , a plane , or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself .
These are weapons of mass destruction -- and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons .
Whether you wish to admit it or not , when you approve , morally , of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military , you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City .
The only difference is that this nation is not going to see any foreign casualties appear on the cover of Newsweek magazine .
It seems ironic and hypocritical that an act viciously condemned in Oklahoma City is now a " justified " response to a problem in a foreign land .
Then again , the history of United States policy over the last century , when examined fully , tends to exemplify hypocrisy .
When considering the use of weapons of mass destruction against Iraq as a means to an end , it would be wise to reflect on the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis .
His words are as true in the context of Olmstead as they are when they stand alone : " Our government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher .
For good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by its example . "
Sincerely
Timothy J. McVeigh

When a team of serial winners starts losing as a habit there is clearly something wrong .
Manchester United have lost as many leagues games in one week as in the previous 10 months and their supporters would feel a lot more reassured if it were not for the fact that , on both occasions , they have gone down without a great deal of dignity .
The damage may still be only superficial but it does , at the very least , inflict upon them the kind of anxieties to which they seemed immune not long ago .
Aston Villa are the next visitors to Old Trafford and , despite their own slump , the fact they have not won there for 26 years might look more of a threat than it was previously a reason for confidence .
Fulham , after all , had not beaten United at Craven Cottage since 1964 .
A week earlier Liverpool 's 4 - 1 mauling of the champions was their biggest win at Old Trafford since 1936 .
Almost inexplicably , United have gone from being trumpeted as possibly the best British side of all time to one that is handing out once - in - a - lifetime results as indiscriminately as someone chucking out breadcrumbs for the pigeons .
What we saw on Saturday , when United finished the game with nine men , looked suspiciously like a side that was struggling to cope now the pressure is close to intolerable .
OK , Paul Scholes 's red card when he handled Bobby Zamora 's goal - bound header , allowing Danny Murphy to put Fulham ahead from the penalty spot , was an instinctive reaction , something that can easily happen .
But Wayne Rooney 's sending - off came from a loss of self - control that , coupled with Cristiano Ronaldo 's tiresome histrionics , epitomised United 's lack of care and judgment .
At least Sir Alex Ferguson did not try to pass them off as the " better team " , as he had done after the humiliation against Liverpool .
But wait .
Did the most experienced manager in the business really try to argue that Phil Dowd could have let off Scholes ?
" He could have easily not given it , " Ferguson claimed in a demonstration of how football managers see the game how they want to see it and to heck with the facts .
His disclaimer was a classic .
" But it 's Phil Dowd , so what do you expect ? "
The truth was that Fulham outpassed , outscored and , for long spells , outplayed their opponents .
Their performance in the opening 45 minutes was the best , according to Hodgson , they have played under him and , almost unnoticed , the club have reached 40 points with eight games to spare .
At this rate Hodgson should be on any shortlist for manager of the season .
They certainly deserved better than for their opponents to resort to the classic cop-out of trying to blame Dowd , now fully confirmed alongside Steve Bennett and Martin Atkinson among the referees Ferguson dislikes most .
United 's manager also complained about Rooney 's second yellow card , when the forward picked up the ball and hurled it roughly in the direction , but actually a fair distance beyond , where United had a free - kick .
" Did he throw the ball in anger ?
Yes , because he wanted the game to be hurried up , " came Ferguson 's defence .
" Did he throw the ball at the ref ?
No , the ball went to where the free - kick was taken . "
Notwithstanding the fact that this was not true ( the ball went past everyone and was not even close to a United player ) , the most important question was this : was Rooney asking for trouble ?
Dowd had already flashed six yellow cards and one red as well as warning Ronaldo he was one more misplaced word away from being sent off .
Rooney 's was a fit of pique , coming only two minutes after Zoltan Gera had hooked in the second goal , and he is fortunate that the FA is unlikely to take any action over the way he left the pitch , punching the corner flag as he went .
Rooney is 23 now , not 18 .
He has been around long enough not to put himself in these situations .
In addition , there could be more problems on the horizon for United after Dimitar Berbatov , who had been replaced by Rooney at half - time , was ruled out of Bulgaria 's World Cup qualifiers against the Republic of Ireland and Cyprus with an ankle injury .
As for Ronaldo , this was one of those wearisome afternoons when he played with the soul of a pickpocket , trying to get opponents sent off , eyeballing the officials , exaggerating injuries – in short , the whole everyone - is - against - me routine .
At one point he spent so long portraying himself as the victim , repeatedly pulling up his shorts to show Dowd a scrape on his thigh , the referee demonstrated how little he cared by doing exactly the same with his own leg .
Dowd might as well have made a W for Whatever with his fingers .
Ronaldo also committed the worst tackle of the game , a scything lunge on Murphy , and at the final whistle he flounced down the tunnel without shaking the hand of a single Fulham player or bothering to applaud the away fans .
At the same time his marker , John Pantsil , was performing a one - man lap of honour .
Wayne Rooney replaces the laid - back Dimitar Berbatov .
Need we press home the point ?
Up to one third of the people killed in Gaza are children who have nowhere to run for shelter , according to UN reports .
As Israel 's soldiers and tanks have moved from farmland at Gaza 's edge into the broken - down refugee camps and towns of the territory , the child death toll has more than quadrupled .
From 60 child deaths in the first eight days of aerial bombardment , the number of children who have been killed now stands at 265 .
Eight children were killed yesterday as the overall death toll climbed to 800 in an area that is sealed off from the world by Israel 's 18 - month blockade , and is just 38 miles long and 8 miles wide .
" There is no safe space in the Gaza Strip , no safe haven , no bomb shelters and the borders are closed and the civilians have no place to flee , " the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a weekly report .
Schools , mosques and houses , where people have been sheltering , have been hit .
But Israel says Hamas is to blame and accuses the militant group of storing and mounting attacks from sites used by civilians .
" Hamas uses homes , mosques and hospitals to fire from and civilian casualties are unavoidable , " said Major Jacob Dallal , a spokesman for the military .
Israel 's military also insists that the majority of deaths have been Hamas members .
Yet Al - Mezan , a Palestinian human rights groups , which is trying to verify the UN 's casualty numbers which come from the Palestinian Ministry of Health , says the military is attacking unarmed civilians .
It says , for example , that on the morning before the ground invasion began , a father and his three sons were scavenging for wood for cooking and heating when they were hit by a missile .
Children are also dying because rescue teams and ambulances cannot retrieve them from the wreckage .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , which is also trying to verify the death toll , said that on the seventh day of aerial bombardment a 10 - year - old boy , Hamada Ibrahim Musabebeh , lost his feet after his house was shelled and he eventually died .
Despite three - hour lulls that Israel has introduced to allow aid and rescue teams to operate , many children in need of urgent attention remain trapped , says Physicians for Human Rights ( PFHR ) , an Israeli human rights group .
" It 's impossible to know how many such children are waiting for help , " PFHR 's Mary Weingarten , said .
M1029 40 - Millimeter Crowd Dispersal Round ( Area )
The M1029 Crowd Dispersal Cartridge is a direct fire , low - hazard , non shrapnel producing projectile 40 mm non-lethal cartridge effective for crowd dispersions or routing of individuals in a crowd control or civil disturbance situations and against subjects who offer violent resistance .
The M1029 round is extremely effective against individuals in a violent mindset or armed with impact or edged weapons .
It is also effective against rioters and in rescue or street clearing operations .
The 40 - millimeter crowd dispersal round delivers a strong , stunning blow to a threat 's body without penetrating it .
This round has a wide range of capabilities for tactical , law enforcement , I/R , and US military detention operations .
In crowd control , it provides a nonlethal capability that can be used to break contact and enforce a buffer zone ( standoff distance ) with a violent crowd .
Although non-lethal ammunition is designed to help control a hostile individual or crowd without serious injury or death to targeted individuals , such instances may still occur even when non-lethal munitions are properly employed .
Engaging targets at less than 10 meters greatly increase the potential lethality of this munition .
Ten meters is approximately the length of two HMMWVs .
The non-lethal 40 mm cartridge provides friendly forces with the capability to stop , confuse , disorient , or momentarily deter a potential threat without using deadly force .
Military forces use this non-lethal cartridge to apply the minimum force necessary while performing missions of crowd control and site and area security of key facilities throughout the world .
The non-lethal 40 mm cartridge is intended to be a direct fire , low hazard , non-shrapnel - producing device which will produce less than lethal trauma upon impact .
The 40 mm cartridge gives field commanders and soldiers an effective , less - than - lethal capability which will increase their flexibility in the application of force and will increase their effectiveness during military operations in war , Support Operations , and Stability Operations .
This relates to all DOD components and may have applicability to United States Coast Guard and other Federal Government and local law enforcement agencies .
The congressionally - mandated Soldier Enhancement Program ( SEP ) , whose purpose is to enhance survivability items used by the U.S.
Army soldier , is the initiative to provide this capability .
The M1029 consists of an aluminum housing , 40 mm in diameter , 4.8 inches long , that contains a non-lethal payload of 48 each , .48 caliber rubber balls .
The payload is projected to the target by the gas - generated from a primer located in the base of the cartridge .
The M1029 is loaded into the M203 grenade launcher , mounted on either the M4 carbine or M16 series rifle and is fired like any other 40 mm ammunition item .
The M1029 cannot be fired out of the MK19 series machine gun .
When this round is fired from the M203 it acts much like a large shotgun shell .
The payload spreads out from the barrel to cover an area equal to five standard E - type silhouettes standing side by side at a range of 30 meters .
Be aware of possible bounce - back if fired at a wall or hard object within 20 meters of the user .
The FY01 production contract for 50,000 rounds was awarded 22 May 2001 .
During the Insensitive Munitions Burn Test , a problem with the .38 caliber casing , recommended solutions include a case crimp or annular grooves to retain the casting .
Upon resolved solution the First Article Testing ( FAT ) will proceed .
During CY01 , the 40 mm NLCDC program obtained its Federal Hazard Classification ( FHC ) , Explosive Ordinance Disposal ( EOD ) supportability statement , created and staffed the Milestone III documentation and verification on the program 's Technical Manuals .
Tony Tufft , a boat builder , said their unusual pet has been amusing people by acting like a dog since she arrived at their home in the Charminster area of the town .
As the first week of the trial came to an end , hundreds of supporters gathered Friday evening for a Spectrial Kopimi Party at a night club in central Stockholm .
The party was thrown by the Swedish Pirate Bureau and saw live performances by several artists , a DJ set from Brokep and video art made from the movies featured in the trial .
It has been a long and exhausting week for all participants of the spectrial .
To end it in style , Pirate Bureau threw a party last night , which turned out to be a huge success .
Tickets were sold out just an hour after they started selling , and as the party got underway the optimistic kopimistic atmosphere among the participants could n’t be mistaken .
“ Right now , society is developing at a fantastic pace .
That is immensely wonderful and everyone involved is having fun .
Let us try and make it a good development , ” said Johan Allgoth of the Pirate Bureau .
The cheerful spirit was not only due to the events in the first week of the trial ( where the prosecution repeatedly failed to present any evidence ) but also down to a supply of free champagne for all pirates in attendance .
“ The Pirate Bureau operated for many years without economic resources and that was a very good way for us to work .
Lately , we ’ve had some money coming into the organization and we needed to put it to good use .
Buying champagne for great people is definitely a good way to channel our resources , paying the poor artist another way , ” Johan Allgoth told us .
Free Champagne ( cider ? ) for all the pirates
The Pirate Bureau has had a busy week in Stockholm , doing their part in the performance of the Spectrial theater .
Their headquarters have been located in the S23 K bus , parked outside the court .
From the bus they created audio visual art , published op - eds and streamed impromptu parties with everyone welcome to participate .
Anyone with an instrument could come by the bus and add their piece to a composition called “ Düsseldorf versus Bochum “ , a recording which was premiered at yesterday ’s party .
Support for the pirate movement has never been so massive as it has this week , even coming from the Stockholm police .
“ Late Wednesday night , we had some problems with the police because there had been complaints about the electrical generator outside the bus being noisy .
The situation was resolved in 2 seconds and the police actually said they support us .
Even the very people who are to uphold law and order love The Pirate Bay , does n’t that tell something about the absurdity of the trial ? ”
Allgoth said .
There was also political support for the defendants .
During yesterday ’s party The Pirate Bay was given the Freedom Prize by Swedish Moderate Party ’s youth organization .
Most importantly , however , the party offered some time to relax after hours in court , or listening to and translating the trial ’s audio streams for days .
Brokep accepts the award while TiAMO drinks some more beer
Last night , artists Ollibolli , Tobias Bernstrup and Goto80 played live .
On the walls were projections of the IRC channel so party - goers could see The Pirate Bay torrents being posted real - time .
There was also video art made of the movies whose supposed sharing is cause for the prosecution in the trial .
As evening turned into night , brokep entered the DJ booth to keep the pirates dancing .
Whether or not an anti-pirate party from the opposing side would have been successful is doubtful .
Goto80 playing his liveset
“ I do not think the anti-pirates are partying tonight , I believe they are sweating .
But we ’d welcome them with open arms here .
I think especially Henrik Pontén and Monique Wadstedt would make great additions to the party .
Some of the more aggressive copyright - coterists would n’t fit here . ”
“ There are rules on how to behave , in nightclubs as well as on the Internet , and the way some of them behave they would probably be thrown out by the bouncers from the nightclub .
And from the Internet . ”
All in all it has been an exciting week for all the spectrial followers , most of who also actively participated .
The party ( more pics ) was well deserved and turned out to be a great success .
On Tuesday the trial will continue , and we will make sure to keep you updated on the latest developments .
Madoff 's yacht was " extremely well kept " , a marshal 's spokesman said Marshals in Florida have seized the multi-million dollar Palm Beach house of disgraced US financier Bernard Madoff and his wife .
Madoff 's 55 ft ( 17 m ) yacht , named Bull , and a motor boat were seized earlier from two Florida marinas .
Last month , Madoff , 70 , pleaded guilty to all 11 charges that he masterminded a $ 50 bn ( £ 35 bn ) investment fraud .
Separately , US financial regulators accused a major feeder fund of lying to clients about the risks they faced .
Officials in Florida confirmed that the Madoff 's house in the exclusive area of the state had been entered and secured .
" We 're seizing the property as we speak , " Barry Golden of the US Marshals Service told Reuters .
Mr Golden was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the process of changing locks and conducting an inventory of the contents could take " a while " .
' Acting alone ' Bernard Madoff could be sentenced to up to 150 years in prison Earlier , regulators in Massachusetts brought civil fraud charges against the Fairfield Greenwich Group , saying company officials had been coached by Madoff on how to answer questions by federal investigators about his investment practices .
Fairfield Greenwich - which had reportedly invested some $ 7bn ( £ 5 bn ) with the disgraced financier - denied the allegations , saying it would " vigorously " contest them .
Last month , Madoff was remanded to prison until his sentencing in June .
He could be jailed for up to 150 years .
Madoff has said he acted alone in masterminding the Ponzi scheme , whereby early investors were paid off with the money injected by new clients .
A former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market , Madoff had been a player on Wall Street for more than 40 years .
While Madoff said the scheme only started in the early 1990s , prosecutors say it began in the 1980s .

This interview was conducted by Monica O’Brien ( @monicaobrien ) from Twenty Set .
As the recession looms on , more and more people are turning to social media and blogs to look for jobs .
Jamie Varon ( @jamievaron ) has generated buzz in the Twitter community with her new website called Twitter Should Hire Me , where she blogs candidly about her attempts to get a job at Twitter .
In this interview , she shares her tips on how to use social media to land the job of your dreams , even in a recession .
What kind of reception have you received since launching Twitter Should Hire Me ?
By the end of the second day that the site launched , I had received over 20,000 views .
My Twitter following count has increased by almost 40 % and I have forged relationships that I would not have otherwise had .
There have been multiple write ups about my campaign and I have been contacted by my local news and some other news outlets that I can’t discuss .
The Twitter community responded to my campaign in an overwhelmingly positive way .
They were very supportive and it spread very quickly throughout people ’s Twitter streams .
At one point , I was the 70th most retweeted person on Twitter , among the top 100 with huge influencers such as Guy Kawasaki , Chris Brogan , and Pete Cashmore .
Sometimes the hardest part of finding a job is getting that initial interview .
What steps did you take to get noticed by Twitter before starting Twitter Should Hire Me ?
I had a connection recommend me to the hiring manager for an open position .
I never heard back because the position was filled .
I dropped in on the hiring manager at Twitter HQ to introduce myself and bring in some cookies ( cheesy , I know ) .
Then , a couple days after that , I emailed the hiring manager that I met .
After not hearing anything back from any of those efforts , I decided it was time to do something a bit more extreme .
That ’s when I came up with the idea for TSHM.com .
Plus , I thought it would be fun to do something bold like that and thought it would be interesting to see the response .
How are you promoting your site and your job search ?
I promoted my site primarily through Twitter .
I thought that the strategy of getting to Twitter through Twitter would be an interesting one .
I did n’t contact any Twitter representatives directly , because I wanted the site to get to them organically .
As of right now , I am not promoting my job search anymore , because I might end up with too many things on my plate , so I ’m backing off a little bit .
However , I am adding blog posts every day to my Twitter site to now show that I have information and ideas to back up the site — and not just a good idea that attracted buzz .
You ’ve garnered amazing support for your site from the Twitter community .
Why do you think people have rallied so strongly around you ?
I think it ’s a great story about innovation in a time where a lot of people are struggling to get noticed by companies .
There ’s a sense of hope , optimism , and ambition in my message , which people are very much needing to see .
We ’ve been hit by a lot of negativity in the media lately and the message of someone continuing to believe in themselves and go for their dreams , even in the midst of this crisis , hit home for a lot of people .
There has been this sense of , “ take whatever you can get , ” and people were happy to see someone who was still keeping the hope alive .
What have you learned from the site about using social media to get a job ?
The power of social media is alive and strong .
I have learned that if you have something worth sharing , people will share it .
And , that if you genuinely want to build community , you will attract people .
I think that a main reason for my success with this site was that I had built a great community before I launched the site .
I had genuinely been using Twitter to connect with people and was n’t trying to push any agenda on them .
My biggest supporters were people that I had previously connected with on Twitter .
They really set the tone for the campaign , because they responded positively and put the word out .
In terms of getting a job using social media , I think what I ’ve learned is that people will know if you have an agenda .
Building relationships without any pretense is vital to being successful with connecting ( and then eventually maybe finding a job ) through social media .
There has to be something real there initially .
What will you do if Twitter does n’t offer you a job ?
I have three job offers doing marketing – One PT social media marketing position actually gets me into the startup industry in a big way .
This site has opened up tons of possibilities for me in marketing .
That ’s the ticket : I wanted something in the creative departments of startups .
So , I created something unique and marketed both it and myself .
No matter what experience I put on the site ( even though I am pumping a good amount of info into it ) , I have achieved what companies want : buzz .
My uncle , out of the woodwork , called me and wants to hire me as a freelancer and throw $ 5000 of marketing budget at me .
That just does n’t happen in this economy .
Furthermore , if Twitter does n’t hire me at this point , I hope to create a relationship with them and maybe the future will bring a partnership .
I know I will be in the startup industry to stay , so even if there is n’t a place for me on the Twitter team at this point , it does n’t mean there would n’t be a place for me in the future .
What advice would you give to people trying to get a job in social media ?
If you want a job in social media , prove you can utilize social media without a paycheck .
I recently was just asked to be a social media marketer for a company because I had spent the month I was unemployed building my own brand online .
I did n’t wait for a company to give me a chance to prove I was successful within social media ; I took it upon myself to let my actions speak louder than my words .
If you ca n’t build your own brand ( your blog or your Twitter , etc ) , then you ca n’t be successful in social media .
And , companies will hire the person that has proven to understand social media , rather than the person who says they do .
Following are excerpts from an interview with Kuwaiti journalist Ahmad Al - Sarraf , which aired on Al - Arabiya TV on March 20 , 2009 .
Interviewer :
Do you agree with those who label you an " extremist liberal " ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : First of all , there is no such thing as an " extremist liberal . "
There are extremist terrorists , extremist religious people , extremist racists , but extremist liberals – that 's the first time I 've heard this .
Interviewer : Have n't you heard that term used ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : No . I have n't heard it from a reliable source .
As for people who curse me using this term – this happens a lot .
Interviewer : So I 'm not the first ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : No , it happens a lot .
If my extremism serves the interests of my country and my society ...
Being an extremist liberal is a good thing .
I have never hurt anyone with my so - called " extremist liberalism . "
I have never denied anybody the right of speech .
I have never eliminated anyone .
I 've never attacked anybody , or harmed his reputation .
If that 's what being an extremist liberal means , I welcome it .
[...]
Interviewer :
Do you think there are terrorists writing in the Kuwaiti press ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Undoubtedly .
Interviewer :
On what grounds do you classify them as terrorists ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Inciting one group against another constitutes terrorism .
When you say that the members of a certain tribe , group , sect , or faith are not worthy of living ...
A well - known writer , or academic , gave a lecture , which was posted by MEMRI on the Internet .
He called for the killing of any journalist who attacked Hamas .
This is verbal extremism .
One says it verbally , another writes it , but they both call for the killing of anybody who writes anything against Hamas .
This is a terrorist call for murder .
I have never said things like : " Kill so - and - so , finish so - and - so off , destroy so - and - so 's business , or make so - and - so divorce his wife . "
Interviewer :
In the recent war in Gaza , you were opposed to Hamas .
Many people thought that this was an attempt to justify the Israeli aggression against Hamas , against Gaza .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Nobody justifies aggression against an innocent , defenseless people .
My problem with Hamas is that it gave Israel the pretext to carry out this treacherous aggression .
Interviewer :
So you think that Hamas bears greater responsibility than Israel ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Without a doubt , Hamas bears greater responsibility for this aggression .
At the time , there was a truce , which Hamas staunchly refused to renew .
If this [ non ] renewal had stemmed from the beliefs of Hamas or of the people ruled by Hamas , we could have lived with it .
But the fact that the decision was influenced from abroad , according to what has been said and published , makes it even more painful .
Interviewer :
What do you mean by " influence from abroad " ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : I believe that Iran was involved in the non-renewal of the truce .
They thought that the " celebration " they had in Lebanon in 2006 could be repeated in Gaza .
Interviewer : Do you mean the July war ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Yes , the 2006 war between Hizbullah and Israel .
The attack and the destruction were ultimately the influence of Iran .
Interviewer :
You consider the war in Lebanon to be a " celebration " ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
It was a tragic celebration , in which there were only losers .
I 'm sad to say that the party that caused the war is now claiming victory .
[...]
Israel has defeated us once , twice , three times , because of our backwardness .
Now , when it is killing us and making us regress even further – our schools are being destroyed , our universities are collapsing , and our poverty and disintegration are growing – we claim that we have won .
[...]
Interviewer :
Do you believe that Kuwaiti nationality will only be complete by disengaging from the Palestinian cause ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Exactly .
You must focus on your own affairs , because zero plus zero still adds up to zero .
Interviewer :
In your opinion , nobody really cares about the Palestinian cause ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : The Palestinian cause would have been better off – and this has been my view since 1967 – if it had been left up to the Palestinians .
If Africa , by way of example , had not received Western aid , which makes them lazy ...
If they had been left to their own devices , they would have made greater progress .
As long as you keep giving your son money , and helping him , and so on , his desire to work hard weakens .
[...]
The Palestinian people have been tormented and dispersed by the Arabs .
The Palestinian people have been killed by the Arabs .
If we just left them to their own devices ...
We should give them this material aid without laying down conditions .
Interviewer :
So you agree to give them aid without laying down ...
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
It 's difficult .
How can I give them 20 million without saying " do this " or " do that " ?
Interviewer :
So with regard to the rebuilding of Gaza , you believe you should give Hamas money for reconstruction .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : No , I do n't .
The inclination in the Arab League , the oil - producing countries , and the U.N. is to refrain from giving Hamas any money for reconstruction .
Interviewer :
What do you think about this ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
This corroborates my approach .
If you give aid to Hamas , you lay down your conditions , just like Iran did with Hamas and with Hizbullah in Lebanon .
The guy who puts the money in the jukebox hears the song he wants , while all the others hear his song , whether they like it or not ...
Interviewer :
Then who would you give the aid to ?
Someone must be entrusted with it .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : I say : Stop giving aid .
Every time Israel strikes , [ they say ] : " Come on , give money , construct homes , build schools , infrastructure , and streets – and then leave . "
Then we wait for the next disaster .
Then Israel strikes again , and they go : " Come on , do this and that " ...
This scenario has repeated itself for 20 or 30 years .
Somebody has to come and say : " Guys , let 's change this . "
If the Palestinians had been left to deal with their Israeli enemy on their own , they would have reached agreements and made peace a long time ago .
The problem is that we all want the Palestinians to sign an agreement with Israel according to our terms – the Saudi want them to sign an agreement according to their terms , the Egyptians want them to ... and so on .
They have not been able to reach common ground with Israel .
[...]
In my opinion , there is no such thing as a justified war .
Peace is justified .
Nothing justifies the collective killing of people .
In my opinion , what happened in Lebanon – the 2006 war – was a crime against Lebanon .
Interviewer : But it was Israel that attacked .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
No , it was n't Israel that kidnapped soldiers .
[...]
Interviewer :
You have a clear opinion about Iran and its intervention in the region .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : I have a clear opinion regarding any religious rule in politics .
My secularism rejects [ the notion ] of a religious scholar as a head of state .
This is unacceptable .
Interviewer :
You are one of the few writers in Kuwait who proclaim their secularism .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Yes .
Interviewer :
The question is whether this secularism leads you to take an anti-religious stance .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Not necessarily .
I am not against religion .
Interviewer :
So it is possible , then .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Absolutely not .
I believe that religion is a necessity for most of the nations of the world .
Everybody is free in his relations with his Lord .
There are numerous religions .
I have nothing against religion or religious thought .
I am against the practice of those who like to act as God 's representative on Earth .
They tell me how to drink , how to get married , how to enter the house , how to enter the bathroom , how to have sex , and how to get dressed .
The continuous interference in my life is what I oppose .
Interviewer :
You present yourself as a liberal , and one of the basic principles of liberalism is respecting other people 's freedom of choice .
Why do you interfere with the right of others to seek the guidance of muftis , and ask them how to dress , how to conduct their lives , how to eat or drink , as long as they made this choice ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
That 's all well and good , but the problem with this interference , and this is what has happened in our case ...
After all these years in which we kept silent about this religious interference , they have begun deciding who has the right to live , to exist .
True , at first it seems as if they are just giving you guidance on how to lead your life according to religion , but if you keep silent about this , it grows to the point that we end up with fatwas accusing people of apostasy .
[...]
There are innumerable fatwas issued by Shiites , accusing Sunnis of apostasy , and among Sunnis , accusing Shiites of apostasy .
And this is only among ourselves .
But once we reach the Buddhists and the Hindus – this is a whole different story altogether .
It 's a complete disaster .
[...]
More than 63 % of the population of Kuwait are not Kuwaitis .
It has become normal for people in Kuwait to act arrogantly toward others .
The fact that you have rights which others do not enjoy has become a norm .
As a liberal , I do not accept this .
I have lived in England and in America , and I never felt , for a single day , that they had any advantage over me , even though it was me who was working for them .
So why should I make the Lebanese , Palestinians , or Egyptians , who come to work for me , feel that I am better than them ?
[...]
Interviewer : Have you ever thought about leaving Kuwait ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Yes , more than once .
Interviewer : Why ?
After all , you say there are people [ in Kuwait ] who support your ideas , and you say that it is our homeland , and that we should defend it .
Ahmad Al - Sarraf :
That 's all very well , but this was before the [ Iraqi ] invasion and occupation , and the liberation of Kuwait .
Interviewer :
That 's when you considered emigrating ?
Ahmad Al - Sarraf : Yes .
I was in a different psychological state of mind .
My wife and I have a son with special needs , who is in need of treatment .
Unfortunately , despite all our wealth , we have been unable to open a suitable school .
In all the Arab countries – with the exception of Dubai , which opened a school for the disabled or slow learners twenty years ago – there is not one recognized school for children who are slow in learning .
[...]
We need to distance religion from our lives .
All the constitutions in the world are based on man-made law .
Interviewer :
You call for man-made law , rejecting any role for religion ...
Religion is the relation between you and your Lord , your Creator , which pertains to personal matters in life – marriage , death , divorce , and so on .
We Muslims criticize the Christians for having a formidable hierarchy in the clergy – starting with the Pope , in the case of Catholicism , or the other denominations , and including a large class of clergyman .
We are becoming the same , I 'm sad to say .
We are getting to the point where we have a hierarchy of muftis .
A child , who has just graduated from the shari 'a department and who has n't even grown a beard yet , issues fatwas , accusing people of apostasy , or excommunicating people .

Julie Myerson 's controversial book , The Lost Child , is being rushed out two months early by its publisher in order to cash in on the publicity caused by the outrage over its contents .
The work , which her publisher , Bloomsbury , had originally intended to bring out in May , deals with Myerson 's decision to lock her 17 - year - old son Jake out of the family home over his use of skunk cannabis .
After details of the book emerged last week , Jake described his mother as " insane " and " obscene " , while commentators slammed Myerson for what Minette Marrin in the Sunday Times called her " betrayal not just of love and intimacy , but also of motherhood itself " .
Bloomsbury has now announced that it will publish the book – subtitled " A True Story " – within a few days .
" Given this week 's extensive speculation about Julie Myerson 's The Lost Child , we felt that it was right to bring forward publication to allow everyone the opportunity to read her brilliant book and consider the complicated questions it raises , " it said in a statement .
" We are pleased to say that we are making the book available within a few days . "
Myerson 's narrative intertwines the stories of Mary Yelloly , an artist who died aged 21 almost two centuries ago , with discussion of events in her family 's life , and the actions of her own son .
" The circumstances are very different , but the questions remain terrifyingly the same , " runs the publisher 's description of the book .
" What happens when a child disappears from a family ?
What will survive of any of us in memory or in history ?
And how is a mother to cope when love – however absolute , however unconditional – is not enough to save her child ? "
Myerson was longlisted for the Man Booker prize for her 2003 novel , Something Might Happen .
Last year she published the crossover novel Out of Breath , about a teenage girl who falls in with a gang of runaway children fleeing reality into an imaginative world that turns out to be just as dangerous .

BEIJING , March 9 ( UPI ) -- China has tightened security in the Tibetan region as people there prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of a failed uprising against Beijing .
A police car and a fire engine were damaged when crowds threw homemade bombs during a protest Monday , The Times of London reported .
There were no reports of casualties .

Although Tibet technically is autonomous , its current government is directed from Beijing .
The Dalai Lama , Tibetan Buddhists ' spiritual and political leader , lives in exile in India .
Tuesday commemorates a failed 1959 rebellion that sent the Dalai Lama into exile .
" We have made due deployment and tightened controls at border ports , and key areas and passages along the border in Tibet , " Fu Hongyu , an official with China 's Ministry of Public Safety Border Control Department , said .
" We will firmly crack down on criminal activities in Tibet 's border area that pose a threat to China 's sovereignty and government . "
Monday 's violence occurred in western Qinghai province , China 's state - run news agency , Xinhua , reported .
The incident began when security officers stopped and searched a truck , resulting in a confrontation that drew onlookers who eventually joined the dispute , Xinhua said .
Pakistan 's status as an international sporting venue has come under doubt after masked terrorists attacked the team bus carrying Sri Lanka 's cricketers to the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore on Tuesday morning .
Five cricketers , including Mahela Jayawardene , the captain , and Kumar Sangakkara , his deputy , received minor injuries .
Ajantha Mendis , Thilan Samaraweera and Tharanga Paravitarana were also injured in the attack which killed six security men and two civilians .
The Lahore Test was quickly called off and the tour cancelled , with the Sri Lankan players evacuated from the Gaddafi stadium and taken to a nearby airbase .
The squad , including Samaraweera and Paranavitana , whose injuries were more serious , flew out in a chartered plane around 10 pm Tuesday and landed in Colombo early on Wednesday .
Samaraweera and Paranavithana went by ambulance to a private hospital in the city , a senior official said .
There have been terror strikes on the sidelines of cricket , but this is the first time players have been directly targeted .
The attack is the first major strike against an international sporting team since Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics .
In its first official reaction , the PCB said the attack was " beyond the control of the management " .
Opposition MPs said in the Pakistan government officials received specific warnings from local police that terrorists were aiming to ambush the Sri Lankan squad .
The paper reported a letter dated January 22 that said an attack was planned on the team , either at their hotel or between the hotel and the sports stadium .
However , a change of government in the Punjab province meant a meeting about the threat was not followed up .
" Intelligence reports said there might be an attack on the cricket team , " Pervez Rashid , a senior member of the sacked Punjab government , said .
" They made no appropriate security arrangements . "
The PCB 's statement is unlikely to cut much ice with other cricket bodies .
David Morgan , the president of the ICC , described Pakistan as " a very dangerous place " at present .
Speaking about the World Cup , he said : " Things will have to change dramatically in Pakistan in my opinion if any of the games are to be staged there .
I think that international cricket in Pakistan is out of the question until there is a very significant change , a regime change I guess . "
The Sri Lanka cricketers were on their way to the Gaddafi stadium when their bus was attacked by 12 armed terrorists near Liberty market , Habibur Rehman , chief commissioner of police , said .
A grenade was also thrown at the bus but it missed .
" The bus came under attack as we were driving to the stadium , the gunmen targeted the wheels of the bus first and then the bus , " Mahela Jayawardene said .
" We all dived to the floor to take cover .
About five players have been injured and also Paul Farbrace [ a member of the support staff ] … "
Describing the injuries , Sangakkara said : " Thilan [ Samaraweera ] has a shrapnel wound in his leg , but he is fine .
[ Tharanga ]
Paranavitana had shrapnel in his chest , but thank God it was n't very deep and just on the surface .
" I had shrapnel injuries in my shoulder , but they have all been removed and I 'm okay now .
Ajantha [ Mendis ] had shrapnel in his neck and scalp , but he too has had medical attention and is fine .
Everyone else is perfectly all right . "
The reserve umpire Ahsan Raza was also injured in the attack .
Nadeem Ghauri , the TV umpire , who was travelling in a bus behind the Sri Lanka team coach said the firing continued for some time .
Umpire Steve Davis , who was on the team bus , called the terrorist attack " terrible " .
" I 'm lost for words , " he said .
Speaking on Geo TV , Inzamam - ul - Haq , the former Pakistan captain , said : " This is the first time that a cricket team has been seriously targeted ...
Pakistan 's image will be hit and only time will tell how much damage has been done to Pakistan cricket .
The World Cup too might be affected ... no country would want to come now to Pakistan ...
I am worried where Pakistan will get a chance to play , not only in Pakistan but outside as well .
This is all so sad . "
In Napier , the New Zealand and Indian teams donned black arm bands midway through their one - day cricket match as a mark of respect for the Sri Lankan cricketers .
The Indian cricket board , which had called off a scheduled tour of Pakistan last December , expressed its sorrow over the attack .
" We pray for the speedy recovery of the injured cricketers , and sympathise with their families and compatriots , " BCCI Secretary N Srinivasan said in New Delhi .
Intikhab Alam , the Pakistan coach , said his team escaped the attack because " the Sri Lankan team left [ the hotel ] five minutes before us " .
The Sri Lankan team only stepped in after the Indian government had barred the Indian team from touring Pakistan after the terror attack in Mumbai .
CONCORD , NH – The Senate voted today , 14 - 10 , in favor of legislation to help cancer patients and others treat debilitating symptoms with small amounts of marijuana with their doctor ’s approval .
“ This is a bill of compassion , ” said Senator Peggy Gilmour , D - Nashua .
“ With this bill , those who derive benefit from marijuana for serious health issues can be called ‘ patients ’ rather than ‘ criminals . ’ ”
Gilmour said marijuana has been found to alleviate the nausea triggered by certain chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer as well as to ease the side effects of treatment for Hepatitis C .
It also reportedly can ease symptoms of AIDS , muscular dystrophy and muscle spasms associated with spinal cord injuries .
“ Thirteen states have legalized marijuana for medical use .
None has found increased abuse , increased crime or any of the myriad social ills or law enforcement nightmares so often feared .
What they have found is one more way to help those with debilitating disease , those at life ’s end , find some increased measure of comfort , ” Gilmour said .
House Bill 648 would allow patients , with the approval of their doctor , to receive a state registry identification card that enables them or a designated caregiver to tend up to six plants and keep up to two ounces of marijuana for a limited period of time .
The marijuana could then be used to ease the symptoms of a debilitating disease or treatment .
Sale of any marijuana would be forbidden but registered patients could legally provide plants or seeds to another registered patient .
The Senate version of the bill adds restrictions forbidding the use of medical marijuana in any public place , workplace , school or jail .
It prevents anyone convicted of a drug - related crime of being named a designated caregiver .
It protects the privacy of patients by limiting access to the state registry .
It also sets up a study committee to look at a simpler , more protected system for providing medical marijuana to those who need it .

Paragon ’s Lunar Oasis
Astronauts ’ meals have come a long way from the freeze - dried powders and semi-liquid pastes of decades ago : now US scientists want to grow vegetables in mini-greenhouses on the Moon .
Although space fare has steadily improved over time , a team of scientists says the best is yet to come .
They look forward to when residents of future lunar or even Martian outposts can dine on luxuries such as fresh vegetables .
Paragon Space Development Corporation has unveiled what it called the first step toward growing flowers – and eventually food – on the Moon .
Paragon , an Arizona company that has partnered with NASA in previous experiments on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station , calls it a “ Lunar Oasis ” .
This is a sealed greenhouse that looks like a bell jar encased in a 46 - centimetre tall triangular aluminium frame .
It is designed to safely land a laboratory plant on the lunar surface , and protect it while it grows .
The miniature greenhouse is to be launched into space by Odyssey Moon Ltd , a participant in the Google Lunar X Prize .
This competition offers $ 20 - million to any entrant who can launch , land and operate a rover on the lunar surface .
Paragon officials say future testing of the “ Lunar Oasis ” will be driven by Odyssey ’s flight schedule , which will not happen until 2012 at the earliest .
When it does lift off the greenhouse will contain the seeds of Brassica , a hardy plant related to Brussels sprouts and cabbage and used in the production of cooking oil and livestock feed .
Because Brassica goes from seed to flower in just 14 days , it can complete its life cycle in a single lunar night .
Preparing to return
“ Colonising the Moon or Mars seems so far away , but it is important that we do this research now , ” Paragon president Jane Poynter told AFP .
“ It takes a long time to get a lot of research , and to get integrated , reliable efficient systems ” before colonists move in , she said .
NASA , which will retire its Space Shuttle fleet at the end of 2010 , has committed to two new goals : returning astronauts to the Moon by 2020 , and a manned mission to Mars by 2030 .
“ I was pleased to see this ( project ) put together by Paragon , ” said Gene A. Giacomelli , a professor at the University of Arizona Department of Plant Sciences .
“ NASA has pulled back on funding for bio - regenerative life support systems , and most of the centres in the US that had been doing that research had stopped . ”
Giacomelli and students at the university ’s Controlled Environment Agriculture Centre ( CEAC ) are working on their own as - yet - unfunded lunar greenhouse .
The agriculture centre also makes remote operational improvements to its existing , state - of - the - art hydroponic “ growth chamber ” at the National Science Foundation ’s new Amundsen - Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica .
Conditions at the South Pole , which include a high - altitude , low air - pressure environment , and wind - chill factors of minus 100 C , make the project a “ good analogue ” to conditions at a lunar outpost , Giacomelli said .
The South Pole greenhouse , now in its fifth year , allows workers living in the coldest place on Earth to dine on tomatoes , peppers , lettuce , strawberries and fragrant herbs .
It produces about 27 kilos each week , enough to provide each of the 75 scientists there with two salads per day .
“ This is n’t science fiction , ” Giacomelli said .
“ We have the technology to sustain life on the other planets right now , if we could get there . ”
There are many challenges to growing plants in space , but the biggest is finding enough water on site to support a permanent outpost .
An expedition to Mars will take three years to complete , so plants must multi-task : remove toxins from the space facility air , recycle wastes , generate oxygen , provide nutrients for future crops , and produce food .
“ Colonies need a bio - regenerative program , ” Poynter emphasised .
“ A colony is there to stay .
It ’s not like you can just pack up your picnic basket and go home . ”

In this exploration of grimoires , books of magical knowledge , Professor Davies covers an eye - wateringly wide range of material , from clay tablets in ancient Babylonia to Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( below ) .
He makes the bold claim that to know the history of grimoires is " to understand the spread of Christianity and Islam , the development of early science , the cultural influence of print , the growth of literacy , the social impact of slavery and colonialism " .
Those brought up with the view that magic is the preserve of primitive people who progress with civilisation to religious belief will be surprised to find how closely religion and magic were always linked in their written manifestations .
One example comes from colonised peoples , who believed the Bible was the occult source of the power of the whites .
A widespread conspiracy theory grew up - reported from Africa , South America and the South Pacific - that the Europeans spreading Christianity were deliberately withholding some of the magic in the Bible , in order to keep them in a state of subjugation .
Such beliefs in extra-biblical magic are part of a tradition stretching back at least to the fourth century .
The characterisation of Moses as a great magician claimed that only the first five books of divine teaching made it into the Bible ; other secret texts circulated as grimoires - and still do .
There was no shortage of court cases in the first years of the 20th century in the US citing the maleficent use of the seventh book of Moses for removing unwanted spouses and former friends in the so - called " hex murders " .
There were warnings also to the user : if a book 's instructions were not strictly followed , it could induce madness , and merely looking at some of its incantations could make one go blind .
Believers were moved to terror by the thought of the even more esoteric eighth and ninth books of Moses , with presumably no end to the potential horror of numerical progression .
The democratisation of high magic in the Renaissance meant suddenly everyone was at it , and the demand grew for books giving the runic farting spell ; the use of candles made from the fat of a hanged man ; and practical manuals for causing rain , seducing women or for making enemies mute with " a weezle 's tongue , dried and worn in the shoe " .
Criminal records show how the widespread use of magic was exposed in the plot to assassinate Louis XIV by a cabal of sorcerers who were purveyors of poison to the palace ( as well as of cosmetics , breast enlargers and the sanctimoniously named " angel makers " , which were abortifacients ) .
Believers were highly resistant to challenge .
The great sceptic Reginald Scot 's exposé The Discoverie of Witchcraft of necessity gave examples of spells but was then used as a repository of ancient lore by charm merchants who recycled its research .
When a French government official defiantly laid his hand on a book , whose mere touch was supposed to conjure the devil , the non-appearance of Lucifer was considered evidence of the official 's skill as a secret magician .
Sometimes the seekers were tricked : Benjamin Franklin's spoof astrological guide Poor Richard 's Almanack was circulated as the genuine esoteric article , but in fact gave a rationalist message within the binding of a grimoire .
Paradoxically , as capitalism triumphed and the world became more materialistic , esoteric knowledge flourished in the occult revival .
In the US , the birthplace of advanced capitalism , one grimoire even founded a religion .
In the 1820s farmer Joseph Smith was employing the usual talismans and peep - stones to seek buried treasure in Wayne County , New York .
He is said to have discovered two golden plates ; the translation of the esoteric characters on them was published as The Book of Mormon .
With this guide , Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
The pulp novelist HP Lovecraft wrote of a fictional grimoire , the Necronomicon .
With no assistance from Lovecraft , versions of the work with bogus genealogies linking it to Mesopotamian sources then appeared .
It is this blurring of fiction and folklore that fed the modern obsession with witches , from the " satanic abuse " of credulous social workers to Harry Potter , television series such as Charmed and the burgeoning popularity of Halloween as a festival .
In this erudite and entertaining addition to book scholarship Davies makes a convincing argument about the resilience of books , with their enduring ability to shape the modern age despite the addition of electronic alternatives .
In keeping with this spirit , Grimoires is a beautifully produced , surprisingly inexpensive book with black end papers and suitably antique illustrations , though a larger type size would have been welcome , for the benefit of older scryers .

As our partner website www.cricketupdates.in asked that the big question of the moment is can Vettori and Team prevent another assault from Virender Sehwag ?
So far if you check the performance of both the teams India and New Zealand , the answer which you will get is NO .
So far Virender Sehwag and Indian batsman has demolished the Kiwis bowling line .
Sehwag has so far destructed the line and length of all the bowlers of New Zealand .
Even in the last match which was washed away by rain , Sachin Tendulkar has also shown his hand in the destructive batting .
So with the 0 - 1 down in the series and one match washed away by rain Kiwis are more under pressure then Team India .
So the third match is a bit of Do or Die for Kiwis , otherwise they will almost lose the series .
Do n’t forget that Kiwis batting line is a bit inexperienced than India and they can brought under pressure by Zaheer Khan , Praveen Kumar and Harbhajan Singh .
Also if Ishant Sharma is fine then he too can be dangerous for them .
Now forget all these worries and watch the live udpates of the third ODI between India and Kiwis , on a Sunday .

I may be biased .
My first foray into Crip or Ableist Theory , apart from a childhood volunteer job playing with kids with autism , was Robert McRuer ’s Crip Theory .
The book specifically looks at intersections of sexuality and ability .
For that reason , I may have a pre-conceived notion that this academic and political discipline is naturally inclined towards a diverse activism from which the others ( feminist , critical race ) have historically strayed .
Forgive my ignorance .
The 3 blogs below , however , support my optimistic fantasy .
( Score one for me ! )

Electric cars have gotta be the way of the future with their clean emission - free engines … but are they all going to look as strange as the tricycle - wheeled Aptera ?
The first pre-production vehicles rolled out recently , and the company has now revealed more data on how its sleek vision of the future car will perform on the road .
The car ’s dubbed the 2e , and it ’s an all - electric powered beast with a rechargeable lithium - ion battery pack .
It has three wheels , with two in front–for better grip while steering –and one trailing .
The electric motor develops 60 lb ft of torque , which is enough to accelerate it up to 60 mph in 9 seconds .
That does n’t sound like much compared to the 100 - plus lb- ft of torque from a typical gasoline engine , but remember that electric engines deliver their power smoothly as they speed up , meaning it ’ll feel very different when you ’re riding inside .
The battery pack is slated to come in two different sizes –10 kWh and 13 kWh of capacity –with the smaller battery offering the car a 100 - mile range .
The car ’s body looks half like a tear - drop , half like a crashed Cessna aircraft .
That ’s to give it an efficient and low drag coefficient of 0.15 – compared to the 0.31 of a Lamborghini Diablo or even the 0.26 of a Toyota Prius–that ’s a terrifically low figure which leads directly to more of the Aptera ’s power being delivered as speed and less wasted in drag .
But that ’s how it gets up to a top speed of 90 mph with such a low - power engine .
It also features gull - wing doors , and enough storage space for 15 typical grocery store bags
It ’s going to cost “ between $ 25,000 and $ 45,000 ” when it goes into mass production in October .
Its maker plans to release the car , that is legally considered a motorbike , in California first .
Then it will roll out across the U.S. , as it ’s 20,000 annual production kicks off .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Tuesday overturned a last - minute Bush administration regulation that many environmentalists claim weakened the Endangered Species Act .
President Obama , with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , marked the agency 's 160th birthday Tuesday .
The regulation , issued a few weeks before George W. Bush left office , made it easier for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists before launching projects that could affect endangered wildlife .
By overturning the regulation , Obama said during an enthusiastic reception at the Interior Department , he had restored " the scientific process to its rightful place at the heart of the Endangered Species Act , a process undermined by past administrations . "
Under the Bush administration rule , there was no need for a federal agency to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Services if that agency determined that no harm would come to an endangered species as a result of its project .
But the determination of what " no harm " meant rested with agency bureaucrats instead of scientists .
Obama issued a memorandum that effectively suspends the regulation while ordering a review to determine whether it promotes " the purposes of the [ Endangered Species Act ] . "
" The work of scientists and experts in my administration , including right here in the Interior Department , will be respected , " Obama said .
" For more than three decades , the Endangered Species Act has successfully protected our nation 's most threatened wildlife , and we should be looking for ways to improve it , not weaken it . "
Environmental groups were quick to praise Obama 's action .
" President Obama 's announcement will allow [ the Endangered Species Act ] to do what it was intended : protect our nation 's endangered plants and animals , " said Andrew Wetzler , director of the Natural Resources Defense Council 's Endangered Species Program .
" Reversing the Bush administration 's midnight action will restore protections for our last wild places and species . "
Obama also helped celebrate the 160th anniversary of the Interior Department on Tuesday .
" Throughout our history , there 's been a tension between those who 've sought to conserve our natural resources for the benefit of future generations and those who have sought to profit from these resources , " he told department employees .
" But I 'm here to tell you this is a false choice .
With smart , sustainable policies , we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment for ourselves , our children and our grandchildren . "

For the Greek , Hemeroscopium is the place where the sun sets .
An allusion to a place that exists only in our mind , in our senses , that is ever - changing and mutable , but is nonetheless real .
It is delimited by the references of the horizon , by the physical limits , defined by light , and it happens in time .
Hemeroscopium house traps , a domestic space , and a distant horizon .
And it does so playing a game with structures placed in an apparently unstable balance , that enclose the living spaces allowing the vision to escape .
With heavy structures and big actions , disposed in a way to provoke gravity to move the space .
And this way it defines the place .

Close up of the Hemeroscopium House 's structure
The order in which these structures are piled up generates a helix that sets out from a stable support , the mother beam , and develops upwards in a sequence of elements that become lighter as the structure grows , closing on a point that culminates the system of equilibrium .
Seven elements in total .
The design of their joints respond to their constructive nature , to their forces ; and their stresses express the structural condition they have .
By the way this structure is set , the house becomes aerial , light , transparent , and the space kept inside flows with life .
The apparent simplicity of the structure´s joints requires in fact the development of complex calculations , due to the reinforcement , and the prestress and post - tension of the steel rods that sew the web of the beams .

Close up of one of the eight main structural beams
It took us a year to engineer but only seven days to build the structure , thanks to a total prefabrication of the different elements and a perfectly coordinated rhythm of assembly .
All of our effort oriented to develop the technique that would allow to create a very specific space .
And thus , a new astonishing language is invented , where form disappears giving way to the naked space .
Hemeroscopium house materializes the peak of its equilibrium with what in Ensamble Studio we ironically call the “ G point ” , a twenty ton granite stone , expression of the force of gravity and a physical counterweight to the whole structure .

Evangelical pastor Ray Stedman knows the root cause of everything that ’s wrong with the world :
It is not nationalism , it is not racism … it is the human heart .
It is the pride of man that fancies he can get along without God .
But not to worry , because he advises us how we can conquer this obstacle .
To achieve that , we must
… take captive every thought to the obedience of Christ .
This is extremely important .
… It is absolutely necessary to do this if you want to have permanent victory .
Allow these unChristian thoughts to remain unconquered , and you will soon have to take the fortress all over again .
They will creep out of their hiding places and take over and you will find that that which God has delivered you from has taken control once again .
Granted , the job of “ taking every thought captive ” can be difficult , even for a believing Christian .
Stedman observes that :
… the intellectual life is often the last part of a Christian to be yielded to the right of Jesus Christ to rule .
Somehow we love to retain some area of our intellect , of our thought - life , reserved from the control of Jesus Christ .
For instance , we reserve the right to judge Scripture , as to what we will or will not agree with , what we will or will not accept .
I find many Christians struggling in this area .
One of our women told us , a few years ago , of a struggle in this respect in her life .
She said she would read through the New Testament and sometimes write in the margin opposite a verse , “ I do n’t agree ! ”
Well , she was honest enough to put it down in writing .
There are many of us who do not agree but we do not write it down , or even admit it to ourselves .
It was honest of her to do that , but it represents a struggle with the Lordship of Christ ; his right to rule over every area of life , his right to control the thought - life , every thought taken captive to obey him .
… Dr. Francis Schaeffer has put it very accurately beautifully in these words : I am false or confused if I sing about Christ ’s Lordship and contrive to retain areas of my own life that are autonomous .
This is true if it is my sexual life that is autonomous , but it is at least equally true if it is my intellectual life that is autonomous , or even my intellectual life in a highly selective area .
Any autonomy is wrong .
Similar to C.S. Lewis saying that obedience is an “ intrinsically good ” habit to get into , or the Pope saying that a Catholic ’s only role is to obey the Vatican with sheeplike docility , both Stedman and Schaeffer agree that “ any autonomy is wrong ” and that we must never question , disagree with , or doubt the teachings of the Bible , lest we lose faith and be overcome by atheism .
We atheists often say that religion “ hardens hearts and enslaves minds ” , but it ’s interesting to see theists who openly agree with us and admit that this is exactly what they are trying to achieve .
What I find most revealing about all this is the sentiment that if you allow un-Christian thoughts to “ remain unconquered ” , they will soon gain strength and overcome you ; that the only way to maintain your faith is to crush all doubts and skepticism and force “ every thought ” into the Christian mold .
It ’s bizarre that so many preachers say this is necessary .
In what other areas of life do people do this ?
Do scientists tell each other that they must take captive every thought to the reigning theory , that even a seed of doubt may grow out of control ?
Do doctors constantly struggle to persuade themselves that they can heal sick people ?
Do chemists grapple with belief in the periodic table ?
A New Yorker book review , Prisoner of Narnia , makes a similar point about C.S. Lewis ’ writing :
A startling thing in Lewis ’s letters to other believers is how much energy and practical advice is dispensed about how to keep your belief going : they are constantly writing to each other about the state of their beliefs , as chronic sinus sufferers might write to each other about the state of their noses .
Keep your belief going , no matter what it takes — the thought not occurring that a belief that needs this much work to believe in is n’t really a belief but a very strong desire to believe .
It seems that many believers wrestle with doubt ; and since they have n’t been able to get rid of it , they ’ve elevated it into a virtue , saying that by its nature faith is hard to hold onto .
In fact , this sentiment is so common that they do n’t realize how strange it is , or what it implies : that their reason is not entirely dormant , that it rejects the absurdities of faith , creating mental tension and doubt when it comes into contact with the will to believe .
I ’ve noted a similar phenomenon in those theists who feel flickers of conscience that cause them to agonize over their faith ’s cruel teachings of punishment and damnation .
Neither the moral nor the rational sense , it seems , are easily quieted , and that is a heartening thought .
I ’m aware this is anecdotal , but what strikes me is that I ’ve never seen a comparable phenomenon among atheists .
What atheist books or websites speak of atheism as something that ’s a constant struggle to keep up , or warn that if we read the Bible or consider arguments for the existence of God , religious thoughts may “ creep out ” and overpower us ?
I grant that many theists who claim to be ex-atheists assert that this can happen , but evidence for the phenomenon among actual atheists , in the same way Stedman discusses seeing among Christians , is conspicuously lacking .
And this leads to a simple , stunning realization : our apologist opponents are afraid of us .
They boast of how their church is founded on the solid bedrock of the word of God , how their faith is strong and impregnable to contrary argument .
But look past the surface , and in many cases , you ’ll find them constantly advising each other how best to stifle doubts , warning each other that our arguments must not be considered , our case not given heed .
You ’ll find sermons sternly warning about the dangers of autonomy , of independent thought , and of using one ’s own best judgment .
Why would they write so extensively about the necessity of taking your own mind captive – unless they fear what it would uncover if it was free ?
The Notorious B.I.G. , a.k.a. Biggie Smalls , was born Christopher George Latore Wallace on May 21 , 1972 .
His father was a small - time Jamaican politician and his mother was a Jamaican pre-school teacher .
His father left the family when Biggie was only two and his mother was rarely home , as she had to work two jobs to pay the bills .
Always a hefty lad , Biggie was nicknamed “ Big ” by the time he was ten years old .
In adulthood , he measured about 6 ’ 3 ” and anywhere from 300 to 380 pounds .
At his school , he was a great student and won several awards in English programs .
This master of the language would later prove crucial in his rapping career .
Biggie grew up during the peak of the crack epidemic and , like many kids around him , he ended up dealing drugs .
Although he was selling crack since he was 12 , his mother never knew about it until he grew up .
He continued to sell drugs up until first child was born , at which time , his label manager , Sean “ Puffy ” Combs , insisted he stopped selling for good .
His high school , George Westinghouse Information Technology High , also had Jay - Z , Busta Rhymes and DMX in attendance .
This was the same period that Biggie began rapping .
He performed in a few groups , the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques , and he sang on the streets by himself .
By seventeen , he decided to drop out of school .
Notorious had long had a problem with the law , starting with his 1989 arrest for weapons charges .
The next year , he was arrest on a probation violation and a year after that he was arrested for dealing crack .
The third time , he spent nine months in jail .
Much later in his career , he was arrested in 1996 outside of a New York club for threatening to kill two fans , punching one in the face and smashing the windows of their taxi cab .
That same year , he was arrested again for drug and weapons charges .
In 1997 , he was ordered to pay $ 41,000 to someone who claimed to have been beaten and robbed by Biggie and his entourage in 1995 , but the criminal robbery charges were dropped .
After his 1991 release from prison , B.I.G. decided to release a demo tape under the alias “ Biggie Smalls , ” the name of a gangster in the 1975 movie Let ’s Do It Again .
He later discovered the name was already in use and decided to change it to “ The Notorious B.I.G . ”
In 1992 , The Source featured Biggie in their “ Unsigned Hype ” column , dedicated to unsigned rappers brimming with talent .
This helped him get the attention of the A&R department of Uptown Records and one of their producers , Puff Daddy .
He signed to Uptown , but almost immediately left to join Puffy ’s brand new label , Bad Boy Records .
Biggie ’s big break came when he added vocals to a remix to the Mary J. Blige song “ Real Love , ” which reached # 7 on the charts .
In 1994 , Notorious married singer Faith Evans only nine days after meeting her at a photo shoot for Bad Boy Records .
Only four days later , he had his first commercial success with the song “ Juicy , ” which reached # 27 on the charts .
His first full - length album , Ready To Die , was released at a time hip hop was dominated by West Coast artists .
The album reached # 13 on the charts and was certified four times platinum .
Rolling Stone said the album " almost single - handedly ... shifted the focus back to East Coast rap " .
By 1996 , he was the top - selling male solo artist and rapper on the US pop and R&B charts .
He also won the award for Best New Artist , Lyricist of the Year , Live Performer of the Year and Debut Album of the Year at the Source Awards .
The Billboard Awards named him Rap Artist of the Year .
Unfortunately , his success peaked at the same time as the East Coast vs West Coast Rap feud .
A former associate of Biggie , Tupac Shakur , accused him of involvement with a November 1994 robbery that left Tupac shot and out of thousands of dollars in jewelry .
Notorious said that he was near the scene of the accident , recording an album but was not involved with the crime .
Tupac soon signed with Death Row Records in L.A. and the two labels became wrapped up in an intense rivalry .
Tupac ’s song “ Hit ‘ Em Up ” involved claims that he was sleeping with Biggie ’s wife and that Biggie stole his style and image .
Biggie did not respond to this , saying it was n't his style to respond .
During all of this drama , Biggie was trying to record his second album .
It took over 18 months to complete , between interruptions from the hip hop wars , legal problems and an injury he sustained during a car accident at the time .
The accident resulted in the use of a cane for the rest of his life .
On Sepember 7 , 1996 , Tupac was shot and killed in a drive by in Las Vegas .
The murder remains unsolved , but reports detailing Biggie ’s involvement sprung up immediately .
Notorious denied the rumors , saying he was in New York working on his album at the time .
Lil’ Kim had a working relationship with Biggie for a few years and when he helped direct her 1996 debut album , Hard Core , the two became entangled in a love affair .
She became pregnant with Biggie ’s child , but had an abortion .
After the events of 1996 unfolded , Biggie claimed he wanted to focus on obtaining a “ peace of mind . ”
" My mom ... my son ... my daughter ... my family ... my friends are what matters to me now , " he explained .

On March 8 , 1997 , Biggie flew to L.A. to present Toni Braxton an award at the Soul Train Awards .
He was booed by some of the audience who blamed him for the death of Tupac .
After the award show , the entire entourage attended a Vibe magazine party at the Petersen Automotive Museum .
When the Fire Department closed the party early , the streets became crowded with people leaving .
Biggie rode in a GMC Suburban when a black Impala pulled beside his vehicle and the passenger , neatly dressed in a blue suit and bow tie , shot him multiple times with a 9 mm pistol .
Biggie was pronounced dead at 1:15 and the murder remains unsolved .
While many murder suspects include members of the West Coast hip hop family , one of the more popular theories was detailed by Randall Sullivan in his book LAbrynth .
Sullivan ’s thesis is that both Biggie and Tupac were murdered by Marion “ Suge ” Knight , co-founder of Death Row Records , and retired LAPD officer David Mack .
His book supposes that the hip hop war was trumped up to make the murders easier to cover up .
He backs up his assertions with the fact that the LAPD did not fully examine murder links to Death Row Records .
This theory is further examined in the documentary Biggie & Tupac by Nick Broomfield .
Based on the evidence by LAPD officer , Russell Poole , and the book by Sullivan , Biggie ’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the LAPD in 2005 .
Their claim accused the department of having enough evidence to arrest the murder , but failing to do so .
The case was declared a mistrial after the judge worried the police were withholding evidence .
The family attempted to expand their lawsuit , but failed , this was enough to get the case reopened in July 2006 though .
The family filled a second wrongful death suit in April of 2007 .
Of course , the pendulum swings both ways , and Tyruss Himes , a.k.a.
Big Syke , was implicated of the murder by tv channel KTTV and XXL magazine and filed a suit against them for defamation .
His case was later thrown out of court .
Fifteen days after the Death of Biggie , his double disc album , Life After Death , was released and hit # 1 on the billboard charts .
The album was later certified Diamond .
The first two singles from this album , “ Hypnotize ” and “ Mo Money Mo Problems , ” were both # 1 ’s and Biggie was the first artist to do this after his death .
Spin magazine named him Artist of the Year and made “ Hypnotize ” its Single of the Year in 1997 .
Since his death , Biggie ’s vocals have been sampled in songs by many artists , including Ashanti , Jay - Z , 50 Cent , Alicia Keys , Usher , Lil Wayne , Nelly and Michael Jackson .
He was named the greatest rapper of all time by both The Source and Blender magazines .
MTV listed him as the third Greatest MC of All Time .
This year , a biographical film , Notorious , was released by Fox Searchlight Pictures .
Producers of the film include Puff Daddy , and Biggie ’s mother , Voletta Wallace .
The film raised over $ 42 million worldwide .
Unfortunately , the violence of hip hop continues .
On opening night , a fan was shot by another film - goer in Greensboro , North Carolina .
I know many readers may not like rap and may complain about the selection this week , but like all of these articles , the band was chosen by user requests .
If you ’ve got a band you want to see tidbits about , just list them in the comments , thanks !
Alternatively , if you want to see more rap artists , leave them in the comments too .

A guest post from Tom Walker :
The economic case for shorter working time was made 100 years ago this August in Winnipeg by Sydney J. Chapman .
It was the standard model accepted by the elite academic establishment â€ “ Alfred Marshall , A.C. Pigou , Lionel Robbins and J.R.
Hicks cited it as authoritative .
This was not some obscure “ debate among scholars from eons ago whom no one knows . ”
No debate was needed .
It was an open and shut case .
One hundred years later , the theory stands undisputedâ€¦ and ignored .
The case can be summarized as followsâ€ ¦
Technological advance makes the labour process more intensive and , as a consequence , more stressful and fatiguing .
Meanwhile , the increased productivity of industry makes leisure time more valuable .
A reduction in the hours of work is required if the gain in the value of leisure time is to be realized but also to establish a new baseline for further technological progress that could benefit society and the mass of working people .
The competitive market for labour does not automatically lead to the establishment of optimal working time arrangements ; rather it contains a systematic bias toward overly long hours .
This established theory was expunged from economic discourse by a technical gimmick with dubious empirical or theoretical merit but considerable mathematical convenience .
By sheer coincidence , this methodological quirk also happens to please and appease “ the free - market orthodoxy which dominates both economics instruction and economic policy - making in Canada . ”
But I digressâ€ ¦
There is a story about a drunk stumbling around under a lamp post looking for his keys .
A passer - by offers to help and asks , “ where did you drop them ? ”
“ Over there in the bushes . ” the drunk replies .
“ Then why are you looking for them here ? ”
“ Because the light is better here . ”
The case for shorter working time was expunged from post - war economic thought because “ the math was better ” under the light of an assumption that the given hours of work are optimal , rather than that the ideal was a dynamic and progressively declining number of hours .
The radical implications of Chapman ’s theory can be hinted at by juxtaposing Chapman ’s observation about the ideal working day of the future with Karl Marx ’s approving citation in his Economic Manuscript of 1861 - 63 of the argument from an obscure 1821 pamphlet .
Chapman wrote :
It is my purpose to demonstrate that the non-physiological value of leisure , as well as its physiological value , must rise with progress , and , therefore , that in all probability , the hours which should be worked per day will become steadily less .
The ideal working day of the future cannot be eight hours , for it must be essentially a progressive ideal .
As a community advances agitation for shorter hours will be constantly breaking out anew [ emphasis added ] .
Marx quoted and then rhapsodized upon the following passage from the 1821 pamphlet , “ A nation is really rich if the working day is 6 hours rather than twelve .
Wealth is disposable time , and nothing more . ”
The obscure pamphlet turns out to have been , in Friedrich Engels ’ words , “ the most advanced outpost of a whole group of writings of the 1820s , which turned the Ricardian theory of value and surplus - value against capitalist production in the interest of the proletariat , and fought the bourgeoisie with its own weapons . ”
It was also the inspiration for Marx ’s own , more famous , analysis of surplus value .
What united Chapman , Marx and the anonymous pamphleteer , besides reverence for disposable time , was the notion that collective struggle , rather than individual choice , was the medium through which shorter hours and a better life would be achieved .
As a resolution of the First International proclaimed , “ the limitation of the working - day is a preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvement and emancipation must prove abortiveâ€ ¦ ”
Before calling in the red squad , though , Canadian humorist and political economist â€ “ and Conservative Party campaigner â€ “ Stephen Leacock also promoted shorter hours of work as the key component of his proposed solution to the Unsolved Riddle of Social Justice while John Maynard Keynes hailed working less as the “ ultimate solution ” to the long - term problem of full employment .
The movement for an eight - hour day was the cornerstone of Samuel Gompers ’s “ pure and simple unionism , ” which is to say the American Federation of Labor .
Ira Steward pioneered the philosophy of eight - hours , which in major respects anticipated and prepared the ground for the Roosevelt New Deal of the 1930s .
Even Henry
Ford touted the advantages of an eight - hour day and a five - day week back when it was heresy to the more respectable spokesmen for business .
Strange bedfellows .
It is crucial to understand that “ the economic case for shorter hours ” has been made many , many times before .
It is , perhaps , even more important to realize that the case , or cases , and the making of them , dwell at the core of some of the most profound upheavals in the history of economic thought and in the social history of the last 200 years .
It would be presumptuous of me to “ make the case ” without somehow acknowledging that history .
Furthermore , my own field of scholarship bears a peculiarly tangential relationship to that case .
What I have studied primarily over the past 14 years has been the economic case against shorter hours , or perhaps I should say more accurately : the economists ’ case against the economic case for shorter hours .
Opposition research .
My guiding question has not been “ what would the benefits be ? ” I have a shelf full of plausible answers from Arthur Donner , Andrew Jackson , Frank Reid , the Atkinson Foundation , Julie White of the CEP , Francois Aubry of the CSN in Quebec , Bruce O’Hara , Anders Hayden , Conrad Schmidt and Peter Victor â€ “ just to mention a few of my Canadian contemporaries and comrades .
Instead , my question has been “ what ’s the big hold up ? ”
It has been a remarkably fruitful research question .
I have two published articles on the alleged economic fallacy of the case for shorter working time and a conference paper documenting the scandalous suppression by mainstream economic discourse of the neoclassical theory of the hours of labour .
Economists lied ; people died .
In the course of my research , I ’ve also examined dozens of the cases argued for shorter working time and have been careful to note their similarities and differences .
Those cases range , chronologically , from a brief commentary in Thomas Jefferson ’s friend , the Marquis de Chastellux ’s 1772 Essay on Public Happiness ( as in “ life , liberty and the pursuit ofâ€¦ ” ) to a short section in the United Nations Environmental Programme ’s 2008 report on Green Jobs : Towards Decent Work in a Sustainable , Low Carbon World .
My synthesis of the economic case for shorter work time from the multitude of economic cases for shorter working time arrives at a qualitatively different perspective than the standard economic view .
Rather than the dwelling on the material benefits of more free time , higher wages , lower unemployment , improved productivity , better health or reduced greenhouse gas emissions , my synthesis emphasizes the differences between the economic subject implied by or constituted in the body of shorter work time texts and the infamous utility - maximizing homo economicus constituted in the text of mainstream economics .
The economic subject of the shorter working time literature is human , whether acting as a collective or as a social individual .
Homo economicus chooses from a cafeteria of ready - made commodities , one of which is labeled “ leisure ” .
Real individuals and collectives struggle for a better standard of living , including free time to become fully developed as human beings .
Historical consciousness is a key part of that ongoing struggle .
“ Wealth is disposable timeâ€ ¦ and nothing more . ”

BBC News website education editor , at the NUT conference
The strike in April 2008 disrupted thousands of schools
One of the biggest teachers ' unions in England and Wales is demanding a pay rise of 10 % or at least £ 3,000 , whichever is greater .
Delegates at the annual National Union of Teachers conference backed the call despite warnings it would be unseemly when people are being made redundant .
One said she was so fed up with the job 's strains and repaying her £ 25,000 student loan that she was going abroad .
The government said teachers ' pay and conditions had never been better .
The average teacher 's salary was £ 33,000 , it said .
But Becky Williams , a history teacher from Nottingham , is going to work in a private school in Kenya .
She told the conference that after four years in the profession she was earning just £ 26,000 .
Asking for 10 % - is stealing from the poor of the world
Michael Wrought - Brookes
NUT member " I have handed in my notice .
I am going to teach abroad , '' she said .
She later told journalists she was going to work in a British - run international school , earning £ 100 a month more than in England .
In Kenya 's state primary schools more than 200,000 teachers staged a 10 - day strike earlier this year until the government offered to double their salaries over three years .
The lowest paid receive about £ 91 ( $ 130 ) a month , leaving them struggling to pay their bills .
In the NUT conference debate , Michael Wrought - Brookes from North Yorkshire opposed the proposed pay demand , arguing that it would be wrong when people were being made redundant in their thousands .
He said it was folly to think standards of living in Britain could continue rising if world poverty were to be tackled in the way that the conference had just demanded in a separate debate .
" Britain has been stealing from the poor of the world for 500 years and is still doing it , " he said .
" And asking for 10 % is exactly that : it is stealing from the poor of the world . "
Habitat sinks
But a Bradford teacher , Ian Murch , said the recession should not be used as an excuse to cut teachers ' pay when the consumer prices index was still more than 3 % .
" We take no lessons in morality from government ministers , who fit out their homes with stone sinks from Habitat on their expenses , who pay their husbands more than a teacher earns to be their personal assistants and who do n't appear to engage in even a hint of performance management of what they get up to . ''
He successfully proposed that NUT members should be balloted for industrial action if the 2.3 % pay rise agreed for September , as part of a three - year deal , is reduced .
Last year the NUT abandoned industrial action over pay , after a one - day teachers ' strike in April that had been the biggest for 21 years , closing about one in 10 schools in England and Wales .
Responding to the conference decisions , England 's schools minister , Sarah McCarthy - Fry , said : " Teachers ' pay and conditions have never been better .
" We have increased their pay by 19 % in real terms since 1998 which means the average teacher is on nearly £ 33,000 , " she claimed .
" We have also cut teachers ' working hours , dramatically reduced the amount of administrative tasks they are expected to do , doubled the number of support staff and given them time outside of the classroom to plan and prepare lessons . "
Special units
The conference also threatened ballots on industrial action against moves to privatise the exclusion units for disruptive pupils .
The government has announced a dozen pilot schemes in England in which private companies will run units for pupils who have been excluded or are at risk of being .
These include a city farm , a football training centre and a scheme based on Army Cadet Force training .
Delegates predicted that the numbers of troubled children being sent to such referral units would rise as family problems grew during the recession .
The centres , known as PRUs , are supposed to provide short - term help to get children back into mainstream classes .
NUT national officer Jerry Glazier said : " We do not want , in any shape or form , privatisation which will simply put up barriers to that partnership working , not take them down . ''
Rachel Lynch , a special educational needs teacher from Bristol , said : " These services should not be used as a dumping ground for children who do not fit in to the mainstream . ''

One addendum to today ’s column : the truth , which I think everyone in the political / media establishments knows in their hearts , is that the nine months or so between the summer of 2002 and the beginning of the Iraq insurgency were a great national moral test — a test that most people in influential positions failed .
The Bush administration was obviously — yes , obviously — telling tall tales in order to promote the war it wanted : the constant insinuations of an Iraq - 9/11 link , the hyping of discredited claims about a nuclear program , etc. .
And the question was , should you stand up against that ?
Not many did — and those who did were treated as if they were crazy .
For me and many others that was a radicalizing experience ; I ’ll never trust “ sensible ” opinion again .
But for those who stayed “ sensible ” through the test , it ’s a moment they ’d like to see forgotten .
That , I believe , is the real reason so many want to let torture and everything else go down the memory hole .
Let ’s hope that does n’t happen .

Clive Cussler Loses $ 13.9 Million Dollar Court Battle Over Why " Sahara " Was Disgustingly Disagreeable
Clive Cussler and one of the " Cusslermen "
Fiction writer Clive Cussler now owes Crusader Entertainment $ 13.9 million dollars because the movie that they made out of his book " Sahara " -- an action / adventure failure from 2005 that cost $ 160 million to make -- was a sprawling , unlovable monstrosity .
This lawsuit has been going back and forth since the movie came out , and it looks like the final verdict is merely for legal fees and " costs .
"
It all started when Cussler sued Crusader because they did n't give him final approval of the " Sahara " script .
He told fans to boycott the film out of spite .
The film then hemorrhaged money and lost millions , going down as one of Hollywood 's biggest disasters .
Crusader then countersued Cussler , claiming that Cussler lied that people liked his book in the first place , that he grossly inflated sales figures , and that he conned Crusader into taking on the beloved " Dirk Pitt " franchise , even though the only people who have ever read a " Dirk Pitt " book are janitors in youth hostels who found ratty copies in the left - behind backpacks of junkies , tried to use them to prop up the legs of wobbly furniture , read fifty pages because the cover was shiny like a wasp , and then slowly rolled joints from the rest over the course of a year , accidentally reading a sentence here and there .
I actually saw this movie , " Sahara . "
I was working at this coffee shop in Austin and sleeping on the couch there at night because I did n't have enough money for rent .
After my shift some nights , these two sisters who came in all the time would invite me back to their place next door to watch movies stolen from my boss 's DVD collection .
One of these movies was " Sahara . "
To promote the film , Matthew McConaughey traveled the country in an airstream trailer personally telling every person in the country to go see it .
He probably also ordered hundreds of copies of the DVD and left them in strategic places around Austin so that he could build a cult following and generate a hunger for sequels .
" This is terrible , " I said , after watching five minutes of this movie .
" I read the book , " said one of the sisters .
" Was the book terrible ? "
" It was Clive Cussler , " she said , shrugging .
I grunted .
" Why do the people in this movie keep talking to each other as if we know who they are and as if we have shared many adventures with them in the past ? "
I asked .
" No one could stand ten minutes with these smug , inhuman idiots .
" The insufferable heroes of " Sahara " have no flaws .
They just have guns .
Consider the worlds most famous action / adventure heroes : Indiana Jones is a cocky coward , James Bond is a lonely sociopath , Sherlock Holmes is a drug addict , Rocky Balboa is mentally retarded .
Flaws !
Make you care !
Also , stories about genius white men setting things right in the third world by blowing shit up and shooting people may not be what people want anymore .
" I do n't know , " she said .
" It 's just a movie . " " It 's a BAD movie .
" We all agreed about this .
I suspected , however , that the book was also bad .
Can you imagine spending $ 160 million dollars on something ?
What would you buy ?
Would you give 3200 people 50 grand so that they could take two years off from work ?
Or would you make a bad movie based on a bad book and then sue the writer of the book because you did n't make as much money as you thought you would and because the writer was delusional about the strength of their art ?
Note : not only do fiction writers receive no credit if a movie based on their work succeeds , they are also blamed if it fails .
WRITERS IN HOLLYWOOD : you are in an abusive relationship !
You did not trip and fall into a doorknob !
You do not deserve the treatment that you get because you are " dirty " or because you " dress so slutty !

Internet service providers are to keep records of emails and online phone calls under controversial new government regulations that come into force today .
ISPs will be legally obliged to store details of emails and internet telephony for 12 months as a potential tool to aid criminal investigations .
Although the content of emails and calls will not be held , ISPs will be asked to record the date , time , duration and recipients of online communications .
The new regulations are contained in an EC directive on data retention that already applies to telecoms providers and is now being extended to ISPs .
The directive was conceived as a response to the London bombings of July 2005 , following which the Council of the European Union highlighted " the need to adopt common measures on the retention of telecommunications data " .
" Knowing when someone sent an email or made an IP telephony call , and knowing who they emailed or called , is very revealing information - these regulations potentially put that information in the hands of a wide range of public bodies , " said Sam Parr , a lawyer specialising in communications at Baker & McKenzie .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said this was " nowhere near as disproportionate and terrifying " as government plans for a central database of communications information , which she believes poses a greater long - term threat to civil liberties .
Despite public protests the French Parliament has passed a controversial new law that will see alleged copyright infringers disconnected from the Internet .
In addition , France ’s Minister of Culture Christine Albanel has stated that under the new law , ISPs may be ordered to block The Pirate Bay .
In order to clamp down on piracy the French have passed a new law requiring Internet service providers to cut off Internet access for persistent offenders .
Under the new legislation ISPs have to warn alleged copyright infringers twice , and if they they ignore these warnings their Internet access is terminated for up to a year .
One of the biggest problems with the new law is that copyright infringers will be identified only by an IP - address , which will undoubtedly lead to many false accusations .
Those who want to prove their innocence have only one option , namely , to install a spyware application that will monitor their every move on the Internet and report it back to the authorities .
Hardly practical .
The law goes much further than disconnecting alleged file - sharers though .
In addition it is now possible to take “ any action ” in order to put a halt to copyright infringement .
Minister of Culture , Christine Albanel , explicitly named The Pirate Bay as one of the sites that could be easily blocked under the new law .
Thus , without having to provide evidence that a website is engaging in illegal activities , it can still be blocked .
Potentially this could mean that access to BitTorrent sites is disallowed in France , as well as access to sites like YouTube or perhaps even Google .
In summary , the new law introduces unlimited options for the copyright holders to go after sites and people that may or may not infringe copyright , without having to actually proove that the accused are guilty .
To date , this is by far the most aggressive and unbalanced piece of copyright legislation that we ’ve seen .
Even more so , only last week the European Parliament spoke out against such disproportionate legislation by adopting a report that aims to protect the rights and freedoms of Internet users and excludes ‘ three strikes ’ as a punitive sanction .
Unfortunately , members of the French parliament completely ignored this .
What struck us most is that the people who get to decide on these issues have no clue about file - sharing at all .
Many of them do n’t know what BitTorrent is , or how it works .
Yet , they decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of Internet users .

Nine years on , the Boys from the Dwarf are back … in Weatherfield .
Here 's an exclusive first look at the new series
It 's cold outside … but the Boys from the Dwarf have finally found somewhere with some kind of atmosphere .
Nine years on from the frustrating final episode , here 's our first glimpse of the all - new Red Dwarf .
We 've got a clip of the new three - part story Back to Earth , due to air over Easter on Dave .
And it 's Earth , Dave , and exactly as we know it , actually .
The new episodes take the Boys back to a modern - day Earth .
Partially to provide some Galactica - style closure to the saga , but mainly because , with the sets long since torn down and the meagre budget of a digital channel , it was the only way they could do it .
This much we know : Kochanski has died ( that noise was a million fanboys whooping ) .
Rimmer has aged ( a double downer , since holograms are n't meant to ) .
And since Lister left a bath running for nine years , Holly is water - logged and still drying out ( so apparently no Norman Lovett or Hattie Hayridge ) .
And somehow , they 'd found themselves in Weatherfield .
That 's Starbug zipping through Coronation Street ( did you spot Dev 's kebab shop and Peter Barlow 's bookies ? )
So chances are , Lister 's going to meet some intergalactic genetic double in the form of cabbie Lloyd Mullaney .
What can be going on here ?
A reality warp ?
Some kind of fiction actualiser ?
An ill - advised bout of fourth - wall breaking ?
Time travel 's somehow involved , and Rimmer knows all about the X Factor .
Why so bitter ?
Could a failed pop career be one of his manifold broken dreams in some other reality ?
Could Rimmer really be a descendant of Leon Jackson ?
There 's just a few weeks until we find out .
Back to Earth is on Friday 10 April 2009 at 9 pm on Dave .
Jones Report

A listener sent in photos of thousands of plastic coffin liners awaiting pick - up for truck delivery somewhere in Alabama .
This unsettling site may well correspond with concerned reports of mass graves being prepared at National Memorial Cemetery in Phoenix , Arizona , at the Houston National Cemetery as well as numerous other reports .
D.H. Williams reported in February on an Indiana county municipal official received detailed requests from FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security in regards to locations for mass graves , preparations for regional refugees , preparations for economic collapse and budget cuts under a GM collapse , as well as the locations of major installations , emergency assets and more .
The official , heard in the video below , says that he became concerned about the intentions of of the FEMA and DHS officials , whose scenarios apparently included a potential bird flu outbreak , alongside fires , floods and earthquakes .
While it is certainly true that cemeteries undergo routine expansions and utilize pre-made burial sites , concerns have grown over FEMA preparations for large numbers of death under various crises .
We have also received reports about questionnaires , such as this one [ pdf linked ] from the New York State Division of Cemeteries issued in 2007 , which solicits details about the capability of individual cemeteries to deal with " mass fatality or pandemic situations . "
" Should a prolonged mass fatality disaster or pandemic flu occur in your community would your cemetery be able to provide temporary or permanent internment space for a significant number of disaster or flu deaths in additional to your current burial services ? "
The state of Colorado issued an executive order in 2000 asserting its authority to bury victims in mass graves and / or cremate bodies under emergency situations .
Jim Erickson of The Rocky Mountain News reported February 8 , 2003 that :
The state of Colorado could seize antibiotics , cremate disease - ridden corpses
and , under extreme circumstances , dig mass graves under executive orders
drafted for use in the event of a bioterrorism attack .
Below is video of some half a million plastic coffin liners spotted in July 2008 awaiting pickup outside Atlanta , Georgia , also for unknown distribution .

BARACK Obama today forecast that the " special relationship " with Britain will save the global economy .
The US President agreed with Gordon Brown that the G20 nations need to pump more cash into massive projects to avoid a repeat of the 1930s recession .
" We have always emerged stronger by standing together , " he said .
" It is not an alliance of interests it is a kinship of ideals which will be renewed .
" We will focus on common ground , not occasional differences .
We will move forward with a sense of common purpose . "
Mr Brown told him : " Your first 70 days in office have changed America and changed America 's relationship with the world .
" Ours is not an alliance of convenience but a partnership for progress .
" We have some tough negotiations ahead - it wo n't be easy - but together we can face this unprecedented global crisis . "
Mr Brown referred to their " personal friendship " and that was reflected by warm words and body language between the two leaders .
During breakfast talks both agreed that their " critical task " was win unity of purpose " until the burden on ordinary people is lifted . "
In Downing Street they attempted to stave off a challenge by France and Germany who want no interference in their own budget - setting .
Both then told the UK Cabinet that there are " difficult challenges " ahead over the next 24 hours .
The scene is set for an Obama - Brown clash with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkosy - who has threatened to walk out of the London summit unless he gets his way - who insist on greater regulation of the money markets .
But the confrontation has forced a closer alliance between Washington and the Brown administration .
Aides said that the premier and the president have an " ever - closer " working relationship , strengthened by the threatened showdown .
Mr Brown needs the summit to be a " resounding " success to shore up his battered government and to show the public that he is a major figure on the world stage .
President Obama needs to demonstrate to US voters and backers that he is taking the lead in the global crisis .
But there are competing demands from other G20 member states .
Russia and China will insist on a greater say in international economic affairs in return for support for a new aggressive military strategy in Afghanistan .
President Obama will meet Russia Dimitry Medveded and China 's Hu Jintao before tonight 's summit dinner in Buckingham Palace .
Despite potential difficulties , the G20 leaders are expected to more than double the £ 175 billion available to the International Monetary fund to rescue countries pushed to the brink of financial meltdown .
President Obama and wife Michelle last night flew into Britain and overnighted in London amid unprecedented security operations .
In central London and Westminster police and joint Anglo - US security units were on full alert for a terrorist attack , with helicopters over the city centre and armed patrol boats in the Thames .
The Metropolitan Police also cordoned off major arteries to control a series of marches and demonstrations by anarchists , anti-capitalists , Muslim organisations and anti-war protesters .
All police leave in the capital has been cancelled , with the focus today on the US Embassy and Trafalgar Square , and the City .
* The G20 leaders run economies which between them account for more than 80 per cent of world trade and financial output .
The GHC Build System Architecture
This section contains information you need to know in order to understand and modify the GHC build system .
The build system is non-standard in various ways ( to be explained shortly ) , and is decidedly non-trivial : do not attempt to modify it without having a grasp of the concepts that follow !
It 's difficult to document a system that is full of details and subject to constant change .
The approach we 've adopted here is to split the documentation in two :
The high - level architectural design , the stuff that is less likely to change , is documented here .
Occasionally we 'll include direct links to source files to illustrate the details .
The low - level technical details , such as the order of arguments to a macro , and the names of specific variables , are documented as comments in the build - system code .
Hopefully this way the documentation is more likely to stay up to date .
Historical note : this is the third major revision of the GHC build system .
The first incarnation was based on jmake , a derivative of X11's own imake , which is based on using the C preprocessor to add macro capabilities and #include to plain make .
The second incarnation used GNU make 's extensions for including makefiles ( but lost the ability to use macros , since at the time GNU make did n't have support for general macros ) .
In this third revision , we use even more of GNU make 's extensions , and we make a fundamental change to the design , as described in the next section .
Another ( fourth ) revision based on Shake is currently being attempted ; see Building / Shake for more details .
Overall structure and important files
The following are a few of the most important files in the build system .
For a more complete overview of the source - tree layout , see Commentary / SourceTree .
ghc.mk
This is where you should start reading : ghc.mk is the main file in the build system which ties together all the other build - system files .
It uses make 's include directive to include all the files in mk /*. mk , rules /*.mk , and all the other ghc.mk files elsewhere in the tree .
Makefile
The top - level Makefile , recursively invokes make on ghc.mk according to the phase ordering idiom .
rules /*. mk
Each .mk file in the rules directory corresponds to a single macro that can be called using make 's $ ( call ... ) expression .
For example , the build - package macro is in rules / build - package.mk .
mk/config.mk.in
The configuration information for the build system , processed by configure to produce mk / config.mk .
Settings can be overriden by creating a local file mk / build.mk ( see Build configuration ) .
compiler / ghc.mk , rts/ghc.mk , etc .
Most subdirectories of the source tree have a ghc.mk file which contains the instructions for building the components in that directory .
Note : these ghc.mk files cannot be invoked individually , they should only be included by the top - level ghc.mk .
Idioms
Until this moment , I did not know you could fit a whole chicken in a can .
The directions on the back use the word " delicious " three times .

Splice Today ’s Matt Poland already examined the Vatican ’s recent decision to reinstitute their medieval policy on indulgences , but that adorably backward - looking decision ( which strikes me as sort of a religious take on Throwback Uniform Day ) has been matched by the Church ’s apparent widespread acceptance of Darwin ’s evolutionary theory :
Ahead of a papal - backed conference next month marking the 150th anniversary of Darwin 's
On the Origin of Species , the Vatican is also set to play down the idea of Intelligent Design , which argues a " higher power " must be responsible for the complexities of life .
Before we give the Vatican too much credit , however , we have to look at the careful wording of this announcement .
Far from saying that Darwin was right and Creationism has been disproved , the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi , has merely claimed that Christian myth and Darwinian theory can peacefully coexist .
More annoyingly , Catholics now claim that , in fact , St. Augustine knew about evolution waaaaaay before Darwin was even born !:
Father Giuseppe Tanzella - Nitti , Professor of Theology at the Pontifical Santa Croce University in Rome , added that 4th century theologian St Augustine had " never heard the term evolution , but knew that big fish eat smaller fish " and forms of life had been transformed " slowly over time " .
Aquinas made similar observations in the Middle Ages .
However they go about covering their asses , it ’s heartening to see the famously , stubbornly conservative Vatican make this kind of acknowledgement publicly , even if , as The New Republic ’s Alvaro Vargas Llosa notes , it was Darwin ’s theory of natural selection that made The Origin of Species so groundbreaking , not his affirmation of evolution .
But this shows that the Vatican is slowly , albeit grudgingly , moving into the 21st century .
Or at least the mid-20th .
So they must be fuming at recently re-communicated Bishop Richard Willliamson , who , despite being recently allowed back into the fold , is clinging steadfastly to his long - held denial of the Holocaust :
The Vatican is demanding that you retract your denial of the Holocaust , and it is threatening to not allow you to resume your activities as a bishop .
How will you react ?
Throughout my life , I have always sought the truth .
That is why I converted to Catholicism and became a priest .
And now I can only say something , the truth of which I am convinced .
Because I realize that there are many honest and intelligent people who think differently , I must now review the historical evidence once again .
I said the same thing in my interview with Swedish television : Historical evidence is at issue , not emotions .
And if I find this evidence , I will correct myself .
But that will take time .
No doubt there are progressive Catholics who are excited by the Church ’s embrace of Web 2.0 and their extension of the naturally - selected olive branch to Darwin .
Maybe the Vatican can make life a little more bearable for these sane folks by , say , not re-communicating unrepentant Holocaust deniers in the first place .

The swine flu virus first detected in Mexico can no longer be contained and countries should focus on mitigating its effects , a top UN official said .
World Health Organization deputy chief Keiji Fukuda was speaking as the WHO raised its alert level to four , or two steps short of a full pandemic .
UN food inspectors are going to Mexico to examine reports that industrial pig farms were the source of the outbreak .
The number of probable deaths from the virus there has risen to 152 .
Swine flu : mapping the outbreak New Zealand confirmed at least three cases on Tuesday , and Israel one .
The US , Canada , Spain and Britain confirmed cases earlier but no deaths have been reported outside Mexico .
' Not inevitable '
Alert level four means the virus is showing a sustained ability to pass from human to human and is able to cause community - level outbreaks .
Mr Fukuda said this was a " significant step towards pandemic influenza " but a pandemic should not be considered inevitable .
Experts did not recommend closing borders or restricting travel , he stressed .
" With the virus being widespread ... closing borders or restricting travel really has very little effects in stopping the movement of this virus , " he said .
The first batches of a swine flu vaccine could be ready in four to six months ' time but it will take several more months to produce large quantities of it , Mr Fukuda said .
WHO PANDEMIC ALERT PHASES Phase 1 : No viruses circulating among animals causing infections in humans Phase 2 : Animal influenza virus causes infection in humans , and is considered potential pandemic threat Phase 3 : Influenza causes sporadic cases in people , but no significant human - to - human transmission Phase 4 : Verified human - to - human transmission able to cause community - level outbreaks .
Significant increase in risk of a pandemic Phase 5 : Human - to - human transmission in at least two countries .
Strong signal pandemic imminent Phase 6 : Virus spreads to another country in a different region .
Global pandemic under way
In pictures : Swine flu spreads Life at centre of the outbreak Swine flu :
Your experiences Health experts say the virus comes from the same strain that causes seasonal outbreaks in humans but also contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds .
A team from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is due to leave Rome for Mexico on Tuesday to investigate allegations that industrial pig farms in Mexico were the source of the outbreak .
Its chief veterinary officer , Joseph Domenech , told the BBC that rumours that people had been falling ill last month near some intensive pig farms meant the FAO had to act .
" [ We had ] no indication of human cases of direct contact with pigs but this can never be totally sure and the probability that this virus could come from pigs directly could not be anyway ruled out totally , " he said .
' Decline in cases '
The number of flu cases under observation in Mexico has reached 1,614 .
Swine flu was confirmed in 20 of the 152 deaths .
Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said all of those who had died were aged between 20 and 50 .
Infections among young healthy adults are a characteristic of past pandemics .
Mr Cordova said the first suspected case of swine flu had occurred in the southern state of Oaxaca but stressed that nobody knew " the point of origin or dissemination " of the virus .
He noted that the number of new cases reported by Mexico 's largest government hospitals had declined during the past three days : from 141 on Saturday to 119 on Sunday and 110 on Monday .
Schools nationwide are to remain closed until 6 May as the country grapples with the outbreak .
In almost all swine flu cases outside Mexico , people have been only mildly ill and have made a full recovery .
Travel advice
In the US , a further 20 cases of swine flu were confirmed in New York .
Cases have also been reported in Ohio , Kansas , Texas and California , bringing the total across the country to 50 .
SWINE FLU
Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission
Swine flu cases confirmed in UK Q&A : What is swine flu ?
' I could n't get out of bed ' US and EU officials have urged caution for anyone considering travelling to Mexico .
Tests are being carried out on individuals or groups in Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia and South Korea .
A number of countries in Asia , Latin America and Europe have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms , while Germany 's biggest tour operator has suspended trips to Mexico .
Taiwan has announced it will quarantine any visitors showing symptoms of swine flu .
Several countries have banned imports of raw pork and pork products from Mexico and parts of the US , although experts say there is no evidence to link exposure to pork with infection .
Shares in airlines have fallen sharply on fears about the economic impact of the outbreak .

Dans la nature ou certaines villes , on voit parfois des nuées d'étourneaux , comptant jusqu'à un million d'individus , tournoyer dans le ciel .
Dans les régions tropicales , des essaims de criquets , rassemblant jusqu'à plusieurs dizaines de milliards d'individus sur des centaines de kilomètres carrés , ravagent les récoltes .
Un phénomène d'agrégation comparable , mais sans conséquences néfastes , existe chez les poissons marins , notamment chez le hareng et l'anchois du Pérou , mais il est beaucoup plus difficile à observer et à analyser .
Nicholas Makris et ses collègues de l'Institut de technologie du Massachusetts ( MIT ) , à Cambridge , ont utilisé un sondeur à guide d'ondes acoustiques ( Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing ) pour comprendre ce qui le déclenche chez le hareng , dans l'Atlantique .
Par rapport aux autres types de sondage acoustique , cette technique a l'avantage de fournir des images instantanées d'une zone de grande superficie - plusieurs dizaines de milliers de kilomètres carrés .
Les chercheurs ont ainsi observé que les harengs passent en quelques heures d'une population où ils sont dispersés à un banc gigantesque où leurs mouvements sont synchronisés .
Le déclencheur semble être un seuil de densité de 0,2 individu par mètre carré , associé à une baisse de luminosité , au crépuscule .
De petits groupes convergent alors pour former de grands rassemblements .
Du point de vue physique , ces convergences créent des ondes comparables à celles d'une « ola » dans un stade .
Elles se propagent à des vitesses de l'ordre de 20 kilomètres par heure , soit beaucoup plus vite que la vitesse de nage des poissons ( moins d'un kilomètre par heure ) .
La densité de la population augmente alors à un rythme de cinq millions de poissons par kilomètre carré et par heure .
Un banc de 250 millions d'individus s'étire bientôt sur une quarantaine de kilomètres et migre ensuite en direction des zones de frai .
Le lendemain , lorsque la luminosité augmente , le banc se désagrège .
Cette étude , en se consacrant à une grande surface marine , permet pour la première fois de suivre la totalité d'un énorme banc de harengs durant plusieurs heures .
D'autres méthodes sont par ailleurs utilisées pour reconstituer plus localement , en trois dimensions et avec une meilleure résolution , la structure des bancs de poissons , afin d'évaluer les stocks des ressources pour la pêche et de mieux comprendre le comportement des espèces , explique Laurent Berger , de l'Ifremer de Brest .
Ainsi , à l'aide d'un sondeur multifaisceaux halieutique , qui équipe le navire Thalassa de l'Ifremer , son équipe étudie le même phénomène quotidien d'agrégation de harengs qui se produit chaque année à la tombée de la nuit , de mi-janvier à mi-février , devant Boulogne - sur - Mer , lorsque l'espèce remonte de la Manche vers la Mer du Nord .
BOGALAY , Myanmar , April 30 ( Reuters ) - A year after Cyclone Nargis battered army - ruled Myanmar , killing nearly 140,000 people , paddy fields remain bare and tens of thousands of survivors live in makeshift shelters .
" Everybody lives on food handouts and most of us do n't have decent shelter or a job , " Ba Thin , 72 , said , pointing to the bamboo , thatch and tarpaulin huts lining the road through his village near Bogalay , an area devastated by the May 2 - 3 storm .
Around Da Nyin
Phyu village , where only 100 of its 800 residents survived , paddy fields have yet to fully recover from the 12 - foot ( 4 metre ) wall of water surged through the fertile Irrawaddy Delta .
Ba Thin blamed the salinated soil for ruining the main rice crop in the area , leaving farmers with crippling debts .
" Without help , almost all of us will not be able to grow anything in the coming crop season , " he said .
With rice yields down nearly a third due to soil salinity and heavy rains affecting the harvest in early April , many farmers will have to sell what rice they have at low prices to try to pay off some of their debts .
" The biggest problem for the people down in these parts is they have n't been able to maintain an income flow , " Chris Kaye , country director for the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , told Reuters during a recent visit to the delta .
With monsoon rains only weeks away , the main aid coordinating body has issued an urgent appeal for donor funds to help pay for shelter materials and other assistance .
Aid groups estimate at least 500,000 survivors , including 200,000 children , are still living in makeshift shelters cobbled together with bamboo poles and fraying tarpaulin , primarily due to a lack of money .
[ ID : nBKK410319 ]
The pre-monsoon appeal is part of a three - year , $ 691 million recovery plan drafted by the Tripartite Core Group ( TCG ) , comprising the United Nations , Myanmar and its Southeast Asian neighbours .
The plan faces serious fund - raising hurdles , including a global economic crisis that is squeezing foreign donor governments .
Myanmar already receives far less aid than other poor countries due to its dismal human rights record .
DRINKING WATER SCARCE
Clean drinking water is scarce for most villages in the region , especially those close to the sea .
" We now have to depend on a local NGO or water sellers from the north for our daily drinking water , " Tin Aye from Pathee Wai Chaung Village told Reuters .
Fishermen are also struggling , but they grumble more about local corruption than a lack of boats or nets .
Aung Myint said he cannot fish in nearby rivers and creeks because the fishing rights were sold to businessmen in Bogalay .
" We pay through the nose to subcontractors of these businessmen .
Sometimes they demand a share of the catch , " he said .
After initially resisting a massive foreign aid effort in the delta , the secretive regime relented and allowed foreign aid workers into the country , albeit under tight restrictions .
Aid groups say much has been achieved in the past year and had expressed initial optimism that it could lead to more humanitarian space elsewhere in the country .
But the generals have dashed any hope of that , arresting activists who led private cyclone relief efforts and tightening their grip ahead of scheduled 2010 elections .
The regime said in February it would only extend the TCG 's mandate to the middle of 2010 , although it was not clear how the decision would affect foreign NGOs operating in the delta .
Mark Canning , the British Ambassador to Myanmar , said he hoped the humanitarian work and access for aid workers would continue , " but we think it 's going to be quite constrained in the period coming up to the election " .
Western governments led by the United States and Britain have criticised the poll as a sham aimed at entrenching rule by the military , which refused to recognise the last election won in 1990 by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy .
Over the years , Washington and London have imposed tough sanctions on the regime , although U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a stir in February when she admitted sanctions had not worked and new ways to sway the regime must be found .
Analysts say there is no sign yet the Obama administration 's policy review on Myanmar will lead to a lifting of sanctions .
In the meantime , Washington has stepped up humanitarian aid , providing $ 74 million in cyclone assistance .

The board of directors governing Eidos and Square Enix have settled on a buyout bid of 84.3 million GBP an equivalent of $ 119.8 million going by today ’s exchange rate .
Both parties will move forward with a shareholder recommendation at the next meeting and if at least 75 % of the shareholders accept the offer Square Enix will own Eidos .
At a 258 % premium over the mid-market closing price of 9 pence per share why should n’t share holders accept the deal ?
Square Enix also assures that following the close of an offer , if completed , the existing employment rights , pension rights , of the management and employees will be fully safeguarded .
Warner
On the other side of the table why is Square Enix interested in Eidos ?
Yoichi Wada , President of Square Enix , explained , “ Eidos is a talented developer and publisher of interactive products with a broad portfolio of highly successful mass market franchises , led by Tomb Raider , one of the most successful video game franchises of all time .
Eidos maintains a strong reputation for high quality development and proven expertise in creating characters and storylines that appeal to customers .
Eidos ’ products are highly complimentary to our business and will accelerate our aggressive expnasion into Western markets .
We believe that wide range of both companies ’ quality products encompassing major genres will enable us to meet diversified customers ’ expectations on a global basis . ”
Tim Ryan , Chairman of Eidos , seems pleased with the offer .
“ We believe this cash offer provides Eidos shareholders with an attractive price and certainty in today ’s challenging market backdrop and economic outlook .
The acquisition of Eidos will complement Square Enix ’s expansion into Western markets and offers mutually beneficial opportunities for the combined group .
The board believes that this offer is in the best interests of the shareholders . ”
OK , we get it .
Square Enix wants in on Western development .
Buying Eidos would immediately give Square Enix access to Eidos owned studios like IO Interactive and Crystal Dynamics .
However , Eidos core franchises – even Tomb Raider do n’t hold the candle they used to .

" I would like to ask President - elect Obama to say something please about the humanitarian crisis that is being experienced right now by the people of Gaza . "
Former Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney made her plea after disembarking from the badly damaged SS Dignity that had limped to the Lebanese port of Tyre while taking on water .
The small boat , carrying McKinney , the Green Party 's recent presidential candidate , other volunteers , and several tons of donated medical supplies , had been trying to reach the coast of Gaza when it was rammed by an Israeli gunboat in international waters .
But as more than 2,400 Palestinians have been killed or injured – the majority civilians – since Israel began its savage bombardment of Gaza on 27 December , Obama has maintained his silence .
" There is only one president at a time , " his spokesmen tell the media .
This convenient excuse has not applied , say , to Obama 's detailed interventions on the economy , or his condemnation of the " coordinated attacks on innocent civilians " in Mumbai in November .
The Mumbai attacks were a clear - cut case of innocent people being slaughtered .
The situation in the Middle East however is seen as more " complicated " and so polite opinion accepts Obama 's silence not as the approval for Israel 's actions that it certainly is , but as responsible statesmanship .
It ought not to be difficult to condemn Israel 's murder of civilians and bombing of civilian infrastructure including hundreds of private homes , universities , schools , mosques , civil police stations and ministries , and the building housing the only freely - elected Arab parliament .
It ought not to be risky or disruptive to US foreign policy to say that Israel has an unconditional obligation under the Fourth Geneva Convention to lift its lethal , months - old blockade preventing adequate food , fuel , surgical supplies , medications and other basic necessities from reaching Gaza .
But in the looking - glass world of American politics , Israel , with its powerful first - world army , is the victim , and Gaza – the besieged and blockaded home to 1.5 million immiserated people , half of them children and eighty percent refugees – is the aggressor against whom no cruelty is apparently too extreme .
While feigning restraint , Obama has telegraphed where he really stands ; senior adviser David Axelrod told CBS on 28 December that Obama understood Israel 's urge to " respond " to attacks on its citizens .
Axelrod claimed that " this situation has become even more complicated in the last couple of days and weeks as Hamas began its shelling [ and ] Israel responded " .
The truce Hamas had meticulously upheld was shattered when Israel attacked Gaza , killing six Palestinians , as The Guardian itself reported on 5 November .
A blatant disregard for the facts , it seems , will not leave the White House with George Bush on 20 January .
Axelrod also recalled Obama 's visit to Israel last July when he ignored Palestinians and visited the Israeli town of Sderot .
There , Obama declared : " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
This should not surprise anyone .
Despite pervasive wishful thinking that Obama would abandon America 's pro-Israel bias , his approach has been almost indistinguishable from the Bush administration 's ( as I showed in a longer analysis .
Along with Tony Blair and George Bush , Obama staunchly supported Israel 's war against Lebanon in July - August 2006 , where it used cluster bombs on civilian areas , killing more than 1,000 people .
Obama 's comments in Sderot echoed what he said in a speech to the powerful pro-Israel lobby , AIPAC , in March 2007 .
He recalled an earlier visit to the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona near the border with Lebanon which he said reminded him of an American suburb .
There , he could imagine the sounds of Israeli children at " joyful play just like my own daughters " .
He saw a home the Israelis told him was damaged by a Hizbullah rocket ( no one had been hurt in the incident ) .
Obama has identified his daughters repeatedly with Israeli children , while never having uttered a word about the thousands – thousands – of Palestinian and Lebanese children killed and permanently maimed by Israeli attacks just since 2006 .
This allegedly post - racial president appears fully invested in the racist worldview that considers Arab lives to be worth less than those of Israelis and in which Arabs are always " terrorists " .
The problem is much wider than Obama : American liberals in general see no contradiction in espousing positions supporting Israel that they would deem extremist and racist in any other context .
The cream of America 's allegedly " progressive " Democratic party vanguard – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Howard Berman , New York Senator Charles Schumer , among others – have all offered unequivocal support for Israel 's massacres in Gaza , describing them as " self - defence " .
And then there 's Hillary Clinton , the incoming secretary of state and self - styled champion of women and the working classes , who wo n't let anyone outbid her anti-Palestinian positions .
Democrats are not simply indifferent to Palestinians .
In the recent presidential election , their efforts to win swing states like Florida often involved espousing positions dehumanising to Palestinians in particular and Arabs and Muslims in general .
Many liberals know this is wrong but tolerate it silently as a price worth paying ( though not to be paid by them ) to see a Democrat in office .
Even those further to the left implicitly accept Israel 's logic .
Matthew Rothschild , editor of The Progressive , criticised Israel 's attacks on Gaza as a " reckless " and " disproportionate response " to Hamas rocket attacks that he deemed " immoral " .
There are many others who do nothing to support nonviolent resistance to Israeli occupation and colonisation , such as boycott , divestment and sanctions but who are quick to condemn any desperate Palestinian effort – no matter how ineffectual and symbolic – to resist Israel 's relentless aggression .
Similarly , we can expect that the American university professors who have publicly opposed the academic boycott of Israel on grounds of protecting " academic freedom " will remain just as silent about Israel 's bombing of the Islamic University of Gaza as they have about Israel 's other attacks on Palestinian academic institutions .
There is no silver lining to Israel 's slaughter in Gaza , but the reactions to it should at least serve as a wake - up call : when it comes to the struggle for peace and justice in Palestine , the American liberal elites who are about to assume power present as formidable an obstacle as the outgoing Bush administration and its neoconservative backers .
Even though this does not mean that all UFO sightings are hoaxes — of course many represent other terrestrial ( instead of extraterrestrial ) events such as the planet Venus , military aircraft , weather balloons , advertising planes , and the like ( and even , pace Men in Black , swamp gas ) — it does reveal how the human mind connects the dots and fills in the gaps with plausible explanations that often include fantastic tales of alien beings .
Enjoy the story and watch the video clips of this amazing hoax !
In this week ’s eSkeptic , we reveal the behind the scenes workings of that UFO hoax that captured headlines earlier this year .
People in and around the Morristown , New Jersey area saw unidentified flying objects , with many of them naturally assuming that these UFOs represented extraterrestrial space craft .
As you shall see , there was a rather more terrestrial explanation .
In fact , they were helium balloons with flares attached to them , lofted into the sky by Chris Russo and Joe Rudy , in their social experiment on how to create your own media event surrounding UFO sightings .
How We Staged the Morristown UFO Hoax
Chris Russo & Joe Rudy
Have you ever seen the face of the Virgin Mary on your grilled cheese ?
How about the image of Satan in a cloud of smoke ?
Or Sasquatch running through the woods ?
What about an alien spacecraft in the sky ?
It is not difficult to find people who respond with an astounding “ yes ! ” to one of these — or all four .
Humans are , by nature , experts at finding patterns whether they are real or not , and UFOs are among the most common patterns people find in the skies .
Now , you may be thinking that UFOs are only seen by a mullet sporting , tobacco chewing , dolt whose highest aspiration is to make an appearance on the Jerry Springer Show , but in fact doctors , lawyers and even pilots report seeing flying saucers , flying triangles , and aerial shapes of all manner of an unidentified nature .
Even over the skies of an affluent suburban community in New Jersey .
Enter Joe Rudy and Chris Russo and the great UFO hoax of 2009 .
In November of 2008 , we found ourselves sitting around one evening discussing pseudoscience and the large numbers of people that still believe in its various guises .
We had always had a strong interest in why people were so easily fooled by such irrational superstitions as psychic ability , spiritual mediums , alien abductions , and the like .
Despite the lack of evidence to support these notions , we were baffled .
How could so many people in an age of science still buy into dogma that is no more or less ridiculous than the notion of an elderly obese man delivering presents to every child on Earth in one evening ?
And like most other people , we had always heard about the uneducated farmer spotting an alien spaceship hovering over his farm , but we wondered if that amount of gullibility could be found in our upper - middle class hometown of Hanover , NJ , and the surrounding cities .
The modern UFO phenomena began in 1947 when a pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted objects that he described as “ crescent shaped , ” adding that they “ moved like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water . ”
He was subsequently misquoted by an Associated Press reporter as having seen “ flying saucers , ” which he later corrected , noting : “ They said that I ’d said they were saucer - like .
I said they flew in saucer - like fashion . ”
Nevertheless , the flying saucer craze was born and 60 years later , despite the fact that there is still no evidence of their existence , the UFO myth is as strong today as ever , fed by cable channel shows that prop up UFO “ experts ” who claim to be authorities on a subject that ’s on par with astrology and palm reading .
These charlatans make a career by perpetuating the E.T. fairy tale and exploiting credulous people who want nothing more than a good conspiracy theory to believe in .
It is in this context that we set out on a mission to help people think rationally and question the credibility of so - called UFO “ professionals . ”
We brainstormed the idea of producing a spaceship hoax to fool people , bring the charlatans out of the woodwork to drum up controversy , and then expose it as nothing more than a prank to show everyone how unreliable eyewitness accounts are , along with investigators of UFOs .
We hatched the idea of tying flares onto helium balloons and launching them in a nearby field — an open yet isolated area surrounded by woods .
There we were sure that we would have the privacy to prep the balloons , and that we would n’t have our plot foiled .
From the beginning we decided to document all aspects of the project , including setting up the flares and balloons , launching them into the sky , and recording any media coverage that the “ UFOs ” received .
The documentation was especially important in order to prevent conspiracy theorists from claiming that we were part of a cover - up of the truth when we revealed the hoax .
On January 5 , 2009 , we set out into the woods on the border of Morris Plains and Hanover , NJ , carrying one helium tank , five balloons , five flares , fishing line , duct tape , and a video camera .
After filling up one 3 - foot balloon with helium , we tied about five feet of fishing line to the balloon , secured the line with tape , then tied and taped the flare to the other end of the line .
Once all five balloons were ready for takeoff ( with our fingers on the verge of frost bite ) , we struck the 15 - minute flares and released them into the sky in increments of fifteen seconds apart from each other .
We filmed the “ UFOs ” as they floated away , and then walked the half - mile stretch out of the woods to our car .
The hoax was underway .
The media coverage the incident received over the next few days was extensive .
Both local and national news stations were covering the UFO over New Jersey .
The local paper had a field day with it , quoting a doctor who said the mysterious lights traveled against the wind , and quoting another man who said the object “ did n’t appear to be manmade . ”
The most sought after witnesses were the Hurley family .
Paul Hurley , a pilot , along with his family , made appearances on just about every major news station , describing the strange lights that they saw in the sky .
The “ Morristown UFO ” became the talk of the town .
We followed up our light show with four more performances , gaining media attention every time .
Every conspiracy website and radio show was mentioning it .
To add fuel to the fire , we made appearances ourselves on News 12 New Jersey , on the Jeff Rense Program ( a radio show that promotes conspiracy theories ) , and at an Illinois UFO symposium hosted by MUFON .
We even provided our own footage .
To see a number of media stories , along with the footage we shot of our hoax being prepared and under way , follow the links at the end of this article .
The icing on the cake came when the popular History Channel show UFO Hunters featured the Morristown UFO as their main story one week .
Bill Birnes , the lead investigator of the show and the publisher of UFO Magazine , declared definitively that the Morristown UFO could not have been flares or Chinese lanterns .
Surely Birnes , who has written and edited over 25 books and encyclopedias in the fields of human behavior , true crime , current affairs , history , psychology , business , computing , and the paranormal , and the co-author of The Day After Roswell ( a New York Times bestseller in 1997 and subsequently a documentary on The History Channel ) , could not have let himself be fooled by a couple of twenty - somethings with no formal education in psychology .
He could .
This begs an important question : are UFO investigators simply charlatans looking to make a quick buck off human gullibility , or are they alarmists using bad science to back up their biased opinions that extraterrestrial life is routinely visiting our planet ?
Either way , are these people deserving of their own shows on major cable networks ?
If a respected UFO investigator can be easily manipulated and dead wrong on one UFO case , is it possible he ’s wrong on most ( or all ) of them ?
Do the networks buy into this nonsense , or are they in it for the ratings ?
How can a television network that has pretensions of providing honest and factual programming be taken seriously when the topic of one of their top rated shows deals with chasing flares and fishing line ?
In fact , we delivered what every perfect UFO case has : great video and pictures , “ credible ” eyewitnesses ( doctors and pilots ) , and professional investigators convinced that something amazing was witnessed .
Does this bring into question the validity of every other UFO case ?
We believe it does .

Embracing The Mobile Hacker Ethic
By Carlo Longino
As mobile phones become more powerful and pervasive , it was inevitable that they 'd spawn the same kind of homebrew hacking culture as computers and the Internet .
While the locked - down nature of cell phones and the closemindedness of wireless carriers has stunted that culture 's growth , a few developments are afoot that promise to give a big boost to DIY mobile programming .
Whereas programmers must typically pick up platform - specific skills to develop for mobile , a number of ways for independent and casual developers and even enthusiasts to use skills they 've already got — or can relatively easily learn — to build applications .

First is Nokia 's release of the Python programming language for its Series 60 smartphone environment .
The port of Python is a full implementation with a high degree of portability from the desktop environment , opening mobile development to a whole new class of programmers — which was its primary goal , says Erik Smartt , the program manager of Python for Series 60 .
" By choosing a developer - friendly , easy - to - learn language , Nokia is making it possible for casual developers to tinker with their mobile phones and innovate without the typical investment costs for embedded system development , " he says .
" Bringing a language like Python to Nokia devices changes the rules on who can create applications . "

While Series 60's Symbian OS underpinnings allow for pretty robust programming in C++ or Java , Python offers a much simpler way to develop applications with much quicker results , encouraging users to tinker and play around .
" If people are going to innovate , they need to feel comfortable rapidly proofing new ideas and throwing away code when something does n't work , " Smartt says .
" That 's less likely to happen if application development takes months .
With Python for Series 60 , it should be possible to produce a simple proof - of - concept application in an afternoon . "
One such application was a simple " Traffic Cam Proof of Concept " app , that was orginally built in 45 minutes .
It 's since been refined to include traffic cameras from cities all over the globe , all added quite easily — an app for London cams , for instance , was built over somebody 's lunch break .
The traffic camera application was built to demonstrate the rapid development possible with Python in response to the quick development time for a New York City traffic cam viewer that won a developers ' contest for content made in Flash Lite — another tool , like Python , that is mainstreaming mobile development .
Flash Lite is already available on more than 40 handset models in Japan , and can be downloaded for Symbian devices .
It 's also starting to appear on several manufacturers ' devices in Europe and North America as well .

Flash Lite applications can be built with the same version of Flash MX that 's used to build Web applications , and it includes a variety of templates to facilitate design for different handsets .
One difference between Flash Lite and Python that 's readily apparent is the rich graphics available with Flash .
Python extends the group of potential mobile developers , but Flash Lite also allows designers into the mix .

A quick look at the Flash Lite Exchange , where people can upload their applications , shows some of the different ideas people have had : there 's a lot of slick games and animations , but also a lot of small applications ( think widgets ) that highlight the potential of Flash Lite to become quite pervasive once it's on a lot of handsets .
Python and Flash are just the beginning of mobile companies embracing the hacker ethic to expand the functionality and coolness of their devices .
There are cracks emerging in the standard mobile industry mindset that innovation has to come from the top down as companies realize that by opening development up to as wide a range of developers as possible will they harness the most innovation .
Another example on the horizon is the Nokia 770 internet appliance , which runs an open - source Linux platform called Maemo .
The device is n't even yet available , but quite a community has already rallied around it and generated several applications .

There 's been a fairly seismic shift of semantics , if nothing else , over the last few years where " hacker " has dropped a lot of its negative connotations , and companies are looking to take advantage of people 's capacity to use devices in new and unimagined ways .
As Nokia 's Smartt puts it , " If you can make a device that 's fun to hack on , people will .
And the more people tinker with a device and produce killer applications , the more the value of the device increases to people who own it . "
