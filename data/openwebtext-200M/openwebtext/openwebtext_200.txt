Insulin , it turns out , may be as important for the mind as it is for the body .
Research in the last few years has raised the possibility that Alzheimer 's memory loss could be due to a novel third form of diabetes .
Now scientists at Northwestern University have discovered why brain insulin signaling -- crucial for memory formation -- would stop working in Alzheimer 's disease .
They have shown that a toxic protein found in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer 's removes insulin receptors from nerve cells , rendering those neurons insulin resistant .
( The protein , known to attack memory - forming synapses , is called an ADDL for " amyloid ß- derived diffusible ligand . " )
With other research showing that levels of brain insulin and its related receptors are lower in individuals with Alzheimer 's disease , the Northwestern study sheds light on the emerging idea of Alzheimer 's being a " type 3 " diabetes .
The new findings , published online by the FASEB Journal , could help researchers determine which aspects of existing drugs now used to treat diabetic patients may protect neurons from ADDLs and improve insulin signaling in individuals with Alzheimer's .
In the brain , insulin and insulin receptors are vital to learning and memory .
When insulin binds to a receptor at a synapse , it turns on a mechanism necessary for nerve cells to survive and memories to form .
That Alzheimer 's disease may in part be caused by insulin resistance in the brain has scientists asking how that process gets initiated .
" We found the binding of ADDLs to synapses somehow prevents insulin receptors from accumulating at the synapses where they are needed , " said William L. Klein , professor of neurobiology and physiology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences , who led the research team .
" Instead , they are piling up where they are made , in the cell body , near the nucleus .
Insulin cannot reach receptors there .
This finding is the first molecular evidence as to why nerve cells should become insulin resistant in Alzheimer 's disease . "
ADDLS are small , soluble aggregated proteins .
The clinical data strongly support a theory in which ADDLs accumulate at the beginning of Alzheimer 's disease and block memory function by a process predicted to be reversible .

In earlier research , Klein and colleagues found that ADDLs bind very specifically at synapses , initiating deterioration of synapse function and causing changes in synapse composition and shape .
Now Klein and his team have shown that the molecules that make memories at synapses -- insulin receptors -- are being removed by ADDLs from the surface membrane of nerve cells .
" We think this is a major factor in the memory deficiencies caused by ADDLs in Alzheimer 's brains , " said Klein , a member of Northwestern 's Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer 's Disease Center .
" We 're dealing with a fundamental new connection between two fields , diabetes and Alzheimer 's disease , and the implication is for therapeutics .
We want to find ways to make those insulin receptors themselves resistant to the impact of ADDLs .
And that might not be so difficult . "
Using mature cultures of hippocampal neurons , Klein and his team studied synapses that have been implicated in learning and memory mechanisms .
The extremely differentiated neurons can be investigated at the molecular level .
The researchers studied the synapses and their insulin receptors before and after ADDLs were introduced .
They discovered the toxic protein causes a rapid and significant loss of insulin receptors from the surface of neurons specifically on dendrites to which ADDLs are bound .
ADDL binding clearly damages the trafficking of the insulin receptors , preventing them from getting to the synapses .
The researchers measured the neuronal response to insulin and found that it was greatly inhibited by ADDLs .
" In addition to finding that neurons with ADDL binding showed a virtual absence of insulin receptors on their dendrites , we also found that dendrites with an abundance of insulin receptors showed no ADDL binding , " said co-author Fernanda G. De Felice , a visiting scientist from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who is working in Klein 's lab .
" These factors suggest that insulin resistance in the brains of those with Alzheimer 's is a response to ADDLs . "
" With proper research and development the drug arsenal for type 2 diabetes , in which individuals become insulin resistant , may be translated to Alzheimer 's treatment , " said Klein .
" I think such drugs could supercede currently available Alzheimer 's drugs . "

Klein , Grant A. Krafft , formerly at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine and now chief scientific officer at Acumen Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , and Caleb E. Finch , professor of biological sciences and gerontology at the University of Southern California , reported the discovery of ADDLs in 1998 .
Krafft is a co-author of the FASEB Journal paper .
Northwestern and USC hold joint patents on the composition and use of ADDLs in neurodisorders .
The patent rights have been licensed to Acumen Pharmaceuticals , based in South San Francisco , for the development of drugs that treat Alzheimer 's disease and other memory - related disorders .
In addition to Klein , De Felice and Krafft , other authors on the paper are Wei-Qin Zhao , a former visiting scientist at Northwestern , now with Merck & Co. , Inc.

" Vice President [ Dick ]
Cheney came up to see the Republicans yesterday .
You can always tell when the Republicans are getting restless , because the Vice President ’s motorcade pulls into the Capitol , and Darth Vader emerges , " Hillary Clinton said just now ( video ) at a $ 100 - a- head fundraiser at town hall near New York 's Times Square , referring to Cheney 's efforts shore up Republican congressional support for the Iraq war .
" I ’m not invited to their meetings and I do n’t know what he says or does , " she said , in an informal conversation on stage with former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and retired General Wesley Clark .
" But all the brave talk about bringing our troops home , and setting deadlines , and getting out by a certain date just dissipated . "
She was referring specifically to the White House 's successful effort to stem Republican support for Senator Jim Webb 's legislation to limit troop deployments , which failed today in the Senate by a vote of 56 - 44 , short of the 60 it needed to pass .

Merrill Lynch ’s directors may be weighing E. Stanley O’Neal ’s future , but one thing is already guaranteed : a payday of at least $ 159 million if he steps down .
Mr. O’Neal , the company ’s chairman and chief executive , is entitled to $ 30 million in retirement benefits as well as $ 129 million in stock and option holdings , according to an analysis by James F. Reda & Associates using yesterday ’s share price of $ 66.09 .
That would be on top of the $ 70 million he took home in his nearly five years on the job .
Under Mr. O’Neal , Merrill moved aggressively into lucrative businesses like the packaging of subprime mortgages and other complex debt securities .
That led to a string of blow - out quarters — and blow - out paydays .
Last year , Mr. O’Neal ’s $ 46.4 million pay package made him Wall Street ’s second - highest paid chief executive , behind Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , who was paid $ 54.3 million , according to Equilar research .
But those big bets appeared to go bust this week .
Merrill announced an $ 8.4 billion write - down , raising questions about whether Mr. O’Neal will keep his job .
One thing that he surely will hold onto , though , are the giant paychecks he has collected .
In a move that has executives from movie studios and record labels grinning from ear to ear , AT&T has announced that it will develop and deploy technology that will attempt to keep pirated content off its network .
The move is spurred in part by the company 's decision to offer IPTV television service as part of its U - Verse package , AT&T senior VP James W. Cicconi told the Los Angeles Times .
The first step for AT&T is coming up with a technological solution that works : something that can effectively filter out illicit traffic while protecting its users ' privacy .
That 's a tall — if not impossible — order .
YouTube has n't managed to do it even for video yet , and that 's when customers are sending them entire files which they can scan at their leisure .
Monitoring all the files sent through BitTorrent — which splits them into tiny pieces — could be even more difficult ; doing it in real - time sounds both expensive and impossible .
Without human intervention , it 's also tough to tell if copyrighted content is even " piracy . "
Fair use carves out exceptions for news reporting , criticism , and commentary ( among other things ) which is nearly impossible for a machine to understand in context .
Despite the major technical problems inherent in such a program , AT&T is moving ahead .
By making themselves into the arbiters of copyright law , the company risks being drawn into a costly " arms race " with programmers who do n't like the idea of a massive corporation ( and one which appears to have turned over information to the NSA ) peeking into their packets and deciding which ones go through .
This is exactly the situation that Dr. Greg Jackson , CIO of the University of Chicago , warned Congress about last week .
" The only successful , robust way to address problems that involve personal responsibility and behavior is with social rather than technological tools , " he said in a hearing .
" If we instead try and restrict behavior technologically ... the only result will be an arms race that nobody wins . "
There 's a certain creepiness to having one of the country 's largest IP networks doing deep packet inspection and monitoring , but consumers who value their privacy can always go somewhere else , right ?
Not necessarily .
In addition to running a massive network of its own , AT&T runs a good chunk of the backbone infrastructure in the US .
It 's a rare bit of traffic that can make it to its destination without passing on to an AT &T - owned network .
If the company deploys its anti-piracy technology to all data passing through its networks , AT&T's " solution " could affect most US Internet users .
In addition , many US residents have limited broadband choices .
The company says it will target only repeat offenders and that it will not violate user privacy or FCC directives on network openness .
Who knows how this is all supposed to work , especially as legal , unencrypted files flow across the Internet from sites like iTunes and eMusic , along with thousands of smaller sites that serve as promotional vehicles for independent bands and filmmakers ?
We suspect that AT&T will start small , deploying some sort of P2P solution that looks for the transfer of unencrypted Hollywood blockbusters and major - label bands in complete form .
The most likely scenario is the deployment of new traffic - shaping hardware that can tell what protocol is being used by watching packets ( but without doing deep inspection ) .
Only those using BitTorrent , FTP , or other targeted protocols would receive deeper scrutiny ; e-mail and web requests should remain private in such a system .
Given AT&T 's size , though , even in an almost - perfect system could cause problems .
Assuming ( and this is a big assumption ) that whatever solution they roll out works with 99.5 percent accuracy , then AT&T will still have a 0.5 percent false positive rate .
That 's pretty good , but 0.5 percent of a gazillion users is still plenty of users .
The company 's focus on " repeat offenders " may be a way of avoiding this problem by only flagging users who share illicit files multiple times and are unlikely to be falsely flagged in every case .
All of this appears to be in the talking stages for the moment , though , so we 'll have to wait awhile to find out exactly how Big Brother - ish it turns out to be .
What it does indicate is that AT&T , once just a network provider , has recognized the importance of content to its own business .
" We do recognize that a lot of our future business depends on exciting and interesting content , " Cicconi told the Times .
All too often , we become ensnared by the familiar phenomenon :
We make rules based on the reasons that they make a lot of sense .
We follow these rules .
Time passes and things change .
The original reasons for the rules no longer exist , but because the rules are still in place , we continue to follow them .

Jack Thompson , photo : John Loomis / Rolling Stone
Jack Thompson .
As the Red Skull did to Captain America , so Thompson fills gamers everywhere with a teeth - clenching cocktail of rage , vitriol and confused frustration over our inability to understand what exactly is wrong with this guy and why he has to keep acting like such a jerk .
He inspires extreme reactions in virtually everyone he interacts with ; he 's gone so far , even some of his erstwhile allies are beginning to distance themselves from his circus .
But in light of a recent report that the Florida Bar Association has suggested he undergo a psychological evaluation , one question hangs in the air , just begging to be asked :
Is Jack Thompson really crazy ?
A self - described Christian conservative and Republican , Thompson 's beginnings were innocuous enough .
Born in 1951 , he grew up in Cleveland , Ohio , attended Denison University , went to law school at Vanderbilt University where he met his wife , then moved to Florida in 1976 .
He joined the Key Biscayne Presbyterian Church where he became a born - again Christian , got involved in local politics , and if that was the end of the story he'd be well on his way to a very normal , moderately successful and otherwise wholly unremarkable life .
Alas , it was not to be .
As far back as 1987 , Thompson was demonstrating the combination of pitbull tenacity and outrageous behavior that would become his hallmark .
As part of a dispute with Florida radio personality Neil Rogers , Thompson spent eight months recording every broadcast Rogers made , eventually documenting 40,000 individual on - air mentions of his name .
40,000 .
Based on a previous agreement with the radio station , he claimed that saying Jack Thompson 40,000 times was worth $ 200 million and sued for that amount .
The courts disagreed , the suit was dismissed and Rogers remained on the air .
The zaniness continued .
In 1988 , Thompson stood for election as Dade County State Prosecutor against the incumbent Janet Reno , who had recently frustrated him with her refusal to prosecute Rogers for his on - air swipes at him .
At a campaign event , he presented Reno with a letter asking her to indicate , publicly , whether she was homosexual , bisexual or heterosexual .
In response , according to Thompson , Reno put her hand on his shoulder and replied , " I 'm only interested in virile men .
That 's why I 'm not interested in you . "
Thompson filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him .
A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate the charge , which was quickly dismissed as a " political ploy , " and Reno went on to crush Thompson at the polls , winning 69 percent of the vote .
Ever the gracious loser , in 1990 Thompson accused the Switchboard of Miami , a social service group that held Reno as a board member , of placing " homosexual - education tapes " in public schools .
This served as the impetus for Thompson 's first court - ordered psychological examination :
He passed and repeated his allegations of Reno 's lesbianism when she was appointed U.S. Attorney General ; he later accused her of suffering from various mental disorders as a result of side effects of the medication she was taking for Parkinson 's Disease .
That same year , Thompson achieved national prominence as a result of his crusade against the 2 Live Crew album , As Nasty As They Wanna Be , which , although unremarkable by current standards , pushed hard against the limits of what were considered acceptable standards of decency for its time .
In affiliation with the American Family Association , Thompson contacted Florida Governor Bob Martinez and State Attorney Janet Reno , attempting to convince them to investigate whether the album violated Florida 's obscenity laws .
The state prosecutor declined , but Thompson was able to move local officials to action , blocking sales of the album in various locales .
Considering the widespread panic over moral decency and music lyrics during this time , Thompson 's actions appear almost reasonable .
But in this case , the weirdness begins not with his madness , but his method :
In his correspondence , Thompson would often include a photocopy of his driver 's license with a picture of Batman pasted over his photo .
" I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I 'm playing the role of Batman , " he said .
" Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie , I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County . "
The hits keep on coming .
In 1992 , facing disbarment over allegations that he lied in accusations against fellow lawyer Stuart Grossman , Thompson admitted violating Bar rules of professional conduct and agreed to pay a $ 3,000 fine and receive a public reprimand .
In spite of this admission , however , he asked a Florida judge later that same year to declare the Bar Association unconstitutional , claiming it was engaged in a vendetta against him because its pro-gay , liberal agenda conflicted with his religious beliefs .
It was not until 1997 that Thompson would turn his attention to videogames .
On December 1 of that year , 14 - year - old Michael Carneal shot and killed three schoolmates at Heath High School in West Paducah , Kentucky , and wounded five more .
Investigators determined that Carneal was a gamer , regularly playing Doom , Quake , Redneck Rampage , Mechwarrior and others , and that he had accessed online pornography .
In 1999 , Thompson represented the parents of the three murdered children in a $ 33 million lawsuit against two porn websites , creators of the 1995 movie The Basketball Diaries and several game companies .
Although the suit was dismissed in 2001 , a decision which was upheld on appeal , Thompson had found his new bugbear .
Were it not for his uncanny ability to find audiences gullible , naÃ¯ve and uninformed enough to buy into his fiery rhetoric , Thompson would likely be viewed as little more than a real - life incarnation of the famous Wile E. Coyote :
His prey remains elusive , and his methods of pursuit grow more garishly bizarre , but the absolute single - mindedness of his cause is utterly unwavering .
Much like the ambition of Commodus , however , such all - consuming determination and drive can very quickly be turned to zealotry .
The good news for gamers is in spite of the best efforts of zealots throughout recent history , we can still legally drink alcohol , play Dungeons & Dragons and even listen to 2 Live Crew .
Jack Thompson 's combination of paranoia , outlandish behavior and ad hominem attacks against his opponents certainly lend credence to the possibility that the man is dealing with some rather deep - seated psychological issues .
He is inflexible and intractable and possessed of what appears to be a divinely - inspired belief in the rightness of his cause .
And while I 'd certainly be happy to learn that all those things add up to a sum total of crazy , finally and absolutely condemning Thompson to the irrelevance he so richly deserves , I 'm not holding my breath .
I expect we will have to satisfy ourselves with other invectives to describe the man , while we wait patiently for the passage of time to consign him to a historical footnote .

Andy Chalk is a freelance contributor to The Escapist Daily .
In Part I , I discussed the short term factors that have resulted in the recent , rapid increase in the price of gasoline .
But there are a number of underlying , long - term issues that have been major contributors .
I will attempt to address them and answer a number of related questions , such as :
Why have no new refineries been built in the past 30 years ?
Are U.S. refineries breaking down more than normal ?
Are oil companies purposely withholding supplies to keep prices high ?
Have environmental regulations played a role ?
Does the use of ethanol influence gasoline demand growth ?
The answers to some of these questions may surprise you .
Please note that my essays should not be confused with financial advice .
Following Part I , I received a number of e-mails requesting financial advice .
While there are often potential financial implications , I am not a financial planner .
If you choose to make investment decisions based on what you read here , you are on your own .
Further note that it is not my contention that refiners are not benefiting from higher prices .
They are .
But my contention is that prices are n't higher because they have increased margins .
Margins have increased because prices are higher .
U.S. Refinery Capacity
The problem , I have read on many occasions , is that we are n't building any new refineries , and that " limiting refinery capacity seems to make more money for oil companies than expanding it . "
Claims like the following from the Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights - are quite common :
America 's big oil companies figured out long ago that they could make more money by making less gasoline .
That 's why the industry has n't built a new refinery in 30 years .
Since deregulation of the refinery business in 1982 , oil consumption has increased 33 % but oil companies have kept refining capacity near what it was 25 years ago .
Why not ?
They know that the scarcer the product , the bigger the profit .
Even members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources seem to believe this , with New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez recently commenting in a Senate hearing on gas prices :
Senator Menendez :
Is n't there a reality that we are paying for some industry decisions that actually reduced refining capacity in this country ?
I mean there was a time that we had greater refining capacity , and the industry reduced that refining capacity , and as a result of making that decision , consumers today find themselves with exactly the consequences that you have described in your testimony before .
There are elements of fact and elements of fiction in the preceding statements .
So , what 's the scoop ?
Are oil companies cutting refinery capacity in order to boost profits ?
In the past 10 years , refining capacity in the U.S. has increased by about 2 million barrels per day , which is equivalent to about 10 good - sized refineries .
Capacity expansions equivalent to 8 more new refineries have been announced for the next 4 years ( although some refiners have recently suggested that some expansions may be put on hold as a result of the stated goal of reducing gasoline consumption by 20 % in 10 years - in order to avoid an oversupply situation ) .
So while it is true that new refineries are n't being built , it is certainly not true that capacity is stagnant .
There are several reasons for expanding existing refineries as opposed to building new ones .
First , it is less expensive per barrel to expand an existing refinery than to build a new one .
The estimates I have seen suggest that existing refineries can be expanded at 60 % of the per barrel cost of building a new refinery .
Second , the permitting process for building a new refinery is onerous .
A group in Arizona has been trying to build a new refinery , and it took them 7 years just to get the permit .
If they proceed and build the refinery , it will have taken 13 years from the time they started the process .
( Even as I was working on this essay , they have announced a further 1 year delay ) .
Finally , while everyone seems to want more refining capacity , nobody seems to want a refinery in their community .
This makes building a new refinery next to impossible .
As Investor 's Business Daily recently asked Senator Chuck Schumer : " Just where in New York state would you like a new refinery to be built ...? "
However , the critics are correct on one point .
Starting in the early 80's , U.S. refining capacity did drop significantly , before beginning to climb back up in the 90's .
The reason for this is quite simple :
There was far more refining capacity than was warranted by the demand .
The result was that gasoline was $ 1.00 a gallon , and many oil companies were losing money .
Many refineries shut down .
Some oil companies went out of business .
Property values in " oil towns " like Houston plummeted .
Yet many view oil companies as if they are public utilities .
But the majority are owned by shareholders , who expect a return on their investment .
Billions of dollars of capital are risked in this business , and if the rewards are poor ( or negative ) , the risks wo n't be taken .
No industry can be expected to maintain high production levels in the face of poor or even negative margins .
If milk producers make too much milk , prices fall and some producers go out of business .
When that happens , supply is reduced and prices go up .
The same is true for any other business .
Yet people do n't accept this very well in the case of oil companies , because many have come to view cheap gas as an entitlement .
U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has spent quite a bit of time investigating these issues , and his view is probably typical with respect to the evolution of refining capacity :
The Oil Industry , Gas Supply and Refinery Capacity : More Than Meets the Eye
In this report , Senator Wyden presents a number of " smoking guns " , such as this internal Texaco document from 1996 :
“ As observed over the last few years and as projected well into the future , the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the West Coast is the surplus refining capacity , and the surplus gasoline production capacity .
The same situation exists for the entire U.S. refining industry .
Supply significantly exceeds demand year - round .
This results in very poor refinery margins , and very poor refinery financial results .
Significant events need to occur to assist in reducing supplies and / or increasing the demand for gasoline . ”
Senator
Wyden skipped right past the part about poor margins and poor financial results , and focused on the " smoking gun " , that either supplies needed to be reduced or demand for gasoline increased .
He then gives a list of the refineries that have closed since the mid-90's , apparently failing to connect these events with " poor refining margins . "
Here are the refineries he lists that closed in 1995 :
Indian Refining Lawrenceville , IL
Cyril Petrochemical Corp. Cyril , OK
Powerine Oil Co. Sante Fe Springs , CA
Sunland Refining Corp. Bakersfield , CA
Caribbean Petroleum Corp. San Juan , Puerto Rico
Do you recognize any of those names ?
Probably not , because most of the companies that shut down did so because they went out of business .
Margins were too poor to remain in business for some .
For others , it was failure to comply with environmental regulations ( some of the closed refineries are now Superfund sites ) .
Yet Senator Wyden presents a picture in which it was a systematic and cooperative effort between oil companies to reduce refining capacity - and that refinery capacity should have been maintained at any cost ( as long as oil company shareholders are the ones to bear those costs ) .
Somehow " the industry " is culpable for the closure of a number of marginal producers - many of whom went completely out of business .
But it was years of poor returns in this cyclical business that drove down refining capacity .
Even in the past 10 years , refinery margins have turned negative on numerous occasions .
The problem is that many people take a snapshot of the current view and believe this is normal .
See the data that the IEA has accumulated ( XLS download warning ) .
Shall we expect that those who are calling for measures to be taken to address the current refinery margin situation will be calling for the government to extend a helping hand the next time margins go negative ?
Somehow , I doubt it .
( Incidentally , for those who think oil companies have boosted their margins by raising prices , how do you explain the incredible variability from month to month ?
How do you explain negative margins ? )
Paul Sankey , an analyst with Deutsche Bank , testified on May 15th before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
He pointed out the long - term factors that have resulted in the refinery capacity we have today :
The reason for the massive recent run up in prices can be traced back to the last significant period of high prices , in the late 1970s , which forced lower gasoline demand , then more efficient cars , which led to excess refining capacity , which led to years of poor returns in refining ( and cheap gasoline prices ) , which disincentivised investment in refining and encouraged demand , and which has ultimately led to today ’s intense market tightness .
The bottom line on the refinery capacity issue is that yes , refining capacity has been reduced at times .
And there were perfectly valid reasons that this happened .
It is also true that capacity is short at the moment - if the objective is to maintain sub - $ 3 gasoline prices .
But , reduced investment in refining capacity is indeed a key factor behind the current gasoline price spike .
If some want to level the charge that refiners failed to accurately anticipate demand growth , then that charge is accurate .
But like the rest of us , refiners do n't have crystal balls .
Are Oil Companies Purposely Withholding Supplies ?
This charge has been repeated quite a bit lately .
Oil companies are either accused of withholding supplies ala OPEC , or they are accused of stretching out their maintenance in order to keep supplies low .
Let 's address that .
In a very tight market , events that take supply off of the market are likely to drive prices higher .
In light of that , would it be a wise business practice if BP , for instance , purposely slowed down the maintenance at their Whiting , Indiana refinery that is partially closed due to a fire ?
Not a chance .
When BP has supply off the market , it benefits everyone BUT BP .
They are foregoing money every day they have that capacity offline .
The refinery manager at Whiting will have part of his performance graded based on the financial returns of his refinery .
The longer the supply is offline , the worse that grade will be .
Consider a couple of examples .
Say that you operate a 200,000 barrel a day refinery .
Margins are quite good right now - let 's say in your area they are $ 20 a barrel .
So , when the refinery is running normally , you are grossing $ 4 million a day .
Would it make good business sense to cut your capacity in half - to 100,000 barrels a day ?
While such action would probably cause the overall price of gasoline to rise , it is going to have a disproportionate effect on your refinery .
If margins go up to $ 30 a barrel ( although there is no way taking 100,000 barrels off the market would impact margins to that degree ) , you are still $ 1 million a day worse of than you were .
You have given up $ 365 million a year in order to reduce your capacity .
You would have made an incredibly stupid business decision .
In fact , you would be much better off if you could boost capacity by 100,000 barrels a day .
Sure , prices might slightly drop , but your overall profits will be higher , especially in such a tight market .
Furthermore , you do n't know if Shell down the street might be able to make up the production shortfall , pocketing the money that would have been made by your refinery .
( Contrary to popular opinion , oil companies do not consult each other on such issues ) .
You also do n't know if exporters from Europe will respond .
If they respond by boosting exports to the U.S. , now they are pocketing the money that your refinery is losing .
In summary , this is not a rational way to conduct business - unless your margins are negative .
You would be making a decision that will certainly cut the returns at your refinery , while not knowing how your competitors will respond to the supply shortfall .
For another example that many can relate to , consider that you wish to put your house on the market .
Housing prices in your area have been outstanding , and you want to capitalize .
However , you are afraid that by putting your house on the market , you may boost the supply in your area and cause prices to fall .
So , you decide to be a charitable neighbor and keep your house off of the market in order to maintain prices for everyone else .
You will sell some other time , even though the market may not be as good .
If your primary objective is to capitalize on the good housing market , have you made a rational business decision ?
Of course not .
The same is true regarding the charge that oil companies are deliberately prolonging maintenance .
It just would n't make good business sense in this market .
Are Refineries Breaking Down More Than Normal ?
It certainly seems each week brings several new refinery outages .
While refineries still have not reached pre-Hurricane Katrina production levels , most of the outages that you read about are the kinds of things that happen every year .
Practically all refineries have one or more unplanned outages each year .
Most years , when the market is amply supplied , these sorts of events do n't make the news .
But this year , as we have seen , is very different .
As the afore - mentioned Paul Sankey testified :
The poor returns of the 1980s and 1990s have indirectly caused some additional external events that have played into the problems .
The years of losing money caused companies to neglect refining investment , culminating in BP ’s Texas City disaster .
Texas City has now rightly caused other refiners to operate more cautiously – and so less capacity is available .
A second impact of years of reduced investment has been a lack of qualified engineering , procurement and construction staff .
One vital issue here is that the tightness of US refining capacity at this time is not because companies are unwilling to invest in more capacity , it is that they are unable .
Refineries are complex .
Heat is being added to flammable materials , and the entire chain of events depends on a steady supply of raw materials , equipment , and qualified people to keep things running smoothly .
Equipment is going to break down .
A refinery is much more complex than your car .
Yet you would not be surprised if your 30 - year old car had annual maintenance problems .
While this year 's outages may be somewhat above average , similar outages happen every year .
The only difference is that most years there is enough spare capacity that the outages go unnoticed by the media .
The Impact of Environmental Regulations
Let me make it clear that I am in favor of the environmental regulations we have in place .
They have made our air and water cleaner .
But there is a price to be paid for those regulations , and consumers should understand that , as they are the ones who will ultimately bear those costs .
There are several things that can happen when a new regulation is implemented .
First , new regulations may redirect capital that might have gone into expanding refining facilities .
Second , they may increase the costs of producing the fuel .
Third , additional processing , as in the case of ultra - low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) and gasoline - can reduce the overall product yield .
Fourth , and perhaps of greatest importance , additional equipment will increase the complexity of the refinery .
Those are the consequences .
The more complex the refineries are , the more unreliable they are going to be .
With each additional complexity that is added , there are more ways for them to break down .
There is more danger as the inventory of hazardous materials increases .
Politicians who are quick to point fingers should understand that they make their own contribution to supply shortages .
If they are going to hold hearings on gas prices , they need n't ponder " Gosh , I wonder why prices are going up ? "
Stricter environmental regulations - necessary as they may be - are one more piece of the puzzle .
They have helped crimp supplies and add to costs .
Investor 's Business Daily recently touched on this :
Our refineries are doing more than ever , but their numbers are dwindling and no new ones are being built .
The reason is not greed , but cost and regulations .
From 1994 to 2003 , the refining industry spent $ 47.4 billion , not to build new refineries , but to bring existing ones into compliance with ever new and stringent environmental rules .
That 's where those allegedly excessive profits go .
I think most people are willing to pay higher prices for a cleaner environment , but it is important that they understand that this is a component of fuel prices .
The Ethanol Factor
It is a fact that ethanol only contains about 65 % of the energy content of gasoline on a volumetric basis .
Therefore , to displace the gross energy content of 1 gallon of gasoline requires 1/0.65 , or 1.5 gallons of ethanol .
What this means is that as ethanol is put into the gasoline pool , demand will go up simply because the pool now contains less energy .
Is this enough to explain why motor gasoline demand ( which includes blended ethanol ) is at a record high ?
In March of 2007 , ethanol contributed 539 million gallons to the gasoline pool , according to the Renewable Fuels Association ( RFA ) .
This is almost 50 % greater than the 365 million gallon ethanol demand in March of 2006 .
Gasoline demand in March , according to the Energy Information Administration , averaged 9.266 million barrels per day ( up from 9.076 a year earlier ) .
Total gasoline demand in March was then 9.266 million * 31 days * 42 gallons /bbl , or 12.06 billion gallons .
The breakdown would have then been 11.52 billion gallons of gasoline and 0.54 billion gallons of ethanol .
( Ethanol imports have been omitted as their impact would have been pretty small ) .
The energy content , however , of the 12.1 billion gallons would have been equivalent to 11.52 gallons of gasoline plus 0.54 billion gallons of ethanol * 0.65 ( factoring the lower energy content ) , or 11.87 billion gallons of gasoline equivalent fuel .
Therefore , our perceived gasoline demand is 1.9 % ( 12.06/11.87 ) higher than it would be without ethanol in the pool .
In other words , part of the record high gasoline demand we are currently experiencing is due to the fact that ethanol is scaling up rapidly , and it is being counted in the finished motor gasoline pool .
Even if demand was constant on a BTU basis , increasing the fraction of ethanol in the pool will increase the volume demand .
Conclusions
While the immediate cause of skyrocketing gas prices is a combination of record demand and low gasoline inventories in the U.S. , several longer - term factors have contributed .
Following years of poor returns and expensive new environmental regulations , investments into expanding existing refineries dried up .
Many refineries closed their doors permanently , as a number of smaller producers went completely out of business in the 80's and 90's .
The cumulative effect was that refining capacity fell starting in the early 80's , but has recently been climbing back as margins have improved .
Just as we were in an oversupply situation in the 80's , we are now in an undersupply situation if the goal is to keep gasoline below $ 3.00 / gallon .
However , refining capacity has increased significantly in the past 10 years , and looks to continue this trend in the foreseeable future .
But demand growth has remained robust in the face of higher prices , so an oversupply situation in which gasoline returns to $ 2 / gal does not appear likely in the foreseeable future .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Black Americans are failing to climb the social ladder , while a worrying number born into the middle classes are now actually poorer than their parents , according to a study released on Tuesday .

Black Americans are failing to climb the social ladder , while a worrying number born into the middle classes are now actually poorer than their parents , according to a study released on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Lee Celano
The report by Brookings Institution scholar Julia Isaacs found blacks were missing out on a cherished American dream that their children will be economically better off .
“ Children from middle - and upper middle - class black families experience a generational drop in income that is in sharp contrast to the traditional American expectation that each generation will do better than the one that came before it , ” she wrote .
The study was part of the Pew Charitable Trusts ’ Economic Mobility Project .
Two out of three Americans who were children in 1968 grow up to have higher income than their parents , Isaacs found , but less than a third of black children born in the middle classes do better financially than their parents .
In addition , being born into a financially secure home is no guarantee of dying in one , with blacks enjoying significantly less economic protection than white peers .
“ A startling 45 percent of black children whose parents were solidly middle income end up falling to the bottom income quintile , while only 16 percent of white children born to parents in the middle make this descent , ” she wrote .
Isaacs does not specifically discuss outright racial discrimination in the labor market as an explanation for the poorer economic performance of black Americans , although one study that draws this conclusion is cited in the report .
The report examined data on 2,367 individuals who were 18 years old or younger in 1968 .
The middle quintile of the U.S. income distribution covers family incomes between $ 49,000 and $ 65,000 in inflation - adjusted 2006 dollars .
PLIGHT OF BLACK MEN
Family incomes have grown for both groups in the last 30 years , partly because many more women are now working .
But this has not closed the race income gap .
Median black family incomes in 2004 were $ 35,000 , compared with $ 60,000 for whites of similar age , and almost one - quarter of blacks live below federally defined poverty lines , three times more than whites .
Part of the problem has been the decline in the relative economic well - being of black men , which got worse between 1974 and 2004 .
In fact , black men now in their 30s earn roughly 12 percent less than their fathers ’ generation .
Another factor may be the lower level of marriage in the black American population , leading to more single - parent families supported by one income .
So not only are black Americans still poorer than whites , the chances are high that they will remain that way .
“ In terms of absolute , relative and integrated mobility measures , white children have substantially more upward mobility than black children of comparable incomes , ” she said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush said Thursday night conditions on the ground in Iraq have improved sufficiently to start bringing some U.S. troops home , and urged Americans divided over the war to " come together . "
President Bush tells the nation Thursday night that 5,700 U.S. soldiers in Iraq will be sent home by Christmas .
In a televised speech to the nation , Bush said he would reduce U.S. force strength by 5,700 troops by Christmas and , by next July , reduce the number of combat brigades from 20 to 15 -- a decrease of roughly 21,500 troops overall .
The first step in that process will come later this month , when 2,200 Marines leaving Anbar province will not be replaced , the president said .
" The principle guiding my decisions on troop levels in Iraq is ' return on success ' -- the more successful we are , the more American troops can return home , " Bush said during a 17 - minute prime - time address from the Oval Office .
" In all we do , I will ensure that our commanders on the ground have the troops and flexibility they need to defeat the enemy . "
Watch how Bush bought time with the speech »
In the Democratic response , Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said Bush 's speech " does not amount to real change . "
" We intend to exercise our constitutional duties and profoundly change our military involvement in Iraq , " he said .
The top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker told Congress this week that progress had been made on the ground in Iraq since Bush in January sent 30,000 additional troops .
The move was termed " the surge . "
Petraeus said the surge campaign has met its military goals of reducing sectarian killings by more than 50 percent nationwide and by more than 80 percent in Baghdad .
Bush said Petraeus and Crocker " made clear that our challenge in Iraq is formidable , yet they concluded that conditions in Iraq are improving , that we are seizing the initiative from the enemy and that the troop surge is working . "
The president pointed to Anbar province , where security improved after local tribal leaders joined U.S. forces in fighting al Qaeda terrorists .
" The changes in Anbar show all Iraqis what becomes possible when extremists are driven out , " Bush said .
" They show al Qaeda that it cannot count on popular support , even in a province its leaders once declared their home base , and they show the world that ordinary people in the Middle East want the same things for their children that we want for ours . "
Despite progress in Iraq , Petraeus told Congress this week that it would be premature to announce withdrawal plans for the 130,000 U.S. troops who will remain after the five brigades leave by next summer .
However , he said further reductions might be revisited in his next report in March .
Bush told the American people that in their March report , Petraeus and Crocker " will provide a fresh assessment of the situation in Iraq and of the troop levels and resources we need to meet our national security objectives . "
However , he cautioned the process of building a free Iraq " will be difficult , " noting that U.S. political , economic and " security engagement " will extend beyond the end of his presidency in 2009 .
" But it is achievable .
Our military commanders believe we can succeed , our diplomats believe we can succeed .
And for the safety of future generations of Americans , we must succeed , " he said .
Though he hailed security improvements , Bush expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of political change , calling on the Iraqi government to show " the same determination to achieving reconciliation . "
" This is an enormous undertaking after more than three decades of tyranny and division , " Bush said .
" The government has not met its own legislative benchmarks , and , in my meetings with Iraqi leaders , I have made it clear that they must . "
He also called on the Iraqi people to " demand that your leaders make the tough choices needed to achieve reconciliation . "
" As you do , have confidence that America does not abandon our friends , and we will not abandon you , " he said .
The president also turned his attention to Congress and the American people , expressing hope that bitter internal divisions of the war can start to heal .
" Americans want our country to be safe and our troops to begin coming home from Iraq .
Yet , those of us who believe success in Iraq is essential to our security and those who believe we should bring our troops home have been at odds , " Bush said .
" Now , because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq , we can begin seeing troops come home .
The way forward I have described tonight makes it possible , for the first time in years , for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together . "
The president said that " whatever political party you belong to , whatever your position on Iraq , we should be able to agree that America has a vital interest in preventing chaos and providing hope in the Middle East . "
Bush also said critics who charge that " the gains we are making in Iraq come too late " are mistaken .
" It is never too late to deal a blow to al Qaeda , it is never too late to advance freedom and it is never too late to support our troops in a fight they can win , " he said .
Bush ended his speech by calling attention to the death of Army Spc. Brandon Stout of Michigan , whose family , the president said , had e-mailed him .
Brandon volunteered for the National Guard and was killed while serving in Baghdad , the president said .
" His family has suffered greatly .
Yet in their sorrow , they see larger purpose .
His wife , Audrey , says that Brandon felt called to serve and knew what he was fighting for , " Bush said .
Stout 's parents , Tracy and Jeff , wrote Bush .
" ' We believe this is a war of good and evil and we must win ... even if it cost the life of our own son .
Freedom is not free , ' " Bush said .

Conversation with Kip Hawley , TSA Administrator ( Part 2 )
This is Part 2 of a five - part series .
Link to whole thing .
BS : I hope you ’re telling the truth ; screening is a difficult problem , and it ’s hard to discount all of those published tests and reports .
But a lot of the security around these checkpoints is about perception — we want potential terrorists to think there ’s a significant chance they wo n’t get through the checkpoints — so you ’re better off maintaining that the screeners are better than reports indicate , even if they ’re not .
Backscatter X -ray is another technology that is causing privacy concerns , since it basically allows you to see people naked .
Can you explain the benefits of the technology , and what you are doing to protect privacy ?
Although the machines can distort the images , we know that they can store raw , unfiltered images ; the manufacturer Rapiscan is quite proud of the fact .
Are the machines you ’re using routinely storing images ?
Can they store images at the screener ’s discretion , or is that capability turned off at installation ?
KH :
We ’re still evaluating backscatter and are in the process of running millimeter wave portals right alongside backscatter to compare their effectiveness and the privacy issues .
We do not now store images for the test phase ( function disabled ) , and although we have n’t officially resolved the issue , I fully understand the privacy argument and do n’t assume that we will store them if and when they ’re widely deployed .
BS : When can we keep our shoes on ?
KH : Any time after you clear security .
Sorry , Bruce , I do n’t like it either , but this is not just something leftover from 2002 .
It is a real , current concern .
We ’re looking at shoe scanners and ways of using millimeter wave and / or backscatter to get there , but until the technology catches up to the risk , the shoes have to go in the bin .
BS : This feels so much like “ cover your ass ” security : you ’re screening our shoes because everyone knows Richard Reid hid explosives in them , and you ’ll be raked over the coals if that particular plot ever happens again .
But there are literally thousands of possible plots .
So when does it end ?
The terrorists invented a particular tactic , and you ’re defending against it .
But you ’re playing a game you ca n’t win .
You ban guns and bombs , so the terrorists use box cutters .
You ban small blades and knitting needles , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
You screen shoes , so they invent a liquid explosive .
You restrict liquids , and they ’re going to do something else .
The terrorists are going to look at what you ’re confiscating , and they ’re going to design a plot to bypass your security .
That ’s the real lesson of the liquid bombers .
Assuming you ’re right and the explosive was real , it was an explosive that none of the security measures at the time would have detected .
So why play this slow game of whittling down what people can bring onto airplanes ?
When do you say : “ Enough .
It ’s not about the details of the tactic ; it ’s about the broad threat ” ?
KH : In late 2005 , I made a big deal about focusing on Improvised Explosives Devices ( IEDs ) and not chasing all the things that could be used as weapons .
Until the liquids plot this summer , we were defending our decision to let scissors and small tools back on planes and trying to add layers like behavior detection and document checking , so it is ironic that you ask this question — I am in vehement agreement with your premise .
We ’d rather focus on things that can do catastrophic harm ( bombs ! ) and add layers to get people with hostile intent to highlight themselves .
We have a responsibility , though , to address known continued active attack methods like shoes and liquids and , unfortunately , have to use our somewhat clunky process for now .
BS : You do n’t have a responsibility to screen shoes ; you have one to protect air travel from terrorism to the best of your ability .
You ’re picking and choosing .
We know the Chechnyan terrorists who downed two Russian planes in 2004 got through security partly because different people carried the explosive and the detonator .
Why does n’t this count as a continued , active attack method ?
I do n’t want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers .
Or search the Internet for “ BeerBelly . ”
It ’s a device you can strap to your chest to smuggle beer into stadiums , but you can also use it smuggle 40 ounces of dangerous liquid explosive onto planes .
The magnetometer wo n’t detect it .
Your secondary screening wandings wo n’t detect it .
Why are n’t you making us all take our shirts off ?
Will you have to find a printout of the webpage in some terrorist safe house ?
Or will someone actually have to try it ?
If that does n’t bother you , search the Internet for “ cell phone gun . ”
It ’s “ cover your ass ” security .
If someone tries to blow up a plane with a shoe or a liquid , you ’ll take a lot of blame for not catching it .
But if someone uses any of these other , equally known , attack methods , you ’ll be blamed less because they ’re less public .
KH : Dead wrong !
Our security strategy assumes an adaptive terrorist , and that looking backwards is not a reliable predictor of the next type of attack .
Yes , we screen for shoe bombs and liquids , because it would be stupid not to directly address attack methods that we believe to be active .
Overall , we are getting away from trying to predict what the object looks like and looking more for the other markers of a terrorist .
( Do n’t forget , we see two million people a day , so we know what normal looks like . )
What he / she does ; the way they behave .
That way we do n’t put all our eggs in the basket of catching them in the act .
We ca n’t give them free rein to surveil or do dry - runs ; we need to put up obstacles for them at every turn .
Working backwards , what do you need to do to be successful in an attack ?
Find the decision points that show the difference between normal action and action needed for an attack .
Our odds are better with this approach than by trying to take away methods , annoying object by annoying object .
Bruce , as for blame , that ’s nothing compared to what all of us would carry inside if we failed to prevent an attack .
Part 3 : The no-fly list
Posted on July 31 , 2007 at 6:12 AM • 100 Comments
And there in front of you is a person looking up , with a nervous smile .
She has blue eyes , hazel brown hair and freckles .
Her prison number is stamped across her back : 599905 .
Nicole Ann Dupure .
Height : 5ft 2in. Weight : 140 lb .
Date of birth : July 8 1986 .
Earliest release date : Life .
When she was sentenced , the judge ruled that the time she had spent in jail awaiting trial - 264 days - should be credited against her term of incarceration .
What does that mean ?
Nobody can predict when Dupure will die , so nobody can calculate when to let her out .
Her sentence demands she stay in the Robert Scott Correctional Facility , the main women 's prison within the state of Michigan , for the rest of her natural life .
She will never have the chance to demonstrate her remorse or convince anyone she has reformed : it is stipulated she is not entitled to parole .
Dupure was 17 when the crime for which she is convicted took place .
She is one of 2,270 juveniles across the United States who were sentenced to life without parole , a punishment second only in severity to the death penalty .
All were under 18 when they committed the crimes .
Six of them were 13 , and 50 of them were 14 - an age at which US law forbids them to drive a car , give medical consent , vote , leave school , sign a contract , drink alcohol in a bar , serve on a jury , be drafted in the army , live away from home .
Yet they were tried as adults in an adult court and given no possibility of a second chance .
In Michigan , Dupure is one of 307 such inmates , the third highest number in any American state after Pennsylvania and Louisiana .
She describes her prison day .
She gets up at 4 am to work in the kitchen .
She does a 40 - hour week , earning 18 cents an hour .
When she asked the prison authorities if she could take a business vocational course , she was turned down on the grounds that as she will never be set free there is no point learning skills geared to rejoining the outside .
It 's not exactly what she intended to do with her future when she was a teenager , she tells me .
At school she had aspirations to become a medical lab technician , specialising in the treatment of heart defects .
Her background was far from typical for a lifer - no criminal record , no history of alcohol or drug abuse , a high school graduate with mainly B grades .
Her next step was to be college .
A chance encounter when she was 17 changed everything .
She was working in the holidays to earn petrol money at a grocery store near her home in Michigan 's St Clair County .
There was a 19 - year - old working there called William Blevins who was funny and charismatic - they started dating .
" I was n't able to see the warning signs .
My mum did .
She said he did n't seem like a good kid and I should n't be around him as he would bring me down .
I did n't listen to her .
I thought like any teenager that she just did n't want me to have a boyfriend . "
When Blevins was thrown out of his home by his parents , Dupure , by then pregnant , left home to be with him .
" I just did n't want him to be alone , " she says .
They went looking for a motel room to rent .
On April 23 2004 they stopped off at Big Boy , a fast - food restaurant she knew well because it was near the apartment of her great - aunt 's best friend , Shirley Perry .
Perry , who was 89 , used to babysit for Dupure when she was very young ; Dupure and Blevins had been to her flat several times , offering to help her with shopping and odd jobs .
At this point the official version parts company with Dupure's .
In court , the prosecution alleged that the teenagers plotted together to kill Perry for her money .
They took just $ 30 from her flat to pay for motel fees and two milkshakes at Big Boy .
Dupure actively participated in the murder , striking the old woman on the head with a cooking pot and fetching the kitchen knife Blevins used to kill her .
Dupure insists she was not in the apartment at all , but waited in the restaurant , oblivious to the events unfolding , while Blevins went off on his own .
What is certain is that Blevins murdered the old woman , stabbing her several times and strangling her .
Under police questioning he admitted it , saying he acted alone .
But shortly before he went on trial he changed his evidence and put Dupure alongside him at the scene of the murder .
In return , the prosecution agreed he should be given the lesser charge of second - degree murder and avoid lifelong incarceration .
Under cross-examination , he conceded to the jury , " I never had intentions to pin it on her until I ran out of options . "
Blevins got 20 to 50 years , with the hope of reducing his sentence through good behaviour .
Dupure got life without parole , with no forensic evidence tying her to the crime and entirely on the strength of Blevins ' testimony .
Dupure has just turned 21 but she still looks 17 .
She was told about life without parole for the first time when she entered prison - " You never go home . "
She spent much of her first year crying , she says .
The prison doctor put her on Prozac but she stopped taking it ; as she puts it , " I 'm depressed because I 'm in this place , not because I 'm depressed . "
Instead , she sees the prison therapist once a month .
She finds talking to the therapist helpful - she can't be open with other prisoners about her fears and despair , as it would be taken as a sign of weakness .
In prison , " you have to pretend to be strong " .
" The difficult bit is blocking out the thought that I 'm here for ever .
You can only do that for so long , and then you break down .
Something hits you .
Somebody will say , ' I 'm glad I have n't got life ' and it will get you .
Or one of the friends you made will leave for the outside and that hurts , so you stop getting close to people . "
She was recently sent a questionnaire by lawyers conducting a survey of juvenile prisoners on life without parole .
Asked what was the most difficult challenge she faced inside , she wrote , " Trying not to feel alone . "
Michigan is one of 41 states in America that allows children under 18 to be imprisoned for the rest of their lives .
The US is among a tiny minority of countries ( Somalia is another ) that have refused to sign up to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that expressly forbids the practice .
According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , only three other countries - Israel , South Africa and Tanzania - mete out the sentence and they have collectively just 12 prisoners serving it .
Technically , a child of any age could be incarcerated for life in Michigan for first - degree murder .
Above the age of 14 , suspects can be placed directly into the adult court system .
At that point , even the judges ' hands are tied .
If a child is convicted in an adult court of a range of serious offences - taking part in a robbery that leads to murder , say - they must automatically be given life without parole , even where the judge feels that is inappropriate .
That 's what happened to Matthew Bentley .
Prisoner 271014 .
Height : 5 ft 4in. Weight : 135lb .
Date of birth : October 4 1982 .
Bentley broke into a house in Michigan 's Colfax township on September 2 1997 looking for a car to steal and some ready cash .
By ill luck , he chose a house where the owner was a gun enthusiast and had 25 handguns and rifles on the property .
Bentley had no experience with firearms , but when he came across them in the hallway , he grabbed a couple of handguns along with a bottle of Coke .
The woman of the house , Betty Bardell , surprised him when she walked into the hallway shouting , " What the hell are you doing here ?
I 'm going to call the police ! "
Bentley pointed one of the guns at her and pulled the trigger .
The bullet hit her in the left shoulder , and she fell to the floor bleeding .
He told me what happened next : " I stood over her and I spoke to her and I said , ' I 'm sorry .
If I could I would call the police to get you out . '
I cried a little bit .
And then I left . "
Bardell bled to death on the carpet .
There is nothing innocent about Bentley .
He has never disputed what he did .
He was aware immediately he pulled the trigger that he had done a terrible thing .
" Have I felt remorse ?
I felt sorry from the first second and I always have done . "
The only mitigation was his age and his background .
When he murdered Bardell , Matthew Bentley was 14 .
His legal file contains details of his immediate family ...
Father :
In jail for sexually abusing a relative .
Mother : Alcoholic ; facing trial for receiving stolen property .
Half - brother :
In jail for raping a family member .
Sister K : Alcoholic .
Sister T : History of arrests for domestic assault .
Half - sister C : In mental hospital .
Bentley 's parents , Terry and Debra , were serial divorcees .
They married in 1975 and divorced two years later .
Terry took a second wife , Grace , in 1978 .
They divorced a year later .
Terry remarried Debra in 1980 , and she gave birth to Matthew in 1982 .
They divorced for the second time in 1989 .
Terry remarried Grace in 1991 , by which time he was already in jail as a sex offender .
Matthew 's childhood was as you might expect in the circumstances .
He was a straight E grade student .
He was regularly suspended for truancy and often in trouble with police .
He started smoking dope aged 10 .
He was in and out of children 's homes , and at the time he murdered Bardell he was on Zoloft for depression and Dexedrine for hyperactivity .
The jury took just an hour to find him guilty in July 1998 .
He was 15 by then .
One of the jurors told the local paper that " a couple of the older ladies on the jury broke down when we got in the jury room .
They had feelings for the Bentley kid and they said they had grandchildren about his age . "
Judge Richard Knoblock gave him the only sentence available to him under Michigan law .
But he made his feelings clear .
" I do n't agree with the legislature that he should be sent away for the rest of his life without parole , " the judge said .
" It was a horrendous crime he committed and certainly he should be punished very severely .
I 'm just not confident in having to lock him up for ever . "
Bentley is now 24 .
He says he has spent the past nine years in jail first in denial , then in deep despair , and now in some degree of reconciliation with his fate .
He has stopped fighting in prison and no longer gets punishment cards .
He has thought , too , about why he did what he did when he was 14 .
" I was a child trying to be a man .
I tried to step up to the roles that were missing in my home .
I thought I 'd get away with it .
Even that was childish . "
There is another document in his file , a poem that he wrote about his time inside .
Part of it reads :
" Everyday that goes by ,
You know you have to die
before you finish your time .
Suddenly you 're all alone
and 50 or 60 years is too damn long .
Isolated in a world turn cold . "
There are only three ways that prisoners put away for life as juveniles can hope to see the outside again .
They can win an appeal , by proving there was a flaw in the trial process - they cannot challenge the sentence itself .
They can receive a pardon from the governor of Michigan - except the governor has never pardoned a juvenile lifer .
Or the state assembly could pass legislation outlawing the practice , and implement it retroactively .
Lawyers working on many of the 307 cases have pulled together a bill that would do just that , which they hope will go before Michigan 's lawmakers this autumn .
Deborah LaBelle , a leading lawyer who is supporting the bill on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union , says she is as hopeful as she has ever been that the legislation might pass .
" Sending someone to prison is partly about public security and partly about punishment .
People are coming to understand that child prisoners should have a chance to prove they no longer pose a risk .
And on punishment , then surely having a person spend more of their life in a prison cell than they had lived as children on the outside has to be sufficient even for the most unforgiving of people . "
LaBelle has been careful to involve victims of juvenile crime and their families in the debate about changing the law , and several victims ' families have privately offered their support .
" They say that what happened was horrible and has devastated them , but they do not want the knowledge that the child who committed the crime will stay in jail for ever to rest on their conscience . "
Kevin Boyd .
Prisoner 251328 .
Height : 5ft 7in. Weight : 170 lb .
Date of birth : September 26 1977 .
He was 16 when , on August 6 1994 , he helped his mother murder his own father .
Like Matthew Bentley , Boyd came from a disturbed home .
His mother , Lynn , was addicted to prescription and illicit drugs , his father , Kevin , was an alcoholic who regularly beat him .
His parents separated on Boxing Day when Boyd was 11 and his mother went to live with another woman .
Boyd went to 10 different schools before he dropped out at 15 .
He received psychiatric treatment and was in hospital after a suicide attempt .
On the night of the murder , Boyd 's mother , high on drugs , met him at a Burger King and asked him for the keys to his father 's flat , saying she was going to kill him .
He handed over the keys .
The next morning Boyd went to his father 's flat and , hearing no one inside , forced open the door .
Kevin senior was slumped in his easy chair .
He had been bludgeoned with a baseball bat and stabbed 23 times .
Boyd was interrogated by police for eight hours .
He told them he had handed over the keys and that was all .
Then a second team of officers questioned him .
They turned off the tape recorder , and kept repeating to him the mantra , " The truth will set you free . "
" Every time I tried to tell them what happened , they shouted me down .
' No , you did n't do that !'
This sounds totally irrational , I know , but after hours of that , I thought if I told them what they wanted they would let me out and it would all go away . "
He confessed to having been the one to stab his father 23 times , and was given life without parole .
Boyd has contemplated his actions and its consequences a great deal over the past 12 years in jail .
He is writing an account of his childhood , the murder and his subsequent imprisonment .
Though he protests that he was not the killer , he still holds himself wholly to blame for giving his mother the keys and thinks it was right that he was sent to prison for many years .
" I 'm not innocent .
I was responsible for his death .
I could have said no to my mother .
I could have picked up the phone to warn my father .
Anything .
But I did n't , and I am suffering the consequences . "
He says he has made that phone call to his father a " million times " .
" I think about it every night before I go to sleep . "
He has had a clean prison record for six years and leads a pretty solitary existence .
He once had a pet , an injured meadow vole he found in the exercise yard that he nursed and then let go .
He has n't had a human visitor for 10 years , though he does correspond with his mother who is a lifer in the same prison as Dupure .
He finds comfort in playing guitar , jogging around the yard and writing his memoir .
In one chapter he says sorry to his father .
" If I could change it , I would die in your place , just to hear your rare but contagious laugh one more time .
Dad , I am so , so sorry .
For what it 's worth , I always loved you .
I always loved you both . "
Donald Logan .
Prisoner 132850 .
Height : 5ft 5in. Weight : 135 lb .
Date of birth : June 23 1954 .
He was tried and convicted twice for the murder of a paperboy , Thomas Eldridge , who went to his school .
They were both 16 .
At the first trial , Logan , who is black , was found guilty by 12 white jurors .
His lawyers appealed on the grounds that the racial composition of the jury was prejudicial , and a retrial was ordered .
In the second trial there were 11 white jurors , including two who were members of whites - only organisations .
The 12th juror was black , but during the course of the hearing it emerged that she was the aunt of the prosecution 's key witness who was giving evidence against Logan in exchange for a reduced sentence .
Logan 's case illustrates two key statistics about juvenile life without parole .
Of the 307 prisoners in Michigan on that sentence , 69 % are black , compared with 15 % of the state 's population as a whole .
A study by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty also found that more than one in four of the juveniles incarcerated for ever was convicted of " felony murder " - serious crimes during which someone is killed yet where the juvenile did not personally or directly cause the death .
The prosecution case against Logan was that he identified the paperboy to a gang of his elder brother 's friends who had robbed Eldridge the previous week and wanted to prevent him giving evidence against them .
Logan was alleged to have acted as lookout when two of the gang members shot the boy .
It was never alleged he had pulled the trigger himself or even held a gun .
" I killed nobody , " Logan said .
" The guys asked me who was the paperboy .
I was the one who pointed him out .
That 's all I did . "
At the trial , a psychologist who examined Logan said that though he was 17 by then , he had the level of understanding of a 12 - year - old .
The pre-sentence investigation described him as being " a failure in almost everything he ever tried " and he was labelled a " retard " .
As soon as he was arrested , aged 16 , he was placed in an adult jail where he faced physical and sexual harassment from older prisoners .
" That 's one of the things I 'd preach if I ever get out : never send a teenager to adult prison .
They are just like a little animal who will get eat up the minute they arrive , " he told me .
In the early 90s , Logan taught himself to read and write and discovered , to his own surprise , that he was n't a " retard " after all .
He also became a Jehovah 's Witness and , with the help of the Bible , he has learned how to live peacefully in prison .
The last time he had a disciplinary ticket was in 1996 .
" I can see now how I messed up my whole life .
But I 've also learned something in all these years inside : how to be a man , how to respect people , how not to take life for granted . "
Under the terms of his sentence , though , he will never be able to argue in front of a parole board that he has changed .
His most recent - and final - appeal against his sentence was in October 2001 .
His lawyers argued that to keep him inside any longer was tantamount to warehousing .
They said he had proven himself to be a reliable , God-fearing and reformed person .
The judgment handed down at the end of that appeal sits in his legal file .
It reads : " It is ordered and adjudged that the petition for habeas corpus be , and hereby is , DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE . "
So what if life continues to mean life ?
What if this autumn 's bill falls ?
What if Donald Logan , and all the others , remain in their cells to the day they die ?
I had been intending to put some of those questions to a man , now aged 70 , who knows he will never see the outside of a prison again .
Allen Smith .
Prisoner 085017 .
Height : 6 ft. Weight : 158lb .
Date of birth : December 6 1936 .
He sent me word that he was keen to talk to me , but warned that he had n't been feeling well lately and had been spending a lot of time in the prison infirmary .
He would telephone me at his lawyer 's office .
As I waited for the call , I read his file .
Smith had an unhappy relationship with his stepfather , had been in and out of homes , and had a reputation for angry outbursts .
He was 16 when , on December 2 1953 , he walked up to the house of an old couple he knew well , Robert and Celeste Holton .
He said he only intended to steal from the couple but things got out of control .
He picked up a deer rifle that happened to be standing by their refrigerator .
Afterwards , he said he did n't know what came over him , why he emptied the whole cartridge and killed them both .
He was arrested that day and taken to prison .
The lawyer appointed to his case advised him to plead guilty .
That way he would be out after 10 years .
" Listen to him , son , " said the sheriff .
" He 's telling you right . "
Smith did as he was advised and on December 19 , just 17 days after the murder , he was sentenced to life without parole .
The judge said he had no choice .
" It is hard on the court and hard on you and hard on everybody , and too hard on the two dead people , but crime does not pay , " he said .
Smith spent several years in solitary confinement with hard labour .
He writes in his file that soon after the murder he was struck by a deep feeling of remorse .
" I had hoped they 'd take my own life , and I could n't understand how I could have done such a thing to such wonderful people , because they really were .
It really tore me apart for a long time . "
Details from the file are sketchy , but he has clearly suffered other periods of anger and despair , punctuated by moments of hope and happiness .
He realised only a few years into his sentence that he would stay in jail for ever .
In 1976 he tried to build a better life for himself in prison and he married a woman who had been visiting him .
At the time he had hopes he might be given a parole hearing .
When it became clear those hopes were groundless , he told the woman he wanted a divorce , to spare her .
They still write .
Then in 1982 he escaped from prison , and was recaptured after a few days .
Futilely , he was given an additional five years on his sentence .
Recently he has become more at ease with himself .
He took up courses in Bible studies and literacy .
He has also versed himself in the law , and until he became ill would act as a legal adviser to younger prisoners , helping them prepare appeals .
Smith writes in his file that he has come to accept that he will die in jail .
In an entry a few months ago , he says he is certain he has not long to live .
He says religion has proved a comfort to him : " I know I have been forgiven . "
I spent most of the day in the lawyer 's office waiting for his call .
It never came .
Nicole Dupure is at the beginning of the journey and has the experience of despair and reconciliation still in front of her .
She 's started to think about what has happened to her and why .
" I just wanted to grow up too fast , I wanted it all right then . "
Her mother and father visit her regularly .
" I do my best to hide it when I 'm not coping .
Especially from my dad .
He 's 73 and he thinks he will die before I get out . "
Her child by Blevins is now two years old and has been adopted by Dupure 's mother .
The little girl came to see Dupure for the first and only time in April .
Dupure was shocked because she had assumed her daughter would not remember her , but she did and ran into her arms calling , " Mummy ! "
It 's time to go and I ask Dupure a couple of last questions .
Should the bill fail this autumn , should she remain in jail for ever , could she find any value in life ?
" I 'm going to keep positive , " she replies .
" I 'm not going to try to kill myself or anything .
I 'm in prison , yes , but it 's still a life .
I 'm just in another world now . "
And her regrets ?
" I just wish I 'd listened to my mum .
She laughs when I say that and says , ' It 's a little late now , Nic . ' "
I stand to leave , walking back past the observation post and into the antechamber with the sliding iron doors .
The woman guard steps forward to meet me and shouts , " Closing ! " for a second time .
Israel alleges that Hizbullah militants in Lebanon have rearmed with new long - range rockets capable of hitting Tel Aviv and tripled their arsenal of land - to - sea missiles since last summer 's war , the United Nations secretary - general said in a report Wednesday .
Ban Ki-Moon said the reports of Hizbullah 's rearming are a cause of great concern for the stability of Lebanon .
" Israel has stated that the nature and number of weapons in Hizbullah 's control constitutes a strategic threat to its security and the safety of its citizens , " he said .
Israel claims Hizbullah 's long - range rocket force is stationed in areas north of the Litani River and that most of the new rockets , including hundreds of Zilzal and Fajr generation rockets , have a range of 155 miles , " enabling them to reach Tel Aviv and points further south , " the report said .
" Israel also claims that Hizbullah has tripled its shore - to - sea C- 802 missiles and have established an air defense unit armed with ground - to - air missiles , " Ban said .
While Israel has not provided the United Nations with specific intelligence due to the sensitivity of the sources , Ban said several speeches by Hizbullah 's leader Hassan Nasrallah in the past few months " seem to confirm these Israeli claims . "
' Israel undermining UN 's credibility '
Senior Hizbullah officials have said Nasrallah 's comments were made to serve as a deterrent to aggression rather than as threats to Israel , Ban said .
" Reports of rearming are a cause of great concern which pose serious challenges for the sovereignty , stability and independence of Lebanon , " he added .
Ban said Israel 's contention that Hizbullah has rearmed to a level higher than before last year 's war — and that arms continue to be smuggled across the Lebanon - Syria border despite Syrian denials — raise serious concerns about implementation of the UN resolution that ended the 34 - day war between Israel and Hizbullah .
Under the Security Council resolution , weapons transfers to the Iranian - and Syrian - backed militants are banned .
Ban warned during a visit to Lebanon in March that arms smuggling threatened the Aug. 14 , 2006 cease - fire .
The resolution calls for the disarming of all militias .
Ban said there has been no progress the disarmament of Hizbullah and other militias , although he sees this as essential to fully restoring government authority throughout the country .
The current political crisis in Lebanon has hindered efforts to implement the resolution .
Ban has said the Shebaa Farms , captured by Israel during the 1967 war , " remains a key issue " in implementing the 2006 resolution .
The United Nations determined that the area is Syrian .
But Lebanon claims Shebaa Farms — a claim backed by Syria — and Hizbullah continues to fight over the disputed land , arguing that Israel 's occupation justifies its resistance .
The report for the first time publishes the provisional " definition " of the Shebaa Farms area , which was prepared by a senior UN cartographer .
Ban said he is encouraged by the Lebanese government 's first strides to enhance the control of its borders .
He again urged Syria to demarcate its border with Lebanon and establish formal diplomatic relations with its neighbor .
He criticized Israel for failing to provide Lebanon with " the exact location , quantity and type of cluster munitions utilized during last summer 's conflict " which has led to an increasing number of deaths and injuries of Lebanese civilians .
" Israel 's continued violations of Lebanese airspace not only constitute repeated violations of Security Council resolutions but also undermine the credibility of the UN ... and damage efforts to reduce tension , build confidence and stabilize the situation in southern Lebanon , " Ban said .
ALBANY , Aug. 22  After a bloody raid by American military forces on an enemy camp in Rawah , Iraq , on June 11 , 2003 , a Defense Department report took inventory .
Eighty suspected terrorists killed .
An enormous weapons cache recovered .
And , in what the report called “ pocket litter , ” a notebook with the name and phone number of the imam of a mosque halfway around the world , here in the state capital .
Prompted by that notebook and records of 14 phone calls between the imam , Yassin M. Aref , and Damascus , Syria , the Federal Bureau of Investigation quickly began a sting operation aimed at Mr. Aref .
Federal agents used an informant with a long history of fraud who spun tales to Mr. Aref about a fictitious plot involving shoulder - launched missiles and the assassination of a Pakistani diplomat in New York .
Mr. Aref and a friend who owned a pizzeria were convicted of supporting terrorism by agreeing to help launder money for the fake operation , and in March the two men were sentenced to 15 years in prison .
But their case seems far from over , and it has become a centerpiece in the effort to challenge one of the Bush administration ’s signature espionage programs .
So there ’s a running debate in libertarian circles about whether Randy Barnett ’s a libertarian or not , and it ’s getting old .
This is a superficially free country ; Barnett and his buddies can employ any nomenclature they like .
Barnett does seem to be true blue on all the issues critical to neolibertarians — some pot for every chickenhawk and a meth lab in every garage — and perhaps anyone who bats above .500 on a given list of public policies should be called a libertarian .
Hmm , he ’s for a liberal application of the biggest , most destructive government program around — but he ’s really solid on a toddler ’s right to pornography , so we ’ll call it even .
Whatever floats your boat , dude .
What bothers me is the notion that Barnett ’s recent Wall Street Journal piece credibly represents anything like libertarianism .
Even putting philosophical matters to the side , I defy anyone who does n’t watch Fox News 24/ 7 to read Barnett ’s op - ed without wincing .
At this moment , when most Americans have finally pulled their heads out of their hindquarters to oppose the Iraq war and occupation , Barnett counsels libertarians , the vast majority of whom have opposed the war all along , to jump on the pro-war bandwagon !
For practical political reasons , no less !
It would be a shame if this misinterpretation [ that libertarians uniformly oppose the war on libertarian grounds ] inhibited a wider acceptance of the libertarian principles that would promote the general welfare of the American people .
Yes , it sure would suck if the majority of Americans suspected us of sharing their thoughts on a matter of great import .
And try holding down your breakfast as you witness the lap dance Barnett gives Rudy Giuliani :
During that debate , the riveting exchange between Rudy Giuliani and Ron Paul about whether American foreign policy provoked the 9/11 attack raised the visibility of both candidates .
When Mr. Paul , a libertarian , said that the 9/11 attack happened “ because we ’ve been over there .
We ’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years , ” Mr. Giuliani ’s retort –that this was the first time he had heard that “ we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq .
. . . and I ’ve heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11 ” –sparked a spontaneous ovation from the audience .
It was an electrifying moment that allowed one to imagine Mr. Giuliani as a forceful , articulate president .
Articulate ?
That thuggish , ignorant non-response was articulate ?
If I were in my teens or early twenties and searching for a political identity , and I had a typical young person ’s knowledge of political theory , this would send me running in disgust from libertarianism .
Barnett ’s op - ed merely confirms the left - right caricature of libertarianism as a trivia - obsessed offshoot of the GOP — and places support for a stupid , immoral , unpopular war front and center !
What ’s not to hate ?

I usually prefer to be selective with my ironies — I like to parcel them out tastefully , subtly , unpredictably , like a playful summer rain lightly nurturing the wildflowers of early June .
When someone asks me for directions to the local school for the deaf , I do n’t automatically pretend I ca n’t hear the question .
But this time it ’s out of my hands .
Owing to laziness , busyness , and a bogus holiday that shut down all the city ’s mailrooms at the worst possible moment , I have been forced , very much against my will , into the most blindingly obvious irony I ’ve ever been obliged to arch my inner eyebrows at : I have to start writing my review of Pierre Bayard ’s How to Talk About Books You Have n’t Read without actually having read the book .
I imagine that every other reviewer in America is , at this very moment , chortling into his tweed collar while pretending to do the same thing .
But I ’m telling you it ’s really happening to me , and I ’m unhappy about it .
Fortunately , the book ’s absence from my life has n’t prevented me , as a citizen of the United States of Amazonikipedia , from learning everything there is to know about it .
I know , for instance , that Bayard , a respected literature professor , admits in the preface that he does n’t enjoy reading , has little time for it , and lectures frequently on books he has n’t read — scandalous revelations that helped make the book a sensation in Europe .
I know , from a photo of the book , that it is small and blue .
I know , from Bayard ’s author photo , that he is fiftyish and improbably slim , and likes to dress entirely in black .
In fact , in lieu of reading the actual book , I ’ve spent a very long time scrutinizing this picture , which strikes me as a masterpiece of calculated faux - casual self - revelation : Bayard leans against a railing in front of a scenic spray of graffiti — a touch of vérité to anchor all the abstraction — and his eyes simmer like coq au vin , and his forehead bunches with a devastating whisper of wrinkle - cleavage ( my God , he is about to think ! ) , and he appears to be sucking on something , perhaps the word oeuvre .
In short , he looks like a foot soldier in the vast army of impish popular intellectuals France has been training since the days of Roland Barthes , just in case the struggle for freedom should ever come down to the ability to wring paradoxes out of a stone or unriddle the world with Lacanian decoder rings .
I like to think of myself as a world - class literary faker .
In second grade , in order to win some kind of certificate , I let everyone believe I had reached the end of an epic novel called The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet , when in fact its heroes had barely even met their first sentient fungi .
I solidified this reputation one day in high - school English class , when , in answer to our teacher ’s impossible question about an Ibsen play we had n’t been assigned to read , I shouted , in a voice of casual authority , “ Ghosts ! ”
When this turned out to be correct ( I had picked a random title from the list on the back cover of A Doll ’s House ) , my classmates looked at me as if I ’d spoken the secret of the universe , and they assumed I was fluent in Norwegian , and started whispering when I passed in the hall .
A decade of college and grad school — boot camps of strategic fakery — immeasurably deepened my arsenal : Today I ’m proficient in such feints as the stretched truth ( “ It ’s funny , I ’ve never actually finished that , ” I ’ll volunteer about War and Peace , of which I ’ve read only the first paragraph ) , the misdirection ( “ Have you read Gravity ’s Rainbow ? ”
“ You know what ’s always bothered me about Pynchon ? ” ) , and , on very rare occasions , the enthusiastic flat - out lie ( “ Did you finish Brideshead Revisited ? ” “ Yes !
Yes , I really did ! ” ) .
My signature move is a mildly orgasmic “ Mmmmm , ” which manages to suggest several things simultaneously : agreement , disagreement , ambivalence , and above all that my familiarity with the book in question is so deep it ’s become muscular and sub-verbal , less a literary opinion than the visceral appreciation of a jaguar for the dawn .
But Professeur Bayard , a practicing psychoanalyst , is not so interested in practical tips .
His goal is more ambitious :
He wants to cure us of the deep cultural neuroses that govern our reading .
His main argument , synopsized identically in reviews from here to Berlin , runs roughly as follows .
Western culture has fetishized books almost as much as it has breasts and cash .
Our reading is governed by a corrosive idealism that fills us all with secret shame :
We believe we should be doing it more and better , and that , until we do , we fully deserve to be sneered at by college dropouts at the Strand .
To Bayard , however , this is unrealistic .
The line - by - line , cover - to - cover experience of a text , he argues , is passé ; true reading consists mainly of nonreading .
By this he means not just an absence of reading but a positive set of shadow skills that we should honor and cultivate and teach to our children : browsing covers and spines , reading first sentences , skimming key passages , monitoring gossip , and b.s. - ing at cocktail parties .
Deep knowledge of a particular book , Bayard contends , is almost always less important than an understanding of that book ’s position in a “ collective library ” — the imagined cluster of books to which it ’s related .
You ’ll probably never need to know , e.g. , that Leopold Bloom eats a Gorgonzola sandwich for lunch , but it might help to know that Ulysses is a long twentieth - century experimental novel by James Joyce , patterned on The Odyssey , and that it uses stream of consciousness to describe a day in the life of a handful of Dubliners .
Bayard is the opposite of old - school canon - boosters like E.D. Hirsch and Harold Bloom , who equate a lack of knowledge about Shakespeare to a lack of opposable thumbs .
In fact , he argues that ignorance of the details of Hamlet ultimately allows us to respond more creatively to the text — and therefore to be more fully ourselves .
The success of How to Talk About Books You Have n’t Read has made the book , no doubt to Bayard ’s utter ecstasy , a perfect mise en abyme of nonreading .
The central question it raises about every other book now applies equally to itself :
Once a text whistles off into the slipstream of international hype , does it still need to exist ?
Or has our society , in its advanced stages of info - fluency , finally managed to do away with the thing itself ?
By the time Bayard ’s book got to me , I was n’t sure what to do with it .
I was already halfway done with my piece , and reading it at this point felt like a surrender to the repressive bourgeois book fetish that I ’d just been thoroughly indoctrinated against by all the other reviews I ’d read , not to mention a clear betrayal of the conceit in my opening paragraph .
I set it aside , unopened , and tried to keep working .
But the tiny Lutheran pastor who lives in my heart wore me down with a series of stern sermons about the sacred trust of book reviewing , and ( since I ’ve always kind of been into repressive norms ) eventually I gave in .
It turns out that Bayard ’s book benefits significantly from not being read .
Although it ’s witty and charming and often fun , it seems to have been designed for abridgment — it ’s best when condensed into bullet points .
Its argument is , despite all the psychoanalytic bells and whistles , pretty familiar .
Is it news to anyone that we forget most of what we read , or that all reading is subjective ?
So to sensationalize matters , he consistently leans on the counterintuitive : Because we can read only a fraction of all the books published , he writes , “ all reading is a squandering of energy . ”
The book ’s tone is stranded halfway between a real work of social theory and satire — it ’s Derrida crossed with “ A Modest Proposal ” — and this tension makes it hard to decide what ’s really at stake .
Even Bayard ’s personal revelation that he ’s “ read relatively little ” turns out to be untrue :
He told an interviewer that the book “ is told by a fictional personality who boasts about not reading and is obviously not me .
This is not a book written by a nonreader . ”
Under the guise of revolutionary honesty , he ’s actually being dishonest .
My biggest gripe is that Bayard ’s conception of reading is entirely social — a way to rack up points at cocktail parties .
At the risk of sounding like the fusty old crank everyone does impressions of in the faculty lounge , I still believe in the private ecstasy of reading .
It ’s one thing to jockey for social position by saying that Dostoyevsky introduced psychology into the novel , or that Chaucer had a fuller grasp of humanity than Shakespeare .
It ’s another thing to experience , with your full attention , Raskolnikov wandering feverishly around St. Petersburg , or the young scholar farting in the face of his romantic rival in “ The Miller ’s Tale . ”
Real reading is not just hoarding fodder for cocktail chatter , it ’s crawling , phrase by phrase , through a text and finding yourself surprised or disappointed or ruined or bored with every other line .
This direct connection — the voice that enters your brain and mingles with your own internal voice — is the only way books really matter , and experiencing it requires a kind of deep surprise at the words in front of you .
If anything , we ’re already too good at talking about books we have n’t read .
The challenge now is to preserve our ignorance .

How to Talk About Books You Have n’t Read
By Pierre Bayard .
Bloomsbury USA . 208 pages .
$ 19.95 .
Many variables affect the evaluation of a personal injury case .
You may prevail on some issues , but not on others .
Because you must consider a variety of trial outcomes , you will need to develop a range of values .
One way to do this is by decision tree analysis .
A decision tree is a graphic illustration of various possible outcomes .
For each issue , there should be a branch going one way for a positive result and the other way for a negative result .
This process can get complex , but do n’t overthink it .
There are rarely more than five crucial issues in any case .
Here is a simplified decision tree :
If the plaintiff cannot prove liability , the case has no value .
Often , questions of comparative fault can arise .
Was plaintiff partially responsible for this outcome ?
Perhaps there are other entities to which responsibility can be assigned who may not even be part of the lawsuit .
In the illustrated case , if the plaintiff can prevail on liability and show the defendant bears all responsibility , plaintiff can expect a valuation of a million dollars .
But what if the jury believes that the plaintiff or someone else bears some responsibility ?
What if the parties disagree about the calculation of the damages ?
Based on a review of the facts and the different positions parties have taken in the history of the litigation , you can define those areas and assign a value for each outcome .
You come up with that value using the methods described in the prior chapters .
Inevitably , you are more likely to prevail on some issues than others .
This decision tree shows five possible outcomes .
But do they each have a one - in - five likelihood ?
You can produce a better evaluation tool by weighting which outcomes are the most likely .
Here is a simplified weighted decision tree analysis for the same case .
Now we have a better guide to making a settlement decision .
Litigators frequently ponder , “ If you tried this case ten times , how many times would you get your best possible outcome ? ”
This chart shows the estimates for a specified result .
One time out of ten , the defendant will win , and the plaintiff will get nothing .
This result is called a “ take nothing ” or that the case was “ defended . ”
Three times out of ten the plaintiff is projected to show full liability , but in only half of those cases will plaintiff be able to prove up damages sufficiently .
According to this chart , the most likely result is that plaintiff will be able to show the defendant is 50 % responsible .
Settlement Statement Shows the Net Result
A settlement statement is a document plaintiff ’s attorney prepares to demonstrate how the money received from the defendant is being allocated and the remaining amount the plaintiff will receive .
At the time of this evaluation , $ 100,000 has been spent to prepare the case .
If plaintiff accepts a $ 300,000 settlement today , the likely settlement statement will look like this :
Attorney Fees ( 1/3 ) $ 100,000.00 Legal Expenses $ 100,000.00 Net to Plaintiff $ 100,000.00 $ 300,000.00
Going to trial is expensive .
Each side must pay to prepare exhibits and for experts ’ time .
Here plaintiff ’s legal expenses to go to trial are estimated at $ 300,000 .
If the plaintiff obtains the higher likely result of $ 500,000 , the settlement statement will look like this :
Attorney Fees ( 1/3 ) $ 166,666.66 Legal Expenses $ 300,000.00 Net to Plaintiff $ 33,333.34 $ 500,000.00
In this scenario , plaintiff would be better off negotiating a settlement of at least $ 300 , 000 , which would still be a bargain for the defendant .
Not only would the defendant end up paying at the low end of the possible verdict range , but defendant would also be avoiding its expense of a trial , probably also about $ 300,000 .
This deal would be what ’s known as a “ win- win ” settlement .
Is there a chance that plaintiff will be entirely successful and get the full million dollars ?
Sure , but your evaluation tells you that the chance of that result is only 15 % .
If a settlement offer comes within the zone of the most likely outcome , are you willing to throw it away and possibly become indebted for additional legal expenses on a 15 % chance of success ?
If you do have a favorable settlement , what will usually occur then is the payment to you will be done through a structured settlement .
Doing so is for not only your benefit but for the interest of the insurance company or defendant .
Usually , agreeing to a structured settlement will give you a higher settlement figure since you agree to accept the payments over time , instead of with a lump sum .
Of course , your attorney will give a recommendation , but often attornies have deals worked out with settlement companies which may not be in your best interest .
Do your homework first as you hired an expert attorney to represent you and you also want an expert serving you for the structured settlement you are about to receive .
Decision tree analysis can help you make better rational decisions about how to negotiate an agreement .…
Continuation Passing Style ( CPS for short ) is a style of programming in which functions do not return values ; rather , they pass control onto a continuation , which specifies what happens next .
In this chapter , we are going to consider how that plays out in Haskell and , in particular , how CPS can be expressed with a monad .
What are continuations ? [ edit ]
To dispel puzzlement , we will have a second look at an example from way back in the book , when we introduced the ( $ ) operator :
> map ( $ 2 ) [ ( 2* ) , ( 4* ) , ( 8* ) ] [ 4,8,16 ]
There is nothing out of ordinary about the expression above , except that it is a little quaint to write that instead of map ( * 2 ) [ 2 , 4 , 8 ] .
The ( $ ) section makes the code appear backwards , as if we are applying a value to the functions rather than the other way around .
And now , the catch : such an innocent - looking reversal is at heart of continuation passing style !
From a CPS perspective , ( $ 2 ) is a suspended computation : a function with general type ( a -> r ) ->
r which , given another function as argument , produces a final result .
The a -> r argument is the continuation ; it specifies how the computation will be brought to a conclusion .
In the example , the functions in the list are supplied as continuations via map , producing three distinct results .
Note that suspended computations are largely interchangeable with plain values : flip ( $ ) [ 1 ] converts any value into a suspended computation , and passing id as its continuation gives back the original value .
What are they good for ?
[ edit ]
There is more to continuations than just a parlour trick to impress Haskell newbies .
They make it possible to explicitly manipulate , and dramatically alter , the control flow of a program .
For instance , returning early from a procedure can be implemented with continuations .
Exceptions and failure can also be handled with continuations - pass in a continuation for success , another continuation for fail , and invoke the appropriate continuation .
Other possibilities include " suspending " a computation and returning to it at another time , and implementing simple forms of concurrency ( notably , one Haskell implementation , Hugs , uses continuations to implement cooperative concurrency ) .
In Haskell , continuations can be used in a similar fashion , for implementing interesting control flow in monads .
Note that there usually are alternative techniques for such use cases , especially in tandem with laziness .
In some circumstances , CPS can be used to improve performance by eliminating certain construction - pattern matching sequences ( i.e. a function returns a complex structure which the caller will at some point deconstruct ) , though a sufficiently smart compiler should be able to do the elimination [ 2 ] .
Passing continuations [ edit ]
An elementary way to take advantage of continuations is to modify our functions so that they return suspended computations rather than ordinary values .
We will illustrate how that is done with two simple examples .

Example : A simple module , no continuations --
We assume some primitives add and square for the example : add :: Int -> Int ->
Int add x y = x + y square :: Int ->
Int square x = x * x pythagoras :: Int -> Int ->
Int pythagoras x y = add ( square x ) ( square y )
Modified to return a suspended computation , pythagoras looks like this :
Example : A simple module , using continuations --
We assume CPS versions of the add and square primitives , -- ( note : the actual definitions of add_cps and square_cps are not -- in CPS form , they just have the correct type ) add_cps :: Int -> Int -> (( Int -> r ) -> r ) add_cps x y = \ k -> k ( add x y ) square_cps :: Int -> (( Int -> r ) -> r ) square_cps x = \ k -> k ( square x ) pythagoras_cps :: Int -> Int -> (( Int -> r ) -> r ) pythagoras_cps x y = \ k -> square_cps x $ \ x_squared -> square_cps y $ \ y_squared -> add_cps x_squared y_squared $ k
How the pythagoras_cps example works :
square x and throw the result into the ( \x_squared -> ... ) continuation square y and throw the result into the ( \y_squared -> ... ) continuation add x_squared and y_squared and throw the result into the top level / program continuation k .
We can try it out in GHCi by passing print as the program continuation :
* Main > pythagoras_cps 3 4 print 25
If we look at the type of pythagoras_cps without the optional parentheses around ( Int -> r ) ->
r and compare it with the original type of pythagoras , we note that the continuation was in effect added as an extra argument , thus justifying the " continuation passing style " moniker .
thrice [ edit ]
Example : A simple higher order function , no continuations thrice :: ( a -> a ) -> a -> a thrice f x = f ( f ( f x ) )
* Main > thrice tail " foobar " " bar "
A higher order function such as thrice , when converted to CPS , takes as arguments functions in CPS form as well .
Therefore , f :: a -> a will become f_cps :: a -> (( a -> r ) -> r ) , and the final type will be thrice_cps :: ( a -> (( a -> r ) -> r ) ) -> a -> (( a -> r ) -> r ) .
The rest of the definition follows quite naturally from the types - we replace f by the CPS version , passing along the continuation at hand .
Example : A simple higher order function , with continuations thrice_cps :: ( a -> (( a -> r ) -> r ) ) -> a -> (( a -> r ) -> r ) thrice_cps f_cps x = \ k -> f_cps x $ \ fx -> f_cps fx $ \ ffx -> f_cps ffx $ k
The Cont monad [ edit ]
Having continuation - passing functions , the next step is providing a neat way of composing them , preferably one which does not require the long chains of nested lambdas we have seen just above .
A good start would be a combinator for applying a CPS function to a suspended computation .
A possible type for it would be :
chainCPS :: (( a -> r ) -> r ) -> ( a -> (( b -> r ) -> r ) ) -> (( b -> r ) -> r )
( You may want to try implementing it before reading on .
Hint : start by stating that the result is a function which takes a b -> r continuation ; then , let the types guide you . )
And here is the implementation :
chainCPS s f = \ k -> s $ \ x -> f x $ k
We supply the original suspended computation s with a continuation which makes a new suspended computation ( produced by f ) and passes the final continuation k to it .
Unsurprisingly , it mirrors closely the nested lambda pattern of the previous examples .
Does n't the type of chainCPS look familiar ?
If we replace ( a -> r ) -> r with ( Monad m ) => m a and ( b -> r ) -> r with ( Monad m ) => m b we get the ( >>= ) signature .
Furthermore , our old friend flip ( $ ) plays a return - like role , in that it makes a suspended computation out of a value in a trivial way .
Lo and behold , we have a monad !
All we need now [ 3 ] is a Cont r a type to wrap suspended computations , with the usual wrapper and unwrapper functions .
cont :: (( a -> r ) -> r ) ->
Cont r a runCont :: Cont r a -> ( a -> r ) -> r
The monad instance for Cont follows directly from our presentation , the only difference being the wrapping and unwrapping cruft :
instance Monad ( Cont r ) where return x = cont ( $ x ) s >>= f = cont $ \ c -> runCont s $ \ x -> runCont ( f x ) c
The end result is that the monad instance makes the continuation passing ( and thus the lambda chains ) implicit .
The monadic bind applies a CPS function to a suspended computation , and runCont is used to provide the final continuation .
For a simple example , the Pythagoras example becomes :
Example :
The pythagoras example , using the Cont monad -- Using the Cont monad from the transformers package .
import Control .

Int ->
Cont r
Int pythagoras_cont x y = do x_squared <- square_cont x y_squared <- square_cont y add_cont x_squared y_squared
callCC [ edit ]
While it is always pleasant to see a monad coming forth naturally , a hint of disappointment might linger at this point .
One of the promises of CPS was precise control flow manipulation through continuations .
And yet , after converting our functions to CPS we promptly hid the continuations behind a monad .
To rectify that , we shall introduce callCC , a function which gives us back explicit control of continuations - but only where we want it .
callCC is a very peculiar function ; one that is best introduced with examples .
Let us start with a trivial one :
Example : square using callCC -- Without callCC square :: Int ->
Cont r
Int square n = return ( n ^ 2 ) -- With callCC squareCCC :: Int ->
Cont r Int squareCCC n = callCC $ \ k -> k ( n ^ 2 )
The argument passed to callCC is a function , whose result is a suspended computation ( general type Cont r a ) which we will refer to as " the callCC computation " .
In principle , the callCC computation is what the whole callCC expression evaluates to .
The caveat , and what makes callCC so special , is due to k , the argument to the argument .
It is a function which acts as an eject button : calling it anywhere will lead to the value passed to it being made into a suspended computation , which then is inserted into control flow at the point of the callCC invocation .
That happens unconditionally ; in particular , whatever follows a k invocation in the callCC computation is summarily discarded .
From another perspective , k captures the rest of the computation following the callCC ; calling it throws a value into the continuation at that particular point ( " callCC " stands for " call with current continuation " ) .
While in this simple example the effect is merely that of a plain return , callCC opens up a number of possibilities , which we are now going to explore .
Deciding when to use k [ edit ]
callCC gives us extra power over what is thrown into a continuation , and when that is done .
The following example begins to show how we can use this extra power .
Example : Our first proper callCC function foo :: Int ->
Cont r String foo x = callCC $ \ k -> do let y = x ^ 2 + 3 when ( y > 20 ) $ k " over twenty " return ( show $ y - 4 )
foo is a slightly pathological function that computes the square of its input and adds three ; if the result of this computation is greater than 20 , then we return from the callCC computation ( and , in this case , from the whole function ) immediately , throwing the string " over twenty " into the continuation that will be passed to foo .
If not , then we subtract four from our previous computation , show it , and throw it into the continuation .
Remarkably , k here is used just like the ' return ' statement from an imperative language , that immediately exits the function .
And yet , this being Haskell , k is just an ordinary first - class function , so you can pass it to other functions like when , store it in a Reader , etc .
Naturally , you can embed calls to callCC within do - blocks :
Example : More developed callCC example involving a do - block bar :: Char ->
String ->
Cont r
Int bar c s = do msg <- callCC $ \ k -> do let s0 = c : s when ( s0 == " hello " ) $ k " They say hello . " let s1 = show s0 return ( " They appear to be saying " ++ s1 ) return ( length msg )
When you call k with a value , the entire callCC call takes that value .
In effect , that makes k a lot like an ' goto ' statement in other languages : when we call k in our example , it pops the execution out to where you first called callCC , the msg <- callCC $ ... line .
No more of the argument to callCC ( the inner do - block ) is executed .
Hence the following example contains a useless line :
Example : Popping out a function , introducing a useless line quux :: Cont r
Int quux = callCC $ \ k -> do let n = 5 k n return 25
quux will return 5 , and not 25 , because we pop out of quux before getting to the return 25 line .
Behind the scenes [ edit ]
We have deliberately broken a trend here : normally when we introduce a function we give its type straight away , but in this case we chose not to .
The reason is simple : the type is pretty complex , and it does not immediately give insight into what the function does , or how it works .
After the initial presentation of callCC , however , we are in a better position to tackle it .
Take a deep breath ...
callCC :: (( a -> Cont r b ) -> Cont r a ) ->
Cont r a
We can make sense of that based on what we already know about callCC .
The overall result type and the result type of the argument have to be the same ( i.e. Cont r a ) , as in the absence of an invocation of k the corresponding result values are one and the same .
Now , what about the type of k ?
As mentioned above , k 's argument is made into a suspended computation inserted at the point of the callCC invocation ; therefore , if the latter has type Cont r a k 's argument must have type a .
As for k 's result type , interestingly enough it does n't matter as long as it is wrapped in the same Cont r monad ; in other words , the b stands for an arbitrary type .
That happens because the suspended computation made out of the a argument will receive whatever continuation follows the callCC , and so the continuation taken by k 's result is irrelevant .
Note
The arbitrariness of k 's result type explains why the following variant of the useless line example leads to a type error : quux :: Cont r
Int quux = callCC $ \ k -> do let n = 5 when True $ k n k 25 k 's result type could be anything of form Cont r b ; however , the when constrains it to Cont r ( ) , and so the closing k 25 does not match the result type of quux .
The solution is very simple : replace the final k by a plain old return .
To conclude this section , here is the implementation of callCC .
Can you identify k in it ?
callCC f = cont $ \ h -> runCont ( f ( \ a -> cont $ \ _ -> h a ) ) h
Though the code is far from obvious , an amazing fact is that the implementations of callCC , return and ( >>= ) for Cont can be produced automatically from their type signatures - Lennart Augustsson 's Djinn [ 1 ] is a program that will do this for you .
See Phil Gossett 's Google tech talk : [ 2 ] for background on the theory behind Djinn ; and Dan Piponi 's article : [ 3 ] which uses Djinn in deriving continuation passing style .
Example : a complicated control structure [ edit ]
We will now look at some more realistic examples of control flow manipulation .
The first one , presented below , was originally taken from " The Continuation monad " section of the All about monads tutorial , used with permission .
Example : Using Cont for a complicated control structure {-
We use the continuation monad to perform " escapes " from code blocks .
This function implements a complicated control structure to process numbers : Input ( n ) Output List Shown ========= ====== ==========
0 - 9 n none 10 -199 number of digits in ( n /2 ) digits of ( n/2 ) 200-19999 n digits of ( n /2 ) 20000-1999999 ( n /2 ) backwards none >= 2000000 sum of digits of ( n /2 ) digits of ( n /2 ) -} fun :: Int ->
String fun n = ( ` runCont ` id ) $ do str <- callCC $ \ exit1 -> do -- define " exit1 " when ( n < 10 ) ( exit1 ( show n ) ) let ns = map digitToInt ( show ( n ` div ` 2 ) ) n' <- callCC $ \ exit2 -> do -- define " exit2 " when ( ( length ns ) < 3 ) ( exit2 ( length ns ) ) when ( ( length ns ) < 5 ) ( exit2 n ) when ( ( length ns ) < 7 ) $ do let ns ' = map intToDigit ( reverse ns ) exit1 ( dropWhile ( == ' 0 ' ) ns ' ) -- escape 2 levels return $ sum ns return $ " ( ns = " ++ ( show ns ) ++ " ) " ++ ( show n' ) return $ " Answer : " ++ str
fun is a function that takes an integer n .
The implementation uses Cont and callCC to set up a control structure using Cont and callCC that does different things based on the range that n falls in , as stated by the comment at the top .
Let us dissect it :
Firstly , the ( `runCont` id ) at the top just means that we run the Cont block that follows with a final continuation of id ( or , in other words , we extract the value from the suspended computation unchanged ) .
That is necessary as the result type of fun does n't mention Cont .
We bind str to the result of the following callCC do - block :
If n is less than 10 , we exit straight away , just showing n .
If not , we proceed .
We construct a list , ns , of digits of n `div` 2 . n' ( an Int ) gets bound to the result of the following inner callCC do - block .
If length ns < 3 , i.e. , if n `div` 2 has less than 3 digits , we pop out of this inner do - block with the number of digits as the result .
If n `div` 2 has less than 5 digits , we pop out of the inner do - block returning the original n .
If n `div` 2 has less than 7 digits , we pop out of both the inner and outer do - blocks , with the result of the digits of n `div` 2 in reverse order ( a String ) .
Otherwise , we end the inner do - block , returning the sum of the digits of n `div` 2 .
We end this do - block , returning the String " ( ns = X ) Y " , where X is ns , the digits of n `div` 2 , and Y is the result from the inner do - block , n' .
Finally , we return out of the entire function , with our result being the string " Answer : Z " , where Z is the string we got from the callCC do - block .
Example : exceptions [ edit ]
One use of continuations is to model exceptions .
To do this , we hold on to two continuations : one that takes us out to the handler in case of an exception , and one that takes us to the post - handler code in case of a success .
Here 's a simple function that takes two numbers and does integer division on them , failing when the denominator is zero .
Example :
An exception - throwing div divExcpt :: Int -> Int -> ( String -> Cont r Int ) ->
Cont r
Int divExcpt x y handler = callCC $ \ ok -> do err <- callCC $ \ notOk -> do when ( y == 0 ) $ notOk " Denominator 0 " ok $ x ` div ` y handler err {- For example , runCont ( divExcpt 10 2 error ) id --> 5 runCont ( divExcpt 10 0 error ) id --> ***
Exception : Denominator 0 -}
How does it work ?
We use two nested calls to callCC .
The first labels a continuation that will be used when there 's no problem .
The second labels a continuation that will be used when we wish to throw an exception .
If the denominator is n't 0 , x `div` y is thrown into the ok continuation , so the execution pops right back out to the top level of divExcpt .
If , however , we were passed a zero denominator , we throw an error message into the notOk continuation , which pops us out to the inner do - block , and that string gets assigned to err and given to handler .
A more general approach to handling exceptions can be seen with the following function .
Pass a computation as the first parameter ( more precisely , a function which takes an error - throwing function and results in the computation ) and an error handler as the second parameter .
This example takes advantage of the generic MonadCont class [ 4 ] which covers both Cont and the corresponding ContT transformer by default , as well as any other continuation monad which instantiates it .
Example : General try using continuations .
import Control .
Monad .
Cont tryCont :: MonadCont m => ( ( err -> m a ) -> m a ) -> ( err -> m a ) -> m a tryCont c h = callCC $ \ ok -> do err <- callCC $ \ notOk -> do x <- c not
Ok ok x h err
And here is our try in action :
Example : Using try data SqrtException = LessThanZero deriving ( Show , Eq ) sqrtIO :: ( SqrtException -> ContT r IO ( ) ) -> ContT r IO ( ) sqrtIO throw = do ln <- lift ( putStr " Enter a number to sqrt : " >> readLn ) when ( ln < 0 ) ( throw LessThanZero ) lift $ print ( sqrt ln ) main = runContT ( tryCont sqrtIO ( lift . print ) ) return
In this example , error throwing means escaping from an enclosing callCC .
The throw in sqrtIO jumps out of tryCont 's inner callCC .
Example : coroutines [ edit ]
In this section we make a CoroutineT monad that provides a monad with fork , which enqueues a new suspended coroutine , and yield , that suspends the current thread .
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} --
We use GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving to avoid boilerplate .
As of GHC 7.8 , it is safe .
import Control .
Applicative import Control .
Monad .
Cont import Control .
Monad .
State --
The CoroutineT monad is just ContT stacked with a StateT containing the suspended coroutines .
newtype CoroutineT r m a = CoroutineT { runCoroutineT ' :: ContT r ( StateT [ CoroutineT r m ( ) ] m ) a } deriving ( Functor , Applicative , Monad , MonadCont , MonadIO ) --
Used to manipulate the coroutine queue .
getCCs :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m [ CoroutineT r m ( ) ] getCCs = CoroutineT $ lift get putCCs :: Monad m => [ CoroutineT r m ( ) ] -> CoroutineT r m ( ) putCCs = CoroutineT .
lift .
put --
Pop and push coroutines to the queue .
dequeue :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m ( ) dequeue = do current_ccs <- getCCs case current_ccs of [ ] -> return ( ) ( p : ps ) -> do putCCs ps p queue :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m ( ) -> CoroutineT r m ( ) queue p = do ccs <- getCCs putCCs ( ccs ++ [ p ] ) --
The interface .
yield :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m ( ) yield = callCC $ \ k -> do queue ( k ( ) ) dequeue fork :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m ( ) -> CoroutineT r m ( ) fork p = callCC $ \ k -> do queue ( k ( ) ) p dequeue --
Exhaust passes control to suspended coroutines repeatedly until there is n't any left .
exhaust :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m ( ) exhaust = do exhausted <- null < $> getCCs if not exhausted then yield >> exhaust else return ( ) --
Runs the coroutines in the base monad .
runCoroutineT :: Monad m => CoroutineT r m r -> m r runCoroutineT = flip evalStateT [ ] . flip runContT return . runCoroutineT ' . ( <* exhaust )
Some example usage :
printOne n = do liftIO ( print n ) yield example = runCoroutineT $ do fork $ replicateM_ 3 ( printOne 3 ) fork $ replicateM_ 4 ( printOne 4 ) replicateM_ 2 ( printOne 2 )
Outputting :
3 4 3 2 4 3 2 4 4
Example : Implementing pattern matching [ edit ]
An interesting usage of CPS functions is to implement our own pattern matching .
We will illustrate how this can be done by some examples .
Example : Built - in pattern matching check :: Bool ->
String check b = case b of True -> " It's True " False ->
" It 's False "
Now we have learnt CPS , we can refactor the code like this .
Example : Pattern matching in CPS type BoolCPS r = r -> r -> r true :: BoolCPS r true x _ = x false :: BoolCPS r false _ x = x check :: BoolCPS String ->
String check b = b " It 's True " " It 's False "
* Main > check true " It 's True " * Main > check false " It 's False "
What happens here is that , instead of plain values , we represent True and False by functions that would choose either the first or second argument they are passed .
Since true and false behave differently , we can achieve the same effect as pattern matching .
Furthermore , True , False and true , false can be converted back and forth by \b -> b True False and \b -> if b then true else false .
We should see how this is related to CPS in this more complicated example .
Example : More complicated pattern matching and its CPS equivalence data Foobar = Zero | One Int | Two Int Int type FoobarCPS r = r -> ( Int -> r ) -> ( Int -> Int -> r ) ->
r zero :: FoobarCPS r zero x _ _ = x one :: Int ->
FoobarCPS r one x _ f _ = f x two :: Int ->
Int ->
FoobarCPS
r two x y _ _ f = f x y fun :: Foobar ->
Int fun x = case x of Zero -> 0 One a -> a + 1 Two a b -> a + b + 2 funCPS :: FoobarCPS Int ->
Int funCPS x = x 0 ( + 1 ) ( \ a b -> a + b + 2 )
* Main > fun Zero 0 * Main > fun $ One 3 4 * Main > fun $ Two 3 4 9 * Main > funCPS zero 0 * Main > funCPS $ one 3 4 * Main > funCPS $ two 3 4 9
Similar to former example , we represent values by functions .
These function - values pick the corresponding ( i.e. match ) continuations they are passed to and pass to the latter the values stored in the former .
An interesting thing is that this process involves in no comparison .
As we know , pattern matching can work on types that are not instances of Eq : the function - values " know " what their patterns are and would automatically pick the right continuations .
If this is done from outside , say , by an pattern_match :: [ ( pattern , result ) ] -> value -> result function , it would have to inspect and compare the patterns and the values to see if they match -- and thus would need Eq instances .

第一章のまとめから適当に抜粋してみると、
FLOSS（要するに、フリーソフトウェアとかオープンソース・ソフトウェアのこと）のうち、2/3ぐらいは今でも個人によって開発されていて、企業は15%、その他の団体が20 %。
ヨーロッパが一番開発者やプロジェクト・リーダが多く、北アメリカも肉迫している。アジアやラテン・アメリカは言葉の壁のせいか少ない。
PCの普及率で重みを付けると、中央ヨーロッパとスカンジナビアが断トツ。平均収入で重みを付けると、インド、そして、中国。
USで はFLOSS関連の巨大企業が強いが、ヨーロッパでは個人の貢献者が多いので、世界的に成功するSME（中小企業）がどんどん生まれている。
現在FLOSSのコードベースは、企業が内部で開発したとすると、120億ユーロ（3兆円？）ぐらいに相当する。過去八年間では18から24ヶ月毎にコードベースが倍増していて、当面この傾向が続きそうである。
企業は12億ユーロぐらいFLOSSに投資していて、そういう企業が56500の職を提供し、年間2630億ユーロの利益を上げている。貢献している企業は、していない企業より、ずっと高い利益を上げる傾向が見られる。
FLOSS 関連事業は、2010年には全IT事業の32%、ヨーロッパのGDPの4%に達する見通し。
FLOSSとプロプライエタリ・ソフトウェアの求職は、30:70ぐらい（重複あり）。
FLOSSを使えば、ソフトウェア研究開発において36%以上のコスト削減が可能で、利益を増やしたり、もっと有用な投資を行うことができる。
FLOSSに関して、ヨーロッパの強みはコミュニティの強さ。USと比べて弱いのは、ICT投資が少なく、巨大産業がFLOSSをなかなか使いたがらないこと。
ヨーロッパには三つのシナリオがある。一つは、CLOSEDで、既得権益が法的・技術的規制によって、のさばり続け、受動的消費者ばかりになる。GENERICは、現在のごた混ぜの方針のせいで、FLOSSは微妙に伸びるが、たくさんの機会を逸する。VOLUNTARYは、FLOSSを理解し、活用し、情報社会における市民の活動を促す。
暗黙、あるいは、明示的にプロプライエタリ・ソフトウェアを優先する政策を是正すべき。公共の研究開発投資やソフトウェア調達などで、FLOSSを不利にしないこと。特定のアプリケーションではなく、技能を教授することによって、教育システムで生涯に渡るベンダ・ロックインを起こさないようにすること。FLOSSのようなコミュニティへの参加を奨励すること。FLOSS開発者に免税処置を施し、税制上の優遇策を取ること。ハードウェアとソフトウェアの抱き合わせを止めることによって得られる効果を調査すること。

There are three kinds of ads in this world .
The ones made by mediocre brands that carry no emotion , do n't make you feel , and are as effective as looking at a concrete wall for an hour .
The other ones made by some designer , looks really amazing , but also completely fails to deliver the message ( the ones winning design awards ) .
But then , we have ads like the one below .
It 's not fancy , it 's not animated , it can be done with a rather small budget and iMovie - but it carries a message , creates a series of emotions , and most of all , it tells a story .
Why even bother creating the first two ?
Why not just tell a story .

Computing Thoughts
Fun-Based Consulting
by Bruce Eckel
October 12 , 2007
Summary
I got a consulting query over the internet the other day ; they were desperate for someone to do a particular project and it seemed like I might be able to help .
Advertisement
It did n't look like a cattle call -- they provided reasonably detailed information about the task , with links to documents and background material .
There was an important clue in the message when they said that several others had been capable of doing it but could n't start soon enough , and that they needed someone immediately .
It 's certainly not impossible that something happened and the person doing that part of the project became sick or injured , and the whole project -- otherwise well - managed -- was being held up by the lack of that one person .
And that none of the other programmers on the team could step in and take over .
Starting to sound unlikely yet ?
I 'll wager that no one reading this blog has ever seen a situation like that .
You have , however , seen the situation where someone , perhaps the entire team , quits because they can't stand it anymore .
The fact that this company could n't wait a little while for those other contractors , who are undoubtedly cheaper than I am , means that things are probably not going so well at the company .
I wrote them back within a few hours of receiving the request , but they never replied .
So it probably was just a well - done cattle call .
Still , how would they know that they never want to actually work with me , to the point that they want me to put time in to reply to them but they are rude enough not to answer ?
I do charge quite a bit per day when I consult .
These are short - term engagements that involve a lot of intense struggle and evaluation , usually trying to discover what 's gone wrong or how to change things so they work a lot better .
I charge a lot because it's hard , sometimes painful , work that requires whatever experience and insights I am able to bring to the problem .
But I do n't actually want to work with rude customers .
I want to work with fun customers who are working on fun and stimulating projects .
The value of a positive working experience is very high -- not just for me , it turns out , but for most people in our profession .
In Demarco & Lister 's book PeopleWare , they have studies showing that programmers do n't really care how much they 're getting paid .
Their primary value is for a positive experience .
My high fees ( not as high as some , certainly ) are a behavior - modification mechanism , as well as a backup plan .
The behavior modification is that it forces a company to be serious enough to put out the money , and to make good use of my time .
The backup plan is that , even if the experience turns out to be miserable , at least I 'm getting paid well .
But maybe this is wrong thinking .
By structuring my system to work with difficult clients , I may only be inviting difficult clients in .
Is there a way to invert the system so that instead it only attracts fun clients ?
Because I realize -- better late than never -- that I did n't actually get into this business because I want to deal with difficult clients .
For me , the experience is paramount .
I would much rather charge a more reasonable rate if I could be doing fun work with fun people .
How do I do that ?
Is There Open Spaces Consulting ?
I used to charge a lot for seminars , for the same reason .
The seminars required that I lecture , and give exercises and coach people through those exercises and keep everybody on the forced march so that I could say that we " covered " the material .
At the end of the week I was exhausted and did n't want to do another seminar for awhile .
It was n't fun , but it made money .
Then I discovered open spaces .
After an open - spaces style event , I am energized and ready to do another one the next week .
I have fun and learn along with everyone else .
Basically , I just organize the event , provide some structure and then get out of the way and become a participant .
It 's so much more fun to do open - spaces style events that I do n't want to give traditional seminars any more , and I 've modified my flagship Java seminar appropriately .
I'm ( slowly ) working to create an electronic delivery system for traditional - style seminars ( my primary initial motivation for learning Flex ) so that I can just do them once , in a studio setting , and people can consume those seminars under their own control .
From a financial standpoint this change to my approach for live events is wrong .
I 'm making significantly less money , but the fun far more than makes up for it , so I do n't care as long as I can survive ( and I always have a number of irons gestating in the fire ; I do n't rely on any one source of income to get by ) .
Recently I 've had a consulting experience with a customer which was the opposite of what I charge a lot for .
It was downright fun , and I came away excited and energized .
It slowly seeped into my brain that I wanted more experiences like this , but how ?
I would much prefer to work with a company that 's doing something fun , in a fun , stimulating environment with fun , stimulating people .
Even if that company can't afford my regular consulting fees .
In fact , I 'm happy to work for less in such a situation .
I 'm still getting paid , but I 'm being paid mostly in fun , and less in money .
( If a job is n't fun , I 'm much more likely to blow the extra money doing something to recover from it , anyway ) .
If you 've been to a naturopath after dealing with conventional Western medicine , that 's more the kind of experience I want to give .
You 've already seen the results of the usual turn - the - crank approach to problem solving , now you 'd like to do something a little more thoughtful and insightful , and have a better experience in the process .
I 'd like to be the software naturopath so that we can all have a better time .
I have no idea how to even begin presenting this to a potential client .
" Hmm , you 're in a real pickle here and anything I try to do for you will involve significant pain , so you 're eligible for my full consulting fee . "
You often do n't know until you get there whether it 's going to be fun or painful , and by then it 's too late .
The complementary approach to my move away from seminars and towards open spaces would be , I suppose , to say " I do n't do painful consulting anymore . "
In open spaces , we try to figure out what people really want to talk about or work on , and put up options .
People migrate to what 's important to them .
What would be the analogy of this for " open spaces consulting ? "
Do I require that the team I 'm working with is already using agile development and a dynamic language ?
That 's probably a good sign , although a team that clicks is not necessarily using a formal agile approach , and a language like Scala is n't dynamic but would be fun .
And how does one even negotiate such an arrangement ?
A company has a lot of incentive to make unrealistic claims , especially because people know that a person likes to feel successful , so once that person buys in they are likely to try to slug it out , even after they discover that the claims the company made are n't true .
This experience , in fact , is what made me strike out on my own in the first place .
I believe there are groups out there who are working on really interesting projects in a fun environment .
Every once in awhile I see evidence that such things exist .
And I think I might be able to contribute something to some of those groups .
I 'm probably not alone in my desire to become connected to such groups -- including lots of people who want full - time jobs .
But our traditional way of thinking about " hiring " is completely broken and counterproductive for making these connections .
It will require an inversion - of - control style change on the order of open spaces to fix the problem ( and I 'm still amazed that open spaces even works , and especially that it works so amazingly well ) .
Do An Experiment
The first open spaces meeting that I organized evolved from an event that I began with Martin Fowler , as a result of an idea that I was bandying about much like I am with this one .
Martin listened for awhile and then said " let 's try a small experiment , " which started the whole process rolling .
That suggestion of " trying a small experiment , then evolving , " has become one of my pocket maxims for solving problems .
So , without knowing what the outcome will be , I 'll try an experiment .
Are you working on a project that 's especially interesting and fun , unfettered by cog-thinking and supported by your management ?
Do you think I might be able to do something to help ?
I 'm interested .
( You can contact me here ) .
Yes , I want to be paid what you can afford .
And it 's obviously easier to measure dollars than it is to measure fun .
But I 'm actually more interested in fun than in dollars , as long as I can make the dollars work and the schedule fit in with my other projects .
I will be spending some time in San Diego with my folks this Fall ( 2007 ) , so if you 're located there that could be a good time ( no travel or lodging expenses ; reduced costs to other parts of CA ) .
Here are the kinds of work I find most attractive ( Programmers : leave a comment about what things you like to do ) : Analysis , Design , Prototyping and Sprinting at the beginning of a project Exploratory experimentation to discover whether an idea or technology is a good fit Python Development with Nose testing Building Flex UIs Agile Techniques , Test Driven Development , Pairing , Highly interactive team environment Special needs I do have a lot of other things going on and my time requires flexible scheduling .
But still , if I can help on a fun project I 'd like to try to work something out .
A Craigslist for Fun-Work ?
If this process of connecting person with work ( whatever the process turns out to be ; please add your ideas as comments ) evolves into something scaleable then perhaps we can build a Craigslist - style version of it so that other people can also discover fun work .
And , trying to think outside the box , maybe there are already consulting groups out there who primarily focus on the quality of experience of the associates rather than putting " make more money " at the top of the list .
If " we do n't make stuff , we make decisions , " as Seth Godin says , then a consultant who is relaxed , rested and happy is more likely to make good decisions , which will produce better medium and long - term profits than a company that sends out bodies disguised as consultants .
Google adwords produced an interesting hit :
Art & Logic , who seem to be doing a lot of smart things , including working out of your home office ( which certainly is n't for everyone ; some people need the structure of the office ) .
Their claim that they hire the " best and the brightest " seems cliche , but if they follow through with their talk of making their consultants love the work , then it could be true .
But I 'm always suspicious about such claims ; they 're easy to make and I 've known too many ex-Thoughtworks people , another " best and brightest " company , who got burned out through overwork ( which seems like short - term thinking ) .
Are there consulting firms you know of that realize that their only asset is their people , and put the quality of the experience of the consultants first ?
What other ideas do you have about connecting the right people with work that inspires them ?
Here 's my web page about consulting .

A treadmill test supports the idea that we evolved to walk on two feet because it saved our ancestors energy ( Image : Cary Wolinsky )
A study of humans and chimpanzees has provided new evidence to support the theory that our ancestors evolved to walk upright for the simple reason that doing so saves energy .
The study , which used treadmills , shows that people walking on two legs use 25 % of the energy used by chimps who “ knuckle walk ” on all fours .
Researchers hope that future fossil findings will reveal the precise anatomical changes that enabled our ancestors to take up bipedalism .
There are numerous ideas to explain human bipedalism , some of which stand on firmer ground than others .
Advertisement
Some experts , for example , have suggested that it helped our ancestors move about the forest canopy more easily .
Others propose that this adaptation provided a more efficient way to feed and carry young at the same time .
But for decades some scientists have suggested we evolved to walk upright because doing so helped our ancestors conserve precious calories under harsh environmental conditions , when food was scarce .
“ The critical piece that ’s been missing is how to link the anatomy to the energy cost , ” says Herman Pontzer at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri .
Built to be safe
He and his colleagues attempted to provide this missing piece of the puzzle by analysing human and chimp biomechanics .
The chimps in the study all knew how to walk on two feet as a result of training .
“ Chimps can walk bipedally , they just choose not to , ” he says .
He adds : “ Chimps are n’t built to be efficient .
They ’re built to be safe . ”
Using all four limbs can help steady them on branches , he explains .
“ Fall out of the fruit tree and you ’re dead . ”
A mask worn by human volunteers and the chimps as they walked on the treadmill enabled the researchers to calculate the number of calories burned , based on oxygen consumption .
Researchers also used non -toxic paint and reflective badges to mark the leg joints of both groups .
This allowed a machine to track the subjects ’ joints as they walked on the treadmill and to characterise their gait .
A complex algorithm also revealed the muscle force exerted on the joints in each step .
Crouched gait
The results of the experiment revealed that while a 50 kilogram ( 110 pound ) human uses roughly 13 kilocalories to walk a kilometre ( above and beyond the energy needed to keep sustain the body at rest ) , a similarly - sized chimp uses about 50 kcal to walk the same distance on two feet .
And when chimps move on all fours they require slightly less energy – 46 kcal , on average – to cover the same distance .
According to Pontzer , chimps require more energy when walking on two feet because of their crouched gait – their bent joints use a lot of calories .
The fact that humans have longer legs , and that our hamstrings attach further towards the back of the pelvis bone , might be the reason that we can comfortably walk upright with our legs straight , minimising the muscle energy needed to support our joints .
Pontzer says that future fossil findings will tell us for sure if it energy efficiency was the key advantage and , if so , shed light on exactly which changes in anatomy allowed early hominins to conserve calories by walking upright .
Journal reference : Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( DOI : 10.1073/pnas.0703267104 )
For his trouble , Weinstein , founder of The Military Religious Freedom Foundation , has found " dead animals on his porch , feces smeared on his walls , or slashes in his tires .
Men have called to threaten his daughter , women to chant rhymes about shooting him in the head , small children to inform him that he will burn in hell . "
These are the values of the so - called Christians ( more like the American Taliban ) who are trying not only to infiltrate our government , but to turn our military into " God 's Nuclear - Armed Army " .
And it looks like they 're winning the battle .
Mother Jones has an excellent article on Weinstein .
For him , the battle has always been personal :
In 1973 , during his freshman year at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs , he repeatedly found anonymous anti-Semitic notes in his dorm room .
He had nearly forgotten the experience when his son , Curtis , entered the Air Force Academy in 2003 and discovered that strains of anti-Semitism had metastasized .
( By then Colorado Springs had come to be known as the " Vatican of the Religious Right " for its concentration of evangelicals . )
Cadets and officers targeted Curtis Weinstein on eight or nine separate occasions during his freshman year with anti-Jewish remarks .
During a football game , an upperclassman reportedly asked , " How does it make you feel to know that you killed Jesus Christ ? "
More from the Mother Jones article :
Weinstein is certain that fundamentalists will stop at nothing to transform the United States military into an army of God .
He notes that Officers Christian Fellowship , with chapters in every major U.S. military installation in the world , envisions — and here he quotes its mission statement — a " spiritually transformed military , with ambassadors for Christ in uniform , empowered by the Holy Spirit . "
The group has helped boost fundamentalist Christianity among the armed forces from a negligible presence 20 years ago to a faith currently held by 30 percent of U.S. soldiers , according to Weinstein .
He adds that many of those soldiers — hardcore end - timers and Dominionists — desperately want America to invade Iran , thereby triggering the biblical prophecy of the Rapture .
This summer he uncovered plans by the Pentagon to ship " freedom packages " to soldiers in Iraq that were to contain Bibles , proselytizing material in English and Arabic , and Left Behind : Eternal Forces , a video game inspired by post - Rapture novels in which " soldiers for Christ " hunt enemies who look suspiciously like U.N. peacekeepers .
Partly due to Weinstein 's efforts , the packages were never sent .
Here 's how bad it is :
The man is a Republican who represented Reagan in the Iran / Contra affair !
One of his supporters is an evengelical Christian himself , David Iglesias , David Iglesias ( one of the U.S. attorneys dismissed this year ) , who says :
" A lot of the anecdotal evidence that Mikey told me I found very troubling from a constitutional perspective . "
Ya do n't say , David .
Another supporter of the The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is Ambassador Joe Wilson ( husband of outed CIA operative Valerie Plame ) , who says :
" They are proselytizing not on behalf of the Constitution of the United States and the national security interests of our country but rather on behalf of some sort of fanatical view of end times .
And they are using our army to affect that . "
And many people are n't quite aware of the same idealogical insanity behind Erik Prince and Blackwater Inc. :
BLACKWATER , the secretive private army now emerging into public view , is a perfect hinge linking two key elements of the Republican political base : America 's war machine and a muscular form of fundamentalist Christianity .
( snip )
Blackwater is the private empire of billionaire Erik Prince , a major Republican fundraiser and bankroller of several fundamentalist Christian organizations .
His private army employs some 2,300 active gunners and boasts a register of 21,000 ready to serve on call .
He has the largest privately held arsenal in the country and the expertise and firepower to bring down a small country .
( snip )
In Prince , the Republicans ' radical Christian base is wed to the war - machine base , the one providing votes and manpower , the other providing campaign funds .
The resulting combination is one of rigid ideology and eagerness to solve any problem with overwhelming force .
The Bush administration convinced itself its views on Iraq were right , pushing aside contrary evidence , then failed to think beyond " shock and awe , " with resultant horrors .
Another person who has written extensively on this thread is Chris Hedges .
From this link ( scroll down ) : http://www.ianmasters.org/...
He is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and is the author of the just published " American Fascists : the Christian Right and the War on America . "
In this book , Hedges , who grew up in rural parishes in upstate New York where his father was a Presbyterian pastor , attacks the Christian fundamentalist movement from the point of view of a believer , as someone steeped in the Bible and Christian tradition .
He points to the hundreds of members of Congress with high approval ratings from the three most influential Christian Right advocacy groups as one of many signs that the movement is burrowing deep inside the American government , in order to subvert it .
The movement 's call to dismantle the wall between church and state and the intolerance it preaches against all who do not conform to its warped vision of a Christian America are pumped into tens of millions of American homes through Christian television and radio stations , as well as reinforced through the curriculum in Christian schools .
He shows that the movement 's yearning for apocalyptic violence and its assault on dispassionate , intellectual inquiry are laying the foundation for an unrecognizable fundmentalist America .
His thesis : we face an imminent threat .
In The Christian Right and the Rise of American Fascism , an article he claims " no major publication will print , " Hedges details in the most blunt , frightening , yet utterly realistic way the true beliefs of these people , and the reasons they exist .
Here 's a little sample :
This image of Christ as warrior is appealing to many within the movement .
The loss of manufacturing jobs , lack of affordable health care , negligible opportunities for education and poor job security has left many millions of Americans locked out .
This ideology is attractive because it offers them the hope of power and revenge .
It sanctifies their rage .
It stokes the paranoia about the outside world maintained through bizarre conspiracy theories , many on display in Pat Robertson 's book The New World Order .
The book is a xenophobic rant that includes vicious attacks against the United Nations and numerous other international organizations .
The abandonment of the working class has been crucial to the success of the movement .
Only by reintegrating the working class into society through job creation , access to good education and health care can the Christian Right be effectively blunted .
Revolutionary movements are built on the backs of an angry , disenfranchised laboring class .
This one is no exception .
The depictions of violence that will befall non-believers are detailed , gruesome and brutal .
It speaks to the rage many believers harbor and the thirst for revenge .
This , in large part , accounts for the huge sales of the apocalyptic series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins .
In their novel , Glorious Appearing , based on LaHaye 's interpretation of Biblical Prophecies about the Second Coming , Christ eviscerates the flesh of millions of non-believers with the mere sound of his voice .
There are long descriptions of horror , of how " the very words of the Lord had superheated their blood , causing it to burst through their veins and skin . "
Eyes disintegrate .
Tongues melt .
Flesh dissolves .
The novel , part of The Left Behind series , are the best selling adult novels in the country .
They preach holy war .
I highly recommend this article and wish I could quote it more at length .
It begins with these scorching paragraphs :
Dr. James Luther Adams , my ethics professor at Harvard Divinity School , told us that when we were his age , he was then close to 80 , we would all be fighting the " Christian fascists . "
The warning , given to me 25 years ago , came at the moment Pat Robertson and other radio and televangelists began speaking about a new political religion that would direct its efforts at taking control of all institutions , including mainstream denominations and the government .
Its stated goal was to use the United States to create a global , Christian empire .
It was hard , at the time , to take such fantastic rhetoric seriously , especially given the buffoonish quality of those who expounded it .
But Adams warned us against the blindness caused by intellectual snobbery .
The Nazis , he said , were not going to return with swastikas and brown shirts .
Their ideological inheritors had found a mask for fascism in the pages of the Bible .
He was not a man to use the word fascist lightly .
He was in Germany in 1935 and 1936 and worked with the underground anti-Nazi church , known as The Confessing Church , led by Dietrich Bonhoeffer .
Adams was eventually detained and interrogated by the Gestapo , who suggested he might want to consider returning to the United States .
It was a suggestion he followed .
He left on a night train with framed portraits of Adolph Hitler placed over the contents inside his suitcase to hide the rolls of home movie film he took of the so - called German Christian Church , which was pro-Nazi , and the few individuals who defied them , including the theologians Karl Barth and Albert Schweitzer .
The ruse worked when the border police lifted the top of the suitcases , saw the portraits of the Fuhrer and closed them up again .
I watched hours of the grainy black and white films as he narrated in his apartment in Cambridge .
He saw in the Christian Right , long before we did , disturbing similarities with the German Christian Church and the Nazi Party , similarities that he said would , in the event of prolonged social instability or a national crisis , see American fascists , under the guise of religion , rise to dismantle the open society .
He despaired of liberals , who he said , as in Nazi Germany , mouthed silly platitudes about dialogue and inclusiveness that made them ineffectual and impotent .
Liberals , he said , did not understand the power and allure of evil nor the cold reality of how the world worked .
The current hand wringing by Democrats in the wake of the election , with many asking how they can reach out to a movement whose leaders brand them " demonic " and " satanic , " would not have surprised Adams .
Like Bonhoeffer , he did not believe that those who would fight effectively in coming times of turmoil , a fight that for him was an integral part of the Biblical message , would come from the church or the liberal , secular elite .
It makes one wonder about the recent fiasco involving the B - 52 , " accidentally " loaded with nuclear - tipped missles , and headed toward Barksdale , an Air Force base that is a staging facility for operations in the middle east :
" Nothing like this has ever been reported before and we have been assured for decades that it was impossible , " said Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass , co-chair of the House Bi-partisan Task Force .
( snip )
Hans Kristensen , director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists , said a host of security checks and warning signs must have been passed over , or completely ignored , for the warheads to have been unknowingly loaded onto the B - 52 .
ACMs are specifically designed to carry a W80 - 1 nuclear warhead with a yield of 5 to 150 kilotons and delivered by B - 52 strategic bombers .
" It ’s not like they had nuclear ACMs and conventional ACMs right next to each other and they just happened to load one with a nuclear warhead , " Kristensen said .
The Defense Department uses a computerized tracking program to keep tabs on each one of its nuclear warheads , he said .
For the six warheads to make it onto the B - 52 , each one would have had to be signed out of its storage bunker and transported to the bomber .
Diligent safety protocols would then have had to been ignored to load the warheads onto the plane , Kristensen said .
All ACMs loaded with a nuclear warhead have distinct red signs distinguishing them from ACMs without a nuclear yield , he said .
ACMs with nuclear warheads also weigh significantly more than missiles without them .
" I just ca n’t imagine how all of this happened , " said Philip Coyle , a senior adviser on nuclear weapons at the Center for Defense Information .
" The procedures are so rigid ; this is the last thing that ’s supposed to happen . "
So how DID it happen , then ?
We know General Boykin , deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence , finally got caught after regularly appearing at evangelical revivals preaching that the US was in a holy war as a " Christian nation " battling " Satan " .
If some unhinged Boykin - esque American Taliban were actually behind the B - 52 mess , would we ever know ?
Of course not .
I 'll end this with more words from Robert C. Koehler , in his excellent article here , ( hat tip to leolabeth for correcting my attribution for this quote ) regarding the insignia in the photo above :
consider the 523rd Fighter Squadron , based at Cannon Air Force Base , N.M. , which calls itself The Crusaders , and whose emblem consists of a sword , four crosses and a medieval knight ’s helmet .
They fly F - 16s with payloads consisting of " a wide variety of conventional , precision guided and nuclear weapons . "
And listen once again to Commander - in - Chief Bush , speaking in 2003 to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas , according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz : " God told me to strike at al - Qaida and I struck them , and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam , which I did , and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East .
If this is a religious war — a " clash of civilizations , " waged by competing agents of God ’s will — victory may be indistinguishable from Armageddon .
God help the human race . "

Micah Brose , a privately contracted interrogator working for American forces in Iraq , near the Iranian border , told The Observer that information on Iran is ' gold ' .
The claim comes after Washington imposed sanctions on Iran last month , citing both its nuclear ambitions and its Revolutionary Guards ' alleged support of Shia insurgents in Iraq .
Last week the US military freed nine Iranians held in Iraq , including two it had accused of links to the Revolutionary Guards ' Qods Force .
Brose , 30 , who extracts information from detainees in Iraq , said : ' They push a lot for us to establish a link with Iran .
They have pre-categories for us to go through , and by the sheer volume of categories there 's clearly a lot more for Iran than there is for other stuff .
Of all the recent requests I 've had , I 'd say 60 to 70 per cent are about Iran .
' It feels a lot like , if you get something and Iran 's not involved , it 's a let down . '
He added : ' I 've had people say to me , " They 're really pushing the Iran thing .
It 's like , shit , you know . " '
Brose said that reports about Washington 's increasingly hawkish stance towards Tehran , including possible military action , chimed with his experience .
' My impression is they 're just trying to get every little bit of ammunition possible .
If we get something here it fits the overall picture .
The engine needs impetus and they 're looking for us to find the fuel - a particular type of fuel .
' It now really depends on who gets elected President in the US .
If nothing changes in the current course , I 'd say military action is inevitable .
But we have to hope there will be a change of course . '
He denied ever being asked to fabricate evidence , adding : ' We 're not asked to manufacture information , we 're asked to find it .
But if a detainee wants to tell me what I want to hear so he can get out of jail ... you know what I 'm saying .'
Other military intelligence officials in Iraq refused to comment , but one said : ' The message is , " Got to find a link with Iran , got to find a link with Iran . "
It 's sickening .'
Last week in Baghdad the US military showed journalists a recently discovered cache of mortars , rocket - propelled grenades and bomb - making materials it claims are of Iranian origin .
Rear Admiral Gregory Smith , spokesman for Multi-National Force Iraq , said it was possible they crossed the border before a recent promise by Iran to stop the flow of munitions into Iraq .
He said : ' Iran has had a historic malign influence here in Iraq .
They have financed many of the activities of Shia extremist groups .
In many cases they have done training , they have actually deployed some of their personnel here in theatre .
The Qods Force ( Iranian Revolutionary Guards ) have come here - we know that , we 've got some in detention .
They have said in many cases they were not here and intend to support a more peaceful outcome in Iraq and we look for their excellence in achieving that . '
Among the weapons Washington has accused Iran of supplying to Iraqi insurgents are EFPs , or explosively formed projectiles , which fire a slug of molten metal capable of penetrating even the most heavily armoured military vehicle .
The number two US commander in Iraq , Lt Gen Ray Odierno , said there has been a sharp decline in the number of EFPs found in Iraq in the last three months .
That is why Andreas M. Antonopoulos , a founding partner at Nemertes Research , a technology research company in Mokena , Ill. , says , “ The threat is complexity itself . ”

Change is the fuel of business , but it also introduces complexity , Mr. Antonopoulos said , whether by bringing together incompatible computer networks or simply by growing beyond the network ’s ability to keep up .
“ We have gone from fairly simple computing architectures to massively distributed , massively interconnected and interdependent networks , ” he said , adding that as a result , flaws have become increasingly hard to predict or spot .
Simpler systems could be understood and their behavior characterized , he said , but greater complexity brings unintended consequences .
“ On the scale we do it , it ’s more like forecasting weather , ” he said .
Kenneth M. Ritchhart , the chief information officer for the customs and border agency , agreed that complexity was at the heart of the problem at the Los Angeles airport .
“ As we move from stovepipes to interdependent systems , ” he said , “ it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and correct problems . ”
At first , the agency thought the source of the trouble was routers , not the network cards .
“ Many times the problems you see that you try to correct are not the root causes of the problem , ” he said .
And even though his department takes the threat of hacking and malicious cyberintruders seriously , he said , “ I ’ve got a list of 16 things that I try to address in terms of outages — only one of them is cyber - or malicious attacks . ”
Others include national power failures , data corruption and physical attacks on facilities .
In the case of Skype , the company — which says it has more than 220 million users , with millions online at any time — was deluged on Aug. 16 with login attempts by computers that had restarted after downloading a security update for Microsoft ’s Windows operating system .
A company employee , Villu Arak , posted a note online that blamed a “ massive restart of our users ’ computers across the globe within a very short time frame ” for the 48 - hour failure , saying it had overtaxed the network .
Though the company has software to “ self - heal ” in such situations , “ this event revealed a previously unseen software bug ” in the program that allocates computing resources .

There has been a bit of talk recently about how it is possible to exhaustively search certain infinite spaces in a finite time .
Unfortunately the explanations seem to be couched in topological language making them a little inaccessible .
So I thought it'd be good to attempt a rigorous , but elementary , proof so that is possible to see exactly where the ' magic ' happens .
Consider the type of infinite streams of booleans :
Can we write a function , that takes as argument a boolean predicate on , and tells us whether or not there is a stream that satisfies it ?
This sounds like an impossible task .
There are uncountable many infinite streams of booleans , so how can we hope to search them all ?
There 's one important thing in our favour : we 're restricting ourselves to predicates that are computable and total .
In other words , whatever stream we pass to the predicate , they have to return a boolean in a finite time .
First , let 's deal with an objection that makeseem impossible to implement .
Given a 4 - tuple of integers , we can encode these integers in a stream .
For example , the integers ( written in binary ) ( 11,10 ,1,111 ) could be encoded aswhere we code the binary digit b as 1b , we separate the integers using 00 and terminate the sequence using 01 .
We could then write a predicate that checks to see if the 4 - tuple gives a solution to x+y=zwith x , y , z>0 and n>=2 .
Plugging that intowe apparently have a way to decide the Fermat - Wiles theorem without doing any difficult number theory .
Surely , therefore , ca n't exist ?
But the predicate we 've just described is n't total .
Suppose we feed it the string 111111 ... as input .
It 's going to think that these represent an x with leading digits 111 ... and it's going to sit there collecting digits forever .
It 's never going to terminate .
So the requirement that the predicate be total is such a strong condition that we can't actually implement the Fermat predicate , even though it uses nothing more than simple arithmetic .
So maybeis beginning to look a little more plausible .
Here 's the key thing : any predicate on boolean streams must terminate after a finite time , meaning it only reads a finite number of booleans .
So given any predicate p , there is a ( mathematical ) function don the boolean streams with the property that d(s ) is the index of the last bit p looks at when given s as input .
d(s ) is obviously always finite .
Now at this point you might immediately jump to the opposite conclusion that of courseis possible because you only need to check a finite number of bits .
But even though d(s ) is always finite , it might be unbounded as s varies over the infinite set of streams .
So the finiteness of don its own is not enough to bound our search .
For example , consider predicates on 4 - tuples of integers again .
Each of these predicates reads only a finite number of bits , and yet we do n't expect a general purpose terminating search algorithm can tell us whether or not Fermat 's equation has a solution .
So to prove termination for the boolean stream case we need to exploit some more structure .
Here 's a first hint at what that structure might be .
Suppose we try to make dunbounded by arranging that You might notice that we immediately have a contradiction .
If d( 00000 ... ) =1 then the predicate must stop reading bits after it has read an initial 0 .
So actually , the sequence d( 01000 ... ) is also 1 .
Lots of streams share prefixes in this way , so the question is , does the infinitude of the set of boolean streams win out , or does the amount of sharing of prefixes eventually tame the infinity ?
Consider the following infinite binary tree : Each boolean stream corresponds to a single downward path through this tree .
Fix a predicate p. Suppose , then , that this predicate , when fed the stream 011 ... , requires only 3 bits to be read , ie .
d( 011 ... ) =
3 . Then we can cut off everything below that point on the tree because no predicate need read that far .
We 've removed every infinite path passing through 011 : Every stream s has a finite cutoff after d(s ) steps .
And after we 've hacked away all of the bits that our predicate never looks at what we 're left with is a finitely branching tree with no infinite paths .
Now comes the magic : we invoke König 's Lemma which says " every tree that contains infinitely many vertices , each having finite degree , has at least one infinite simple path . " .
Conversely , if there are no infinite paths , the tree must be finite .
In other words , for any predicate p we only need to search a finite tree .
The rest is just details , such as the precise method by which we determine when we 've finished searching .
In the case of Martín Escardó 's paper the details are some of the most ingenious coding I 've ever seen .
Update : I fixed the type ofabove .
Thanks to Cale for pointing this out .
Unfortunately I deleted his comment by accident so I 'm crediting him here .
“ I miss Albania ! ” W. wails .
“ They know how to treat a president there .
Women were kissing me and men rubbed my hair .
The crowd kept yelling , ‘ Bushie ! , ’ and they almost grabbed the watch right off my wrist trying to get at me . ”
The concerned group huddling outside the president ’s closed - bedroom door in Kennebunkport can barely hear him .
His voice is muffled because he has his face buried in his feather pillow , which the Secret Service has carefully transported from Washington to Maine for the weekend , knowing that it would be needed .
They guard it so conscientiously that they have even given it a code name .
Since the president ’s Secret Service name is Tumbler , his agents christened his beloved pillow Slumber .
“ Son , I know how you feel , ” Poppy calls in to him , trying to sound positive .
“ Riding high in 2002 , shot down in 2007 .
That ’s life , as Sinatra says .
You were a puppet and a pawn to King Dick and it screwed up your presidency and our party and the Middle East and the Atlantic alliance and the family legacy and Jeb ’s future , not to mention the fate of the planet .
But you ca n’t just roll yourself up in a big ball and die , George .
Your friend Vlad the Impaler is here , and I think you should come out and talk to him .
You invited him and he came all the way from Russia , and you do n’t want to be rude .
“ I ’ve already taken him to Mabel ’s Lobster Claw and out on the boat .
He scared all the fish away .
I do n’t know what else to do with him , George .
He brained the Filipino manservant , the little brown one , with a horseshoe . ”
Rachel Maddow : Bush says ' World War III is worth starting ' over Iran David Edwards and Muriel Kane

In an appearance on NBC's Today Show , Air America 's Rachel Maddow suggested that President Bush 's warning against allowing Iran to acquire nuclear know - how should not be mistaken for a promise that Republicans can be trusted to prevent World War III .
" What he 's saying is that World War III is worth starting , if only over the issue of Iran 's nuclear know - how -- not even over the issue just of them having weapons , " Maddow stated , President Bush had indicated in Wednesday 's press conference that " if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing [ Iran ] from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
" Right now probably the most anti-American country on earth is Pakistan , " Maddow continued .
" Pakistan not only has a nuclear weapon but has demonstrated that they will proliferate that technology on the black market .
The idea that Iran would be cause for World War III but Pakistan 's no big worry to us is psychotic . "
Iranian leaders have stated many times that they are not pursuing nuclear weapons and that their nuclear program is for strictly peaceful purposes , a claim endorsed by Russian President Vladimir Putin .
The International Atomic Energy Agency also agrees there is no sign of an Iranian nuclear weapons program and is currently working with Iran to resolve outstanding questions about its activities .
Maddow and Michael Smerconish , a Philadelphia talk show host who sometimes substitutes for Bill O'Reilly , also sparred over the significance of Bush 's remark for the 2008 presidential campaign .
Smerconish said he believes Bush 's comment was primarily directed at President Putin over his recent visit of support with Iranian President Ahmadinejad .
He added that it's hard to disagree with it , because " Ahmadinejad 's a crackpot ... he 's dangerous , he 's also delusional . "
While acknowledging that " the administration totally lacks credibility for taking the country to war yet again , " Smerconish insisted that " I think historically when the country feels imperiled , the Republican Party benefits .
...
It helps the GOP in the ' 08 cycle . "
Maddow responded , " This is good for the country , to know that if you vote for a Republican candidate for president , you are voting for a war with Iran . "

Perhaps the most prolific artist of our time , Henry Darger 's strange genius was n't discovered until after his death .
He was a lonely and highly reclusive man who worked for years as a janitor in Chicago .
He was odd and unkempt , scavenged through the garbage for art supplies and talked to himself in strange voices .
He never took an art class , never bought a manual on how to draw or paint , but when he died in 1973 -- buried in a paupers ' cemetery not far away , with no family or friends to provide for his burial -- his landlord discovered a massive literary and artistic body of work that he had been creating since nearly the turn of the century .
It included hundreds of paintings , many of them up to ten feet in length , and an amazing , 15,145 - page fantasy graphic novel entitled The Story of the Vivian Girls , in What is known as the Realms of the Unreal , of the Glandeco - Angelinnian War Storm , Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion .
A brief summary of the book , and more of Darger 's strange outsider art , after the jump :

In terms of user - friendliness , MacKay 's text has the edge when it comes to its thorough index , the rich use of figures , the provision of free software for the use of the reader , and the profusion of examples and exercises , many with worked solutions .
A strong selling point for MacKay 's book is its free availability for online viewing .
Unlike Rowling , who is notoriously secretive about her textbooks before they are published , MacKay made his entire book available online while it was a work in progress .
A possible weakness of MacKay 's product is that it is only available in hardback .
Native speakers of Latin may also prefer Rowling 's text , since a full translation into Latin is now available .
The issue that must clinch the choice , however , is availability .
Our reviewer tried to purchase both texts from Barnes and Noble on Mon 5/1/04 , and found that the Rowling text is not available .

In conclusion , we can give a cautious recommendation of Harry Potter only to speakers of Welsh and Latin ; for everyone else , we recommend Information Theory , Inference , and Learning Algorithms .
The following is an article from Uncle John 's Supremely Satisfying Bathroom Reader
You 've heard of physics J. Robert Oppenheimer , the " father of the A - Bomb . "
But have you head of Lise Meitner ?
Her discovery of nuclear fission opened the door to the creation of the atom bomb , much to her regret .
Here 's her story .
OUT OF SCHOOL Lise Meitner [ wiki ] was born in 1878 in Vienna , Austria .
She was very bright , but in those days it did n't matter -- education was for boys only .
People thought that if the delicate female brain was subjected to too much education , the result would be mental illness and infertility .
( Schooling for girls ended at age 13 . )
Fortunately for Meitner in the 1890s , the Viennese government began to permit women to attend high school and college , making it possible for her to pursue her passion -- physics .
After graduating from the University of Vienna in 1906 , Meitner went to Berlin to attend lectures by Max Planck , later winner of the Nobel Prize for his work in quantum mechanics .
This existence of the atom had only recently been discovered and the study of radiation was new and exciting -- and Berlin was where these sciences were being advanced most vigorously .
She decided to stay .
A WOMAN'S PLACE At the University of Berlin , Meitner had to ask permission to attend classes .
Planck was reluctant to allow a woman in , but begrudgingly gave his permission , saying , " It can not be emphasized strongly enough that Nature itself has designated for woman her vocation as mother and housewife , and that under no circumstances can natural laws be ignored without grave damage . "
Planck later recognized that Meitner had great talent , ad she became his assistant .
Eventually she was offered a position doing research … though she was not allowed to work in the same lab as the men and was instead given a makeshift workshop in the basement .
Her parents supported her financially , but she wrote scientific articles to earn additional income , signing her name " L. Meitner . "
( Journals would not publish work written by a woman . )
At the university , Meitner began working with another scientist , Otto Hahn .
Together they made numerous discoveries about the nature of the atom and radiation .
They remained scientific partners for the rest of their lives .
SECOND - CLASS CITIZENS
When the modern Kaiser - Willhelm Institute opened a new wing devoted to radiation research , Hahn was offered a job and Meitner accompanied him …officially listed as his " unpaid guest . "
( Hahn got paid for his work ; she did not . )
At the institute , Meitner discovered the element protactinium .
Tough she did the majority of the work , Hahn 's name appeared as senior author on their scientific papers .
Consequently , the Association of German Chemists presented him with their highest award , the Emil Fischer Medal .
Meitner received only a copy of his medal .
It was only after World War I that Meitner 's value began to be recognized :
She became the first woman professor ever in Germany and was finally paid a living wage ( though still less than Hahn ) .
In 1926 she was appointed full professor of physics at the University of Berlin .
There , she continued to study beta and gamma rays , isotopes , atomic theory , radioactivity , and quantum physics .
A NEW COUNTRY By 1937 Meitner and Hahn had identified at least nine different radioactive elements .
A scientist named Fritz Strassmann joined them , and together the three of them began working to find out what happens when the nucleus of an atom splits .
But at this time , the Nazis were raising to power .
Meitner was forced to fill out papers admitting that her grandparents were Jewish .
It did n't matter that she was raised a Protestant -- she was fired from her job .
Jews made up less than 1 % of the German population , yet they accounted for 20 % of the scientists .
Researchers all over Germany began to follow Albert Einstein 's lead , and fled the country .
Meitner announced that she was taking a " holiday , " but instead escaped to safety in Sweden .
At the age of 59 , after living and working in Germany for 31 years , she was forced to leave her money , possessions , research papers , friends , and career .
Starting over from scratch , she went to work at the Nobel Institute of Physics in Stockholm , where she spent the next 22 years .
It was there that she made the discovery that literally rocked the world .
SPLIT DECISION Scientists knew that radiation is released when the nucleus of an atom decays .
Every nucleus has protons , which have a positive charge , and electrons , which have a negative charge .
When a nucleus loses protons , radiation is emitted and the atom transforms into a new kind of atom .
This new atom , or " daughter atom , " splits and spirals away with enough force that the original atom recoils , like a rifle recoils after firing a bullet .
( Radium releases a million times more energy during radioactive decay than when it is burned like coal . )
Then scientists discovered that every atom also has a neutron , which has no electrical charge at all .
Enrico Fermi discovered that when he bombarded heavy elements that were even heavier than the ones he started with .
Protons and neutrons in a nucleus cling very tightly together , but they cling more tightly in some elements than others .
Iron is the most stable element and therefore the hardest to split .
Uranium is the least stable and the easiest to split .
When Meitner and Hahn had tried bombarding uranium with slow - speed neutrons , they ended up with barium -- which is lighter than uranium , not heavier .
They were confused : neither of them realized they had just split the atom .
EARTH - SHATTERING
In Sweden , Meitner discovered that when a nucleus splits , the mass of the two new atoms added together is less than that of the original atom , because some of the mass is released as energy .
That energy is what causes the two pieces of the split atom to repel from each other .
She calculated , using Einstein 's formula of E=MC2 , exactly how much energy would be given off every time a single atom split and predicted that this could happen in a chain reaction , releasing an enormous amount of energy in a very short period of time .
If millions of atoms could be split at once , the power would be unimaginable : splitting the nucleus of a uranium atom , for example , releases 20 million times more energy than exploding an equal amount of TNT .
When she shared this news with Hahn , he did experiments to prove her theory .
Then he published a paper ( leaving her name off , for fear he would get in trouble if Nazis found he was still in contact with her ) .
Meitner also published a report in a British journal in 1939 .
Suddenly the world was in a race to see who would be first to harness atomic energy in the form of a bomb .
Einstein wrote a letter to President Roosevelt warning him about what would happen if Germany got the bomb first .
Roosevelt set American scientists to work on the project -- called the Manhattan Project -- and invited Meitner to help .
She turned the job down , repulsed by the idea that her discovery might be used to kill people .
She told them she hoped they failed .
BAD CREDIT
The Nazis , in the meantime , had been removing all traces of the Jews , and Meitner 's name was erased from all the research she had done .
Perhaps because of this , Otto Hahn managed to convince himself -- and the world -- that the discovery of nuclear fission ( Meitner coined the term ) had been his .
Hahn received the Nobel Prize in 1944 .
( Meitner never did . )
For years ,
Hahn was listed at the inventor , with Lise Meitner occasionally mentioned as his assistant .
When the atom bomb was dropped on Japan , Meitner was upset , not only by the devastation but also by the sudden publicity : reporters on her doorstep ; cameras in her face ; phone messages and telegrams waiting for her reply .
She had little to say .
The bomb had killed 100,000 people , and suddenly she was being portrayed in the media as the person who had come up with the blueprint for it .
RECOGNITION Lise Meitner finally did receive her share of attention for her discoveries .
She was named " Woman of the Year " by the Women 's National Press Club ; received the Max Planck Medal from the German Chemical Society ; received honorary doctorates , published 135 scientific papers ; won the Enrico Fermi Award ; and was elected to the Swedish Academy of Science - - only the third woman in history to achieve that honor .
She was even offered a movie deal by MGM .
( She turned it down , horrified that the script called for her to flee from Germany with an atom bomb hidden in her purse ! )
Meitner continued her research into her mid-70s and helped Sweden design its first nuclear reactor , which was the way she wanted her discovery to be used .
Despite continued exposure to massive amounts of radiation , she lived to be nearly 90 years old , dying in 1968 , just three months after Otto Hahn .
In 1992 physicists named the newly discovered 109th element in her honor : meitnerium .
BitTorrent is by far the most popular way to transfer large files over the Internet , but where will it be five years from now ?
To get some answers to this question TorrentFreak asked the admins of Mininova , The Pirate Bay , IsoHunt and TorrentSpy what they think the future holds for BitTorrent and their websites .
It ’s hard to predict the future , especially when it comes to technology .
However , that did n’t put us off and we gave it a shot .
We asked the people behind the 4 largest BitTorrent sites on the Internet to tell us how they envision the future of BitTorrent .
Despite the differences these four guys sometimes have , they all believe that no other P2P protocol performs better than BitTorrent at the moment .
However , there ’s no doubt that there will be changes in the future .
“ Technology is always evolving and I have little doubt that 5 or 10 years from now we will be using a different protocol ” says Justin from TorrentSpy .
Peter ( aka Brokep ) from The Pirate Bay also thinks new protocols will take over eventually .
“ There will be other alternatives , ” he said “ Not necessarily ours but others will come . ”
Niek from mininova has more faith in BitTorrent but expects that the protocol will evolve rapidly , an opinion shared by Gary from IsoHunt .
Most of the admins also predict that mainstream production companies will eventually embrace BitTorrent and P2P and some of them hope to play an active role in the transition from old to new media distribution .
Below you can read the full responses to the question I asked them :
What do you think the future holds for BitTorrent and your website ?
Niek from Mininova
I ’m sure that we ’ll see quite a few changes in the P2P landscape during the next couple of years .
From a business perspective , I notice that content producers recognize more and more the advantages of P2P distribution models ( see e.g. the Pariah Island case ) .
We all know that DRM is close - to - death , and major studios are now rethinking their business models , which is a good thing .
We ’d like to see Mininova play a major role in this shift , so stay tuned for some related announcements the coming weeks :)
Looking at the technical side of things , I expect that the BitTorrent protocol will evolve rapidly .
See for example ( audio and video ) streaming , which is already possible and supported by several clients .
Other interesting developments are BT - capable chips and TOR - like functionality .
New protocols ( like the one proposed by The Pirate Bay ) might arise , but only time will tell whether these will substitute BitTorrent .
Personally , I think BitTorrent can go a long way with some extensions and modifications .
Having said that , Mininova ’s only focus wo n’t be BitTorrent : when the “ next big thing ” arises , we ’ll definitely consider backing it .
Justin from TorrentSpy
I do n’t really concern myself with the future of BitTorrent the protocol but I do care about peer - to - peer as a technology platform .
Technology is always evolving and I have little doubt that 5 or 10 years from now we will be using a different protocol .
However I firmly believe that the use of peer - to - peer for everything from data transfer to shared CPU power will take the Internet to the next level .
If we look at TV you will already see this trend .
Media use in our society is transitioning from someone else deciding what you want ( push ) to something that allows what you want , when you want it ( pull ) .
Right now you turn the TV on at 8 pm to watch your favorite show or skip channels until you stumble across something interesting .
The future is a demand system where you can buy and watch an episode the network has “ released ” any time you want .
Tivo is a first step in this direction .
Surprising as it may seem , this can be done pretty easily today , but is tied up in complex licensing schemes , conflicts between producers and distributors , and a wide array of selfish interests .
Unfortunately many companies use their power and influence to halt and punish innovations they cannot think of ways to make money with .
The monopolies tried to stop the VHS , DVD , and MP3 player , but thankfully failed when they took it to Court .
Now Imagine for a second all the amazing products they did manage to squashâ€ ¦
Gary from IsoHunt
With so much momentum of content behind BitTorrent , I do n’t see it going away anytime soon .
Unless there ’s a far superior and open protocol that is superior to BitTorrent in efficiency and convenience , for which BitTorrent is pretty hard to beat , I see we ’ll like have new developments by extending the existing BitTorrent protocol .
Although Bram Cohen talked about Merkle trees as a major revision in improving BitTorrent , and that did n’t go anywhere ( at least not in open source ) .
When BitTorrent Inc. do significant enough closed source changes to the protocol , BitTorrent will fork or new open protocols will rise .
For future of BitTorrent sites and IsoHunt , I ’ve always been an advocate of open and public access .
The more sites try to go underground , the more reasons the authority think there ’s something dark at work and more they will take sites down by force – Oink and other private trackers for example .
I ’ve been blogging about P2P and its economic sense / legitimate use cases for a while ( latest one on independent music ) , and I believe that ’s what will give BitTorrent continued adoption and acceptance as a de-facto protocol and internet standard .
It ’s like the WWW : if people did n’t use the early web for other purposes than for porn ( which was prolific in the web ’s early days ) , the governments might have a different view and regulations on the internet now .
It ’s not what copyright infringement or “ piracy ” may be occurring , on P2P , BitTorrent or the internet .
It ’s what new use cases we nurture that benefits both end users and content producers , that will correct the stigma behind P2P and BitTorrent and accelerate their acceptance .
Development on isoHunt and our other sites will for sure be done with this in mind .
Peter aka Brokep from The Pirate Bay
First of all , I do n’t think it ’s easy to predict the future .
But I do think that it ’s very important to be very promiscuous when it comes to the protocols we use .
BitTorrent is currently the best but this might change .
There will be other alternatives , not necessarily ours but others will come .
In five years things are probably very different from today , technology wise and politically .
The latter thing is the biggest issue , not the technology .
I would foresee that streaming is bigger and the companies still try to frame their users to use their locked down systems , maybe not DRM but rather streamed with their clients ( like the BT DNA system ) which will contain other copyright protection scams .
What do you think ?
It ’s great to hear the opinions and predictions of the leading BitTorrent admins , but what do you think the future of BitTorrent will be ?
Will we be all using a new protocol 5 years from now , will BitTorrent sites change , will TV and movie producers embrace BitTorrent ?
Let us know !

Another delusional answer by Bush at a joint presser with France 's President Sarkozy yesterday .
It 's getting to the point that when I hear someone mention the word " freedom , " I cringe because he has perverted it .
You do n't invade a country that has not attacked us and then talk about freedom to the rest of the world .
Bush does his best not to talk about reconciliation in Iraq either at the presser , but then came this question .
Q : Thank you , Mr. President .
My question is on Iraq .
Mr. President , this morning you talked at length about Afghanistan , Iran , but not Iraq .
And I wanted to ask both of you , is France reconciled with the United States , the United States is reconciled with France ?
So what about Iraq ?
Can France , for instance , help to get out of the Iraqi quagmire ?
And President Bush , where do you stand on Iraq and your domestic debate on Iraq ?
Do you have a timetable for withdrawing troops ?
BUSH : I do n't -- you know , " quagmire " is an interesting word .
If you lived in Iraq and had lived under a tyranny , you 'd be saying , god , I love freedom -- because that 's what 's happened .
And there are killers and radicals and murderers who kill the innocent to stop the advance of freedom .
But freedom is happening in Iraq .
And we 're making progress .
The latest CNN poll shows that Americans are still overwhelming against the Iraq war .
The propaganda push has convinced nobody .
As Kevin Drum notes :
Apparently the American public is smart enough to realize that military progress is n't really that meaningful without political progress , and we have n't seen a dime 's worth of that .
Unless and until we do , I do n't expect this trend to change .
Andrew Sullivan :
We do know that national political reconciliation has n't happened , and may be further away than ever .
We do know that this was the actual point of the surge .
And there are ominous indicators that any declaration of " Mission Accomplished " is premature ..
Amanda says :
From today 's WSJ : Congress recently raised the federal minimum wage to $ 7.25 an hour by 2009 , in the name of helping low - income families escape poverty .
But a sobering new report from the New York City - based Center for an Urban Future shows how minimum - wage laws are already hurting the unskilled and inexperienced .
The " Summer Help " study assesses New York City 's publicly funded Summer Youth Employment Program , which each year matches tens of thousands of young people between the ages of 14 and 21 with employers ranging from the local library to investment banks .
Today , however , the New York program serves 20 % fewer young adults than it did in 1999 , and last year it turned away 30,000 mostly black and Latino applicants .
The report cites minimum wage - increases in the Empire State -- one of 30 states that mandates a minimum higher than the federal floor -- as a factor in the program 's decline .
The harm from minimum - wage laws is well - documented , and even government job programs are n't immune .
As an antipoverty measure , these laws are inefficient because most people who are poor already earn more than the minimum , and most who do earn the minimum are n't living in poverty .
They are retirees , homemakers , part - time workers , and teenagers in the Big Apple -- fewer of whom will have summer jobs in the future thanks to the higher minimum wage .
From the BLS May employment reports here and here , and this minimum wage summary
Number of teenagers unemployed : 1,054,000
Overall teenage unemployment rate for May : 15.7 %
Teenage unemployment rate for blacks : 30.4 % ( 247,000 )
Teenage unemployment rate for whites : 13.9 % ( 807,000 )
Number of states with minimum wages above the federal ( currently $ 5.15 , will increase to $ 5.85 on July 24 ) : 29
Minimum wage in NY , PA , Alaska , and Michigan : $ 7.15
eliminate them ? ) :
Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm : " Increasing the minimum wage is one part of her plan to diversify and expand Michigan 's economy . "
From the politicians ( are n't they supposed to try to create more jobs , notthem ? ) : " Increasing the minimum wage is one part of her plan to diversify and expand Michigan 's economy . "
Marilee Jones , dean of admissions , has resigned effective immediately , after it was confirmed that she had " misrepresented her academic degrees to the Institute , " Dean for Undergraduate Education Daniel E. Hastings announced in an e-mail to the MIT community today .
Stuart Schmill has been named interim director of admissions , effective immediately , and a search process for a permanent head of admissions will begin shortly , according to Hastings .
" This is a sad and unfortunate event , " said Hastings .
" But the integrity of the Institute is our highest priority , and we cannot tolerate this kind of behavior . "
Hastings noted in his statement that the MIT admissions process is built on the dedication of dozens of faculty and staff who commit themselves to the selection of MIT 's undergraduate students .
" The process of admitting the incoming class continues without disruption , " Hastings said .
Jones issued a separate statement following her resignation .

In the Dutch market , the concept of so - called ' startpages ' is hugely popular .
In this article we will give some background information on them , and give those of you who may be startpage webmasters a few tips on how to create unique and informative startpages .
What 's a startpage ?
Basically , it 's a webpage with a lot of links about a specific topic .
The startpages are hosted on a startpage domain and each separate startpage is maintained by an individual webmaster .
The links on startpages are usually ordered by categories related to the topic of the page .
Besides hyperlinks , startpages often contain text , animations and pictures .
Startpages are quite unique to the Dutch market , and offer a simple interface for novice users to create their own web portals , with a unique approach to user - generated content .
The whole startpage concept began in September 1998 with the launch of Startpagina.nl , which was set up to be an online linkbook for the inexperienced Internet user .
Since then , Startpagina.nl has become a huge success , mainly because an enormous number of volunteers created and maintained the different startpages covering lots of interesting and diverse topics .
Since Startpagina.nl emerged , lots of other startpage domains have been created , and are still being created today .
The fact that there are still new startpage domains appearing and that the number of individual startpages on these domains is still increasing shows the continued popularity of startpages in the Dutch market .
Creating useful startpages
As a search engine , we love to have useful and diverse pages showing up in the search results we present to our users .
We thought it would be a good idea to highlight some of the best practices we 've seen in creating value - added startpages .
Create your startpage for users , and not for search engines .
This involves making sure that all your text on the page is visible to users , and writing full sentences as descriptions instead of just keywords .
Try to deliver unique , informative and on - topic content .
The structure of startpages is pretty straightforward and does not leave much room for variation .
However , you can make a difference .
Try to find a topic you know a lot about that has not been fully covered yet .
Create good categories that are related to your topic and give a relevant title to every category .
Then , find links that are related to the categories on your page and label every link with an anchor text that is relevant .
For example , instead of naming your links ' link1 ' , ' link2 ' et cetera , you can choose names that make clear where the link is pointing to .
And you can write a short description for every category .
Do n't create startpages out of commercial intent or for the sole purpose of exchanging links .
Of course there is nothing wrong with trying to monetize your startpage , but a page with only banners and affiliate links is not the best user experience and therefore not recommended .
The same goes for startpages that are created as part of a link network .
For example , pages that have all links pointing to a particular website and to other startpages that are also pointing to that same website .
These kind of link schemes have no added value for the user and go against the Google webmaster guidelines .
With this post , we hope to have provided potential startpage webmasters with some helpful guidelines that will help to create the type of startpages the Dutch speaking people love !
On a final note , we would like to encourage you to fill in a paid links form if you come across a startpage that is involved in buying and selling links for the purpose of search engine manipulation .

Startpagina's
Op de Nederlandstalige markt zijn de zogenaamde startpagina 's bijzonder populair .
In dit artikel willen we , naast het geven van wat achtergrondinformatie over startpagina's , toekomstige startpaginabeheerders een aantal tips geven voor het creëren van unieke en informatieve startpagina's .
Wat is een startpagina ?
Een startpagina is een webpagina met een verzameling links gerelateerd aan een specifiek onderwerp .
De startpagina 's worden gehost op een startpagina domein en elke individuele startpagina wordt beheerd door een webmaster .
De links op een startpagina zijn meestal opgedeeld in verschillende categorieën die relevant zijn voor het specifieke onderwerp van de startpagina .
Naast een indeling in hyperlinks vind je op een startpagina vaak tekst , animaties en plaatjes .
Het concept van startpagina's is redelijk specifiek voor de Nederlandstalige markt en komt nauwelijks voor in andere markten .
Startpagina 's hebben een simpele interface die het , ook voor de onervaren internetgebruikers , eenvoudig maakt om een eigen webpagina te creëren .
Het startpagina concept kwam tot stand in september 1998 met de lancering van Startpagina.nl , dat werd opgezet als een soort van linkboek voor de onervaren internet gebruiker .
Startpagina.nl bleek al gauw een enorm succes .
Dit succes was vooral te danken aan het enorme aantal vrijwilligers dat meehielp om startpagina 's te creëren en beheren .
Dat er nu , bijna negen jaar later , nog steeds nieuwe startpagina domeinen verschijnen en dat het aantal individuele startpagina 's op deze domeinen nog steeds groeit toont aan dat de startpagina 's onverminderd populair zijn .
Een waardevolle startpagina creëren
Als zoekmachine vinden we het fantastisch om waardevolle pagina 's met unieke content en diversiteit in onze zoekresultaten te hebben .
Het leek ons daarom een goed idee om een aantal tips te geven die kunnen helpen bij het creëren van startpagina 's met toegevoegde waarde .
Maak een startpagina voor internetgebruikers en niet voor zoekmachines .
Zorg dat alle tekst zichtbaar is en gebruik volledige zinnen in plaats van enkel een aantal keywords .
Probeer unieke , informatieve en aan je onderwerp gerelateerde inhoud aan je bezoekers te presenteren .
Hoewel de opzet van een standaard startpagina niet heel veel ruimte biedt voor variatie , kun jij als beheerder het verschil maken !
Begin met het zoeken naar een onderwerp waar je veel over weet en waar naar jouw idee nog niet genoeg informatie over te vinden is .
Maak vervolgens relevante categorieën aan die gerelateerd zijn aan het onderwerp en geef elke categorie een relevante naam .
Zoek vervolgens de links die je op je startpagina wil plaatsen en geef elke link een anchor tekst die omschrijft waar de link je bezoeker naar toe stuurt .
Noem je links niet link1 , link2 , en link3 , maar geef ze een naam die relevant is voor de inhoud van de pagina waar de link naar verwijst .
Als extra aanvulling kan voor iedere categorie een korte beschrijving worden toegevoegd .
Maak geen startpagina 's vanuit een puur commercieel oogpunt .
Er is niets mis met te proberen om wat te verdienen met je startpagina , maar vergeet niet dat je bezoekers niet zitten te wachten op een pagina met alleen reclamebanners en affiliate links .
Hetzelfde geldt voor startpagina 's die enkel worden aangemaakt als onderdeel van een linknetwerk .
Een voorbeeld hiervan zijn startpagina 's waarbij alle links verwijzen naar eenzelfde website en naar andere startpagina 's die ook allemaal naar dezelfde website verwijzen .
Dit soort startpagina 's hebben geen enkele waarde voor je bezoekers en gaan bovendien in tegen de Google Richtlijnen voor Webmasters .
We hopen dat we met deze eerste Nederlandstalige post potentiële startpaginabeheerders hebben kunnen voorzien van een aantal nuttige tips die er voor zorgen dat zij het soort startpagina 's kunnen gaan creëren waar onze Nederlandstalige gebruikers van houden !
Tot slot willen we iedereen aanmoedigen om een paid link formulier in te vullen , wanneer je een startpagina tegenkomt die links koopt en verkoopt om daarmee zoekmachines te manipuleren .
Andere zaken die ingaan tegen de Google Richtlijnen voor Webmasters kun je melden door een spamrapport in te sturen .
Wij bekijken elk rapport dat wordt ingestuurd en deze informatie wordt gebruikt om onze algoritmes en zoekresultaten verder te verbeteren .
Zoals altijd wordt jullie feedback en hulp om onze gebruikers te voorzien van de meest relevante zoekresultaten enorm gewaardeerd !

I ’ve been working with Ruby on Rails intensively for several months , and I ’ve finally found a place where Rails can’t readily be extended to do what I want .
It ’s ActiveRecord , which is probably the most controversial part of Rails .
I ’m reminded of a James Gosling quote disparaging Microsoft tools , particularly Visual Basic : “ The easy stuff is easy , but the hard stuff is impossible . ”
There ’s a parallel between VB and Rails in this instance , in that if you only let yourself use the high level tools , the hard stuff is impossible , but the designers specifically tell you to do the hard stuff using a lower level toolset .
The controversy that surrounds “ X ca n’t do everything , therefore it sucks ” should really be focusing on the feasibility of going through that trapdoor to do things “ the hard way ” .
This is what Delphi did , which is why so many folks chose it over VB ; it made the hard stuff easier .
Here ’s the task I need to accomplish , for which ActiveRecord is not well suited : complex queries involving SQL functions and multiple - table joins .
I want to join a few tables together , order by a SQL function , include with each result row the result of a SQL function that operates on each row , and have all that come back as a graph of high - level objects .
Despite my attempts to use plugins , extend and / or fix bugs in those plugins , and to dig through the ActiveRecord source to figure out what the documentation wo n’t tell me , I was unable to get it to work .
Most of the parts of what I wanted was possible : acts_as_tsearch cleverly weaves SQL functions into a high - level ActiveRecord : : Base . find calls ; paginating_find provides a very convenient pagination API on top of ActiveRecord : : Base.find , and ActiveRecord includes some clever association tricks such as automatic many - to - many relationships ( has_and_belongs_to_many ) , eager loading of associated records using a join ( via the :include option to ActiveRecord : : Base.find ) , and a fairly low - level : joins option that lets you add tables to a ‘ find ’ query which can be used in your : conditions .
Problem is , they do n’t all work together in a fancy way .
Really , the issue in this case is related to the design choices that went into ActiveRecord .
Some ORMs ( object - relational mappers ) are designed in a modular fashion : there is a part that helps you describe the relationships between your model objects , a part that helps you construct queries , and a part that does the storage and retrieval .
Sometimes there ’s another part that uses your description of object relationships to create an empty database with the appropriate data model , or that looks at an existing database and creates an object model that matches it .
Sometimes there ’s an import / export tool for bulk data loading or dumping as well .
ActiveRecord has the first three functions integrated ( which has benefits and drawbacks compared to a more modular approach ) , has a very isolated schema manipulation module , and has a somewhat isolated data loader tool .
The relationships are explicitly declared in source code using associations : has_one , has_many , belongs_to , and has_and_belongs_to_many .
These are pretty fancy and provide some convenience features that make the associations appear as object collections , such that changing the collection and saving it turns into insert / delete / update activity in the database .
Query construction is basically tied to the objects themselves , in a way that greatly simplifies star - join queries , but which handles only the simplest joins across multiple tables , and is barely able to handle self - referential joins at all .
So , you can easily load an object ( or group of similar objects ) and associated objects , but OLAP - style queries ( “ what are the top 5 states where customers are located who have bought classical CDs within 2 weeks of their release using American Express and had them shipped as gifts via UPS 3 - day Select ? ” ) are impossible .
Oddly , views , functions , and stored procedures could bridge the gap between real - world data models and ActiveRecord ’s limited set of association types , but they are not supported either .
The storage and retrieval code is inseparable from the query code , and so it is not possible to examine and modify the final SQL before it is executed , nor is it possible to provide an arbitrary query and have the results be parsed into an object graph based on the associations you have defined .
The code that would allow these features appears to exist and be sufficiently well designed to allow this with a fairly small amount of changes to ActiveRecord .
However , it is currently ( as of Rails 1.2.3 , which is the current release ) not part of the documented API and is declared private .
There is a limited facility for constructing simple objects from arbitrary SQL , in find_by_sql .
This loses essentially all of the high level functionality of the find method ; most notably , it is n’t possible to use find_by_sql results to instantiate an object graph , rather than a flat array of objects ( similar to the eager loading feature in the regular find method ) .
ActiveRecord has fairly good high - level schema creation functionality ( “ migrations ” ) .
Though it lacks concepts for all but the basic database objects , support can be added for foreign key constraints ( I kid you not , they are n’t supported by Rails itself ! ) and views .
There ’s also a simple way to execute arbitrary SQL .
Migrations are n’t technically that amazing , but rather they ’re a helpful organizational approach to what can be a really hairy problem : defining a schema and then applying changes to live databases while keeping track of what changes you ’ve already applied .
Finally , there is a test data loading facility called Fixtures .
The common opinion of Fixtures seems to be that they are broken by design and should be avoided .
The main issue I ’ve found with them is that the implementation ignores the kind of database design elements that any book on SQL would recommend , such as foreign keys and check constraints .
I managed to circumvent this with a combination of a plugin and some customization , described in detail in my previous post , Rails , Fixtures , the Test DB , and Test : : Unit .
With those changes , all test fixture data is preloaded in the right order ( so constraints are n’t violated ) before any tests run , and any data alterations within tests are rolled back automatically by Rails .
A secondary issue with Fixtures is that they go directly from YAML text files to SQL INSERT statements , bypassing the ActiveRecord Model classes .
ActiveRecord does pretty much rule out any fancy mapping between database tables and objects , so that ’s not a problem , but this model - skipping fixture loading implementation means that any code in your model object ( validations , before_save filters , etc. ) will not be executed when loading fixtures .
So fixtures do not work well with the otherwise pervasive Rails design rule of “ put all the intelligence in the application ” .
Still , despite the commonly - held disdain for using fixtures at all , I find that they can be tamed .
In fact I ’ve even created a base data facility for loading the fundamental data set that needs to be in the live database ( e.g. initial admin user info ) .
My approach is basically to alter fixture behavior to treat it as essentially a bulk data loading tool , and to do the extra housekeeping after loading to make up for the fact that the ActiveRecord model code was bypassed .
As far as I know , there is no bulk data dumping functionality in Rails .
So , to summarize , of the five main ORM features , here ’s how ActiveRecord stacks up :
Describing Relationships : Easy to understand and use , with lots of slick functionality Querying : Easy to understand and use , but limited to simple join structures , and not possible to customize query building or rewrite SQL before execution Storage and Retrieval : Very easy to use , but only within the limits of the query builder ’s features Schema manipulation :
Easy to understand and use ; limited in functionality but readily extensible ; solid third party plugins are available for missing schema objects Bulk Loading and Dumping : Loading is badly designed and implemented , but fixable with some effort ; dumping is not offered
Okay , so it definitely makes the easy stuff easy .
But what about the rest ?
As I observed before , ActiveRecord is not designed as a set of modules that you use to assemble a solution that fits your needs .
That ’s more of the Java approach to design , and it trades flexibility for convenience .
It can be a major pain to assemble a working system out of all of those abstract Java APIs , which are sometimes so comically over - patternized as to draw mockery such as the hilarious “ Are Javalanders Happy ? ” code snippet from Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns .
Rails makes the opposite trade - off : sacrifice flexibility and gain a very approachable API .
Unfortunately , the Java approach ( too abstract to readily use , but extremely flexible ) is easily wrapped with a simpler , more convenient , less customizable API .
The Rails approach is n’t internally componentized ( have a look at ActiveRecord ’s activerecord / base.rb source file in its 2,165 - line glory , almost all of which is one class ) , so if you want to fiddle with its internal behavior , you can ’t .
So with Rails , it ’s all or nothing : high level slickness for simple requirements , or hand - written SQL and hand - coded results mapping for your complex requirements .
As I said at the beginning , though , the key question is not how comprehensive the high level feature set is .
More important is the question of how painful things are when you drop down to a lower level for a greater degree of control .
It would be nice if there were a middle level of complexity , between the high - level ‘ find ’ method and ‘ has_xxx ’ associations , and raw SQL .
There is n’t .
I think that the reason there is n’t one is that there is still a persistent belief among many Rails core team members and community members that databases should be stupid : just a persistent hash .
Once upon a time I worked that way myself : I did n’t have access to or skill with a SQL RDBMS , and so I solved all of my persistence problems with DBM files , which ( using Perl ’s Tie : : Hash class ) are conceptually just persistent hashtables .
miniSQL was little more than a SQL query parser on top of that sort of storage engine , and MySQL originally was pretty similar .
But big databases have all sorts of useful features that address complicated persistence requirements in a fairly elegant way .
Given that Ruby fans like the idea of domain specific languages , which let you work in a super high level language customized to the problem domain , it ’s surprising that Rails groupthink is that SQL is bad .
It ’s actually a very high level language , and allows a well written database to do some pretty amazing optimization on the fly because it provides a strong layer of abstraction between what you requested and how the storage engine provides it .
No , it ’s not dynamic , nor is it pure relational perfection , but it ’s pretty darn good .
Pre- and post - event validations and arbitrary callbacks to user - specified code , functions providing behavior on top of data … these are all things that Ruby and Rails fans hold in high regard when provided by Ruby and Rails , but which are considered a bad idea at the database layer .
As I discussed at length in Rails and the notion of Stupid Databases Being a Good Idea , this is a philosophy rooted in DRY , but it has some major flaws .
Mainly , there is the issue that some things must be done in the data tier , and trying to put them in the application tier does n’t work .
The best example that comes to mind is full text search .
Satisfying queries is the database ’s job , period .
It ’s just hideously slow to try and do an inner join in the application across a network link to a database .
If you find yourself doing this , that ’s a pretty good sign that your architecture is broken .
But some queries are too complicated for ActiveRecord , so sometimes you must choose between a series of high level queries whose results are intersected in application code ( easy to understand , but extremely inefficient ) , or hand coded SQL .
Well , SQL is fast and is a high level domain - specific language , so it is n’t actually a bad tool for the job .
The problem is that this approach ( the trapdoor to the lower level API ) is regarded differently by different people .
Some see it as a common and reasonable approach to complex requirements ; others see it as a bad evil scary thing that should be avoided at all costs , a kludge and a design mistake .
As a result , the low level option in Rails is anemic .
It ’s there , but you ’re not supposed to use it .
Ruby ’s ActiveRecord Makes Dropping to Raw SQL a Royal Pain ( Probably on Purpose ) notes that there are no bind variables allowed in ActiveRecord .
You may be saying , “ No , wait a minute , I ’ve used them , that ca n’t be right . ”
That ’s what I thought .
Look at the source ; the bind variable functionality is actually a high level feature built on top of drivers that do n’t have that feature .
Whatever you did at the high level , it ’s going to the driver as a single string .
Okay , it ’s nice that they added that feature , especially since it provides a single point of testing and verification for safe escaping .
But that functionality ( in sanitize_sql ) is not part of the public API .
Fortunately that same article provides a workaround that makes sanitize_sql accessible , so you can use bind variables in your hand coded SQL code , and pretend that the driver supports them .
But that ’s not likely to work forever .
The key problem with ActiveRecord is its least common denominator feature set , based around the least featureful of all popular SQL databases : MySQL .
Years ago , MySQL AB ( the vendor of the MySQL database ) took a strong philosophical stand against pretty much any advanced database features ( which their product lacked , and which competing products had ) , but lately they ’ve softened and added those features that they claimed nobody really needed .
In the meantime , Rails has been designed with minimal expectations for database sophistication ; therefore , the limited functionality of ActiveRecord is fairly complete , assuming you ’re using a database with similarly limited functionality .
Triggers , stored procedures , functions , data integrity constraints , nested transactions , and views are all examples of unsupported database functionality .
Try and use them via ActiveRecord ’s high level API , and you will quickly see how fragile and inflexible ActiveRecord really is .
If you should n’t need those features in your database , then you should n’t need anything that ActiveRecord does n’t already provide , so it should n’t matter that you ca n’t extend ActiveRecord .
Truly , these are features that you need only in a few small cases in your application , so looking at individual queries they ’re needed rarely ( which is not the same thing as “ never ” ) .
But looking at whether you need one or more of them in a given application , they ’re needed more often than not .
The pain of using hand coded SQL makes this worse : some tricky things could be done either using a view or stored procedure , or using a really slick dynamic SQL statement .
Making all of those options painful means that even a clever developer ca n’t use anything in their bag of tricks to craft an elegant solution .
Unfortunately , non-trivial web applications need things like full text search , complex associations between persistent objects , non-trival summary information about associated objects , and complex reports , and ActiveRecord fails at all of these .
These are not just things that big dumb ancient companies that like using Object COBOL think they need ; Amazon and eBay need them too .
The acts_as_tsearch plugin is a good case study of ActiveRecord ’s design flaws .
TSearch2 is the standard PostgreSQL full text search engine , and it ’s pretty good in my opinion .
It ’s also pretty straightforward to use .
Unfortunately for developers using Rails , TSearch2 uses SQL functions ( mainly to_tsquery and rank_cd ) .
The acts_as_tsearch plugin tries to inject SQL into ActiveRecord ’s queries via the high - level find interface , but ultimately fails as soon as you use the : joins or : include options .
The problem is that ActiveRecord has a very simplistic idea of how queries and joins work , and so if you need to inject SQL functions to get the job done ( as is necessary in TSearch2 queries ) , too bad .
( See also issues 7 and 8 in acts_as_tsearch , in which I describe and attempt to clean up the mess that results when you use find_by_tsearch in non-trivial ways . )
A fellow Rails developer asked me in all seriousness why I was n’t abandoning the full text search functionality of TSearch2 and just using a completely separate , redundant database product designed exclusively for full text search .
Seriously , that is considered the “ easy ” approach : one database for full text search , and another for ACID / OLTP / CRUD .
Honestly if I were going to go down that road I would try hard to just abandon the SQL RDMBS and put everything in the other database , since Lucene and its imitators are capable of far more than just find - text - in - document queries .
The pain of duplicating everything , using two query languages , two document representations ( in addition to the object representation in Ruby ) and writing application - tier query correlation makes the double - DB approach seem very unwise .
It makes far more sense to me to use the SQL RDMBS ’s full text search facility , even if there ’s a 2 x or 3 x read performance penalty , because the conceptual simplicity of having one powerful storage tier ( instead of two halves cobbled together ) eliminates a ton of ugliness in the application , and the SQL RDBMS is going to get clustered for reads anyway .
Nevertheless , even if I ’m wrong about this case ( putting search in the SQL RDBMS instead of in a separate server ) , there are other cases for needing a smart database that gives you exactly the results you need and lets you push data logic into the data tier .
So , what do I suggest ?
Abandon Rails ?
Nope .
I still like Ruby a lot , and find Rails very useful .
I just think that ActiveRecord needs to support the low - level and middle - level abstractions better .
Specifically , supporting bind variables ( either by exposing that sanitize_sql function , or better yet by making drivers and connection adapters support bind variables for real ) would make the find_by_sql , select_all , and exec approaches to low - level SQL query execution less painful .
More difficult , and substantially more valuable , would be refactoring ActiveRecord : : Base to split it up in the way I described above : association descriptions and unmarshalling code separate from query building code separate from SQL execution and result retrieval code .
All of this could remain hidden for most users under the same old slick high - level API , but for advanced requirements , the ability to fiddle with the SQL and still use the built in high - level unmarshalling code to create object graphs from flat result sets would be very powerful , and useful .
I looked at one alternative to ActiveRecord , called Sequel , which overlaps with ActiveRecord only partially .
It is a query builder and lazy result proxy , which is actually what I thought ActiveRecord would do when I first started working with Rails .
The proxy design means that you can either keep adding constraints or start fetching results , from the same Dataset class .
This seems like a pretty good approach , though I have n’t really looked closely to make sure it would fit what ActiveRecord needs .
What Sequel lacks , though , is the unmarshalling side : turning a 2 - dimensional ( rows of columns ) result set into a complex object graph ( customers with orders with order lines with products from suppliers stored in warehouses ) , with user - controlled eager or lazy loading behavior .
Ruby is well - suited to a design that would allow user - specified code ( i.e. , a block ) to decompose each row into the object graph associated with that row , leaving the remaining associations on those objects to be lazily provided via future queries .
So , I think there is hope for ActiveRecord , definitely .
I considered the idea of rolling a minimal Hibernate clone , or some other sort of challenger to ActiveRecord , but I do n’t that ActiveRecord is broken beyond repair .
I think the shortest path to a badass Ruby ORM is through improvements ( refactoring and abstraction ) to ActiveRecord .
So , if you ’ve read this far , you probably care about these issues .
Here ’s my call to action : Please help me make ActiveRecord less like VB and more like Delphi .
Who else is interested in helping me with this effort ?
Are there alternatives that I ’ve missed , or components that could be integrated into ActiveRecord to make it better ?
“ LABOUR shortage ” is one of the most nonsensical phrases ever coined .
Real shortages happen outside the market economy : armies run short of ammunition ; sailing ships may lack wind .
But with six billion people on the planet , labour is not in short supply .
What “ labour shortage ” means is that employers can't find workers with the right skills at a price they like .
Similar shortages are reported of Rembrandts , lobsters and nice houses in London .
Nonetheless , the news that British farmers are complaining of a “ labour shortage ” is excellent news .
For the past five years , eastern European workers have been pouring into Britain — perhaps as many as a million Poles , and hundreds of thousands of other nationalities , legal and illegal .
The result has been a triumph of European integration .
The diligent new arrivals have boosted economic growth in Britain , and many have gained money and know - how to help rebuild home countries ruined by communism .
That supply seemed inexhaustible .
But it was n't .
Most economies of eastern Europe are now booming , so pay and conditions at home are improving .
The “ discount ” on staying put and the premium on going abroad have both shrunk .
Secondly , the new Europeans are realising that tedious and monotonous agricultural work is not the only way into life in Britain .
Waitressing at a country pub is a better job than picking strawberries in the surrounding fields : you improve your English , do n't get dirty , and meet nicer people .
Figures published last month showed 41 % of registered workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 applying to work in administration , business or management , compared with 25 % three years ago .
The hospitality industry accounted for 19 % and agriculture only 11 % .

Strawberries today , hotels tomorrow ?
The solution for British farmers is simple : compete .
They need to offer their seasonal workers better pay , living accommodation and other treatment .
As Marina Lewycka 's new novel “ Two Caravans ” illustrates so poignantly and amusingly , the bottom end of the agricultural labour market is a cesspit of scams , abuse and squalor .
Workers are paid below the minimum wage , overcharged for cramped and dirty accommodation , ripped off for bogus “ agency fees ” and transport costs .
The farmers are not the worst culprits .
The “ gangmasters ” — as the small employment agencies specialising in casual work for foreigners are known — have an even worse reputation .
A Cornish gangmaster , Baltic Work Team , lost its licence last month after it left 40 Bulgarian workers unpaid for more than a month , threatened to send them home if they did not pay a £ 100 “ deposit ” and threatened them if they complained .
Such sharp practice may indeed shave a couple of pennies off the cost of a punnet of strawberries .
But if the result is that workers simply stay away , the market is sending a useful signal : the rip - off merchants ' business model is unsustainable .
The farming lobby wants the government to ease the “ shortage ” next year by bringing in thousands more workers from Ukraine under a special scheme in which a temporary work visa comes tied to a particular job .
That , the farmers explain , gives them “ certainty ” that their workers wo n't bunk off half way through the harvest .
That is an odd argument : the best way of encouraging workers to stay put and work hard is to treat them properly , not to use schemes more reminiscent of the imperial days of bonded labour and coolies .
Britain and other EU countries should allow Ukrainians to compete in the western labour markets — but as full - fledged participants , not as a reservoir of uncomplaining low - paid workers for a noisy , influential but actually peripheral bit of the economy .

She used the North Vietnamese airwaves to beseech American pilots to consider the effects of their bombing .
Worst of all , once home she branded returning POWs who described torture sessions " hypocrites and liars . "
Despite apologies , fine screen performances and her string of exercise videos , to those on the hard right Jane Fonda will always be Hanoi Jane .
That , of course , was an allusion to Tokyo Rose , the handle that Allied forces in the South Pacific slapped on anonymous English - speaking women who broadcast Japanese propaganda .
In fact , the hard right turned former pin-up girl Fonda into a poster girl for their caricature of liberalism .
Considering how excruciating her exhibition was , even to those on the left , you could scarcely blame them .
In recent years , the hard right has also fired its share of broadsides at Hillary Clinton , George Soros and Nancy Pelosi .
But Jane Fonda remains the figurehead that cuts the prow of their idea of a ship of fools .
However , despite those who thought Fonda had provided aid and comfort to the enemy , the Nixon Administration showed no interest in indicting her for treason .
Maybe the president had a soft spot in his heart for her and , after Pat went to bed , retired to the East Room with a drink ( or six ) for a screening of " Barbarella . "
An example of a true traitor was Mildred Gillars , an American who found work as an actress and an announcer with Radio Berlin before World War II .
After the US entered the conflict , she stayed on and did the Third Reich 's bidding .
Mildred identified herself as " Midge at the mike , " but Allied soldiers called her Axis Sally .
Mildred - Midge - Sally played American songs , attacked FDR , spewed anti-Semitism , and sought to plant doubts in soldiers ' mind about the faithfulness of their sweethearts back home .
Captured , she was tried and served 12 years in prison .
Today , Azzam the American ( Adam Gadahn from California ) alternately appeals to and threatens Americans on behalf of al - Qaeda .
Meanwhile , those who view westerners working for Al Jazeera in the same light only reveal their ignorance of its professionalism and objectivity .
But there 's still a nation that could sorely benefit from an American spokesman : Iran -- its government , that is , not its people .
Their enemy - ness is as elusive as that of the citizens of any country we 've fought in recent years .
Today , of course , we conduct hostilities against either governments or terrorists and , in Iraq , sectarian militias .
The surest route for a government to attain enemy status in our eyes is to support said terrorists .
Besides its support for Hezbollah during its bomb - throwing heyday , Iran cements its status as an enemy through its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons .
Thus far , of course , Tehran has only sought nuclear power for peaceful ends .
But it 's hard to deny that it 's got lust in its heart for nuclear weapons .
At present , though , its efforts are akin to some guy browsing MySpace or Facebook in search of an under - aged girl to lure out of her cyber - lair .
While the American public ain't got no quarrel with them Persians , few of us voice our opposition to the administration 's plans to attack them .
Why do n't we ?
Possible explanations include :
1 . The Iran hostage crisis is still an open wound on our national psyche .
( Sort of like how Iran 's never gotten over 1953 when the CIA helped depose Iran 's elected president Mohammad Mossadegh and re-installed the shah . )
2 . One of the kidnappers himself , president Ahmadinejad , has been only too happy to play bogeyman for us .
Of course , his role in the hostage crisis is as apocryphal as his call for Israel to be wiped off the map .
But the infamous holocaust denial conference he hosted was all too real .
Recently he boasted that Iran 's nuclear program was now cascading ( separating out the bad uranium from the good ) 3,000 centrifuges .
Once a program reaches this threshold , it 's on its way to producing nuclear energy and , down the road , weaponizing it .
You 've seen or heard of the movie " 300 , " in which the Persians get their heads handed to them by the Spartans .
Now see " 3,000 , " in which Ahmadinejad 's boasts bring down the wrath of Israel and the US on him and his country .
( Though how 3,000 centrifuges stacks up against 10,000 nuclear warheads between the US and Israel is n't clear . )
3 . When the names Osama and Saddam merged in the minds of Americans , it was one occasion when the use of that jargony word " conflate " ( v. to bring together ; meld or fuse ) was warranted .
Because their names are much more similar , we 're that much more likely to conflate the menacing Ayatollah Khomeini , who led Iran 's 1979 Revolution , with its present " Supreme Leader " Ali Khameini .
When it comes to niceties like getting foreign names right , Americans do n't stand on ceremony .
4 . Nor do we sweat the small stuff when it comes to stretching the meaning of a term .
Even though terrorist groups are , by definition , non-state actors , we do n't object to Bush & Co. designating the Revolutionary Guard , with its elite Quds unit , as a terrorist organization .
They cite the arms with which they believe Iran supplies Iraqi Shiite militias .
Especially EFPs ( explosively formed penetrators ) which are taking the " improvised " out of IEDs ( improvised explosive devices ) .
If these devious devices are crossing their mutual border , the Revolutionary Guard 's guilt has yet to be supported by evidence .
In fact , as the erstwhile Gareth Porter explains , while their use is down in recent months , constructing them has been one of Iraq 's new cottage industries .
It just that , given the Revolutionary Guard 's past as a mentor to Hezbollah , supplying Iraq with arms sounds like something Iran would do .
Also , the Guard supports Iraq 's Badr brigade and may have provided training for Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi army .
Still , the Guard 's support for Shiite militias is a drop in the bucket compared to the funding our allies , the Saudis , funnels to Iraq 's Sunni insurgents .
Also , an unwritten rule holds that you do n't go to war over the actions of another nation 's proxies or intelligence agencies .
Were that the case , the whole world would have been warranted in declaring war on us decades ago for the wholesale depredations of the CIA .
5. Ahmadinejad may crow about his centrifuges and Cheney and the Neocons portray Iran 's acquisition of nuclear weapons as nearly a done deal .
But there 's another reason why we think Iran is on the yellowcake road to nuclear weapons .
It 's hard to believe that , when all these other countries have developed them , Iran is still playing with test tube like high school students in chemistry class .
After all , the technology has been around 60 years .
Are n't a brainy college kid , the Internet , and a good machine shop all you need today to toss together a rudimentary bomb ?
Iran may have benefited from the technical and material largesse of Qadeer Khan , the " grandfather " of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
But between the shutdown of his black market ( since rumored back in action ) and the International Atomic Energy Agency breathing down its neck , its nuclear program has two strikes against it .
One shudders to think of the third â€ “- an attack by the US .
6 . Thus skeptical of Iran 's nuclear innocence , we find ourselves secretly rooting for the administration to bust a bunker or two hundred belonging to Iran 's underground nuclear program .
The debacle of the Iraq War has failed to disabuse us of the notion that we can still get in and out fast , like in the Gulf War .
Iran may be it own worst enemy at times .
But it can also be its own best friend -- and , if we let it , ours ( maybe not BFFs , but joined in a marriage of convenience ) .
In a recent eye - opening Esquire article by John Richardson , former Bush administration officials Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann catalogue Iran 's overtures to us .
After 9/11 , not only was it eager to help us subdue the Taliban in Afghanistan , but to hold -- drumroll , please -- unconditional talks .
" ' It was revolutionary , ' Mann says .
' It could have changed the world . ' "
The administration 's reaction ?
It slapped away the olive branch Iran was extending as if were a gun pointed at its face .
Again in 2003 , Supreme Leader Khameini 's son- in - law presented an intermediary , the Swiss ambassador to Iran , with a detailed proposal for peace in the Middle East .
" Scanning it , " writes Richardson , " Mann was startled by one dramatic concession after another -- ' decisive action ' against all terrorists in Iran , an end of support for Hamas and the Islamic Jihad , a promise to cease its nuclear program , and also an agreement to recognize Israel . "
In other words , beat those swords into ploughshares , stick daisies in rifle barrels , break out the warm puppies , and let 's celebrate peace in the Middle - East .
The administration 's response this time ?
To complain to the Swiss government about their ambassador 's meddling .
Obviously , it 's tough for Bush & Co. to justify attacking Iran .
Maybe they should try the truth : that we want to be top dog in the Middle East in order to best allocate energy resources to ourselves .
With the rise in oil prices giving no signs of abating , most of us would overlook how much Big Oil stands to benefit and support a resource grab .
After all , a nation has to do what it has to do to survive .
But it 's a measure of how desperate more and more of us are to thwart an attack that we might be ready to resort to desperate measures -- for our own sakes as well as Iran's .
For example , why not furnish Iran with its own version of a Hanoi Jane , Axis Sally , or Azzam the American -- a Tehran Todd , if you will .
Such a person could apply for work with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting , from which to broadcast Iran 's point of view to Americans .
For instance , Tehran Todd could inform us that at a recent major Friday prayer service in Tehran one Ayatollah Kashani stressed the peaceful civilian nature of Iran 's nuclear program .
He reiterated that not only do nuclear weapons play no part in Iran 's defensive doctrine , but they contradict Islamic values and teachings .
Besides , TT could point out to us , the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty grants the acquisition or development of nuclear energy to every country that 's signed on to it .
Just because the treaty 's original ratifiers failed to foresee that weaponizing nuclear energy would be less difficult in the future should n't penalize the signatory ( fancy word for signee ) .
Outrage at Iran for enriching uranium just because we do n't like its face should be channeled into an initiative to amend the offending article ( IV ) of the NPT .
Now is not the time for Bush & Co. to make another end run around the law .
They 've already made a career of it and , as a result , expend much of their energy trying to keep the telecoms from being prosecuted for warrantless spying , as well as themselves for their illegal authorization of torture .
Tehran
Todd could continue by pointing out that if Iran finds itself looking longingly at nuclear weapons , Americans have only the administration to thank .
Its failure to pay more than lip service to another article ( VI ) of NPT and begin the disarmament process in earnest makes Iran , not to mention the rest of the world , nervous .
Even more nerve - wracking is Iran 's proximity to Israel , a country which is light years more guilty of illegal nuclear acts .
Not only is Israel a non-signatory of the NPT , it 's never even formally owned up to it nuclear weapon program .
But it would behoove Tehran Todd to gloss over that little detail in light of the antipathy , both real and imagined , that Ahmadinejad has demonstrated toward Jews and Israel .
Besides , to most of the US , the Holy Land can do no wrong .
Instead , air programs about inter - faith dialogues between Iran and the US .
Many have been initiated by groups such as Search for Common Ground , Network 2020 and the Fellowship of Reconciliation , all of which have visited Iran .
Also , interview Iran 's citizens to provide them a forum for sharing their love of American people and culture with us .
Finally , TT , report that scholars recently converged on Tehran to commemorate the 800th birthday of the poet Rumi .
Not only is he revered by Muslims ( anti-life Salafis and Wahabbis excepted ) , he 's arguably America 's most beloved poet since the likes of Rod McKuen and Maya Angelou .
Do n't forget to mention that , before the minister of culture honored Rumi with a speech , the ceremony opened with an address delivered by none other than President Ahmadinejad himself .
Please , Tehran Todd , help us know the spiritual side of the man who Israel sees as Mr. Thirty Seconds Over Tel Aviv .
To those who retort that Tehran Todd is a traitor , he only need remind us that the only difference between his message and that of progressive commentators in the US is that it 's coming from Iran instead of the West .
Here comes the inevitable question .
You seem to know a lot about this .
Why do n't you put your money where your mouth is , apply for a visa ( Americans can only enter Iran in a group tour at present ) and volunteer your services ?
I 'm already doing my patriotic duty by paying off my credit card debt .
Besides , this writer has a better idea .
Actually it's that of another writer , the feminist and activist author Naomi Wolf , who suggests a new round of demonstrations .
Demonstrations ?
Where did they get us with Iraq ?
Anyway , we 're too busy building a critical mass on the Web .
Did you know that Vice President Cheney is sensitive to what he reads on blogs , whether it's the Drudge Report , Politico or DailyKos ?
Not .
Graciously appearing on a little - known blog ( re- posted at AlterNet ) , Ms. Wolf provides detailed directions for sit-ins .
Demonstrations are bad enough , but sit-ins ?
They 're so sixties .
Hers , however , are the new and improved variety .
At first , they sound familiar :
Set up a website for monthly events held in a public space ; send a press kit to local media outlets .
Then Ms. Wolf gets inventive :
Ask all attending to wear red , white , or blue shirts or sweaters .
" A strong visual is more likely to get wide press coverage , " she surmises .
Also , " Have people bring uniformly sized US flags . "
Not those dinky things you hold between your thumb and forefinger either .
" It reinforces that this is pure support for the American system , not partisanship . "
Finally , make music .
" The civil rights movement sang , " she writes , while progressives today make speeches .
" For some mysterious reason , protests swell and move people when there is singing , but depress and dispirit people when there are only speeches or angry chanting . "
Sit-ins , Ms. Wolf concludes , are " more effective now than a march ; less cause for confrontation , more family - friendly .
. . more of a community affirmation of American values and the Rule of Law . "
You remember law , do n't you ?
Unfortunately , with possession nine - tenths , it 's currently under the lock and key of Bush & Co .
But who among us has either the time or the network to initiate a series of sit-ins ?
We can always appeal to those who have .
For instance , try emailing an excerpt from Ms. Wolf 's suggestions for her new demo model , as well as the link , to anti-war coalition United for Peace & Justice .
They might bristle at first , but if enough of us make ourselves heard , they 'll eventually bend to the old adage that the customer knows best .

But statistics rarely tell the whole story .
While some women believe that more than one lover is too many , there are others seemingly happy to change partners as frequently as their handbags .
Here , SADIE NICHOLAS asks four women how many lovers they have had - and examines the emotional consequences of their sexual choices .
CHRISTINA KHATER was in her early teens when she made the decision to remain a virgin until she married .
As a teenager at a state school , her only physical contact with the opposite sex were kisses with a boy she dated for a few months at 14 .
Now aged 22 and a film studies graduate , she is still a virgin .
She lives in a flat in London with her 22 - year - old fiancee Gabriel Wakim .
She has been seeing him for three years - but they have never had sex .
" I decided that when I had sex for the first time , I wanted it to be special and I would wait until my wedding night , " she explains , keen to point out that her vow of chastity is not for religious reasons .
And having watched her friends get hurt over the years , she feels vindicated in her decision .
File pic
" A lot of my friends have casual flings , and I 've noticed that the ones who jump into bed with someone too soon are the ones who often get hurt the most when the relationship flounders , " she says .
" I 'd never judge anyone for choosing to have sex with someone who was n't their husband - but it 's just not for me .
" People may be surprised that I 'm still a virgin in my 20s because there 's such pressure on young women to ' enjoy themselves ' and , apparently , feel liberated by having lots of lovers
" Because of my choices , I never have to worry about sexually transmitted diseases , pregnancy or any of the other troubles which can go hand in hand with casual sex . "
Kissing and cuddling is as near as she and Gabriel get to intimacy - but Christina admits it 's not always easy .
" There have been times when I 've felt a physical urge to make love to him and I 've had to force myself to pull back , " she says .
" It can be terribly frustrating . "
Her mother , who is Greek , is a housewife and her father is director of a civil engineering company , and Christina describes her upbringing as " normal " .
" My parents are in no way responsible for my decision , " she insists .
" It 's something very personal to me . "
But while Christina may be a virgin , her husband - to - be is not .
" Gabriel 's had sexual partners before , but I do n't know how many .
I 've never asked . "
When they started dating , she told him she was a virgin and would be until she married .
Inevitably , Christina feared that her fiancee might look elsewhere for physical satisfaction .
" But he respected my decision , and here we are three years later .
We plan to marry in the next two years , and consummating our marriage will be all the more special because we have waited . "
ANNETTE LEDBROOK has only ever slept with two men : the boyfriend to whom she lost her virginity , and her 29 - year - old husband Daniel , a management accountant .
The couple live together in Quinton Village , Birmingham , with their children Oliver , five , and 14 - month - old Harriet .
Annette is expecting their third child later this year .
She says it was the sexual activity she witnessed as a teenager that put her off casual sex .
Raised in a middle - class , Christian household in Birmingham , she insists her parents were not strict , and after attending a Church of England primary school she went to an ordinary mixed comprehensive .
" As a teenager , I was n't that interested in boys - I wanted to concentrate on my schoolwork and make my parents proud .
" Also , I comforted one friend who was going through the agony of an abortion , and I did n't want to be like that .
Yes , I was the butt of jokes from friends who thought I was a goody two shoes - but I did n't care .
" I hung onto my virginity until I was 20 , at university , and had been with my first boyfriend , a fellow student , for a year .
" He was a virgin , too , so it was a big deal for both of us and we planned it meticulously , booking a cottage in Wales for a weekend .
We wanted it to be special . "
After another year together they split up .
Annette continued studying management and accountancy at a college of further education in Birmingham , and not long afterwards she met Daniel .
" We knew from the start that ours was a special relationship , and we first had sex after four months , " she says .
" He 'd only had one lover before me .
" I did once ask him if he regretted not being a bit of a Jack the lad - but , like me , he much prefers what we have .
I do n't ever look back and wish I 'd slept around . '
Despite their growing family , Annette insists : " We still have sex most days .
" People ask what our secret is - it 's simply that we are totally in love and continue to invest the same effort in making one another feel as special as we did in those early days .
" I love the intimacy of sex with Daniel .
He still makes me feel like a sexy , gorgeous woman - not just a wife and mother . "
Until three years ago , 37 - year - old JO KINGSTON had only had six sexual partners - but in the following two years she notched up another 15 .
It happened after the PA , who works at a major London tourist attraction , split up from her long - term boyfriend and started internet dating .
" A couple of them were short - term relationships , while others were one - night stands .
It sounds a lot , but it 's only one every two months - which I do n't think is so bad .
" I surprised myself , though , in the way that I managed to detach sex from emotion in the same way men can . "
Even so , Jo , who lives alone at her house in Edgware , Middlesex , found that the consequences of such behaviour finally took their toll .
" It 's fine for a while , but eventually it affected my self - esteem and I began to get a bit of a complex .
Why did men only want to sleep with me , yet not date me properly ?
" The answer , of course , is that when you make yourself available sexually , men are likely to have a different perception of you . "
Jo grew up in London and was five when her father , a newsagent , died .
Her mother , a shop assistant , remarried but sex was rarely discussed in the household .
Jo , who attended the local mixed comprehensive , lost her virginity at the age of 16 to a boy who lived round the corner from her .
They did n't use any contraception .
" There was a pregnancy scare and my mother found out , " she says .
" She told me off but did n't really sit me down and talk about the implications of having sex . "
There followed a number of back - to - back long - term relationships .
By the time she was 18 , Jo was living in a flat above her mother 's and planning a wedding to her then boyfriend .
" But I knew I would miss out on so much in life if I settled down so young , ' she says .
Jo moved to Berkshire and , starting as an office junior , worked her way up through companies such as Columbia Pictures and the BBC .
" All the men I 've slept with I met through work , " she says .
" I wanted to settle down and get married , but there was always something not quite right that stopped me from doing so . "
Her last long - term relationship lasted five years .
" I loved him like a friend , " she says , " but the chemistry was not right .
Finally , I plucked up the courage to end it . "
She embarked on the dating scene in London 's bars and clubs , expecting to meet someone quickly .
Instead , she found herself in a world where sexual encounters are often all too brief .
" With hindsight , I think 15 is actually too many men to have slept with in two years .
I do n't regret it , because it was something I felt the need to do .
" I always practise safe sex , because HIV terrifies me , but I would never be that promiscuous again .
" No - strings sex was n't all it was cracked up to be , either physically or otherwise , and it meant I let myself date unsuitable men because I knew it would never last long . "
Last summer , she was dumped by one man by email .
Embarrassed , she vowed to become celibate for a year .
" I was attracting men who only wanted one thing .
I can't deny there was a certain excitement being intimate with lots of different men , but it 's made me realise I much prefer sex in a long - term , loving relationship .
" I stuck to my vow of celibacy for nine months and worked at getting my self - respect back .
" Then , three weeks ago , I started dating a new man .
I met him at a time when I really was n't looking for sex , so it took me a bit by surprise that we got together , " she says .
" Now , for the first time in years , I 'm really enjoying getting to know a man , and looking beyond sex to something more meaningful .
I do n't want to go back to casual relationships . "
JASMINE SMITH , a 21 - year - old part - time photographer and dressmaker from York , admits she was shocked when she added up all her lovers and realised there had been 90 .
" Sometimes I really regret sleeping with so many men because it makes me feel cheap and a bit ashamed , " she says .
She was 15 and at a mixed state school in York when she lost her virginity to a 19 - year - old boy .
A year later , she fell pregnant by another teenage boy .
Feeling desperately ill - equipped to be a mother , she terminated the pregnancy , but after being dumped by the 16 - year - old father , she embarked on four years of reckless promiscuity .
" Some men were friends of friends ; others I picked up on nights out .
There were a few I developed feelings for , and when they ended things I felt that same hurt I 'd felt at 16 all over again . "
Jasmine is not the first young woman to confuse sex and love and find herself on a never - ending search for lasting affection .
And her experiences certainly contradict the idea that sexual promiscuity is somehow " liberating " , or that women can detach themselves emotionally from their sexual behaviour .
A painful family history may also have contributed to her behaviour .
Jasmine was just two when her mother , who works with autistic children , and her father , who runs his own small business , separated .
She saw her father only sporadically .
Her mother remarried and later separated from her stepfather .
" It had a real effect on my attitude to sex , " says Jasmine .
" I 've never had a man in my life who 's cared about me consistently , and that 's what I 've been searching for - even if I 've gone about it the wrong way . "
She was bullied at the mixed comprehensive she attended in York .
" I did n't look like the other girls , " she says .
" I did n't wear make - up and short skirts .
I used to hang around with boys a lot because I found them less judgmental than the girls , but I used to get called names for it . "
As she got older , her interest in boys grew .
" Mum was quite open - minded about sex , but I do n't really remember her giving me advice or telling me how I should behave .
" Several girls in my year at school were pregnant by the time they were 14 , but my immediate group of friends did n't lose their virginity until much later .
" I sat somewhere between the two , and was 15 when I first had sex with a boy .
It was n't an experience to boast about . "
Having embarked on a sexual path , it seemed impossible to turn back .
At 16 , she became pregnant and had an abortion .
She and her boyfriend got engaged , but two months later he left her for another girl .
" After the abortion , I was an emotional wreck for a long time , " she says .
And yet the terrible irony is that it made her even more selfdestructive .
" I decided I would treat sex as sex , and try to detach it from feelings . "
So followed a four - year period when Jasmine slept with more than 20 lovers a year .
" It became a vicious circle , " she says .
" While I was having sex , I 'd feel needed and wanted , but as soon as it was over I 'd feel emotionally vulnerable again .
" Lots of women think they can detach themselves emotionally from sex in the way men do - and I thought I could .
But now I do n't believe women can : it 's just not in our make - up to be that physically calculating .
" A year ago , I decided something had to change .
I did n't want to get a reputation and , above all , I wanted a man who did n't just want to use me for a bit of fun .
" So I vowed not to have sex again until I found a man I could stay with , and who would respect me . "
At the start of her bid to turn over a new leaf , Jasmine visited an STD clinic .
" Stupidly , I have n't always practised safe sex - and I panicked .
I remember thinking that I could be HIV positive . "
Thankfully , all the tests were clear .
And since that day , Jasmine has remained celibate .
" I feel much better about myself .
When I think about how many men I 've slept with , I can't believe it was me , and my friends are shocked too .
" My mother does n't know the extent of my sexual encounters , and she 'll be sad when she finds out that I felt vulnerable enough to let men use me that way .
At least I 've made the change now , before it 's too late .
The Air Force ’s Friday report on the August 29 - 30 nuclear weapons incident which saw six armed cruise missiles flown across the continental US in launch position on a B - 52H bomber leaves all the big questions unanswered , attempting to shuck the whole thing off as an “ unacceptable mistake . ”
To be sure , Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne and Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Maj. Gen. Richard Newton , said that after a six - week investigation , five officers , including Col .
Bruce Emig , commander of the Fifth Bomb Group at Minot AFB in North Dakota , where the flight originated , have been relieved of duty , and 65 other Air Force personnel were also removed from their duties , and both Barksdale and Minot were decertified for their strategic nuclear responsibilities .
But that ’s still pretty small beer for an incident so serious it ’s never happened before in half a century of nuclear weapons handling .
There are , at this point , no court martials being contemplated , and nobody ’s been discharged from the military .
Put simply , six 150 - kiloton warheads were improperly attached to six Advanced Cruise Missiles , all loaded onto a wing launch pod , and then mounted on the wing of a B - 52 H Stratofortress at Minot , along with six similar missiles with dummy warheads , which were loaded onto a launch pod on the plane ’s other wing , an all 12 were improperly and illegally flown across the country to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana .
The Air Force , following its “ investigation , ” is saying the same thing it said before the investigation : it was all a big “ mistake ” — the result of “ widespread disregard for the rules ” regarding handling of nuclear weapons .
A few guys at Minot “ inexplicably ” screwed up and loaded the nukes and then there were a chain of mistakes because no one else treated the nuclear - tipped missiles as if they were armed with nuclear weapons .
The trouble with this theory , or story line if you will , is that while nobody at Minot , supposedly , noticed what was happening — even though ground crew workers spent eight hours laboring to get the pod with the six nuke - tipped missiles mounted on the plane ’s wing .
This despite the warheads are clearly visible and identifiable by the silver coating they exhibit when viewed through a little window in each nosecone cover , and because there are red coverings on the nuke nosecones — once the plane got to Barksdale , the ground crew there , which had no reason on earth to suspect it was looking at nuclear warheads , spotted them immediately upon going to the plane .
They had no reason to expect nukes because for 40 years it has been illegal for the military to carry nuclear weapons on bombers over US territory , and indeed since 1991 , it has been illegal to even load nuclear weapons on a plane , period , even for training purposes on the ground .
( The weapons went unnoticed for 10 hours in Barksdale , but that 's because no groundcrew visited the plane for that long , but when they did go to it , they reportedly spotted the nukes right off the bat . )
How can it be that Air Force ground crew people at Barksdale could spot the nukes in a flash while nobody at Minot — not the workers who mounted the warheads on the missiles in the heavily guarded bunker , not the guards who are supposed to guard those weapons with their lives and prevent any unauthorized removal from the bunkers , not the ground crew that loaded them onto the plan , and not the pilot and crew of the bomber , who are supposed to check every missile before they take off — noticed they were nuclear warheads ?
The Air Force , at a press conference announcing the results of its investigation , did n’t answer this question .
It appears they reporters at the session did n’t ask it either .
Certainly the AP reporter did n’t ask it , because if she had , she would surely have included the Air Force ’s answer , or it ’s non-answer , in her story .
Nobody , apparently , asked the Air Force either about six mysterious violent deaths of Air Force personnel from Minot and Barksdale , and from a mysterious Air Force Special Commando Group , all of which occurred in the days and weeks immediately before , during and after the incident .
Two of those deaths — of the Special Commando Group officer and of a Minot weapons guard — were reportedly “ suicides . ”
In an article in the current issue of American Conservative magazine , currently on newsstands , I report that incredibly , no federal investigators from the Pentagon or the federal government even bothered to contact the police investigators or medical examiners who investigated those six deaths — an remarkable failure of due diligence , given the seriousness of this incident .
One retired Navy officer who contacted me during my investigation , who worked in electronic warfare , told me it would be simply impossible for those weapons to have been moved out of the storage bunker .
He claims to know for a certainty that all nuclear weapons in the US arsenal are equipped with high - tech tags ( “ like they have at WalMart and Kmart only better ” ) that would instantly trigger alarms when the weapons are moved , unless they were deliberately disarmed .
So what we have is pretty clearly a cover - up here .
A cover -up of what though ?

A general strike is proposed for the United States on September11 , 2007 , the sixth anniversary of the 9/11/2001 attacks on New York City and Arlington , Virginia .
The general strike movement has no clearly named leadership .
It ’s described as an Internet viral effort .
Wikipedia defines viral efforts on the Internet as :
An object ( or an idea ) is viral when it has the ability to spread copies of itself or change other similar objects to become more like ( it ) when those objects are simply exposed to the viral object .
General strikes , more common in Europe , are events that shut down the normal operations of a city , state , or nation for a period of time .
These strikes aim to force awareness and action on a single issue or broader set of concerns .
The 9/11/07 General Strike has a central location - http://www.strike911.org/
- on the Internet , which is linked to and reproduced on a variety of other internet sites .
The site states the rationale for the effort :
The General Strike is a national call to action , from citizens to other citizens .
It is not about a single issue .
It is not an anti-war protest , a civil rights protest , an election fraud protest .
It is not about torture , surveillance , corporate media , the 9/11 coverup , or the environment .
This strike is about all these issues and more .
We all have different concerns , but we all have the same concern : we are being lied to and this government does not represent us .
Join other Americans in demanding truth , justice , and accountability .
This is our country .
And our world .
We just have to stand up .
A National Call to Action : Tuesday , September 11th , 2007
No school .
No work .
Buy nothing .
Hit the streets ( Click “ ABOUT ” )
LOCK DOWN USA – NO Answers ( to anything )
The strike targets key issues facing the American public , issues that have not been addressed in any meaningful way by any branch of government .
These include enduring questions and inconsistencies about 911 , the Iraq War ; violations of civil rights ; and election fraud .
As the statement above indicates , one key means of the coverup is the corporate media .
Citizen discontent with 911 has been expressed in a number of public opinion polls .
One of the most shocking surveyed citizens of New York City .
The little reported August , 2004 Zogby Poll found that “ Half of New Yorkers Believe US Leaders Had Foreknowledge of Impending 9 - 11 Attacks and “ Consciously Failed . ”
National surveys also show substantial skepticism about the efforts of “ US Leaders . ”
Other concerns of the strike include areas of strong public skepticism .
As of August , 2007 , 64 % of Americans oppose the Iraq War and a majority says it should never have happened in the first place .
Massive violations of civil rights are occurring with the aid of the U.S. Department of Justice , as reported by its former voting rights head .
Confidence in the legitimacy of the Bush government has been voiced in polls in Pennsylvania and in a national sample of registered voters .
Both Zogby polls showed that tens of millions of Americans have little faith in the fairness and results of the 2004 presidential election .
Reflecting the disquiet of the American public , Bush popularity is in free fall .
As low as 26 % approval in recent polls , his decline has been steady and unending since the peak after the 9/11 attacks ( with an odd spike on Election Day 2004 ) .
The strike campaign argues that these and other issues rarely covered in any depth by nearly all of the corporate media leave only one move for citizens - a general strike to protest the policies plus the lack of recognition and response .

一昨日の文化審議会著作権分科会過去の著作物等の保護と利用に関する小委員会（第7回）で、一番光っていたのは津田大介委員だと思う。延長を主張する側が色々なことを述べても、的確に、急所を突いて質問し、反論していた。津田委員と呼ぶとよそよそしいので、津田さんと呼ばせていただくが、傍聴していて、自分たちの代表がそこにいる、と実感した。
津田さんが的確な反論を即座にできたのは、津田さんがこの問題に対して非常に深い考察をされているからであるのは当然だが、津田さん個人の能力や努力だけでは無いと思う。ネット上には、著作権についての有意義な意見や発言がたくさんあふれている。著作権を扱うブロガーも少なくないし、そこで書かれていることは、きちんと考察された者も多い。津田さんの元にそれらの意見や発言が集まってきたり、津田さん自身が収集したりして、延長はの意見に対する的確な反論が既にストックされているのだと思う。だから、即座に反論できるのだと思う。
言い換えれば、ネットを津田さんのブレーンとしてフル活用されているのだと思う。
だから、自分たちの代表が発言しているんだ、と傍聴していて感じることができたのだと思う。
まさに、津田さんはエンドユーザーの代表なのだ。
思い起こせば、2004年の国会で輸入権の議論がなされたとき、民主党の城井崇議員（当時）が文部科学大臣に向かって「ブログって知ってますか」と質問をした。ブログを通じて輸入権の反対運動が盛り上がっていると言うことが国会の審議の中で言及されたのだが、今国会議員を介さなくても、審議会の委員会の中に自分たちの代表がいて、自分達の声を代弁している。改正案が国会に出されてしまってはもう遅い、審議会の場でつぶしておかなければダメだ、と言うことを輸入権の時に思い知らされた。でも今は、津田さんを介して審議会の場に自分たちの意見が出される、反映される。これは本当に心強い。
津田さんが委員に入っている意義は本当に大きい。
そして、津田さんが委員に入っているのは、輸入権の時の反対運動があったからだ。あの反対運動が無ければ、ネット界隈の声を文化庁が聞こうとは思わなかったはずだ。
謎工さんを始め、多くの方の反対の声は決して無駄にはなっていない。
あの時蒔いた種がいま育ちつつあるのだと思う。

As public relations professionals , we know how to figuratively stretch a dollar .
Occasionally , clients do n’t have a recurring roster of robust news , or the news they do have is not always deemed media - worthy ( think internal company announcements or minor hiring shifts ) .
As PR practitioners , we ’re tasked with helping clients make the most of the messages they disseminate , even if the content is n’t necessarily “ new ” news .
I think the idea for my Neighborhood Speed Trap came from reading the old internet standby , " 100 ways to be annoying " , # 84 - Sit in your front yard pointing a hair dryer at passing cars to see if they slow down .
Our family lives on a beautiful two - lane road in Sacramento .
It is a great street to live on , except for all of the cars .
And the motorcycles .
And the helicopters .
People speed by , oblivious to the impact they could have if something unexpected runs into the road .
On Saturday , it was time to try out my new Hot Wheels Radar Gun .
Yes , they make a radar gun for kids , they work , and they are $ 20 .
The plan was to see what road conditions would have the greatest impact on drivers .
I would note the average speed of cars before and after placing some objects in view of passing drivers .
I found the perfect spot to try it .
At several places on my street ( T Street ) , grassy islands divide the west and east - bound lanes of traffic .
The small triangular area at the leading edge of the island was right in the line of sight for every driver that came down the road .
That would be my stage .
I sat a few yards down the road .
Ideally , I 'd have been hidden behind a Hooter 's billboard , but we live in a classy part of town so the only billboards are for diamonds and casinos .
The first thing I wanted to do was to find out what the average speed was under normal circumstances .
Most were below the speed limit .
I measured the speed of 35 passing cars , and found that they were traveling at an average of 27.1 miles per hour .
With this information in hand , I could determine what effect , if any , my efforts would have on the flow of traffic .
The first speed - reduction device I tried was this Mr. Potato Head .
Standing at just eight inches tall , he would be easy to overlook , but I had a feeling that seeing a toy here would remind drivers that children live on this street .
Right away , I could tell it was n't working .
The next set of 35 cars were actually going a little bit faster than my baseline set , averaging 27.8 mph .
This part of the experiment unfolded from 11:58 am to 12:10 pm , so drivers may have been in a rush to get to lunch .
On the other hand , Mr. Potato Head might have influenced drivers to go faster .
Also , he might have influenced them to order french fries .
For the next test , I swapped the Potato Head for this pink tricycle .
A pink tricycle with no rider .
Surely this would signal drivers that a child was near the road .
Not everyone was fooled by the pink tricycle .
Many people sped by undeterred .
On the other hand , a few people put it together and slowed down considerably .
Two vehicles slowed to 16 mph and one crept past at 11 .
The first 19 cars drove by at an average of 25.1 mph , and I only had a chance to measure 19 before the experiment came to an end .
House votes to end CIA rendition program , ACLU says RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This A little noticed prohibition in the Democrats ' $ 50 billion Iraq funding bill that passed the House Wednesday would effectively end CIA renditions , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
The ACLU , one of the largest nonprofit organizations fighting the Bush Administration on torture and civil liberties issues , lauded House members for passing the bill , which faces a rocky road in the Senate .
The Iraq funding measure revises the Army Field Manual to prohibit torture and abuse , including waterboarding , and authorizes an array of specific interrogation tactics .
It specifically states that CIA operatives must adhere to these rules as well .
 The House of Representatives made great progress last night by passing legislation that reinforces the ban on torture and abuse by any government body or official ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , in a release .
 This could end the CIAs use of torture if signed into law .
America does not stand for torture and Americans can now know that no element of our government is engaged in torture .
This will begin to restore Americas tarnished image at home and abroad . 
CIA renditions involve what some call an illegal practice of capturing terror suspects abroad and engaging in harsh interrogation techniques , shuffling them through different countries and sometimes handing them over to countries that practice torture as a matter of course to extract information .
RAW STORY was the first to reveal the location of a secret CIA prison in Poland in March 2007 .
The bill would fund the Iraq for an additional four months and demands the withdrawal of troops to begin in 30 days .
It is unlikely to be passed by the Senate in its current form .
If the bill now fails to pass in the Senate or is vetoed by the president , the Pentagon will be forced to borrow from its budget to finance the occupation starting Nov. 17 , 2007 .
Congress used the approaching deadline for an extension to include language not only banning torture , but also provisions that will reduce troops and force a new mission in Iraq .
 The House voted last night to stop the Bush administration from playing word games with anti-torture laws ,  Christopher Anders , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel , added in the release .
 The Army Field Manual spells everything out in clear black - and - white language , with no room for any lawyer to weasel around its protections .
If the Army Field Manual is good enough for Americas men and women serving in uniform , it should certainly be good enough for civilians . 
Also Thursday , a new report indicated that Ukraine airstrips had been used in CIA renditions .
It ’s gotten almost no coverage in the mainstream media , but earlier this week , Ron Paul introduced a bill that would repeal most of the Constitution excesses we ’ve seen over the past seven years :
On Monday , Rep. Ron Paul , the outsider Republican presidential candidate who has long upheld these values and who was an early voice warning of the grave danger to all of us of these abuses , introduced the AFA ’s legislative package into Congress .
( The mainstream press has an irrational habit of disparaging outsider candidates — as if corrupt money and machine endorsements equal seriousness of purpose — even though the Founders hoped that the system they established would lead citizens , ideally those unembedded in the establishment , to offer their service to the nation . )
Here ’s is Paul ’s speech to the House when he introduced the bill :
Madam Speaker , today I am introducing a comprehensive piece of legislation to restore the American Constitution and to restore the liberties that have been sadly eroded over the past several years .
This legislation seeks to restore the checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution by our Founding Fathers to prevent abuse of Americans by their government .
This proposed legislation would repeal the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 and re-establish the traditional practice that military commissions may be used to try war crimes in places of active hostility where a rapid trial is necessary to preserve evidence or prevent chaos .
The legislation clarifies that no information shall be admitted as evidence if it is obtained from the defendant through the use of torture or coercion .
It codifies the FISA process as the means by which foreign intelligence may be obtained and it gives members of the Senate and the House of Representatives standing in court to challenge presidential signing statements that declares the president ’s intent to disregard certain aspects of a law passed in the U.S. Congress .
It prohibits kidnapping and extraordinary rendition of prisoners to foreign countries on the president ’s unilateral determination that the suspect is an enemy combatant .
It defends the first amendment by clarifying that journalists are not to be prevented from publishing information received from the legislative or executive branch unless such publication would cause immediate , direct , and irreparable harm to the United States .
Finally , the legislation would prohibit the use of secret evidence to designate an individual or organization with a United States presence to be a foreign terrorist or foreign terrorist organization .
I invite my colleagues to join my efforts to restore the U.S. Constitution by enacting the American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 .
By way of summary , the bill would :
repeal the Military Commissions Act of 2006
prohibit the admittance of evidence obtained under torture or coercion in both civilian courts and military tribunals
prohibit acquisition of intelligence that contravenes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
grant standing to Congress “ to file a declaratory judgment action in an appropriate Federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of a presidential signing statement that declares the President ’s intent to disregard provisions of a bill he has signed into law because he believes they are unconstitutional . ”
prohibit all officers and agents of the United States from engaging in kidnapping , imprisonment , and torture abroad based solely on the president ’s judgment that the person is an enemy combatant
protect journalists ’ rights to publish information acquired from the executive branch , with the only exception being when there is a “ direct , immediate , and irreparable harm to the national security of the United States . ”
prohibit the use of secret evidence to designate a foreign individual or organization as a terrorist or terrorist organization .
The full text of the bill can be found here , and is well worth taking a look at .
One recurring theme in nature is that anything which creates a waste product tends to also create an ecological niche for something which uses that product .
This has also occurred in technology .
It is relatively common for waste products which contain energy to find uses , but we may be about to see something a little different and more radical .
For the past century , millions of tons of a particular waste product have been piling up all over the earth .
This waste product contains no useful energy or rare elements , so its potential has taken longer to be widely recognized .
It might just become something far more important to the future : a cheap and abundant energy - maker .
Languishing in labs and landfills
One of the most consistent elements of technological advancement is the gap between discovery and widespread commercialization .
The first oil well in the USA was Drake 's , in 1859 ; it took 54 years before the Model T reached mass production , and even longer before the internal combustion engine reached half of US households .
The mechanism of nuclear fission was pieced together between 1934 and 1939 , the first human - engineered fission chain reaction was in 1942 , and Oyster Creek , the first nuclear plant to be ordered commercially , went on - line in 1960 ( 26 years ) ; today , nuclear still accounts for only about 20 % of US electric generation .
Nuclear fusion was first initiated by humans in 1952 ( the Ivy Mike test ) , but has yet to be demonstrated as a self - sustaining reaction under laboratory conditions ( 55 years and counting ) .
Some important energy sources were originally waste products .
Naptha ( gasoline ) was originally an almost unmarketable byproduct of the production of kerosene lamp oil from petroleum .
It found some uses such as cleaning fluid , but no application could use all that was being produced until the invention of the carburetor for the internal combustion engine .
Now demand for gasoline and diesel fuel is the main driver for oil production .
What was once discarded has become the industry 's raison d'etre .
Previous responses to oil price spikes depended on technology already on the market .
The US generated a substantial amount of its electricity from oil through the 1960's .
When the oil price shocks of the 1970's hit , the response was to accelerate the on - going construction of nuclear electric plants ; no new " Manhattan Project " was required , because the old one did just fine .
Today , only about 3 % of US electric generation comes from oil and oil byproducts ( including petroleum coke ) .
We are ten to twenty years late in beginning our response to peak oil .
Given the delay between invention and widespread commercialization , our productive responses from now until about 2025 - 2030 will come from inventions and resources already known but not yet widely used , languishing as they wait for us to take notice .
Photovoltaics are one of these small but growing sources of energy .
Today 's state of the art in PV
There are 4 major flavors of photovoltaic cell on the consumer market today :
Single - crystal silicon .
Polycrystalline silicon .
Amorphous silicon .
Thin film ( silicon , CdTe , and CIGS are most widely used ) .
Some elements , like gallium , are in limited supply and cannot supply a great deal of power via photovoltaics .
Others have few constraints ; silicon is the 2nd most abundant element in Earth 's crust ( 27.7 % by weight ) .
By all rights we should be able to make as many silicon PV cells as we want ; we should be able to cover the planet with them .
The reality is different and more strange .
Silicon PV production began as an offshoot of the semiconductor industry .
The chip industry started with circular wafers made into single crystals by dipping a slowly turning crystal into a molten bath of silicon and drawing it out incrementally ; the continuous turning created a rough cylinder consisting of a single crystal , which was sliced into wafers .
Single crystals create the most efficient cells , but this is a slow and expensive process .
Far from covering a planet , it remains far outside the typical household budget to completely cover even the house 's roof .
New processes are changing this .
Polycrystalline and amorphous silicon films are much cheaper than large single crystals , in both money and energy .
But until recently the PV industry has been too small to be worth its own supply of silicon , so it has survived on the surplus from the semiconductor industry .
This surplus had a way of disappearing when electronics were hot , squeezing out the PV industry .
But this may be about to change in a very big way , and the consequences may be earth - shaking .
The chemistry of a revolution
This story starts about as far away from PV as you could think of , back in mines producing phosphate rock .
Phosphates have long been in high demand as fertilizer ( phosphorus is an essential element of life ) and phosphate rock ( fluoroapatite , Ca 3 ( PO 4 ) 3 CaF 2 ) is today 's major mineral source of the P in the KNP of fertilizers .
This rock is dissolved in sulfuric acid ( H 2 SO 4 ) to release phosphoric acid , gypsum ( CaSO 4 ) and hydrogen fluoride ( HF ) .
Hydrogen fluoride is nasty stuff .
Today 's method of disposal is to combine it with silicon dioxide ( quartz sand ) to make fluorosilicic acid , and then neutralize it with sodium hydroxide ( lye ) to make sodium fluorosilicate , Na 2 SiF 6 .
This has some minor uses as a source of fluoride for drinking water , but far more is produced than can be used .
It 's been piling up for a long time .
If Fluoride Alert 's figures can be trusted , roughly a million tons of this stuff ( containing about 600,000 tons of fluorine ) is made every year .
That million tons of silicate also contains about 147,000 tons of silicon .
It 's been sitting there ever since .
That resource got noticed some time ago , during the alt - energy boom which followed the 1970 's energy crisis .
SRI International engineered a process which mixes sodium fluorosilicate with metallic sodium ( Na ) .
The fluorine has a greater affinity for sodium than silicon , so the result is sodium fluoride and elemental silicon .
SRI claims that this process is simple and cheap ( under $ 15/kg in volume ) , and easily scaled up to 1000 tons / year .
The process got shelved after energy got cheap during the mid-80's , but the world has changed again and SRI has dusted it off .
Per their presentation at last May's Clean Tech conference , the silicon can be turned into solid pellets , or cast directly into round crystals or ribbons .
Enter Evergreen Solar .
Evergreen 's " string ribbon " process produces 100 - micron ( 0.1 mm ) thick polycrystalline silicon ribbons directly from a molten silicon bath .
Here 's the new prospect for PV silicon : semi-toxic fertilizer waste and metallic sodium in , production - ready rectangular polysilicon wafers out .
Quantity matters
Making silicon is one thing .
Making enough cheap enough to seriously change our energy situation is another thing entirely ; you can burn Chanel No. 5 perfume , but you 're not going to run even one heavy truck on it all year and the pricetag will make anyone less well - heeled than Bill Gates have second thoughts .
So the important questions are ,
How much silicon is really available , How much ( area ) of wafers can it make , How much power ( peak ) could they produce , and How much will it all cost ?
How much silicon :
The million tons may not all be available .
Some of it may be contaminated , or unsuitable for whatever reason .
But since SRI claims to have tested this process , let 's assume that enough raw material is produced to make 112,000 metric tons of silicon per year .
That allows a bit over 20 % of wastage .
The specific gravity of silicon is about 2.8 , so 112,000 metric tons would be about 40,000 cubic meters of solid elemental silicon .
How much area can it make : cast into ribbons 0.1 mm ( 10 - 4 meters ) thick , it would make a staggering 400 million square meters of wafers .
This is enough to cover a square 20 kilometers ( roughly 12.5 miles ) on a side .
How much peak power could they produce : Evergreen Solar is reputed to produce cells which are about 12 % efficient .
At the standard 1000 W / m² irradiance , the 400 million square meters of panels would produce a peak 48 billion watts of power .
That 's 48 gigawatts , more than 10 % of US average electric consumption .
We could probably add that much power every year , just from the waste produced in Florida from current mining .
There are other phosphate mines , and probably a lot of raw material piled up over the years .
How much will it all cost :
This is where things get into serious guesswork .
SRI claims a cost ( after sale of byproducts ) of $ 14 - something per kilogram of raw silicon .
Let 's round up to $ 15/kg and then multiply by ten to account for the cost of casting into ribbons , doping , printing electrodes , laminating onto glass and attaching connections ( production of 400 square km per year will have some serious automation applied to it , so it should n't be all that expensive ) .
A square meter of 100 - micron cells has only a tenth of a liter of silicon , or 280 grams .
Multiply by $ 150/kg and we get a price of $ 42 / m² or about 35 cents per peak watt .
The annual pricetag for all of this ( 112 million kg / year at $ 15/ kg , times ten ) would be just $ 16.8 billion .
That 's downright cheap ; at less than $ 4.00 per square foot , it would be highly competitive with conventional roofing .
We might see a situation where non-PV surfaces become the exception .
The consequences
It took a lot of money and smarts to create this development , but it may be very cheap to crank it out like popcorn .
For the rough price of 1 year of the war in Iraq , we could make peak PV generation equal to about half of the nameplate capacity of every generator on the US grid .
Further improvements in either the thickness ( 100 microns may not be the limit ) or the efficiency ( 12 % is just where things are today ) of the cells would make watts even cheaper and more attractive .
Would we be able to absorb that much solar power ?
I 'd like to say " probably " .
Today 's just - in - time generation would make it difficult , but two developments would make it almost trivial : ice - storage cooling and battery - powered vehicles .
Ice - storage is already starting to take off , driven by the difference between peak and overnight electric rates .
The PHEV revolution is nascent , but leads inexorably to the pure EV at the limit .
These developments are a grid manager 's wet dream , allowing generation to be averaged over hours instead of seconds .
They 'll help a lot with wind , but cheap daytime PV power will drive both of these trends .
One question on everyone 's mind is how this would fare in a monetary crisis .
I think it depends whether it gets started soon enough .
If it takes too long , there wo n't be either capital or barter to get it established in such an uncertain environment .
But if it is already in motion , the picture looks very different to me .
A cheap energy producer made in a country with a fickle currency ( and a base of technology and labor which will be looking very hard for options ) becomes a very attractive item for international trade .
Everybody wants to make a profit , so part of the return trade would be the raw materials ( sodium ) and machine parts to make more .
It would make little sense to outsource the labor to countries with strong currencies , so the work would stay where the raw material now sits piled in dunes .
Some of the product would stay at home , too .
What would a rapidly - growing source of cheap energy do to an economy and currency sunk by expensive energy ?
It 's hard to see how the declining trend would fail to reverse itself .
Conclusion
To summarize the points above ,
We 've been ignoring a major supply of silicon - containing material .
This material can be made into elemental silicon very cheaply .
The silicon product is ready for direct fabrication into raw wafers for PV cells .
These PV cells may be extremely cheap : about 3 peak watts per dollar .
If we used all the annual supply of this silicon source , we could create peak capacity of about 10 % of US average electric consumption every year .
If we used the stockpiles accumulated over the last several decades , we could go a lot faster than that .
Cheap renewable energy producers would be an economic engine and could even help rescue a moribund economy and currency .
I know this is a rhetorical question , but what are we waiting for ?
Visitors to the two Bay Area Maker Faires will remember the amazing supercomputing cluster made from recycled PCs running on a veggie oil - fueled generator , and Silicon Death Valley , a fun cemetery of computer industry cast - offs .
Those were the work of the good people at the Alameda County Computer Recycling Resource Center , a fantastic Berkeley , California - based non-profit group that recycles anything that plugs into the wall .
Its director , James Burgett , is a champion of DIY culture , opening his doors to makers looking for old gear for projects , but their primary focus is " the charitable placement of computers in the hands of those who do not have access . "
As the ACCRC slogan goes , " Obsolescence is just a lack of imagination . "
Now though , the ACCRC is in trouble .
The Department of Toxic Substance Control of the California Environmental Protection Agency has issued the ACCRC a violation that could make it very hard for the group to stay in business .
And , quite frankly , that 's a damned shame .
MAKE : founder Dale Dougherty has more at the O'Reilly Radar blog .
From his post :
Let 's imagine that you set up a non-profit to recycle electronics and divert computers from going directly into landfills or otherwise being destroyed by a grinder .
You look for ways to refurbish these components and possibly recombine them into functional computers that go out to areas and institutions that have difficulty obtaining computers .
You might even collect some of the vintage electronics that comes through the door and hang on to this stuff because you think it 's cool and somebody may want it someday .
Yes , your place looks a bit like a junkyard but it's one that employs people to do something with the junk you collect .
And while you have organized these efforts as a charity , you have figured out how to break even from providing these recycling services and you do n't need donations or government support .
You do all this and then a government inspector drops in one day .
This is an inspector from the Department of Toxic Substance Control of the California Environmental Protection Agency .
You 've had inspectors before and the visits have been cordial .
Your operation is not unlike the Salvation Army or the Goodwill .
You have worked with the DTSC in the past .
You think you 're a friend of the environment because you repurpose equipment that would otherwise be waste .
You expect to pass the inspection but no .
Instead , you get written up .
Perhaps it 's because there 's a new inspector in town with something to prove .
No matter , you 've now been handed a Section 1 violation , which means they can shut you down or make it very hard for you to stay in business .
The inspector says that you do n't have a proper inventory of all the parts .
The inspector says that you have to get rid of equipment after a year , so you 'll have to clear out your museum of collectibles .
This is the letter of the law and you 're expected to follow it .
You 're given 30 days to comply .
Now , if this really was you , you might get upset .
You 'd see all the work you 've done about to be undone , unravelled .
It seems nobody cares that you 're in this mess and the government , which seems to promote and support environmental cleanup , is using narrow interpretations of its regulations to block the operations of a group engaged in precisely this kind of activity .
Ron Paul Releases Best Letter Yet
July 17 , 2007
What a day and half in northern California !
On Friday , my first appointment was at 6:00 am , and my day ended at 11:00 pm .
I did radio and tv interviews in San Francisco , followed by a meeting with the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle .
The questions were tough but fair : my favorite !
Meanwhile , more and more interview requests pour into the campaign .
There is a real hunger for our ideas , even in the mainstream media .
The message of liberty is popular !
Then I headed for Google , one of Americas great businesses .
Some of the young stars who populate that company took me on a tour of a firm that seemed like a university student union .
I saw where everyone works , eats , and exercises .
Next I did a political YouTube interview with questions submitted from the web .
I was told that never had Google , in the entire history of this series , received the sheer number of questions that it had for my interview .
People care about freedom .
Then I spent an hour answering questions from Google employees , crowded into a large room with overflow rooms overflowing too .
Next was fascinating briefing from some of the technical heads of Google Earth , Google Maps , Google Apps , and other extraordinary innovations .
Then there was a press conference for the media gathered in a company courtyard , and then a fundraising reception that a group of Google employees had organized off - site .
In the evening there was another successful fundraiser .
Saturday morning was the Silicon Valley Meetup in a park right next to Google .
A huge and enthusiastic crowd was there to hear about our ideas , and the diversity was astounding .
There were bikers in leather and hippies , young parents and grandparents , high - tech workers and business owners , and so many young Americans .
I talked about all our ideas : marching out of Iraq just as we marched in ; no more meddling in the Middle East ; bringing the troops home , from hundreds of expensive bases all over the world , so that we could have the money we need for the transition to freedom in social programs , and to abolish the personal income tax and the IRS .
They are not compatible with a free society .
In a Ron Paul administration , we would also repeal the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act , restore habeas corpus and stop the spying on Americans .
No more eavesdropping on our emails and bank accounts , our phone calls , home and businesses .
No national ID — just the bracing freedom of the Constitution .
We must have sound money , and not a giant counterfeiting machine called the Federal Reserve that causes recessions and inflation .
We must have private property rights , with no pollution or other attacks on property .

" What happened [ in Nazi Germany ] was the gradual habituation of the people , little by little , to being governed by surprise ; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret ; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand , or so dangerous that , even if the people could not understand it , it could not be released because of national security .
And their sense of identification with Hitler , their trust in him , made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it ...
" To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it ...
Each step was so small , so inconsequential , so well explained or , on occasion , ' regretted ' ... "
Milton Mayer
They Thought They were Free .
First , the Busheviks warned of the growing threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb .
But when they ran that flag up the pole , few in the media and the public were found to salute .
So now , we 're told that the Iranian government is training and sending lethal weapons to the Shiite " insurgents . "
And so , in his press conference last Thursday , George Bush warned the Iranians that " there will be consequences for people transporting , delivering ... highly sophisticated IEDs [ improvised explosive devices ] that kill Americans in Iraq . "
This is just fine with Dick Cheney who , according to McClatchy newspapers , is eager to attack Iran and is winning the struggle with the diplomats to convince Bush .
That an attack on Iran would be an unmitigated disaster seems not to trouble Bush and Cheney , who steadfastly refuse to take counsel from the " reality - based community . "
First of all , Iran is a country with twice the area and four times the population of Iraq , and with an intact and well - provided military .
Next , the Iranians reportedly have advanced missiles at the ready capable of sinking a billion - dollar aircraft carrier and bottling up the Strait of Hormuz , through which passes a fourth of the world 's supply of petroleum .
Furthermore , China , an ally of Iran , obtains a significant portion of its petroleum from Iran and will surely not sit still for this .
And China , if sufficiently provoked , can dump its dollar credits and embargo its exports to the US , which will surely bring on a depression that would make the thirties pale in comparison .
And what of the rest of the industrialized world ?
They have seen the US violate international law by launching two unprovoked wars , in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Would they tolerate a third ?
Contrary to the Bushite megalomania , " the outside world " is not helpless .
Even though the US military budget is greater than that of all the rest of the world combined , the United States can be brought to its knees without a shot being fired .
( See my The Vulnerable Giant ) .
An attack on Iran just might be the final straw .
When Bush and Cheney fed us a pack of lies to justify the attack on Iraq – the aluminum tubes , the WMDs , the Saddam / al Qaeda alliance , the African uranium -- the mainstream media , including the " newspapers of historical record , " The New York Times and The Washington Post , swallowed them whole .
And when Colin Powell presented these lies to the UN Security Counsel , the mainstream media was unanimously gullible .
The Editorial response of The Los Angeles Times was typical :
Piling fact upon fact , photo upon photo Wednesday , Secretary of State Colin L. Powell methodically demonstrated why Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains dangerous to his own people , Iraq 's neighbors and , potentially , the Western world .
And the Washington Post :
Mr. Powell left no room to argue seriously that Iraq has accepted the Security Council 's offer of a ' final opportunity ' to disarm .
And he offered a powerful new case that Saddam Hussein 's regime is cooperating with a branch of the al Qaeda organization that is trying to acquire chemical weapons and stage attacks in Europe .
So now it is starting all over again : unsubstantiated allegations against the next victim - state , as preface to the next disaster .
" Fool me once , shame on you , fool me – you can't get fooled again . " ( GWB ) .
Unfortunately , it appears that the mainstream media might be fooled again .
If so , then once again we have refused to heed Santayana 's oft - quoted warning : having failed to learn from history , it appears that we Americans are about to repeat it .
As I reflect upon the behavior of the mainstream media prior to the Iraq war , and perchance prior to the pending attack on Iran , I am reminded of William L. Shirer 's account of German public opinion and the part of the Nazi press in shaping it in August , 1939 , the month preceding the attack on Poland and the outbreak of World War II .
Is Shirer sending a warning to us today ?
You be the judge .
" In Berlin ... a foreign observer could watch the way the press , under Goebbels ' expert direction , was swindling the gullible German people .
For six years , since the Nazi " coordination " of the daily newspapers , which had meant the destruction of a free press , the citizens had been cut off from the truth of what was going on in the world ...
For Germans who could read English or French , there were occasionally a few copies of the London and Paris journals available , although not enough to reach more than a handful of persons .
( Shirer : The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , 563 - 4 ) .
In Berlin , on August 10 , 1939 , Shirer wrote in his diary :
How completely isolated a world the German people live in ...
A glance at the newspapers yesterday and today reminds you of it ...
Whereas all the rest of the world considers that the peace is about to be broken by Germany , that it is Germany that is threatening to attack Poland ... here in Germany , in the world the local newspapers create , the very reverse is maintained ...
What the Nazi papers are proclaiming is this : that it is Poland which is disturbing the peace of Europe : Poland which is threatening Germany with armed invasion .
Shirer then quotes headlines in the German press :
" Complete chaos in Poland – German families flee – Polish soldiers push to the edge of the German Border ! " ( Berliner Arbeiterzeitung , August 26 , 1939 ) " Whole of Poland in War fever !
1,500,000 men mobilized !
Uninterrupted troop transport toward the frontier ! " ( Voelkischer Beobachter , August 27 , 1939 )

Update : ABC pulls then revises story saying US could stay in Iraq up to ten more years
John Byrne
Published : Saturday June 2 , 2007 Print This Email This
ABC News pulled a story alleging that they had discovered US plans to keep troops in Iraq beyond 2009 Saturday , then replaced it later in the day with an article emphasizing a plan to begin pullout in early 2008 .
The original story , " ABC News Learns of Plans to Keep Troops in Iraq Beyond 2009 , " posted around 8 pm Friday , was gone by Saturday morning .
The link listed in Google News took users to a default page not found .
Sometime on Saturday , however , ABC replaced the story with a second revised piece , " Troop Drawdown by February 2008 ?
Two Plans Set Forth . "
Both versions contained much of the same language .
However , the piece posted Saturday seems to have changed the focus of the story from a planned pullout to a planned attempt to keep troops in the region for another five to ten years .
According to both articles , officials said 50,000 troops could remain for ' 5 to 10 years ' beyond 2009 .
The original article began , " U.S. officials tell ABC News that the troop levels in Iraq cannot be maintained at the present level , either politically or practically , with the military stretched so thin . "
The new article begins , " The current U.S. emphasis may be on the surge in Iraq , but there are plans to start drawing down U.S. forces by the beginning of 2008 , according to senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the planning . "
The original headline remains in Google News as : " ABC News Learns of Plans to Keep Troops in Iraq Beyond 2009 . "
Also of note is that the section dealing with a plan to keep troops in Iraq for up to a decade is now six paragraphs down as opposed to four , and continues onto a second page .
ABC could not immediately be reached for comment .

CAMBRIDGE - After Anna
Tang and her boyfriend broke up three weeks ago , prosecutors say , the Wellesley College junior began sending him e-mails telling him she would kill him .
Yesterday , police said , she almost succeeded .
At about 6:30 a.m. , Tang sneaked into his dorm room at MIT , climbed on top of him as he slept , and plunged a knife into his back , Assistant District Attorney Suzanne Kontz said in Cambridge District Court yesterday , where Tang was arraigned .
The man woke , turned around , and tried to fight her off , but Tang kept stabbing him .
At one point , she lost her grip on the knife and reached for another she had brought with her , Kontz said .
Tang was armed with three knives , the prosecutor said .
The 19 - year - old MIT student , who was not identified , is in serious condition at a local hospital , and Tang , who prosecutors said stabbed him seven times , was held without bail until next Tuesday , when she will return to court for a dangerousness hearing .
Tang , a slight woman who wore blue hospital scrubs in court , was charged with armed assault with intent to murder and home invasion .
A not - guilty plea was entered on her behalf .
" We believe this to be an isolated incident done with specific intent to critically harm the defenseless victim , " Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. said in a written statement yesterday .
Tang 's lawyer , John Valerio of Andover , described the suspect as a " meek , mild - mannered young lady , " originally from South Bend , Ind. , who is " in a great deal of distress . "
" She 's in a state of shock , " he said after the arraignment , adding that he would investigate the prosecution 's allegations .
" By all accounts , this is a good girl who has never had problems with the law . "
Tang has no prior criminal record , and there had been no restraining order filed against her by the victim , prosecutors said .
Tang and the MIT student broke up after dating for about eight months , Kontz said .
Late Monday night ,
Tang went to the dorm and waited the entire night before she obtained a key to the victim 's bedroom , Kontz said .
How Tang obtained the key is still under investigation , according to Leone 's office .
The victim managed to fight off Tang , who fled .
He called 911 , and minutes later police found him covered in blood .
They later found Tang in the building , a black folding buck knife in her backpack .
They also found her jacket , covered in blood .
Tang , 20 , a computer science major , most recently worked at Brigham and Women 's Hospital as a summer student through the undergraduate research program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
She had been taking courses at MIT , Valerio said .
MIT officials could not be reached last night .
Mary Ann Hill , a Wellesley spokeswoman , confirmed that Tang is a student at the college but declined to provide personal information about her .
Hill said the college had not made a decision yet on any disciplinary action against Tang .
" I think today our focus was on how to support and to help anyone who might be affected by the situation , " she said .
Mark A. Sheldon , a visiting assistant professor of computer science at Wellesley , called Tang a good student who seemed well adjusted .
" I do n't know quite what to make of it , " he said of the charges .
" She always struck me as a perfectly normal student . "
At MIT yesterday afternoon , students milled around the dorm , a large , brick building called Next House on Memorial Drive overlooking the Charles River .
The building is relatively safe , students said .
A resident must have a security card to enter the main building , and students have keys to their rooms .
Security is " pretty tight , " said Ananth Swaminathan , 17 , who was walking outside the building with his roommate , Taylor Gilbert , 18 .
Neither freshman knew the victim .
Gilbert said he did not know anything had happened until he saw a police officer and caution tape .
" This is sort of unsettling , " he said .
" You want to make sure the person hurt is going to be OK . "

This is an absolutely spectacular time to be a PC gamer .
The slew of top - notch and hotly anticipated games hitting stores shelves is practically unprecedented , including BioShock , Crysis , Quake Wars , Unreal Tournament 3 , and Valve ’s Orange Box trio of goodness .
I ca n’t remember a time quite like it .
However , this may not be the best time to own a dated graphics card .
The latest generation of high - end graphics cards brought with it pretty much twice the performance of previous high - end cards , and to add insult to injury , these GPUs added DirectX 10 - class features that today ’s games are starting to exploit .
If you have last year ’s best , such as a GeForce 7900 or Radeon X1900 , you may not be able to drink in all the eye candy of the latest games at reasonable frame rates .
And if you ’ve played the Crysis demo , you ’re probably really ready to upgrade .
I ’ve never seen a prettier low - res slide show .
Fortunately , DirectX 10 - class graphics power is getting a whole lot cheaper , starting today .
Nvidia has cooked up a new spin of its GeForce 8 GPU architecture , and the first graphics card based on this chip sets a new standard for price and performance .
Could the GeForce 8800 GT be the solution to your video card , er , Crysis ?
Let ’s have a look .
Meet the G92
In recent years , graphics processor transistor budgets have been ballooning at a rate even faster than Moore ’s Law , and that has led to some , um , exquisitely plus - sized chips .
This fall ’s new crop of GPUs looks to be something of a corrective to that trend , and the G92 is a case in point .
This chip is essentially a die shrink of the G80 graphics processor that powers incumbent GeForce 8800 graphics cards .
The G92 adds some nice new capabilities , but does n’t double up on shader power or anything quite that earth - shaking .
Here ’s an extreme close - up of the G92 , which may convince your boss / wife that you ’re reading something educational and technically edifying right about now .
We ’ve pictured it next to a U.S. quarter in order to further propagate the American hegemonic mindset .
Er , I mean , to provide some context , size - wise .
The G92 measures almost exactly 18 mm by 18 mm , or 324 mm².
TSMC manufactures the chip for Nvidia on a 65nm fab process , which somewhat miraculously manages to shoehorn roughly 754 million transistors into this space .
By way of comparison , the much larger G80  made on a 90nm process had only 681 million transistors .
AMD ’s R600 GPU packs 700 million transistors into a 420 mm² die area .
Why , you may be asking , does the G92 have so many more transistors than the G80 ?
Good question .
The answer is : a great many little additions here and there , including some we may not know about just yet .
One big change is the integration of the external display chip that acted as a helper to the G80 .
The G92 natively supports twin dual - link DVI outputs with HDCP , without the need for a separate display chip .
That ought to make G92 - based video cards cheaper and easier to make .
Another change is the inclusion of the VP2 processing engine for high - definition video decoding and playback , an innovation first introduced in the G84 GPU behind the GeForce 8600 lineup .
The VP2 engine can handle the most intensive portions of H.264 video decoding in hardware , offloading that burden from the CPU .
Both of those capabilities are pulled in from other chips , but here ’s a novel one : PCI Express 2.0 support .
PCIe 2.0 effectively doubles the bandwidth available for communication between the graphics card and the rest of the system , and the G92 is Nvidia ’s first chip to support this standard .
This may be the least - hyped graphics interface upgrade in years , in part because PCIe 1.1 offers quite a bit of bandwidth already .
Still , PCIe 2.0 is a major evolutionary step , though I doubt it chews up too many additional transistors .
So where else do the G92’s additional transistors come from ?
This is where things start to get a little hazy .
You see , the GeForce 8800 GT does n’t look to be a “ full ” implementation of G92 .
Although this chip has the same basic GeForce 8 - series architecture as its predecessors , the GeForce 8800 GT officially has 112 stream processors , or SPs .
That ’s seven “ clusters ” of 16 SPs each .
Chip designers do n’t tend to do things in odd numbers , so I ’d wager an awful lot of Nvidia stock that the G92 actually has at least eight SP clusters onboard .
Eight ’s probably the limit , though , because the G92’s SP clusters are “ fatter ” than the G80’s ; they incorporate the G84’s more robust texture addressing capacity of eight addresses per clock , up from four in the G80 .
That means the GeForce 8800 GT , with its seven SP clusters , can sample a total of 56 texels per clock well beyond the 24 of the 8800 GTS and 32 of the 8800 GTX .
We ’ll look at the implications of this change in more detail in a sec .
Another area where the GeForce 8800 GT may be sporting a bit of trimmed down G92 functionality is in the ROP partitions .
These sexy little units are responsible for turning fully processed and shaded fragments into full - blown pixels .
They also provide much of the chip ’s antialiasing grunt , and in Nvidia ’s GeForce 8 architecture , each ROP has a 64 - bit interface to video memory .
The G80 packs six ROP partitions , which is why the full - blown GeForce 8800 GTX has a 384 - bit path to memory and the sawed - off 8800 GTS ( with five ROP partitions ) has a 320 - bit memory interface .
We do n’t know how many ROP partitions the G92 has lurking inside , but the 8800 GT uses only four of them .
As a result , it has a 256 - bit memory interface , can output a maximum of 16 finished pixels per clock , and has somewhat less antialiasing grunt on a clock - for - clock basis .
How many ROPs does G92 really have ?
I dunno .
I suspect we ’ll find out before too long , though .
The 8800 GT up close
What the 8800 GT lacks in functional units , it largely makes up in clock speed .
The 8800 GT ’s official core clock speed is 600MHz , and its 112 SPs run at 1.5GHz .
The card ’s 512MB of GDDR3 memory runs at 900MHzor 1.8GHz effective , thanks to the memory ’s doubled data rate .
Here ’s a look at MSI ’s rendition of the GeForce 8800 GT .
Note the distinctive MSI decal .
This card is further differentiated in a way that really matters : it comes hot from the factory , with a 660M Hz core clock and 950MHz memory .
This sort of “ overclocking ” has become so common among Nvidia ’s board partners , it ’s pretty much expected at this point .
MSI does n’t disappoint .
I do n’t want to give too much away , since we ’ve measured noise levels on a decibel meter , but you ’ll be pleased to know that the 8800 GT ’s single - slot cooler follows in the tradition of Nvidia ’s coolers for its other GeForce 8800 cards .
The thing is whisper - quiet .
The sight of a single - slot cooler may be your first hint that this is not the sort of video card that will put an ugly dent in your credit rating .
Here ’s another hint at the 8800 GT ’s mainstream aspirations .
Nvidia rates the power consumption of the 8800 GT at 110W , which makes the single - slot cooler feasible and also means the 8800 GT needs just one auxiliary PCIe power connector , of the six - pin variety , in order to do its thing .
Another place where the 8800 GT sports only one connector is in the SLI department .
That probably means the 8800 GT wo n’t be capable of ganging up with three or four of its peers in a mega - multi-GPU config .
Two - way SLI is probably the practical limit for this card .
Here ’s the kicker , though .
8800 GT cards are slated to become available today for between $ 199 and $ 249 .
Doing the math
So that ’s a nice price , right ?
Well , like so many things in life and I sure as heck did n’t believe this in high school it all boils down to math .
If you take the 8800 GT ’s seven SP clusters and 112 SPs and throw them into the blender with a 1.5GHz shader clock , a 256 - bit memory interface , along with various herbs and spices , this is what comes out :
Peak

( GFLOPS ) GeForce 8800 GT 9.6 33.6 33.6 16.8 57.6 504 GeForce 8800 GTS 10.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 64.0 346 GeForce 8800 GTX 13.8 18.4 18.4 18.4 86.4 518 Ge
Force 8800 Ultra 14.7 19.6 19.6 19.6 103.7 576 Radeon HD 2900 XT 11.9 23.8 11.9 11.9 105.6 475
In terms of texture sampling rates , texture filtering capacity , and shader arithmetic , the 8800 GT is actually superior to the 8800 GTS .
It ’s also quicker than the Radeon HD 2900 XT in most of those categories , although our FLOPS estimate for the GeForce GPUs is potentially a little rosy another way of counting would reduce those numbers by a third , making the Radeon look relatively stronger .
Also , thanks to its higher clock speed , the 8800 GT does n’t suffer much in terms of pixel fill rate ( and corresponding AA grunt ) due to its smaller ROP count .
The 8800 GT ’s most noteworthy numbers may be its texture sampling and filtering rates .
Since its SPs can grab twice as many texels per clock as the G80’s , its texture filtering performance with standard 8 - bit integer color formats could be more than double that of the 8800 GTS .
Performance - wise in graphics , math like this is n’t quite destiny , but it ’s close .
The only place where the 8800 GT really trails the 8800 GTS or the 2900 XT is in memory bandwidth .
And , believe it or not , memory bandwidth is arguably at less of a premium these days , since games produce “ richer ” pixels that spend more time looping through shader programs and thus occupying on - chip storage like registers and caches .
Bottom line : the 8800 GT should generally be as good as or better than the 8800 GTS , for under 250 bucks .
Let ’s test that theory .
Our testing methods
As ever , we did our best to deliver clean benchmark numbers .
Tests were run at least three times , and the results were averaged .
Our test systems were configured like so :
Please note that we ’re using “ overclocked in the box ” versions of the 8800 GTS 320MB and 640MB , while we ’re testing a stock - clocked GeForce 8800 GT reference card from Nvidia .
Thanks to Corsair for providing us with memory for our testing .
Their quality , service , and support are easily superior to no -name DIMMs .
Our test systems were powered by PC Power & Cooling Silencer 750W power supply units .
The Silencer 750W was a runaway Editor ’s Choice winner in our epic 11 - way power supply roundup , so it seemed like a fitting choice for our test rigs .
Thanks to OCZ for providing these units for our use in testing .
Unless otherwise specified , image quality settings for the graphics cards were left at the control panel defaults .
Vertical refresh sync ( vsync ) was disabled for all tests .
We used the following versions of our test applications :
The tests and methods we employ are generally publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Crysis demo
The Crysis demo is still fresh from the oven , but we were able to test the 8800 GT in it .
Crytek has included a GPU benchmarking facility with the demo that consists of a fly - through of the island in which the opening level of the game is set , and we used it .
For this test , we set all of the game ’s quality options at “ high ” ( not “ very high ” ) and set the display resolution to believe it or not 1280 ×800 with 4X antialiasing .
Even at this low res , these relatively beefy graphics cards chugged along .
The game looks absolutely stunning , but obviously it ’s using a tremendous amount of GPU power in order to achieve the look .
The demo is marginally playable at these settings , but I ’d prefer to turn antialiasing off in order to get smoother frame rates on the 8800 GT .
That ’s what I did when I played through the demo , in fact .
Notice several things about our results .
Although the 8800 GT keeps up with the 8800 GTS 640 MB in terms of average frame rates , it hit lower lows of around 10 FPS , probably due to its lesser memory bandwidth or its smaller amount of total RAM onboard .
Speaking of memory , the card for which the 8800 GT is arguably a replacement , the 320 MB version of the GTS , stumbles badly here .
This is why we were lukewarm on the GTS 320 MB when it first arrived .
Lots of GPU power is n’t worth much if you do n’t have enough video memory .
GTS 320 MB owners will probably have to drop to “ medium ” quality in order to run Crysis smoothly .
Unreal Tournament 3 demo
We tested the UT3 demo by playing a deathmatch against some bots and recording frame rates during 60 - second gameplay sessions using FRAPS .
This method has the advantage of duplicating real gameplay , but it comes at the expense of precise repeatability .
We believe five sample sessions are sufficient to get reasonably consistent and trustworthy results .
In addition to average frame rates , we ’ve included the low frames rates , because those tend to reflect the user experience in performance - critical situations .
In order to diminish the effect of outliers , we ’ve reported the median of the five low frame rates we encountered .
Because the Unreal engine does n’t support multisampled antialiasing , we tested without AA .
Instead , we just cranked up the resolution to 2560 ×1600 and turned up the demo ’s quality sliders to the max .
I also disabled the demo ’s 62 FPS frame rate cap before testing .
All of these cards can play the UT3 demo reasonably well at this resolution , the 8800 GT included .
I noticed some brief slowdowns on the GTS 320 MB right as I started the game , but those seemed to clear up after a few seconds .
Team Fortess 2
For TF2 , I cranked up all of the game ’s quality options , set anisotropic filtering to 16X , and used 4X multisampled antialiasing at 2560 × 1600 resolution .
I then hopped onto a server with 24 players duking it out on the “ ctf_2 fort ” map .
I recorded a demo of me playing as a soldier , somewhat unsuccessfully , and then used the Source engine ’s timedemo function to play the demo back and report performance .
The 8800 GT leads all contenders in TF2 .
Even at 2560 ×1600 with 4X AA and 16X aniso , TF2 is perfectly playable with this card , although that did n’t help my poor soldier guy much .
BioShock
We tested this game with FRAPS , just like we did the UT3 demo .
BioShock ’s default settings in DirectX 10 are already very high quality , so we did n’t tinker with them much .
We just set the display res to 2560 ×1600 and went to town .
In this case , I was trying to take down a Big Daddy , another generally unsuccessful effort .
A low of 23 FPS for the 8800 GT puts it right on the edge of smooth playability .
The 8800 GT pretty much outclasses the Radeon HD 2900 XT here , amazingly enough .
The 2900 XT could n’t quite muster a playable frame rate at these settings , which my seat - of - the - pants impression confirmed during testing .
Lost Planet : Extreme Condition
Here ’s another DX10 game .
We ran this game in DirectX 10 mode at 1920 ×1200 with all of its quality options maxed out , plus 4X AA and 16X anisotropic filtering .
We used the game ’s built - in performance test , which tests two very different levels in the game , a snowy outdoor setting and a cave teeming with flying doodads .
Here ’s another case where the 8800 GTS 320 MB stumbles , while the 8800 GT does not .
Although the Radeon HD 2900 XT lists for $ 399 , it looks like an also - ran in most of our tests .
Power consumption
We measured total system power consumption at the wall socket using an Extech power analyzer model 380803 .
The monitor was plugged into a separate outlet , so its power draw was not part of our measurement .
The idle measurements were taken at the Windows Vista desktop with the Aero theme enabled .
The cards were tested under load running BioShock in DirectX 10 at 2560 ×1600 resolution , using the same settings we did for performance testing .
Nvidia has done a nice job with the G92’s power consumption .
Our 8800 GT - based test system draws over 20 fewer watts at idle than any of the others tested .
Under load , the story is similar .
Mash up these numbers with the performance results , and you get a very compelling power efficiency picture .
Noise levels
We measured noise levels on our test systems , sitting on an open test bench , using an Extech model 407727 digital sound level meter .
The meter was mounted on a tripod approximately 14 ″ from the test system at a height even with the top of the video card .
We used the OSHA - standard weighting and speed for these measurements .
You can think of these noise level measurements much like our system power consumption tests , because the entire systems ’ noise levels were measured , including the stock Intel cooler we used to cool the CPU .
Of course , noise levels will vary greatly in the real world along with the acoustic properties of the PC enclosure used , whether the enclosure provides adequate cooling to avoid a card ’s highest fan speeds , placement of the enclosure in the room , and a whole range of other variables .
These results should give a reasonably good picture of comparative fan noise , though .
Nvidia ’s single - slot coolers have too often been gratuitously small and noisy in the past year or two , but the 8800 GT is different .
This may be the quietest single - slot cooler we ’ve ever tested ( save for the passive ones ) , and it does n’t grow audibly louder under load .
That ’s a pleasant surprise , since the thing can get very loud during its initial spin - up at boot time .
Fortunately , it never visted that territory for us when runnning games .

Is that your definition of a good man ?
Carmela : I thought psychiatrists were n’t supposed to be judgmental .
Dr. Krakower : Many patients want to be excused for their current predicament because of events that occurred in their childhood .
That ’s what psychiatry has become in America .
Visit any shopping mall or ethnic pride parade and witness the results .
... You 'll never be able to feel good about yourself .
You 'll never be able to quell the feelings of guilt and shame that you talked about , so long as you 're his accomplice .
Carmela :
You 're wrong about the accomplice part , though .
Dr. Krakower :
You sure ?
Carmela :
All I did was make sure he 's got clean clothes in his closet and dinner on his table .
Dr. Krakower : So " enable " would be a more accurate job description for what you do than " accomplice " .
My apologies ...
Take only the children -- what 's left of them -- and go .
Carmela :
My priest said I should work with him , help him to become a better man .
Dr. Krakower : How 's that going ?
Carmela : I would have to get a lawyer , find an apartment , arrange for child support ...
Dr. Krakower :
You 're not listening .
I 'm not charging you because I wo n't take blood money .
You can't either ...
TWO months ago Heftsiba , an Israeli construction firm , went bust .
One reason for its woes was a court order last year to freeze work on a big housing project on an Israeli settlement just inside the West Bank .
The land , it turned out , had in effect been stolen from private owners in a neighbouring Palestinian village , Bilin .
Yet after the bankruptcy , the same court ruled that the apartment blocks — and their prospective buyers , who had broken in and occupied them at the news of Heftsiba 's impending collapse — could stay .
And thus it has always been .
Never mind that Israel has flouted international law by settling its citizens in occupied foreign territory ; what is remarkable is how consistently the settlers have thwarted Israel 's own laws , in pursuit of what to them are biblical lands inhabited by Palestinian interlopers .
The Bilin case was just a variation on a tried and tested method : seize land illegally , establish hard - to - reverse “ facts on the ground ” and then legalise the claim retroactively through the courts or the government .
The result is a West Bank so riddled with settlement that it is hard to see how enough can be removed for a viable Palestinian state to emerge .
In this thorough and eye - opening book , Idith Zertal , a historian , and Akiva Eldar , a journalist , explain how a few tens of thousands of people bent the state to their purpose .
Settlements were not on the official agenda after Israel 's surprise capture of the Palestinian territories in 1967 .
But pressure from ardent young religious Zionists found a secular echo among military men , who came to see security benefits to having Israelis live in the West Bank .
Such confluences of interests were what drove the settlements ' spread .
Only rarely , when a new outpost was too blatantly illegal and too plainly of no strategic use , did the apparatus of the state contrive to force a retreat .
With politicians constantly interfering on behalf of the settlers , the army 's effectiveness against law - breakers soon bled away .
Over the years , official attitudes evolved .
The Labour governments that ruled until 1977 turned a blind eye to expropriations of land for “ military ” use that then became civilian .
The more right - wing coalitions that followed embraced settlements openly , devising ingenious legal veneers .
Since the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords , Israel has avoided building “ new ” settlements via administrative tricks that expanded existing ones , though it has also ignored innumerable violations .
Whatever the government in power , the settlers ' genius was in exploiting its weaknesses and co-opting sympathetic officials .
The authors ' anger falls mainly on the religious pioneers and their secular allies , especially Ariel Sharon , whose removal of settlements from Gaza in 2005 was , they argue , no more than a way to consolidate the hold on the West Bank .
But nobody escapes blame .
Shimon Peres , Israel 's elder statesman , emerges as one of the settlers ' most useful early helpmates .
Yasser Arafat , the Palestinians ' former leader , and Mahmoud Abbas , their current president , were still exiles in Tunis when they negotiated the first Oslo accord and had no idea how settlements had permeated the West Bank .
To the horror of their local advisers , they agreed to no more than a token constraint on settlement growth .
Yitzhak Rabin , the prime minister who signed Oslo and whom the authors plainly admire for hating settlers almost as much as they do , gets a lashing for presiding during one of their fastest rates of growth and being in a “ state of denial ” about their influence .
That denial had much to do with an inability to grasp how different religious Zionism , with its messianic belief that Israel 's creation hastened Redemption , was to Rabin 's traditional , secular - nationalist sort .
For the true believers , constant war with the Arabs was essential to avoid “ assimilation [ of Jews ] into the Semitic expanse ” .
The costs of this ideology to Israel , let alone the Palestinians , have been enormous .
Rabin 's assassin in 1995 was inspired by a settler , Baruch Goldstein , who killed 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque in 1994 .
Goldstein 's rampage , according to a former adviser to the head of Israel 's security service , also prompted Hamas to exacerbate the tactic of suicide - bombings against Israeli civilians .
And yet , the authors conclude , traditional Zionism must take a share in the blame .
It was the aggressively secular early state of Israel that repressed religious Zionism in the first place , setting the stage for its violent revival , and for the dichotomy in Israel 's nature that it has yet to resolve .
Since the state of Arizona currently has no net metering standards , individual utilities are free to develop their own .
This is a disastrous situation , and there is no better example than what Arizona Public Service , the state ’s largest utility , is trying to do .
In their latest rate case , APS filed for a net metering tariff that would be devastating to solar in their service territory .
To begin with , APS ’s net metering proposal would cap installations at 10 kW .
Fine for the residential market , but that pretty much eliminates commercial systems .
APS claimed that they are deprived of “ lost revenues ” for which it deserves compensation if customers install solar systems .
Excuse me , but that statement made me break out the giant “ BULLSH * T ” button .
Hey , ASP , if a customer decides to invest in a system which draws less energy from the grid , you assholes are not entitled to compensation from them for “ lost revenues ” .
Such a proposition is preposterous and flat - out dumb .
If this is n’t enough , ASP wanted to be paid about 6.7 cents for every kWh a customer - sited solar system generates .
Yes , you read that right .
If you buy electricity from them , it ’d cost you 11 cents a kWh .
If you install solar and do n’t buy electricity from them , you still owe them 6.7 cents per kWh !
Are you kidding me ?!?
The good people at Vote Solar got some colleagues together , hired a lawyer , and successfully fought APS ’s proposal .
APS will offer net metering up to 100 kW for the time being .
However , the fight continues .
For some perspective , the Germans have this net - metering business all figured out .
If you go solar there , the utility company is required to pay YOU three times the going rate for the electricity you produce .
That ’s why , even though it ’s cloudy as all get out in Germany , there is more solar per capita installed than anywhere else in the planet .
Meanwhile , customers that WANT to go solar in sunny Arizona have to deal with this kind of crap .
If this is n’t enough , there are no interconnection standards in Arizona .
This is also a significant hindrance on solar development .
Why ??
According to a report by votesolar.org :
“ Tucson Electric Power , one of the state ’s larger utilities , recently decided that commercial grid - connected solar systems in its service territory must have a data monitoring system capable of collecting “ plane of array solar insolation in watts / M2 , ambient temperature in degrees F. , wind speed in miles / hour and actual AC power output in watts … on an average time interval not to exceed five ( 5 ) minutes for each data point throughout the day . ”
Why is measuring wind speed relevant ?
It ’s not — but purchasing and installing this system will increase costs by up to $ 8,000 . ”
Blech !

EDIT : 11/4/07
I awoke to find a reasonable amount of chatter on this story at reddit.com .
I ’d urge many of you to read through the comments there as some are quite informative .
One of the users submitted this link to an AZCentral story urging me to read up on the tariffs APS is proposing and all the incentives APS has already to spur on solar development .
Indeed , since utilities in Arizona are required to have 15 % of their power portfolio come from renewables in 15 years , they have provided some incentives to get more solar on roofs .
They ’ve also proposed a tariff similar to that in Germany to catalyze more solar installed .
However , there are no standards for the rates they pay solar installers for the power they are generating once those systems are installed .
This is the main problem .
Installation incentives are there , however the utility seeks to maximize their revenues by proposing to bill solar power producers for electricity they are producing .
This is rapacious and continues to be Bullsh*t .

The other day , I stopped using Firefox for gmail .
Part of the reason is that Firefox under MacOS feels slightly wrong and renders funny because it is still using older Carbon interfaces .
But , the real reason I stopped was because the text widgets do n't have Emacs key bindings the way normal MacOS text widgets do .
What I find sad about this is not that Firefox is lacking this feature , but that my nervous system is so crippled that even 20 years down the line , I can't purge the need for this stupid text editing user interface from the tips of my fingers .
My conclusion is that Emacs makes you retarded .
Of course , it 's not really Emacs that is at fault here .
The real problem has to do with the ability of the human nervous system to quickly adapt to one idiosyncratic way of working ( ctrl - a for go to beginnging of line ?
Who thought that made sense ) and then not be able to flush out the adaptation when it has clearly become an impediment to further productivity .
During all these years , I would have gladly given up the Emacs in favor of any number of other tools , but my psyche used various techniques to make this impossible .
A False Sense of Superiority
This kept me going for at least a good decade .
The notion that I would use something else if only there were something better .
Many better things were always staring me in the face , but I was always able to rationalize them away .
" Well , that tool might have decent font coloring , but it wo n't do adaptive USENET news thread classification . "
You know how it goes .
Premature Abandonment
This is the syndrome that causes you to give up on every new tool after five minutes because you cannot immediately adapt to it .
You forget that it probably took months of acclimation to get really good with the original tool .
But , no matter .
You try to use a new , and probably better , tool for a few minutes and the fifth time ctrl - a does not do the right thing , you throw it out the window .
One Last Legacy
I still use Emacs day to day , but not for coding .
I actually use it to connect to an archaic chat system that many of my online " friends " also use .
My attachment to this legacy application is almost as sad as my attachment to ctrl -a .
But what can you do .
Ultimately , I think in a few more years , I 'll have managed to completely wean my subconcious from the need to hit ctrl - a all the time .
Happily , or maybe not so happily , MacOS has managed to slow this process down somewhat because the Cocoa frameworks date back to NeXTStep , which was devleoped by a bunch of recovering Emacs addicts , and so all of the text editing widgets ( and some modern applications , like Keynote and Pages ) provide all of the core key bindings , including the beloved ctrl -a .
The irony that brings the Mac user interface and Emacs together is pretty thick .
So , yes , I will remain mentally crippled , but at least I 'll be able to edit text on my Mac .
San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders
Gay Marriage Press Conference Transcript
September 19 , 2007
Mayor Sanders :
( Sanders with lesbian City Councilmember Toni Atkins )
Those folks include my daughter Lisa
( Sanders in this year 's gay pride parade )
" With me this afternoon is my wife , Rana .
" I am here this afternoon to announce that I will sign the resolution that the City Council passed yesterday directing the city attorney to file a brief in support of gay marriage [ with the California Supreme Court ] .
" My plan , that has been reported publicly , was to veto the resolution , so I feel like I owe all San Diegans right now an explanation for this change of heart .
" During the campaign two years ago , I announced that I did not support gay marriage and instead supported civil unions and domestic partnerships .
" I have personally wrestled with that position ever since .
My opinions on this issue have evolved significantly -- as I think the opinions of millions of Americans from all walks of life have .
"
In order to be consistent with the position I took during the mayoral election , I intended to veto the council resolution .
As late as yesterday afternoon , that was my position .
" The arrival of the resolution -- to sign or veto -- in my office late last night forced me to reflect and search my soul for the right thing to do .
" I have decided to lead with my heart , which is probably obvious at the moment -- to do what I think is right , and to take a stand on behalf of equality and social justice .
The right thing for me to do is sign this resolution .
" For three decades , I have worked to bring enlightenment , justice and equality to all parts of our community .
" As I reflected on the choices I had before me last night , I just could not bring myself to tell an entire group of people in our community they were less important , less worthy or less deserving of the rights and responsibilities of marriage -- than anyone else -- simply because of their sexual orientation .
" A decision to veto this resolution would have been inconsistent with the values I have embraced over the past 30 years .
" I do believe that times have changed .
And with changing time , and new life experiences , come different opinions .
I think that 's natural , and it 's certainly true in my case .
" Two years ago , I believed that civil unions were a fair alternative .
Those beliefs , in my case , have changed .
" The concept of a ' separate but equal ' institution is not something I can support .
" I acknowledge that not all members of our community will agree or perhaps even understand my decision today .
" All I can offer them is that I am trying to do what I believe is right .
" I have close family members and friends who are a member of the gay and lesbian community . , as well as members of my personal staff .
" I want for them the same thing that we all want for our loved ones -- for each of them to find a mate whom they love deeply and who loves them back ; someone with whom they can grow old together and share life 's experiences .
" And I want their relationships to be protected equally under the law .
In the end , I could n't look any of them in the face and tell them that their relationship -- their very lives -- were any less meaningful than the marriage I share with my wife Rana .
Thank you . "
AG nominee wo n't say if waterboarding is torture

Attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey left open the possibility that a controversial technique alleged to be used by CIA interrogators could be considered Constitutional , when he refused to say one way or another whether water boarding is torture .
During the second day of his Senate confirmation hearings , Mukasey was asked if he believed water boarding " was Constitutional . "
" If water boarding is torture , torture is not constitutional , " Mukasey said , claiming that he was not familiar with the specifics of the process .
Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse ( D - RI ) called that answer a " massive hedge , " and he explained the specifics of the practice -- strapping down a detainee and pouring water over his face to simulate drowning .
He asked if that practice would be considered constitutional .
" If it amounts to torture it is not constitutional , " is all Mukasey would say .
Whitehouse scolded Mukasey , saying he was " very disappointed " in his " very semantic answer . "
" Sorry , " Mukasey mumbled .
The former federal prosecutor and district court judge is expected to be easily confirmed , but he has seemed reticent to outline specifics on controversial administration programs such as detainee treatment , the prison at Guantanamo Bay and warrantless wiretapping .
Questioned earlier Thursday by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Mukasey outlined a view of presidential authority that went beyond existing laws .
Responding to a question about warrantless wiretapping , Mukasey said his understanding was that the president 's program derived from his wartiime powers to protect the country .
" I see a loophole big enough to drive a truck through , " Leahy said , asking why Bush could n't use that same authority to justify torture .
( Mukasey claimed the Constitution is more stringent in outlawing torture than it is in preventing searches of Americans . )

Obama : Clinton is trying to sound or vote like a Republican Adam Doster

This A fight may be brewing between two of America 's most famous Senators .
In a long interview with the New York Times on Friday , Senator Barack Obama finally took some shots at Presidential front - runner Hillary Clinton , signaling a change of course in whats been a low - key campaign thus far .
Obama was especially accusatory on the question of national security , claiming that Clinton of trying to sound or vote like a Republican and was straddling between the Giuliani , Romney side of the foreign policy equation and the Barack Obama side of the equation .
He also noted that Clinton had not been fully truthful with voters about what her policies would be as president , especially on issues like Social Security , Iraq and Iran .
 I dont think people know what her agenda exactly is ,  Obama said .
As evidenced by these attacks , Obama said he would begin challenging Clinton more vigorously , which is great news for many Obama supporters that feel his lack of boldness has allowed Clinton to command the presidential race thus far .
In fact , The Times suggests the morale of Obama volunteers has dropped considerably in recent months , and they are looking for a change in strategy .
 The only way that hes going to be able to be clear with the American people ,  said Alan D. Solomont , a former contributor to both Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton who is now raising money for Mr. Obama in Boston , is to draw a distinction between his candidacy and his ideas about change and those of other candidates .
It s fair to say that he is beginning to do that , but he hasnt done enough yet . 
On Tuesday night , the Democrats will meet for a nationally televised debate in Philadelphia , and pundits are excited to see how far Obama is willing to go .

Former White House Deputy Counsel leads drive to aid Gonzales defray legal expenses RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Justice Department inquiry to be completed in several months , report says
The man who took the fall for the firing of nine US attorneys is stocking up to fund attorneys of his own now that he can no longer rely on the taxpayers ' largesse to enforce the laws of the land .
The man leading the drive ?
Ford Motor Company general counsel David G. Leitch , who wrote in an email last month to supporters that Gonzales is " innocent of any wrongdoing " but can't afford to pay for his defense , according to the Washington Post 's Dan Eggen .
As his biography notes , " Immediately prior to joining Ford , Leitch served in the White House as Deputy Counsel to President George W. Bush .
In that capacity , he advised the President and his staff on a variety of legal issues , including issues involving the war on terror , judicial nominations , legislative proposals and ethics . "
Supporters of the erstwhile Attorney General have created a trust fund to help defray his legal expenses , which are steadily mounting .
Gonzales faces a Justice Department investigation into whether he committed perjury or improperly prepped a congressional witness .
A contribution form asks for donations to the Alberto R. Gonzales Legal Expense Trust , suggesting contributions from $ 500 to $ 5,000 .
According to Eggen 's sources , the probe into Gonzales ' misdoings is set to be completed in the next few months .
" The inspector general is looking at whether Gonzales misled Congress in sworn testimony and improperly sought to influence testimony of an aide , Monica M. Goodling , about last year 's firings of nine U.S. attorneys . "
" In the hyper - politicized atmosphere that has descended on Washington , an innocent man cannot simply trust that the truth will out , " Ford 's general counsel wrote in his appeal .
" He must engage highly competent legal counsel to represent him .
That costs money , money that Al Gonzales does n't have . "
Eggen adds : " The establishment of a legal defense fund for the nation 's former chief law enforcement officer underscores the potential peril confronting Gonzales , who is one of a handful of attorneys general to face potential criminal charges for actions taken in office . "
Ford 's general counsel also wrote that Gonzales attorney George J. Terwilliger III " has substantially reduced his fees to represent Al Gonzales , but the costs will likely be high nonetheless . "
WASHINGTON , Nov. 13 — President Bush on Tuesday vetoed a major spending measure that would have funded education , health care and job training programs , saying it contained money for too many of the special projects known as earmarks .
But he signed a $ 459 billion bill to increase the Pentagon ’s nonwar funding .
The veto , on a measure providing $ 150.7 billion in discretionary spending for the Departments of Education , Labor , and Health and Human Services , was announced as Bush was en route to Indiana to deliver an economics speech in which chastised Congress for “ wasteful spending ” and describe it as acting “ like a teenager with a new credit card . ”
The president ’s action guaranteed a new round of wrangling with the Democrats who control Congress over war costs and clashing domestic spending priorities .
The president ’s criticisms of Congressional spending priorities have grown steadily more pointed .
But in her immediate response to the veto , the Democratic speaker of the House , Representative Nancy Pelosi , adopted a restrained tone , saying that compromise was possible but that the president needed to help if the two sides were to find “ common ground . ”
THE sister of a veteran Texas prosecutor who blew his brains out as he was about to be busted in an underage - sex sting set up by “ Dateline ” is slapping NBC with a $ 100 million suit .
Louis “ Bill ” Conradt grabbed a gun and shot himself as he spotted cops , reporter Chris Hansen and a camera crew from the popular “ To Catch a Predator ” segment outside his home on Nov. 5 , 2006 , according to a notice of claim sent to NBC yesterday .
The suit will be filed Monday in Manhattan Federal Court on behalf of his estate , said Patricia Conradt ’s lawyer , Bruce Baron .
“ NBC was responsible for his death .
They conducted their sting operation and intentionally and with negligence sensationalized the situation , ” Baron said .
“ It brought it to the point that he died of a self inflicted gun shot wound . ”
The 56 - year - old prosecutor , a highly praised 20 - year - law enforcement veteran , allegedly went online to solicit sex from a 13 - year - old boy .
Hansen and a “ Dateline ” crew tagged along with cops to the prosecutor ’s home to capture the arrest .
NBC said if a suit is filed , “ we will defend ourselves vigorously , as we believe the claims are completely without merit . ”
Profit From The Weak U.S. Dollar With Currency Plays And Other Strategies
A couple of days ago , I spoke of how the devalued dollar has caused American merchandise to become priced much more cheaply compared to similar stuff sold in other countries .
This led to my sour graping whenever friends and family from abroad came by to visit in order to indulge in shopping marathons .
Um yeah , it ’s sure nice to be the spectator while everyone is cooing over their amassed loot , all at half price courtesy of the flailing dollar .
The tourists buy up a storm while I watch — how exciting is that ?
So I ’ve blamed the faltering greenback for this situation .
When I did so , however , discerning readers pointed out that I was complaining about something that may not necessarily be a bad thing .
Well , they were right — it ’s not as black and white as it seems .
So the basic question arises : is a weak dollar a good or bad thing ?
In my mind , it depends on your perspective .
As an American consumer , you may not be all too happy ( as I am ) about this state of affairs , but if you ’re a multi-national conglomerate , you ’d be jumping up and down with glee .
Here ’s a quick rundown of the Pros and Cons of the weak vs strong dollar :
Strong Dollar Weak Dollar Pros Consumer sees lower prices on foreign products / services .
Lower prices on foreign products / services help keep inflation low .
US consumers benefit when they travel to foreign countries .
US investors can purchase foreign stocks , bonds , real estate at “ lower ” prices .
US companies find it easier to sell goods in foreign markets .
US companies find less competitive pressure to keep prices low .
More foreign tourists can afford to visit the US .
Foreign investors can purchase US stocks , bonds , real estate at “ lower ” prices .
Cons US companies find it harder to compete in foreign markets .
U.S. firms must compete with lower priced foreign goods .
Foreign tourists find it more expensive to visit US
More difficult for foreign investors to provide capital to U.S. in times of heavy U.S. borrowing .
Consumers face higher prices on foreign products / services .
Higher prices on foreign products contribute to higher cost - of - living .
U.S. consumers find traveling abroad more costly .
Tougher for U.S. companies and investors to expand into foreign markets .
My point of view has probably been a little myopic , but I was merely sharing my views as a consumer who was feeling the pinch of the sliding dollar .
Not to mention that there are potential risks that build up as our currency drops even further : a continuously falling dollar can trigger inflation and greater global and trade imbalances that may lead to a recession .
But we ’re not there yet so I wo n’t be chicken little just yet .
I also received a few questions about whether we should even care about this , or whether there ’s anything we can do to capitalize on these currency conditions .
Here is one such question by reader JEM , who like many , are becoming enticed by the recent strong returns of foreign funds aided in part by the weak dollar :
I have a friend who is trying to get us to sell our US stock and only invest in international stocks and mutual funds .
What are your thoughts on this ?
To answer this question , I ’m going to look into the various ways we can work things out to our advantage as both investors and consumers , since changes in our economic condition often supply us with opportunities that we can capitalize on if we ’re keen enough to catch on to them .
I ’m actually taking up these suggestions as a response to our current economic climate .
How To Ride The Weak Dollar
Limit international travels or delay them to a more opportune time .
Our kids are quite young hence they ’re at the age when traveling with them can be most “ challenging ” , especially when you ’re dealing with close quarters in crowded planes .
It ’s therefore a good excuse to resort to day trips and staying within the confines of the nation for now so we do n’t feel the effects of foreign exchange rates .
We ’ll continue to limit our spending to domestic transactions , at least , for the near term .
Invite overseas family and friends over more often .
We have lots of friends and family scattered all over the world who we ’d like to keep up with .
For now , we ’ve asked people to come by and visit as it ’s become very affordable for them to do so ( while it ’s the opposite for us of course ) .
Despite my grumpiness over shopping , we do enjoy keeping tabs with those closest to us and so we have pretty much an open door policy .
Do some research before traveling .
If there ’s no keeping you on domestic shores , then there are still good travel deals that abound if you know where to look for them .
With some digging around , you may be able to cut down on your travel expenses .
Check out our list of best travel sites for great deals .
Raise international holdings and stay in equities .
During the last several years , my international funds have been doing quite well , no doubt aided by the falling dollar .
Of course , we do n’t know how long this trend will last but it ’s good to be aware of the opportunities that present themselves when economic tides shift .
Along these lines , here ’s my response to the reader question I presented earlier that asked whether one should dump U.S. stocks in favor of foreign funds : my solid answer is NO .
If you do this , you ’re simply timing the market .
The optimal investment strategy is to keep a diversified investment portfolio with representation from various asset classes such as domestic and international equities , bonds and cash .
Dropping an asset class from your mix will potentially raise your risk and could cause market - timing blunders .
I would n’t do it as you can easily get whipsawed by the market , say if U.S. stocks stage a strong comeback while overseas equities stall .
If you really want to play the foreign angle , you can simply increase your foreign allocation by some percentage you ’re comfortable with .
This is what I plan to do myself .
As I ’ve said before , I intend to raise our foreign holdings from 10 % to 20 % .
( Note that this does not constitute financial advice as I ’m no adviser , just a regular jane investor . )
Buy into other currencies .
I ’ve become tempted to diversify into foreign currency .
This diversification strategy has been in the back of our minds for a while now and we ’ve been working to execute this plan .
What ’s great is that there ’s a straightforward way to go ahead and do this , care of EverBank .
This sounds like an intriguing idea which more people should look into .
Tip : Our Our EverBank review covers a lot of the details of diversifying into foreign currencies via certificates of deposit and safer accounts .
Keep some assets in foreign lands .
This may not apply to everyone but it particularly applies to people like us who have family abroad .
If you have any family assets that need to be reunited with you one day , then you automatically have a dollar hedge .
You can also extend this idea to “ off - shore ” type banking schemes , but I ’m not so sure how “ cool ” an idea that really is since I ’m not really too familiar with the concept .
I only know that such schemes are associated with rich people who want to hide money somewhere else .
Buy American and limit buying of imported goods .
If you can avoid buying imported goods , then you wo n’t be paying for that currency exchange premium .
So until things get cheaper , I may watch what I ’m buying … except for that delightful Swiss chocolate .
-ooOoo -
Again , this may not have as much impact on your everyday living unless you ’re an avid globe - trotter or someone fond of foreign imports .
But if you ’re after making that dollar ( what ’s left of it ) stretch further , then hopefully , these tips could help .

BOSTON , MA November 24 2007 :
You could almost run that old Lone Ranger theme - the famous William Tell Overture - as the soundtrack to the local news stories I watched here in Boston on Thanksgiving day featuring perky local news " correspondents " stirring a buying frenzy with upbeat reports on manic consumers racing into malls for " midnight madness " sales .
It was , in the words of Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping , a " shopopocalyse . "
His crusade against out of control consumption is pictured in the new film " What Would Jesus Buy ? , " opening at some theaters in LA and San Francisco .
This highly relevant film was not on TV , of course , because our media is deeply complicit in promoting / encouraging mindless consumerism through newspapers , commercials and on newscasts .
This is a well - practiced formula mirroring TV 's promotion of the war in Iraq , as the line between selling and telling disappears .
Media outlets are amply rewarded with endless ad revenues hyping all the discounted goodies you can get with the Boston Globe packing no less than 43 advertising / sales supplements ( down from 47 a year ago ) into a paper that had wall to wall Macy ads , including some offering $ 10 coupons to bribe you into the stores .
Marketing is what the media does best .
The only negative note was the fear among some that toys might be unsafe because of lead or other dangers .
Some 26 million toys have been recalled this year , a sign that the regulators were asleep on this front in the economic wars as they were on Wall Street .
The real danger may not be lead in the toys but another type of lead in our heads that leads to denial on the part of millions that we can go on with addictive well - cultivated crazed consumption habits .
Bill Bowles writes about this on his CNI Blog :
" The problem is that many of us have been force - fed with a diet of nothing but passive , uncritical consumptionism , indeed , we are addicted to the stuff ; breaking such powerful habits is what this is all about ; it 's about getting people to think critically again about what 's going on and why and what , if anything , we can do about it . "
Bowles also ties this cultural affliction , sometimes known as affluenza , back to our dependence on a media system that wo n't really allow other voices to be heard .
" It would be an understatement to say that the world has changed almost beyond recognition in the past two decades , we appear to have re-entered the age of the dinosaur , gigantic creatures stomping across the planet , ' guided ' by pea-sized brains .
So ... we have increasing concentrations of powerful media -- media that is actually an entire raft of processes critical to the survival of capitalism -- either in the hands of vast corporations or the state ( which in any case is now openly in bed with the big corporations ) ... "
Were most media outlets connecting any dots between the annual shopathon and the " severe recession " that many economists are forecasting ?
Were there any warnings to the public to save their rapidly inflating money for the expected hard times ?
Was there any explanation of how prices have sharply risen and , thus , the discounts - - often " teaser " rates just like the ones offered sub - prime loan victims — are really not all they are cracked up to be ?
No way .
What about the larger trends ?
Yes there has been reporting on how bad things are -- but this reality was largely NOT depicted in the ' shop now , be happy ' coverage .
The Globe did run a story in the B Section where the business news is buried .
At the very end of the AP report ( not theirs ) you read this :
" Last year , retailers had a good start during the Thanksgiving weekend , but many stores struggled in December and a shopping surge just before and after Christmas was n’t enough to make up for lost sales .
This year , analysts expect sales gains to be the weakest in five years .
Washington - based National Retail Federation predicted that total holiday sales will be up 4 percent for the combined November and December period , the slowest growth since a 1.3 percent rise in 2002 .
Holiday sales rose 4.6 percent in 2006 and growth has averaged 4.8 percent over the last decade . "
Where were the stories alerting us to this coming calamity on the front pages ?
They were n't there .
It is not in their interest to carry them , clearly a big No No .
It gets worse .
MTV pointedly rejected an ad from the Cultural Jammers Network urging a " Buy Nothing Day . "
The network complained , " The station that markets itself as the voice of hip youth has censored the burping pig . "
But why ?
Their advertising standards representative , Elisa Billis , said that “ the spot goes further than we are willing to accept on our channels . ”
Too radical for MTV which routinely carries military recruiting ads with no qualms .
The Globe did carry a cartoon lampooning local sports mania in a town with winning teams .
In its last panel , set in a mortgage office , a fan is being told he will be able to pay off his Red Sox / Celtics / Patriots tickets in just a few decades .
Many of the shoppers this season are charging it even though all the credit card companies have jacked up rates driving the real cost of shopping higher , and even though credit balances are at an all time high .
The companies are just waiting for them .
The day after Christmas , VISA will report on how much business was done .
In years past , they called it " disappointing . "
And then in January , the returns will start as the bills come due .
Experts -- including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers -- are warning that the credit card system may be the next to fall .
Writes economist Robert Samuelson :
" The spectre of the subprime debacle is that it 's just a start .
Huge amounts of auto loans , credit - card debt , commercial mortgages and equipment leases have also been securitised .
If similar problems emerged , it would shake confidence in the securitisation model and , by magnifying investors ' losses , threaten to turn the credit crunch from a slogan into a reality .
A broader crisis , though a long shot , ca n't be excluded . "
Thanksgiving this year fell on the anniversary of the John F. Kennedy assassination .
The New York Times predictably marked the event with one more op - ed article - in a long line — assuring us that there was no conspiracy .
( Even as 80 % of the public continues to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone . )
While they discredit suggestions of a past conspiracy , they seem to be ignoring a current one .
That involves the steady decline of our economy thanks to illegal practices through white - collar predatory lenders backed by our biggest banks and hedge funds , as well as the inability of regulators to regulate and a complicit media to blow the whistle , which caused a multi-billion dollar economic crime that is still in progress .
It has already defrauded millions of investors and homeowners , and the squeeze will only get worse .

News agency Reuters has been forced to admit that footage it released last week purportedly showing Russian submersibles on the seabed of the North Pole actually came from the movie Titanic .
The images were reproduced around the world - including by the Guardian and Guardian Unlimited - alongside the story of Russia planting its flag below the North Pole on Thursday last week .
But it has now emerged that the footage actually showed two Finnish - made Mir submersibles that were employed on location filming at the scene of the wreck of the RMS Titanic ship in the north Atlantic some 10 years ago .
This footage was used in sequences in James Cameron 's 1997 blockbuster about the 1912 disaster .
The mistake was only revealed after a 13 - year - old Finnish schoolboy contacted a local newspaper to tell them the images looked identical to those used in the movie .
Reuters has admitted that it took the images from Russian state television channel RTR and wrongly captioned them as file footage originating from the Arctic .
RTR had also used the footage to illustrate stories about the North Pole expedition , but it is thought as library footage , and it never claimed it was actually of the flag - planting .
The pictures were first broadcast by RTR when the Russians were still several hours away from the North Pole .
Reuters distributed a package of clips that included the scenes from Titanic , alongside computer animations and footage of ships on the surface at the North Pole .
In its piece on the subject , two of the four Reuters pictures were from the Titanic filming .
Reuters has now apologised for the error and has made changes to its video material on the expedition , with captions denoting the various origins of the file footage used .
In a statement , Reuters said : " On August 2 , 2007 in a TV story about two Russian submersibles planting a flag on the seabed under the North Pole , we used file shots of MIR submersibles as part of this story .
" Reuters mistakenly identified this file footage as originating from the Arctic , and not the North Atlantic where the footage was shot .
" This footage was taken during the search for the Titanic and copyright is held by Russian State broadcaster RTR .
" This location error was corrected as soon as it was brought to our attention .
A still image of the submersibles was also taken from the footage and put out on the Reuters photo wire .
The caption has been corrected . "
The incident is doubly embarrassing for the agency since it follows a case in August last year in which it published an image by a freelancer of Israeli bombings in Lebanon that had been dramatised using photo manipulation , with the addition of smoke rising from allegedly burning buildings .
After that gaffe , Reuters promised to tighten up its controls on material being put out in its name .

After informing the governments involved of their security failings and receiving no response , Egerstad published 100 of the email accounts , including login details and passwords , on his website for anyone curious enough to have a look .
The site , derangedsecurity.com , has since been taken offline .
The hack required little more than tools freely available on the internet , and Egerstad maintains he broke no laws .
In fact , he is confident the email accounts he gained access to were already compromised by other hackers , so his efforts in fact prevented them from continuing their spying .
Egerstad was soon back to his regular routine but , on Monday morning , his apartment , located 650 kilometres from Stockholm , was raided by four agents from Swedish National Crime ( which Egerstad calls " our FBI " ) and Swedish Security Police ( " our CIA " ) .
About 9 am Egerstad walked downstairs to move his car when he was accosted by the officers in a scene " taken out of a bad movie " , he said in an email interview .
" I got a couple of police IDs in my face while told that they are taking me in for questioning , " he said .
But not before the agents , who had staked out his house in undercover blue and grey Saabs ( " something that screams cop to every person in Sweden from miles away " ) , searched his apartment and confiscated computers , CDs and portable hard drives .
" They broke my wardrobe , short cutted my electricity , pulled out my speakers , phone and other cables having nothing to do with this and been touching my bookkeeping , which they have no right to do , " he said .
While questioning Egerstad at the station , the police " played every trick in the book , good cop , bad cop and crazy mysterious guy in the corner not wanting to tell his name and just staring at me " .
" Well , if they want to try to manipulate , I can play that game too .
[ I ] gave every known body signal there is telling of lies ... covered my mouth , scratched my elbow , looked away and so on . "
Egerstad said the police also accused him of theft because he had eight PlayStation 2 consoles in his apartment .
He said he owns a company that " handles consoles " .
Egerstad was released and no charges have been laid against him , but the police are in the process of investigating the matter and nothing has been ruled out .
Linus Larsson , a reporter for Computer Sweden magazine whom Egerstad called after the ordeal , said in a phone interview he had confirmed with Swedish police that the raid took place .
" We do n't know exactly what they [ police ] are doing now but they took his hard drives and his computers , and according to him the interrogation went on for about 2 hours and he was then released but he did not get his equipment back , " Larsson said .
Egerstad said his lawyer was looking into whether the Swedish police had broken the law by taking several " unnecessary actions " .
" They are n't giving me any information on who filed the report but said that they have been exchanging information with other countries . "
He said he had n't heard anything from police since the raid but he did not expect to receive the seized equipment back for months , even years .
" [ I 'm ] losing money and trust in my company and even if i'm never charged I will not get any compensation it looks like . "
The raid occurred around the same time a feature article on Egerstad 's hack appeared in the Next IT section in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald , but it is unlikely the story sparked the raid .
Patrick Gray , who wrote the article , has published a detailed audio interview with Egerstad , which took place before the raid , on his website ( http://itradio.com.au/security/).
deviantART Proudly Announces ...
deviantART
Film
Film
Film as a word conjures up something special .
A unique feeling .
Almost a different texture than words like movie or video .
When someone asks you to go see a movie on the weekend you think , “ Oh cool , that ’ll be fun , ” but if someone asks you to go to a film festival the feeling you get is entirely different .
It feels like an investment of your time , one for which you want to plan accordingly and enjoy thoroughly .
And this is exactly what we are bringing you with deviantART Film .
An experience meant to be enjoyed from the moment you hit watch to the very end of the film because you know that the artist has invested considerable time and effort to create something special .
And based on that experience , you ’re naturally compelled to share your opinions and thoughts on what you just experienced , because it is special and deserves it .
We have invested a lot of time to ensure that this experience is unique .
We also see it as a natural step in the evolution of deviantART and this community .
As the community has grown , we have witnessed more and more collaboration between deviants , and the art of filmmaking is perhaps the pinnacle of what deviants can do when we come together and collaborate .
The worlds of visual art and literary art exist here in abundance ... so maybe it is time to start looking at some of your neighbors more closely ... expanding your ambitions and horizons .
In the Beginning ...
In the course of putting together this showcase of the moving image , we have decided to take a unique approach to how it is presented .
As we put out feelers and dropped hints to you , the community , a common response was that film on deviantART would be similar to * gasp * YouTube and turn deviantART into a veritable dumping ground for thousands of webcam - shot and vastly inane ramblings and observations , or clips from people ’s favorite TV shows , or worse .
We cannot and will not let this happen .
This launch will showcase a series of artists from dA as well as artists from outside the dA community . .
The film projects they have created are quite simply , jaw - dropping .
We hope that this strong of an opening will set the standard for what you and the rest of the world can expect from deviantART Film .
For the immediate future , we will keep submissions to deviantART on an invite - only basis to set the standard for what we think will ultimately redefine the concept of the short film on the Internet .
Additionally , we think it will help deviants raise the bar as well as the quality of the film content you create .
There is nothing more artistically inspiring than a bit of friendly competition to help you polish and refine your work .
This is undoubtedly a different approach than most of you are used to with us , but like you , we do not want to simply become just one more place to upload some crappy clip .
You want art , and that is what we will deliver .
Annotations
For the most part , we simply want you to explore and enjoy the experience and discover all the different things that you can do and the many ways you can view all of this amazing film content .
Discovery , as you well know , is half the fun with new features but there is one set of features we want to explain in a bit more detail .
When viewing a film on deviantART , you will notice something you have never seen on other film related sites .
How do we know this ?
Simple , because we created it specifically for deviantART Film .
So what exactly is this wondrous addition ?
The ability for a deviant viewing a film to stop the film at any specific frame , and leave comments , suggestions , rants and raves , on any given frame .
Nice huh ?
This means that from day one , deviantART
Film will offer something new , allowing for real , up to the second critiques and discussion .
You no longer need to explain what specific part of the film you like or dislike ... you can discuss it right where it occurs .
And if this was n't enough , the film makers themselves will be able to add their own annotations to the film , much like the directorA­s commentary film aficionados enjoy on special edition DVD releases .
This is a truly defining moment for film on the Internet .
The Nuts and Bolts
Technically speaking , dA Film will be offered in a number of flavors .
Users will be able to upload a film in any format for automatic conversion into high - quality DivX® format , h.264 and standard flash .
Why the three different formats ?
DivX video offers the most complete viewing experience for high resolution films ( including HD ) at full screen on the PC and beyond .
Further , DivX videos can be downloaded to watch on any of the millions of DivX Certified devices out there — from DVD players to PMPs to in - car players and even mobile phones .
h.264 is another high - quality standard which will be available as a download option within the next few days .
h.264 is supported on the iPod and as well as the PSP , which means you can immediately watch them upon download .
So grab your iPods and PSP and enjoy !
$ randomduck will thank you for it !
Standard Flash will be the default viewing format for watching it within the deviation film page , or in other words , web viewing for those with slower connections .
Films will be encoded at 400 pixels wide in Flash and 640 wide for DivX video and h.264 .
And , and as previously stated , both DivX video and h.264 will offer full screen viewing options .
The Future ...
So , here it is .
deviantART
Film .
A new way of presenting the moving picture to the world .
Where it goes from here is simply upward and onward ..... into new territory .
So grab a seat , wait for the lights to dim and stay tuned for more developments !
For now , pick a film , press watch and enjoy .
Now go and enjoy some of these fine films here !
Edible body parts .
Suck on this !
This is Kittiwat Unarrom ’s body bakery .
It appears to be the basement of a serial killar with putrefying body parts laid around the place on shelfs but they are actually bread scultpures by the student artist .
Kittiwat started painting portraits and then moved onto mixed media and then to dough .
Together with edible human heads , he also makes arms , feet and chicken and pig parts .
He uses anatomy books and his own memory from museums etc as reference .
“ When people see the bread , they do n’t want to eat it .
But when they taste it , it ’s just normal bread , ” he said .
“ The lesson is ‘ do n’t judge just by outer appearances . ' ”

No Cheers For CAFTA
by Ottón Solís
October 19 , 2007
The Wall Street Journal may say “ Bravo , Costa Rica ” on its Opinion page October 9 , but almost half of the people who voted in the Central American Free Trade Agreement referendum October 7 are not celebrating .
We are proud that our health and environmental policies are , by far , the best in the region , that our democracy is founded on an extensive system of family farming , that our telecommunications services are lower priced and more efficient than those of our neighbors , that we abolished all military forces 60 years ago , and that our laws forbid the trade and production of weapons and their parts .
All these sources of national pride are threatened by CAFTA .
That is why we tried to stop it through a popular referendum .
The fundamental problem is that , on many issues , CAFTA would give multinational corporations more power than our government .
For instance , if a corporation thought that a new environmental regulation or a democratically decided performance requirement interfered with the company ’s interests , it could sue Costa Rica in a court located outside our territory , regardless of where the corporation registers its operations .
We supply health care and medicines to those who need them , not just those who can afford them .
But since CAFTA ’s intellectual property protections exceed U.S. patent law and the regulations of the World Trade Organization , CAFTA will reduce access to generic drugs and thereby increase the price of medicines .
It seems contradictory that even though the Bush administration is even willing to wage war over weapons proliferation , it promotes an agreement that liberalizes trade and manufacturing of all kinds of weapons and parts , including nuclear .
CAFTA is very good for multinational corporations and a very small elite of Central Americans .
Elsewhere in the region these elites managed to get CAFTA ratified after one or two sessions of their parliaments .
But Costa Rica has a much more sophisticated democracy .
We tend to reject both the grotesque wealth concentration prevailing in the other Central American countries and also the populism that has taken hold in some South American countries .
Opposition to CAFTA had nothing to do with Hugo Chavez or Fidel Castro , whom most of us disagree with .
In Costa Rica there is practically no anti-U.S. feeling .
There are more Americans living in Costa Rica than Costa Ricans living in the United States .
During the referendum campaign , the “ yes ” side spent millions of private dollars and unlimited government resources .
We countered with not a penny , just the deep conviction that CAFTA is wrong for Costa Rica .
Even so , the final tally shows a slim difference of three percentage points .
For all these reasons you would do well to look closer at the CAFTA process in Costa Rica .
Please do not misunderstand :
We are not , in any way , opposed to trade with the United States or any other democratic country .
But we know that 13 years of NAFTA have increased poverty in Mexico to such an extent that the United States is now building a wall to keep impoverished Mexicans from crossing the border .
As voting day approached , the White House even went so far as to interfere in our internal affairs , weighing in with statements that echoed false threats that the “ yes ” side had been spreading .
Public statements from the administration warned that Costa Rica could lose its trade preferences under the Caribbean Basin Initiative if we voted “ no ” — even though the CBI is a permanent agreement .
While the Bush administration sought to spread fear , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other key Democrats in the Senate and House brought hope to the Costa Ricans throughout our long national debate over CAFTA .
In their efforts to set the record start on Costa Rica ’s status under the CBI , they reached the hearts of thousands of Costa Ricans who rediscovered an image of the United States that has seemed lost during the last years .
Regardless of the outcome of the referendum , this new understanding is an important outgrowth of their visits for both countries .
I am sorry that pundits who support CAFTA do not value or even acknowledge it .
Ottón Solís is head of the Costa Rican Citizen ’s Action Party and a former presidential candidate .

CBS News reported Tuesday on " disturbing revelations " regarding the Boy Scouts , saying that " over the last 60 years , at least 5,100 adult leaders were kicked out of the Scouts because of allegations of sexual abuse . "
That figure emerged as the result of a lawsuit against the Scouts by two brothers , who told CBS they were abused throughout their entire childhoods by an assistant scoutmaster who has since acknowledged his guilt .
" Thousands of secret Boy Scout files ... were turned over to the brothers ' attorney " as a result of the suit , CBS reported , and the attorney told CBS his analysis showed troop leaders were being tossed out for suspected abuse every three days before 1991 and every 2 days since then .
The Boy Scouts insist that these numbers represent only a tiny percentage of scoutmasters , and the organization now requires criminal background checks and has instituted educational policies intended to prevent abuse .
Despite the increased scrutiny , the head of the Scouts ' child abuse prevention program was convicted in 2005 of trafficking in child pornography .
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on August 28 .
I previously wrote about the interesting phenomenom of pathological gambling developing in Parkinsons patients who were taking medications called dopamine agonists , which increase dopamine in certain places in your brain .
A study in the journal Neurology now finds that when these medications are used by people with Restless Leg Syndrome ( RLS ) , the same pathological gambling can develop , even when lower doses of these medications are prescribed .
Up to 10 % of the population may have Restless Leg Syndrome .
The symptoms include :
1. strong urges to move your legs , often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations described as creeping , itching , or creepy - crawly
2. worse with rest
3. gets better when you move your legs
4. worse in the evening
Two of the patients in the study had been recreational gamblers , but developed gambling addiction when using medication .
One patient had not previously gambled , but started when taking the medication .
One of the patients gambled away $ 140,000 before stopping the medication !
So a caution to RLS patients who are started on these medications .
We want to keep your bank account intact .
( Of course , do n’t change any of your medical treatments based on today ’s post .
Talk with your doctor if you have questions about any of your medications . )
More about the study can be found at the Restless Leg Syndrome Foundation website .
When the CEO and product development manager of Zero Motorcycles first wheeled their electric motorcycle up to my front door , it did n’t look like much .
A slim , 120 pound bike , the Zero - S testing model comes with none of the bulky appurtenances of a regular motorcycle .
Instead , there ’s only a rectangular battery and a small engine , discreetly tucked beneath the seat .
It looks like a low - powered dirt bike , useful merely for fooling around .
But looks can be deceiving .
The Zero has significant potential as a form of transportation , and may spark a small revolution for motorcyclists .
Unlike electric cars , which have been loudly championed by environmentalists for over a decade , and lower - powered conveyances from the IZIP to the widely hyped Segway , electric motorbikes have n’t gotten much attention .
The few that have been developed have mostly been one - off side projects of engineers ; the one - of - a- kind KillaCycle , which claims to be the world ’s fastest electric motorcycle , is also the most publicized .
Chances are , you have n’t heard of it .
Having already sold out of their initial run of 24 bikes , tiny Zero is busy gearing up for its next edition .
Among the pre-orderers for the $ 7,000 Zero - S 2008 model , which should appear within three weeks , is Google co-founder Larry Page , in for three .
The first Zero motorcycles will begin shipping next month , although the company expects to be backlogged for the remainder of the year while it gears up production .
( The company ’s web page is outdated ; for pre-orders , they ’re currently taking calls . )
Back to the test ride .
Before showing up , Zero ’s acting CEO , Damon Danielson , had promised the Zero would “ blow your socks off . ”
Once I saw the bike , I had reason to doubt him .
When I think of a powerful bike , I think of a hulking Ducati or CBR , not a demure package like the Zero .
What Danielson and the engineering mind behind the Zero , Neal Saiki , failed to mention is that electric engines have far more torque than gas engines when starting from a stop .
I kept my socks , but the bike almost left me behind — the first time I gently rolled the hand - grip back to accelerate , I was jerked across an intersection , with the bike standing up on its rear wheel .
The Zero motorcycle I tested is the company ’s lower - powered model , coming in at the equivalent of a 250 cc motorcycle .
But during my test drive , it felt significantly more powerful , zipping up intimidatingly steep San Francisco hills with ease — the low body weight of the bike makes a large difference .
The Zero can keep the pace for about 50 miles before a recharge ( at least , that is what is reported ) , which takes two hours on average .
Based on Californian electricity prices , it can be charged for about 40 cents from empty , plugging into any ordinary wall outlet .
The brain behind the Zero is Neal Saiki , the aforementioned product manager .
An aeronautical engineer , Saiki helped popularize the use of space - age materials in bike frames at companies like Trek and Santa Cruz Bicycles ; while still a student , he led the team that invented the world ’s first human - powered helicopter .
Saiki claims to have made breakthroughs in the power integration systems required to make a high - powered but small vehicle like a motorcycle able to run without setting its own battery aflame .
When battery systems are crammed into smaller spaces , much like computer chips , efficiency issues arise .
But the Zero is innovative in more than one way .
With its light weight , it can be shipped for as little as $ 200 , opening up an unusual distribution strategy ;
Zero wants its customers to be able to order the bike from outlets like Costco and Amazon , having it shipped to their door .
With only about 200 moving parts , the bike will rarely require servicing except when the battery wears out , which takes about five years .
The lithium - ion batteries , produced by a company called Emoli , are even rated for regular landfill disposal .
And due to intentionally placed loopholes in the laws of California and 17 other states , the electric motorcycle requires no license to operate , as long as you keep it more or less to the right side of the road , which is considered a bike lane .
( You are n’t misreading .
Anyone — perhaps I should say any idiot — can buy an electric motorcycle and zip around at high speeds , without any training at all .
We doubt this loophole will last , if a large market develops . )
So what ’s next for Zero ?
Securing venture funding , the founders say .
They ’ve so far gained commitments for about $ 5 million , but are seeking more offers from lead investors .
They ’re also considering going as high as $ 8 million , although they do n’t think they ’ll need any more than that .
They ’re currently in talks with several funds , but hope to be approached by more .
As production scales , Saiki says , he will be able to bring the costs down ; individual components are currently produced at factories around Asia , then shipped to the US for final production at the headquarters in Scotts Valley , Calif .
Assuming the prices for his batteries continue to drop as they have over the past year , the price for the bikes could drop to $ 4000 within a year and a half , when the next model , the Zero Way , is released .
( See the chart , below , for comparisons in cost and performance against other forthcoming electric vehicles — note that the Honda has a gas engine . )
It 's just the Constitution that 's suffering because of House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's nutty and unprincipled " impeachment - off - the - table " position
blocking any effort to impeach President Bush or Vice President Cheney for
their many crimes and abuses of power .
Her position on impeachment is killing the Democratic Party too , by driving
away not just progressived members of the party , but independents who voted
for Democrats last November expecting some action in defense of the
Constitution .
I see this anger welling up among progressives and independents everywhere I
travel , as people say they 've simply had it with the Democrats .
The support
of the party for a bill continuing funding for the war through September was
terrible .
The Democrats ' rush to pass a bill granting Bush the authority to
spy without a warrant on Americans , and to expand the power to spy
domestically well beyond phones and internet to even include break - ins was a
last straw .
My own little call for people so sign an " I Quit This Party " petition has
seen a jump from 300 to now 400 signers .
( Sign up on the column to the
right . )
When it gets to 500 I 'll be sending the list off to Pelosi , as well
as to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic
National Committee Chair Howard Dean .
Four or five hundred party defectors may seem like small loss , but it
reflects a larger trend across the country .
Here 's a letter I got from the head of a group of active Democrats in
central Pennsylvania -- the very kind of heartland area that Democrats will
need if they are going to win the presidency and hang on to or make gains in
Congress next year .
Writes Kathy Ember , a Democratic Committee member in Pennsylvania , and
president of the Kutztown Democratic Club :
I am the president of a very active grassroots Democratic club just outside
Philadelphia in PA .
Recently , I got an email from Nancy Pelosi , asking all
of us to help build the grassroots .
EXCUSE ME
Nancy , but we have been working our butts off out here for years
trying to do just that .
WE are the ones that put that Democrats back in
power in Congress .
We 've been there for you , but you have let us down by not
holding the current administration responsible for their crimes .
Not only are you losing us ... you are making it impossible for us to " build
the grassroots " .
Do you know how people look at you now when you ask them to
join the Democrats ?
They laugh in your face .
Why , they want to know , should
we join or support a party that has done nothing toward getting out of Iraq
or impeaching this president ?
I am in contact with other Democratic clubs across PA .
Some have recently
changed the word " Democrats " in their name to a lower case " d " .
Others have
abandoned their association with the Democrats altogether and have formed
instead " citizen action groups . "
When will the Democrats in Washington wake up and realize that it's not
impeachment that will hurt the party ... it is the lack of it .
I believe that the aptly named Ember is just one spark in a prairie fire
that is going to sweep away the conservative Democratic establishment in
2008 .
Whether it is by turning to third party candidates , or just sitting
out the next election , these angry and frustrated Democrats are showing that
they 've been betrayed one too many times by the Democratic Party .
Either Pelosi -- who is facing an election challenge by Cindy Sheehan in her
own San Francisco district -- better do an about face and open the path to
impeachment of Bush and / or Cheney .
Otherwise , she and her fellow party
leaders are going to find themselves either ousted in primaries , or back in
the position of minority " leaders " in 2009 .

Social Media Addiction
The cornerstone of modern communication primarily revolves around Instagram , Facebook , Tinder , and Twitter .
This is because these services create a sense of belonging and redefine their way of being by connecting people all over the world .
However , of late , concerns have been raised regarding the same .
Social media addiction is creating a negative impact on the health and well - being of users .
Signs of Disorder
The first alarming signs that show one is addicted to social media are as follows :
You check your smartphone every now and then for any notification received on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram or Tinder .
An addict is likely to feel that the world is crashing down when they are unable to get internet access .
Addicts have a tendency of posting and announcing everything they do on social media , such as brushing teeth , having a snack , etc .
You will always tag your friends in a picture even when it does not involve them .
This is done to make sure that they like the picture and it features in their timeline .
On not getting adequate likes and comments , you become upset .
Stalking your friends and random people on social media is your favorite pastime .
If someone does n’t respond to your friend request , you take it seriously and ponder over it day in and day out .
Social anxiety and isolation is a common symptom for social media addicts as well .
They lack touch of a real life and associations because of which they tend to suffer from low self - esteem and loneliness .
What Are the Symptoms of the Internet Addiction ?
The symptoms can be presented in both physical and emotional manifestations .
The emotional symptoms include :
Depression
Anxiety
Euphoric feelings while using the computer
Inability in prioritizing and keeping schedules
Lack of sense of time
Avoidance of work
Isolation
Mood swings
The physical symptoms consist of headaches , backaches and neck pain due to sedentary lifestyle .
IAD can be cured only if treated at an early stage when the first symptoms show .
The Key Risk Factors of Medical Complexities
As per a case study , in the year 2012 , the number of 3G smartphones in Macau had increased from 8 % of the population to 95 % .
This dramatic escalation is owing to the growing popularity of social networking sites ( SNSs ) .
While SNSs can be ideal for building relationships and networks such as two old friends connecting after a long time ; excessive usage can lead to compulsive behavior and addiction .
The consequences of these include loss of control and an experience of withdrawal .
Apart from that , an individual runs risks of neck pain , back aches , headaches and lack of concentration .
Sitting with a smartphone for hours is likely to cause muscle issues , dry eyes and tumors especially a gliomas which occurs in the region between our brain and spinal cord due to inadequate blood flow .
Some Prevention Methods and Treatments
Given below are some tips on how one can control their social media addiction :
Turn off the notifications so that you are able to concentrate on your regular work properly .
Try setting a timer in the clock or phone by which you can limit the amount of time spent on social networking sites .
A large number of people lose their jobs and perform poorly in their academics since they are not able to limit their usage of SNSs .
Switch off your cellphones during bedtime .
The microwaves and X - rays generating from phones are hazardous for the brain , thereby causing memory loss and brain cancers .
Spend time with your family members and loved ones .
There is nothing better than connecting with people in real life and making memories .
Even though there is a growing debate worldwide whether social media addiction is a clinical condition or not ; there have been various researches which establish that addicts require treatments if not medical therapies .
The Prospects of Digital Detox
One of the major treatments for curing or at least limiting social media addiction is digital detox .
This is a strategy that forces one to limit the amount of time spent in SNSs .
This is generally achieved by turning off the media sound on your phone , followed by restricting yourself from checking the phone every now and then .
It also includes a dedicated period of ‘ self imposed no phone time ’ on a regular basis .
Over the years , researches have also shown that SNSs addicts suffer from loneliness , depression , hyperactivity disorders and anxiety .
Therefore , it is recommended to seek professional counseling and medical therapies for treating these problems .
Since these disorders result in social media addiction , once the issues have been taken care of , addiction can also be constrained .
Social media addiction is a sensitive issue containing negative connotations .
Hence , it is imperative for victims and people around them to start resorting to treatments or prevention methods the very moment early signs of addiction show .
It 's high noon , Apple and AT&T -- we really hate to break it to you , but the jig is up .
Last night the impossible was made possible : right in front of our very eyes we witnessed a full SIM unlock of our iPhone with a small piece of software .
It 's all over , guys .
The iPhoneSIMfree.com team called us up to prove their claim that they cracked Apple 's iPhone SIM lock system , and prove it they did .
( No , we do n't have a copy of the unlock software , so do n't even ask us , ok ? )
The six - man team has been working non -stop since launch day , and they 're officially the first to break Apple 's SIM locks on the iPhone with software .
It 's done .
Seriously .
They would n't tell us when and how they would release it to the public , but you can certainly bet that they 'll try to make a buck on their solution ( and rightly so ) .
We can hardly believe the iPhone 's finally been cracked .
No , scratch that -- we just can't believe it took this long .

The tech industry – makers of hardware , software and every ware in between – prides itself on innovation .
If George Bush is the decider , then Steve Jobs and his pals , er , rivals at Dell and IBM are the innovators , the geniuses , the gurus .
We ’ve elevated these guys to rock - star status , which I suppose makes sense , because they provide the tools that allow a self - involved culture to wallow in its narcissism .
They keep us kitted out with must - have laptops and iPods and Blackberries , thereby giving us texting and virtual worlds and , hoo - wahhh , our own personal music .
Unfortunately , all these way - cool necessaries wear out or become obsolete ( and way too soon – more on that in a bit ) .
Now , Johnny I ’m - Way - Deep - Into - Myself can’t afford to fall behind on the gadget front , so he ’s going to ditch the stuff he ’s got to get the newest stuff , the best stuff .
This makes the mandarins at Microsoft and Apple and all those other Incs , Corps and Plcs very happy indeed , because continually buying their new toys keeps their profits high and , they ’ll tell you , keeps them innovating .
Trouble is , it ’s almost impossible to dispose of discarded technology in an environmentally friendly way , and the earth is starting to strangle on all this electronic detritus .
Of course , we here in the United States – by far the biggest consumers on the planet – do n’t see the worst of it , because we ship a lot of our tech garbage overseas .
It ’s even got a cute name : e-waste .
According to the Associated Press , upwards of 500 million tons of electronic trash is generated worldwide every year , and the lion 's share of it comes from here .
Most of it winds up in U.S. landfills , a cheery thought .
What 's left is sent overseas to Third World chop shops , where what can be salvaged and resold is .
The rest is dumped , and without much care .
Burying old computer components and television monitors in landfills , or dumping them in a Malaysian ditch , is a particularly malignant form of pollution , given the high levels of toxins present in these electronics .
On top of that , the workers who deconstruct all this wonderful innovation in Vietnam or India or , especially , China are n’t protected by OSHA regulations .
Using crude tools and sometimes no tools , they are expected to extract what can be recycled , leaving them exposed to poisoning and sickness and , who knows , maybe death .
The brokers who arrange for our e-waste to be sent abroad argue that they are actually doing the world a favor and advancing the cause of technology by sending working computers to the developing world .
In truth , the stuff is usually crated and shipped without ever being checked for its viability .
Nobody here cares if it works .
We want to get rid of it , and the middlemen want to get paid .
And the problem is only getting worse , as more U.S. municipalities ban the dumping of discarded electronics in local landfills .
This junk has gotta go somewhere , and guess where it ’s going .
Some countries are wising up .
China , for example , no stranger itself to despoiling the planet , still accepts more electronic waste than anyone , but is beginning to enforce a ban .
According to the AP , Hong Kong customs officials – tipped by environmentalists – intercepted a couple of containers full of old computers and TVs that were jettisoned in the modern Land of Milk and Honey .
The junk was sent back to the United States , with love from the Peoples ’ Republic .
But vigilance is n’t enough .
Electronics are being discarded almost as fast as they ’re being made .
And the innovators are largely to blame for that .
While the effective lifespan of a new computer should be , in a sane world , a decade or more , realistically you ’ve got a dinosaur if it ’s been sitting on your desk longer than a couple of years .
And our tax laws encourage this .
Why ?
Because the innovators know that they need you coming back every few years to keep those coffers overflowing .
If you ’re visiting the Apple Store only once in a decade , then there might not be an Apple Store at all .
So the innovators practice the art that the automakers perfected decades ago : the art of planned obsolescence .
Even as they tout the latest must - have operating system , or the coolest new game console , they know most of it will be passè by the next holiday - shopping season .
They know that , because they 're already planning the coolest technology for 2009 , but do n't want you to know too much about it .
Some of you may be untroubled by this .
If so , shame on you .
Your planet is slowly dying from carbon dioxide emissions and the casual dumping of toxic waste .
Turning a blind eye to this fact while eagerly consuming every glittery new tech bauble dangled before you is not only pathetic , but suicidal .
There is legislation out there – in any number of countries , including this one – that 's supposed to curb this scourge .
All well and good , but we know that for every law there 's a loophole .
And when there 's money to be made , those loopholes can get pretty big .
Tell the rock stars that if they 're such groovy innovators , they 'll innovate a cheap - but - efficient way to clean up this filthy world they ’ve helped to create .

RIAA Hits a Sour Note With Its File - Sharing Witch Hunt
On the Road at 50 Remains an Anthem for the ' Crazy Ones '
Thanks for the Memories ... Whatever They Were
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
Our notion of play has changed over the years and has little to do with fun .
These days the closest a child gets to an adrenalin rush is rocking back and forth on a springy chicken in an asphalt - covered playground .
Children are losing the freedom to roam and play independently , says a new report from the think tank Demos , along with places where such exploration is allowed .
It argues that children have effectively been segregated from public spaces , and are instead herded into fenced - off playgrounds or driven to activities deemed " acceptable " for letting off steam .
But the erosion of unstructured play is not making anyone happy .
Hanging out
" Unless young people are in structured activities or acting as mini-consumers , we assume that they are causing trouble , " says Celia Hannon , one of the authors of the Demos report .
" Our streets , squares and parks need to be accessible and enjoyable for all , otherwise existing anxiety around anti-social behaviour will get worse .
Children should be seen and heard . "
So what can we do differently ?
Three experts in the field consider the future of play .
TEMPORARY SPACES
Play means more than just swings and a slide , and it definitely means more than playgrounds .
Taking a space not usually associated with children and turning it into a playground for all ages can transform an area .
Urban beaches ' unite generations '
Such projects are not just about the physical , they also send out a message , says Adrian Voce , the director of Play England .
" They challenge people 's notion of what play is and where it can be done .
" They have impact and send out a message that play is n't something trivial , it is something that can break down barriers and create a place where people of all ages can be . "
MOVING SPACES
Cars , commerce and " adult play " take priority over children , says Demos .
So the opportunities for many children to have fun are few and far between .
Also , there are times when play becomes even more important , like in the school holidays .
This is why play in the future could be brought to children when and where they need it .
In Bristol " play pods " are being built out of refurbished shipping containers .
These will be filled with toys and moved around areas during school holidays .
" It 's about taking the action to children , moving play to where it is needed , " says landscape architect Phil Heaton , who has been involved in the redesign of many play areas .
" It 's about giving kids who do n't have many opportunities for play the chance to get involved . "
ICONIC SPACES
Play has become so narrowly circumscribed , there are few places it is considered " acceptable " .
Even in public places there are limitations on noise , meeting friends , playing ball games , riding bike , using skateboards ... the list goes on .
Creating a village in central London
Last year Trafalgar Square was grassed over , creating a family - friendly environment in central London .
Grassing over major road arteries for the day , such as Spaghetti Junction and London 's North Circular , are other suggestions .
" Schemes like this turn traffic - congested roads and places into villages , " says Mr Voce , of Play England .
" It creates a carnival culture where people of all generations come and mix .
For too long cars have been given priority over people .
Events like this turn the tables . "
CREATE OWN SPACE
In the future children should be encouraged to appropriate and adapt their own play space .
Adults should not to be so hung up on kids hanging around , says Ms Hannon , of Demos .
Skateboarders are now part of South Bank
Skateboarders on London 's South Bank have become a tourist attraction in their own right , turning a dark warren of covered spaces into an exciting , vibrant place to be .
" These young skaters have made this place their own , but not to the exclusion of anyone else , " says Ms Hannon .
" It 's a great example of somewhere that is safer with young people hanging around .
It is usually assumed that they make a place more threatening . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
Am I living in a parallel universe ?
When I was a child we went to the swings and now I 'm a parent I regularly take my two children to the local park to play in the playground on the swings , slides , climbing frames etc .
We often have a little walk round the park too .
They really enjoy it and it 's free .
It 's also always full of other families doing the same .
Any research that says that playgrounds are n't used is just another attempt to sell them off .
We all need to defend them so that all kids can carry on playing for free , outdoors and not become obese .
Catherine Hill , Croydon , UK
Do we really need a think tank to tell children how to play ?
For heaven 's sake , just let them get out there and get on with it .
Douglas Lee , London , UK
Some Scandinavian countries have developed play grounds with equipment that can be used by all - adults , children , people with disabilities .
So instead of signs that say ' for under 14s only ' , and dreary parks where parents have to stand round and watch their children on the swings and slides , and climbing apparatus , they now have places where everyone can go and enjoy a bit of play .
Surely an idea that we should take up in this country ?
Why should a 15 year old , or 50 year old , be banned from having some fun ?
Dot Peryer , Penryn , UK
Could not agree more .
We should not exclude children from the adult world .
I expect respect and good manners from children .
I hope I deserve this .
I despair of adults that do n't .
Colin McFarlane , Gawcott , Buckingham , UK
I think part of being a child is having fun with the imagination .
To the adult mind it might only be a silly " springy chicken " but in the imagination of a young child it is something much more fun and exciting than that .
Part of playing is letting the imagination run free in whatever space you find available .
Like somebody has said , we just need to provide the children with the breathing space to find their own areas of play and stop developing over them .
Kirsty , Cornwall , UK
As innovative as the new play proposals are , they still focus on controlling and approving places to play .
When I was a child ( which was n't too long ago ) , it was all about finding your own places to play : Fields , trees , wooded areas , ' the green ' etc .
If every spare bit of land did n't turn into a crowded housing estate or new shopping complex within the blink of an eye , then kids would still be able to do this .
Instead of designing our way out of problems all the time ( play pods ? ) , we actually need to slow the rate of development down and give kids a bit of breathing room .

The mentality of children changes with each generation , its foolish to presume that just because our parents enjoyed something , we Will .
We need something that suits the modern generation .
Matt , 16 , Scunthorpe , UK
We did n't need spaces or equipment to play when I was a child .
There were well defined seasons , skipping , whip ' n ' top , two ball etc - all had their season when quite by magic , everyone suddenly played the same thing .
We played games that these days do n't seem to have been passed on to the next generation .
Kick out ball , hopscotch ...
I could carry on naming all sorts of games that we played in the street .
We played rounders and cricket and mums and dads would come out and join in the fun , or a gang of us ( including parents ) would go to the local park and play there .
Life is too fast now and there is too much reliance on technology which isolates kids and keeps them alone and apart from their peer group .
Lesley , Leeds
As a parent I do n't feel it safe for children to go off and find their own spaces - you can't trust strangers and you can't rely on the general public to help out a child in distress because they also do n't want to be put in that situation .
Jo , Surrey
Is n't the real issue here safety and crime , there are places for children ( and adults ) to play but they get vandalised or used by drunks and drug addicts .
Twenty - odd years ago when I was growing up I could go to the park without my parents worrying about alcoholics or abusers .
Andrew , Staffordshire
I agree with the point about cars taking precedence over people .
Traffic is a far greater danger to our children 's safety than predatory adults , yet strangely nothing is done about it .
Riding a bicycle to a friend 's house is n't even safe for an adult .
The priorities need to shift from cars going as fast as possible with as few interruptions from pedestrians as possible , to a recognition that the pedestrians were here first , and have a right to use the entirety of public space .
Let the cars sit in traffic for an extra minute : it 's not going to kill anybody .
Matt
Councils should be looking at the playgrounds projects of the architect Aldo van Eyck .
His playgrounds were in public spaces and involved objects that let children explore them , rather than only giving them one way to play on them .
They did n't look like playgrounds either , and the objects within sometimes looked more like sculpture than climbing frames .
If more playgrounds were designed like this here then it would be far easier and arouse little or no opposition if they were integrated into public spaces .
Richard , Swansea , UK
As a kid growing up in Bristol in the 80s we had a disused railway track running behind our house .
We used to play all up and down it , on adventurous days we'd walk for miles to places we'd never been before and have a good look around the area .
There were old signal huts , eroded embankments , railway bridges and dozens of other things to look at and explore .
We did this as young as seven or eight years old .
We got in scrapes , the odd experiment with boxes of matches and discarded mattresses and maybe even a bit of fisticuffs but it was great .
Excepting the odd glue - sniffing skinhead , no one except kids wanted to go on this railway track .
It was ours .
I feel very sorry that kids have nothing like this today .

Here 's Mitt Romney telling Bob Schieffer on CBS's Face the Nation that he will put the rule of law above religion , and wo n't " take orders or even input from a religious leader . " :
Scheiffer :
How would you describe your relationship to the church and how you would see the responsibilities and duties of the President ?
Romney : Well , no President could possibly take orders or even input from a religious leader telling him what to do .
I mean I guess you could always listen to ideas , but you certainly would n't be guided by someone outside the Constitutional circle of you will .
I subscribe to something Abraham Lincoln spoke about when he was a young man .
He said you take the oath of office and you subscribe to America 's political religion , and that is you take the oath of office and the rule of law as your primary promise to God , and that 's the way I feel .
My church would n't endeavor to tell me what to do on an issue and I would n't listen to them on an issue that related to our nation .
If I'm President of the United States and put my hand on the bible , I do what the Constitution tells me , what the rule of law tells me , I certainly do n't do what a leader of my church or any other tells me to do .
For new parents , transatlantic travelers and people who stay up watching late - night TV , life is all about getting enough sleep .
No one really knows why human and other animals sleep , or why , after losing sleep night after night , we become crazed .
We bumble around , grumpy and complaining , and then lie down for a good sleep but end up wide awake .
And now , Francesco Cappuccio at the University of Warwick Medical School in Coventry , Canada , claims that too little sleep will also kill us .
Cappuccio and colleagues at the University College , London , gathered sleep data on 10,308 civil servants in the late 1980s and then again in the early 1990s .
Of course , some of those government employees had died in the meantime , and so the researchers could factors out such variables as smoking , exercise , obesity and blood pressure and concentrate on how sleep might send us into the Big Sleep .
It seems that how much sleep the civil employees got ( not at their desks , but in bed at night ) played a part in putting them to sleep permanently .
Those who changed their sleep habits by cutting the time in bed from 7 to 5 or less hours were 1.7 times more likely to die , and twice as likely to die from cardiovascular problems .
Oddly enough , sleeping too much also turned out to be bad .
Going from the standard 7 hours of sleep to more than 8 hours also upped the risk of death twofold .
This research suggests that we all should be getting 7 hours of sleep a night , and we should religiously stick to that quotient .
But anthropologist James McKenna of Notre Dame begs to differ .
McKenna studies the sleep patterns of parents and babies , and he has looked at the history of sleep in the West as well as how people sleep in other cultures .
" In America , you are expected to go to bed at 11 o'clock and basically die until 7 a.m. , and if you do n’t , you have a pathology — insomnia , " McKenna says .
Americans , according to McKenna , also have a certain reverence for sleep , which makes it a cultural issue worthy of endless conversation , and research .
But in other cultures where people do n't work in offices , no one is all that interested in who gets how much sleep .
Also , everyone gets up at least once a night and does something , like tend the fire or comfort someone 's baby .
" Humans are really bi-phasic sleepers , " McKenna claims .
He says that we are biologically designed to sleep in two or more interrupted bouts during the night and then fall asleep again during the day .
In other words , there is no such thing as a good night 's sleep , but the catnap is the trade - off .
Sleeping at our desks in the middle of the day , then , is a good thing .
If Cappuccio searched his data base and found out which government employees nap during the work day , chances are the desk nappers are still with us .

MAY 29 -- In a scathing broadside at NBC 's popular ' To Catch a Predator ' series , a former producer charges that she was canned last year after complaining that the show violated ' numerous journalistic ethical standards ' and many of the network 's own ' policies and guidelines . '
In a breach of contract lawsuit , Marsha Bartel , 49 , alleges that her 21 - year career at NBC ended months after her August 2006 appointment as ' sole producer ' of ' To Catch a Predator , ' which conducts sting operations targeting men seeking illicit liaisons with children they 've met online .
According to her complaint , which was filed last week in U.S. District Court in Chicago , Bartel charges that many of the program 's ethical lapses stem from its relationship with Perverted Justice , a shadowy vigilante group that the show uses to ' troll for and lure targets into its sting . '
A copy of Bartel 's lawsuit can be found below .
According to Bartel , by paying Perverted Justice , NBC has given the group a ' financial incentive to lie to trick targets of its sting . '
The identities of the group 's 50 - plus volunteers were kept secret from her , Bartel says , adding that Perverted Justice does not provide ' complete transcripts from its trolling operations , ' so network officials ' cannot independently verify the accuracy ' of the group 's transcripts .
In some instances , Bartel claims , sting targets are 'led into additional acts of humiliation ( such as being encouraged to remove their clothes ) in order to enhance the comedic effect of the public exposure of these persons . '
She also charges that NBC has unethically covered up the fact that law enforcement officials have acted improperly while working in conjunction with the ' To Catch a Predator ' crew , such as ' goofing off by waving rubber chickens in the faces of sting targets while forcing them to the ground and handcuffing them . '
Bartel says that when she ' raised concerns ' about controversial comments made by Perverted Justice 's founder , David Corvo , executive producer of the newsmagazine ' Dateline , ' responded , ' We all know they 're nuts . '
Bartel , who signed a four - year contract in March 2006 , contends that soon after reporting her concerns about ' To Catch a Predator ' to NBC management , she was terminated effective December 24 , 2006 .
While NBC told her she was part of a ' mass layoff precipitated by general business factors , ' Bartel alleges that she was canned in retaliation for insistence on 'ethical and accurate reporting on the Predator series . '
NBC , she adds , was ' more interested in sensationalizing and dramatizing the Predator series for profit than news reporting . '
Bartel is seeking at least $ 1 million in damages from NBC .
In a statement , NBC said it has been ' transparent about our reporting ' on the Predator series , for which audience reaction has been ' overwhelmingly positive .
NBC
News is proud of its reporting and we believe this lawsuit is without merit . ' ( 10 pages )

Technology affects culture .
An explosion of communication technologies is driving not just the form , but also the content of messaging between people today .
A communication is only as deep and genuine , and as treasured , as the time , thought and effort put into it .
Ease can also lead to callousness .
Writing a letter on paper used to take at least half an hour , and many days or weeks to reach .
Coupled with the physical touch of the chosen paper , the watermark , the smell and texture of the ink , the handwriting , the writing in the margins , the post - script ( which is meaningless in an electronic medium ) , the address on the envelope , the hazy postmark , the choice of the stamp , the way the envelope was glued ...
Even without considering the content , there was so much that was unique to a paper letter that it was a thing to treasure , to look up after many years when the paper had yellowed and smelled different , to read again and again and recognize an affirmation of oneself as a human being who was thought of .
And as the letter was an infrequent thing , it also contained tidbits of events spanning a longer time - frame : the health of the family , the evolution of one 's thought , the planning of a celebration ... My aim is not to romanticize the past , but to see in which way we are blindly driven by technology to change the nature of human interactions .
Greeting cards was the next step .
Eloquent messages about the particular relationship ( " The best mother on earth " , " Happy Birthday Dear Brother " , " Friendship " ) made the other feel better than any hand - written letter could make them .
This was the first " outsourcing " of message - content .
One could just write " Dear Mom " , and " Affectionately , your son xxx " and the rest of the message could be taken care of ( along with sweet pictures of flowers and scenery ) .
Yes , we could choose between say , twenty different greeting cards , but does that make it any different , or any less depersonalized ?
The strange thing is , sometimes it takes more time to shop for a greeting card than to write a letter .
But there is a reason why people still shop for them .
The greeting cards lie romantically .
Most of us have neither the skill to be poetically romantic nor to express hyperbolic sentiments about the relationship .
Also , the verbalizing of emotion makes the emotion superficial , and that is why we find it hard to write a letter of our love to our parents or to our siblings .
The card is not authentic , and therefore its over - the - top exclamations are also curiously acceptable .
The love or affection between people does n't need to be put into descriptive words , comparing ( for example ) our mother to other mothers or describing the value - addition they have meant for us .
Hence , writing letters is also inherently a tougher task .
What creative and original words can one write , after all , since the whole " keeping in touch " is a ritual to stroke each other 's egos and keep the emotional bonds tugged tight ?
But the messaging in greeting cards is a great study in inter - human expectations , and to see why they appeal so much ( despite them being formulaic ) can be an instructive exercise .
When greeting cards were still a new thing , people were teary eyed at getting them , the colored envelope and the oh - so - heartfelt ( but professionally written ) message inside , without perhaps realizing that that card was printed in thousands with very careful attention to what people wouldto say to ( or hear from ) each other ....
The proliferation of computer and mobile telephone networks breaks altogether new ground .
Let 's briefly review the situation at present :-
We are in touch .
We have hundreds of email addresses of people : our childhood friends , our classmates , our extended family , our past colleagues . -
Mobile phones flaunt their 1000 - entry address books .-
It is considered a feature to be able to send a mass message via one 's phone to hundreds of recipients .-
We are part of faceless online communities : multiple social networks , mailing lists , forums and newsgroups .-
We have almost unlimited storage space for our old emails , but little time to ever review them at leisure . -
Through twitter , facebook , and other such contraptions , we know exactly which song our friend is listening at present , where he hiked to last week , which news stories she finds interesting , which are his favorite films , which books he recently read , ...-
We have automated reminders of others ' birthdays and anniversaries ( whereas the whole purpose of wishing somebody on their birthday is to express that we care enough for them to remember it ) .-
We receive probably dozens of personal emails ( and many times more work - related emails ) every day .
For the personal emails , the interesting question to ask is : how many of them are worthy of being treasured ?
How much time is spent on writing them , reading them , thinking about them and in replying to them ? -
We are addicted to the " latest " .
But since it is too time consuming to keep up with the latest happenings in hundreds of online places , " Feeds " comes to the rescue .
Now one can be up to date without much manual effort .
( I recently came across a news article describing a feed - junkie : that person had more than 600 site feeds in his RSS reader . ) -
Greeting cards have a new avatar : E - greeting cards .
Choose from a dozen or so animated pictures , put in the recipient email address and off it goes .
Probably it can be automatically linked with our calendars ( where we store others ' anniversaries etc. ) .
On the recipient side , probably an automated email filter will file the " Happy Birthday " wishes into a special folder , to be read and replied en masse . -
Emails allow responses in which the original text can be preserved , the replies merely being in the form of an annotation to the original text .
Hence messages can be sent which are almost entirely responsive in nature . -
Hyper - linked content encourage attention deficit disorder .
Due to the " unknown " nature of what lies behind a link , the mind has a tendency to de-focus on the present page and click and open ( perhaps in a different tab in the browser ) the various links in an article . -
One can have multiple open conversations in an instant messenger , without the other realizing it .
I think there ought to be a term : " information greed " .
Only recently in human history has it become possible for a human being to know about the entire world , have an unlimited vista ( to an astonishing level of detail ) of the workings , thoughts and activities of billions of people , all the films and books ever written , all the TV shows , all the software ever made , all the philosophies , religions , cults , sects available to one at the touch of a button .
With this storm , deluge and maelstrom of information , where does one stop ?
Being on the internet is like being in Manhattan or Tokyo or Bombay .
There ismuch to see , absorb , so many people going around , so many billboards , things crying for one 's attention , and so little time .
It is not possible to be empathetic in a big metro because empathy is possible only towards a limited set of people .
How many will you empathize with when driving on the Ring Road in New Delhi ?
Just as relentless physical crowding takes away one 's capability for genuine empathy , similarly , trying to keep in touch with too many people online ( just because it is possible ) takes away the depth in one 's communication .
Most of the personal communication that I see happening around is not original .
They are second - hand , facile and in a word : consumptive .
Forwarded emails , feel - good powerpoint slides about the Dalai Lama , the Ten Rules of friendship , difference between a woman and a bottle of beer , chicken - soup - for - the - soul stories about conquering the odds , the pronunciation mistakes of Bush ( and not his disastrous foriegn policy ) , urban legends and spurious health warnings , epidemiological and post - hoc " research " , dieting tips , celebrity gossip , ... One might find the way Donald Knuth deals with his email interesting .
On the mobile phones , SMS witticisms and jokes present a laugh in ten seconds and in two lines .
Some claim that the messages are coined by specialists in mobile phone companies and are then sent out into the world , to rake in millions from clueless customers who have a chuckle , and then blindly forward them to all they know .
Personal SMS messages , since they are so difficult to type , are short and abbreviated .
Since the day is so tight , one of the prime uses of SMS is to touch base , to agree on an eatery or on the time to meet up or that one is getting late .
One can understand the abbreviation and the lack of pronunciation in an SMS , but this is now spreading to email and instant messaging , stressing that this a symptom of one 's restlessness rather than a restriction of the medium .
Dis instead of This , 2 gud instead of " too good " , " tc " ( short for " take care " ) as the final remark in an online conversation , and of course the opening line in online dating : a / s/l ( Age / Sex / Location ) ... At any moment during the day , there are hundreds of known people online , holding a mobile phone in their hands or having a computer in front of them .
Communication is so inexpensive so as to be almost free .
In this milieu , " keeping in touch " becomes a tiresome and ultimately undo-able exercise , unless one starts using canonical mass forwarded messages .
But then , what does that " keeping in touch " mean if one is only forwarding depersonalized information ?
And if one does not keep in touch , is one therefore guilty of disloyalty to one 's friends and relatives ?
This is a very recent and real phenomenon , and one which is going to get more pronounced as time goes on .
One will feel less and less at leisure , the days and months and years will pass as if in a flurry and yet nothing will be there to talk about .
One will be up - to - date at the time of one 's death , knowing the stock prices and the discount telephone calling plans and the availability of a torrent of the latest chart busters , having thousands of emoticon laden unread messages in one 's inbox , and hundreds of unread feeds .
Up - to - date , in touch , and ... fondly remembered for the nice forwards and SMSes .
TWIN FALLS , Idaho - When Jamie Howard knocked on Paul Sucher 's door six months ago , he was trying to sell him a new vacuum cleaner .
He ended up giving him one of his kidneys .
The chance encounter with Howard , a travelling salesman for the Kirby Co. , led to transplant surgery in August .
Now , the colour is returning to Sucher 's cheeks and he is recovering .
Sucher , 35 , suffered kidney failure three years ago because of high blood pressure , forcing him to undergo dialysis .
When Howard came by on a sales call , he learned that Sucher could n't afford a new vacuum cleaner because of the illness .
He also learned Sucher had O - positive blood - the same as his .
" I went outside , prayed about it , called my dad and my wife , " Howard remembers .
" ( Donation ) was something I was called to do . "
Howard , who is also 35 , passed the tests required for potential donors .
The operation was done at the University of Colorado hospital in Denver , where Sucher had been on the transplant waiting list .
Two months later , Sucher says he feels so good it 's almost as if he never was ill .
" It 's truly a miracle , " he said .

Things go better with Coke , as some of us found ourselves singing in 1963 .
And who among us did n't dream of building the world a home and furnishing it with love ?
As brand awareness goes , you have to admit Coca - Cola is ' it ' .
Each day , 1.3 bn thirsts are slaked with a Coca - Cola product .
They made $ 4.8 bn in profits last year .
The company 's sloganeers may have been overscrupulous in their efforts to avoid too much creative sturm und drang down the ages ( their latest paean to wholesomeness is ' Welcome to the Coke Side of Life ! ' ) , but since the dawn of consumerism they have been singularly successful in stringing their bunting across the galaxy - from Aberystwyth to Zanzibar and those out - of - the - way places where reworking that iconic handwritten logo into an alphabet recognisable to speakers of Gurmukhi or Inuktitut is all part of teaching the world to sing from the same spreadsheet .
But this is no time to be thinking in Gurmukhi .
Coca - Cola has a new product coming out in Britain .
Like Diet Coke , Coke Zero contains no sugar , but unlike Diet Coke it tastes like the real thing - that is , like ordinary Coke .
At least that 's the verdict in the US and Australia , where Coke Zero is already up and running and doing good business .
The global Coca - Cola Company - which even when nothing much is happening manages to spend $ 2bn a year on marketing - is pushing the boat out .
This is the most important British launch since Diet Coke 22 years ago .
It 's a big deal , with noughts on .
Everyone is hugely excited .
Will Coke Zero make as big a splash as the launch in 2004 of the company 's ill - starred bottled water Dasani , which , it was belatedly discovered , came straight out of the tap and contained prohibited levels of bromate ?
Or the festival of schadenfreude surrounding the wretched failure of re-flavoured New Coke in 1985 , when 40,000 letters of complaint a week poured into Coca - Cola HQ , and big - screen commercials were openly booed at baseball matches ?
The trouble with the kind of media coverage money can't buy is the difficulty of turning it off when you 've had enough .
The World of Coca - Cola museum in Atlanta , Georgia - birthplace of Coca - Cola and home to its current headquarters - is a monument to things going better .
Affable archives director Phil Mooney is showing me round .
He says people come here expecting to see antiquated cogs and pulleys and assembly lines , but there 's none of that .
The showcases around us are devoted largely to advertising artwork , designs , old correspondence , sponsorship paraphernalia and merchandising items that eBay would call ' collectables ' .
What most people do n't realise is that for all the vast industrial panoply of Coke 's operation - the busy factories , the Niagara of product , the billions of bottles and cans and crates and multipacks , the fleets of liveried trucks and vans , the display coolers and dispensing taps and vending machines and paper cups - the Coca - Cola Company itself manufactures nothing but syrup .
Everything else , Phil explains , is down to Coke 's franchise ' partners ' worldwide - the bottling plants .
Whoever decided to cut in the middleman during the early 1900s did so for sound financial reasons - they did n't have the money to build factories .
Today , that decision looks like a licence to print money .
But how can Coca - Cola guarantee that its ' partners ' are not watering down the syrup too much ?
Or that they 're not going to print the logo upside down ?
Phil laughs .
' We 're giving the world 's most valuable trademark to a partner and saying , " We 're relying on you to deliver . "
No one wants to lose that .'
We wander around the exhibits .
Phil tells me about John Pemberton , the small - time pharmacist who invented Coca - Cola in 1886 , selling the cocaine - laced beverage as a remedy for depression , hysteria and anxiety .
In his first year , Pemberton spent $ 78 on advertising and earned $ 50 .
It was his successors who finished the job .
Phil points to the face of a coquettish young woman from the silent era , looking out from a tea tray , a postcard , a book of sheet music .
' See how they used one image across a range of things just to get the message out there . '
Here now are the Coke calendars , the Coke barometers , lampshades and tea sets .
I 've never seen so many smiles under one roof .
Even during the war years , soldiers , sailors and factory girls were chasing away the blues with Coke .
' He 's Coming Home Tomorrow ' says one image - a GI 's apple - cheeked wife fetching a six - pack from the store .
There are laughing servicemen at a soda fountain ; a Norman Rockwell of a southern gent with girl , dog and Coke ; a beautiful nurse carrying bottles of Coke on a tray .
' It 's What They Want ' is the tagline .
It might easily have been : ' Hey , Who Needs Morphine ? '
Phil is telling me about the early bottlers - hundreds of horse - and - buggy operations - then about the need to patent the famous ' contour ' bottle , and the secret formula for Coke , which is locked in a bank vault a block from here .
The point is , I realise , we 're only seeing the marketing side of things because that 's the only side there is .
The history of Coca - Cola is the history of marketing .
It 's also the history of the American century , from soda fountains to the Atlanta Olympics and beyond .
A photograph from 1965 shows a line of Coke trucks crossing the Bosporus like liberating troops .
A Martian browsing here would marvel at Coca - Cola 's role in space flight .
He would surmise that , during the Sixties , black people were discovered living in America and enjoying it immensely .
Certainly he would assume that Coca - Cola was a force for good in the world .
Despite the glut of beverages here , I need a drink .
The World Cup has just started .
Out in the heat of the day , I am directed to Hooters , a vulgar but welcoming place where I order a cold beer and watch the second half of Germany versus Costa Rica .
Coca -Cola has a big piece of the World Cup , of course .
But then the measure of a brand 's success is precisely this sort of ubiquity .
Coca - Cola , the world 's most recognised brand , has long reached a point of saturation at which its signature in public spaces is omnipresent and yet as invisible as telegraph poles or people wearing shoes .
Like Costa Rica 's defence , Coca - Cola is all over the place .
The domination of high streets by multinational interests is viewed unsympathetically , and not just by people who throw dustbins through the windows of McDonald 's restaurants .
A 2006 poll of British consumers found that Coca - Cola was considered the sixth most unethical big brand .
The ' Boycott Coca - Cola ' campaign was prominent at this year 's Winter Olympics in Italy , undermining the company 's $ 66 m sponsorship .
We are encouraged to see global commerce as imperialism by other means , though in fact it is nothing new - at least not for Coca - Cola .
Writing in the New Yorker magazine as long ago as 1959 , EJ Kahn noted that overseas critics of the brand 's growth had come up with the term ' Coca - Colonialism ' .
He quotes a vice president of the company , who wrote in a memo to an associate : ' Apparently some of our friends overseas have difficulty distinguishing between the United States and Coca - Cola .
Perhaps we should not complain too much about this .'
Coca - Cola 's world tour has continued .
Indeed , elsewhere seems the only place to go .
There 's a dwindling market for fizzy drinks in the developed world ( in the UK , sales are down more than 5 per cent ) .
With 85 per cent of Coca - Cola 's profits made in the fizzy sector ( the other 15 is from juice drinks and water ) , developing countries in particular are openly targeted , raising the hackles of critics who question the morality of creating a demand for fizzy drinks in poor countries .
Globalisation is one thing , but Coca - Cola has not been helped by concerns over obesity - tarred and feathered alongside McDonald 's in Eric Schlosser 's bestselling 2001 Fast Food Nation and Morgan Spurlock 's 2004 movie Super Size Me , and buffeted by perennial health scares over aspartame , the sweetener used in Diet Coke .
Then there 's the ongoing story about the Indian farmers who complained that the local Coca - Cola plant was exhausting water supplies .
Last year , the Today programme ran a story about a Mexican shopkeeper who was suing Coke because the local bully - boy distributor would n't let her keep a rival drink in her promotional Coca - Cola fridge .
The worst horror , though , involved the murders of union officials at a bottling plant in Colombia - allegedly with Coca - Cola 's connivance .
Successive legal inquiries have cleared Coca - Cola and its associates of all involvement in the latter - though not before US college students started a website ( www.killercoke.org) outlining the company 's perfidy , detailing operations in Colombia and India in particular .
Within weeks , college campuses nationwide were boycotting the company 's products .
Coca -Cola is the sort of company with rebuttal procedures in place , and it issues a report each year detailing its good work in labour relations , environmental issues and community initiatives .
But mud sticks .
More people , for example , will have read headlines about the Italian study last year suggesting links between aspartame and cancer in rats than the European Food Safety Authority 's ( EFSA ) response to it last month , concluding that , on the contrary , there is in fact no link between aspartame and cancer in rats .
But all is cheer when I meet Dr Kelly Sepcic , who heads the flavour research team at Coke HQ .
She talks of ' creative tasting ' and ' improved mouthfeel ' .
She wo n't be drawn on the worst - ever drink she has invented in her 12 years here , but she is passionate about Coke Zero .
' It 's as close to regular Coke as we could get , ' she says .
We crack open some cans .
It does taste like Coke , though I 'm no judge .
Maybe this was what they were after when they invented Diet Coke , I suggest .
' Maybe , ' she says .
So why not launch it as New Diet Coke ?
Am I kidding ?
People love Diet Coke .
Well , not everyone .
Which is why this one is aimed at men .
The marketing teams are already calling it Bloke Coke .
It 's for younger guys who are starting to get calorie conscious but refuse to drink Diet Coke in case their mates think they 're a wuss .
' I drink Diet Coke , ' I say .
In the long pause that follows I ask about aspartame .
Were n't they rattled by the recent Italian study ?
Were n't they relieved to get the all - clear from the EFSA ?
Dr Sepcic shrugs .
' We have total confidence in aspartame .
It 's had more studies carried out on it than any ingredient in the food - supply chain .
Everything we use has been tested for consumption in 200 countries . '
And yet it keeps coming back , I say .
' Coca - Cola sells two things .
Products and newspapers .
We 're an easy target .
A big story .'
Later we meet Marc Mathieu , Coke 's vice president in charge of global brands .
' You see , we are really expanding our offering to cover the totality of the need states , ' he says .
' Some people drink to complement their food , some to cover wellness concerns they may have .
The question is : how do you complement the variety of need states under the one trademark - Coke ?'
I 've no idea .
I 'm still wondering what a ' need state ' might be .
Marc is ardent about the ' footprint ' of the brand , comparing it with , say , BMW , which can fulfil all of our needs under one marque - the sedan , the SUV , the sports model , a family station wagon , something for the office , bigger or smaller engines , male , female .
' They serve all the needs - enable people to keep their loyalty to a brand .
That 's what we 're trying to do with Coke . '
I suggest that maybe this flowery , bright optimism is just slightly out of kilter with the times .
And the global thing - has the image of Coca - Cola not suffered from flying the flag too high for America ?
' Whether we like it or not , we are the leader and we have a point of view .
Coke has become a symbol of America because it has embodied a lot of the American dream .
But when people buy a Coke , they are not buying just a fizzy drink , they 're buying into a vision of world citizenship .
Coke stands for much more than a refreshing beverage .
It stands for an ideal : people feel Coke is part of their lives .
It belongs to them .
It accompanies them in their moments of joy , their moments of pleasure , their moments of connection with other people . '
I nod .
We agree that Marc should maybe show me some amusing ads on his laptop .
Back on the ground a week later , in Hammersmith , London , the British Coca - Cola team is counting down to what they are calling Zero Hour .
The launch starts after the World Cup , but the Spar in Colchester has already sold the first can in Britain .
' Last Sunday , five minutes after midnight , ' says marketing director , Cathryn Sleight .
' A bit like Harry Potter , ' I say .
' Exactly ! '
It 's been frantic but totally exhilarating .
And a privilege , Cathryn says .
The response has been amazing - from the taste panellists , from the sales people , from Australia .
There 's such belief .
Some retailers have been sending their own lorries out to collect stock from the factory !
' It 's unknown , ' Cathryn says .
' Coke Zero could be as big as Diet Coke in 10 years ' time . '
' Is that your target ? ' I ask .
She has a serious pause .
' I 'd say it was a vision .
Here , we talk about the completion of the trilogy - Coke , Diet Coke , Zero . '
So no plans for a fourth ?
She shakes her head .
' I do n't think so . '
That 's what they said about Star Wars , I say .
Cathryn moves on to ' need states ' , which I now dimly understand to mean that people are more likely to be in the mood for a cup of tea with their mid-morning flapjack rather than , say , a bottle of Jack Daniel's .
Needless to say , it 's not quite as simple as that .
Coca - Cola 's research army has identified a whole list of ' need states ' , which include ' comfort and relaxation ' , ' action replenishment ' , ' food enhancement ' , ' mental renewal ' ...
Are people ever just thirsty , I ask .
Yes , she says .
Anyway , they 've had 3,600 people keeping drink diaries , and have come up with 40,000 different ' occasions ' when only this drink or that will do .
' It 's a great way of connecting with our consumers , ' she says .
Hilary Langan , marketing manager for Diet Coke , is talking now about the cast of thousands behind the launch - the ' flavour people ' , R&D , the ' ground teams ' , outside agencies for PR , ads and graphics .
She explains how Coke Zero's black tins and bottles which feature the silvery ' urban icons ' of dice and girls ' legs will appeal to their profile male - ie , someone of about 25 with the world at his feet , no mortgage , first job , who is just becoming health conscious .
' These are young guys who are maybe reducing their consumption of Coke , but not connecting with Diet Coke .
For them , Coke Zero is very male , no sugar - but with the great taste of Coke !'
They call their profile male Dan .
The TV ad for British Dans is still being shot , but we sit and watch the Australian one , which features a man shouting on a bus .
Blimey .
Can he really just be talking about a fizzy drink ?
' Yes , that 's a bit too Australian for us , ' Hilary says , but the core message will be the same with ours - ' Great things in life made a little bit better ' .
Then there 'll be huge outdoor ads and lots of presence online , as well as Swat teams hitting the streets , jumping out of vans , giving stuff away and targeting sports events , big music shows , parks .
No one is safe .
' In four weeks we 'll have sampled four million consumers , ' Hilary says .
' It will be unmissable . '
' So you 're not just going up against Pepsi Max ? '
I say .
There 's a blank look here .
Pepsi who ?
No , says Cathryn .
' It 's about breadth of choice and customer opportunities and need states .
It 's about anticipating consumer needs . '
But has n't Pepsi already anticipated that one ?
They 've already got two diet colas .
No , no , Cathryn insists .
It 's much broader than that .
Cola wars are something drummed up by the media .
By now I am suffering from enthusiasm fatigue .
But a few days later , at Liverpool Street station , I find myself approaching a team of young people handing out mini-cans of ... yes , Pepsi Max !
I notice no one leaps out to offer me one .
Am I a victim of age profiling ?
Or are they just a figment of my imagination ?
Sometimes you just do n't know what to believe .
When robots go wild
July 5 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Well , not really wild but a little cranky .
Wired has a fascinating piece about Robotarium X , a robot zoo in Portugal and the first zoo dedicated to artificial life .
This interests me from a complexity perspective – 45 different robots ( or animals ) inhabit the same vivid yellow 4 m high glass and steel cage and self - organise .
They adapt to their environment and simulate nature and evolution .
Far from living in harmony , the robots are showing signs of aggressive behaviour .
The robots belong to two different ‘ classes ’ – the ‘ solar bots ’ , which are small , peace loving robots who seek sunlight and power themselves by photovoltaic energy ; and the larger ‘ electrical bots ’ , which are powered by cable , perform for the audience and cannot detect the solar bots .
Within the two classes , there are fourteen distinct species and all the robots are autonomous and have wheels , legs or the capability to slither .
Of all different designs , some of the bots are hairy , some have horns , others have sensors .
I ’m not sure why but Cursovigilo reminds me of Tyrannosaurus Rex – probably because Cursovigilo is the vigilant of the cage and looks a bit like T - Rex .
There are seven of these robots , which follow anyone that approaches the glass .
There have been some unfortunate run-ins .
The larger bots run over the smaller ones and cut off their tails so they are in a sense ‘ dead ’ and unable to function .
By sensing and detecting movement outside their cage , the nine larger bots like to follow and interact with visitors .
Spider - like bots move up and down the glass of the cage making threatening gestures ; whilst a flower - like bot opens its petals when it senses an audience of admirers looking at it .
The smaller bots ’ mission is to stay out of the way of the larger , more aggressive electrical robots , seek sunlight and avoid bumping into walls .
The designer of the robots , Leonel Moura , wants to move onto a larger installation , which he is calling Zoobotic and believes that robots will form a novel species in the future .
You can check out the robots on Moura ’s site – some are quite cute , some look like mice , others have long thin tails , Moura seems to have created the zoo as a work of art as well as a scientific experiment .
You can watch a video of Robotarium X on YouTube – fascinating if not a little creepy .
And go to Moura ’s site to see some photos of the little critters , including Cursovigilo – putting the photos on my blog caused it to crash !

Lenny Bruce ( born Leonard Alfred Schneider ) introduced a strongly satirical , taboo - breaking form of comedy during the 1950s and 1960s , which paved the way for some of America ’s great comedians — Richard Pryor , George Carlin , Chris Rock , even John Stewart .
And for ushering in this new era of comedy , Bruce paid a heavy personal price .
In 1961 , San Francisco authorities arrested Bruce on obscenity charges .
Then , in 1964 , Bruce found himself in the crosshairs of Manhattan ’s District Attorney , Frank Horgan .
A six month trial followed , which raised important First Amendment issues , and which also brought Woody Allen , Bob Dylan , Allen Ginsberg , Norman Mailer , and William Styron to Bruce ’s defense .
( Dylan would later write a song about the affair . )
But , regardless , the trial ended badly for Bruce , and , two years later , the impoverished comedian would die of a heroin overdose .
For Bruce ’s legacy , things have gotten a little better .
In 2003 , Governor George Pataki granted New York ’s first posthumous pardon to the satirist , calling it “ a declaration of New York ’s commitment to upholding the First Amendment . ”
Meanwhile , legal scholars have written books that paint Bruce and his First Amendment battles in a rather sympathetic light .
Below you can find a video clip of Lenny Bruce appearing on the very popular Steve Allen Show .
It gives you a pretty good look at the brand of comedy that Bruce presented to the wider nation .
( You can access Part II of the video here . )
Beyond this , you may also want to check out the actual FBI file that was kept on Bruce .
It ’s been published thanks to the Freedom of Information Act .
And if you ’re up for more video footage , here is a clearly deflated Bruce using his trial as fodder for comedy .
EARLY science is a lot like stamp collecting .
In any new field of endeavour , the first priority is to gather lots of specimens .
In planetary science the result is a menagerie of exotic new worlds , some 236 of which were this week confirmed as exoplanets — that is , planets outside the solar system .
Over the past few days members of the American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu have also been tussling over whether the first Earth - like planet , announced at the end of April , has actually been found .
The rate of progress is extraordinary .
The first exoplanet orbiting a normal star was discovered a mere 12 years ago .
Before that , the answer to the rhetorical question “ are we alone ? ” , might quite possibly have been “ yes ” .
Exoplanets were the stuff of science fiction .
Now the hunt is well and truly on for places that are capable of sustaining life , and in some ways the speculations of the sci - fi writers have been far outstripped by reality .
The main rivals in the exoplanet race are a team led by Geoff Marcy of the University of California , Berkeley , and another led by Michel Mayor of the University of Geneva .
Overall , the Americans have detected more planets , clocking them up at an impressive rate of three a month for the past year .
But the Swiss have had some notable triumphs .
Indeed , it was they who started the whole thing off 12 years ago .
It was also they who announced the Earth - like planet — meaning , in this context , that they think it is both rocky and capable of harbouring liquid water .
If their interpretation is confirmed , it would be a real coup .
For , as the meeting heard , bagging exoplanets is a game with a natural bias that tends to yield exactly the opposite of Earth - like planets .
Spatial prejudice
The reasons for this bias are varied , but they have a common underlying cause .
Compared with the stars they orbit , exoplanets are faint and difficult to spot directly .
Hence astronomers mostly infer their existence by looking for their effects .
The first type of bias is that the stars which reveal their planets most readily are smaller than the sun .
The commonest way of finding a planet is to look for a star that wobbles .
The most probable cause of such wobbles is that the star in question has a planet or two tugging at it .
Such playground altercations are most readily noticed when a star is small .
Though the sun is not a particularly large star , the wobble - detecting technique works best with stars that are even smaller .
The second source of bias is the opposite of the small - star effect .
Large planets create more wobble than small ones do .
By “ large ” , planet hunters mean not just bigger than the Earth , but bigger than Jupiter , which is 318 times more massive than Earth .
That is very big indeed .
The third cause of bias is that easily detected planets tend to be close to their stars .
This is partly because the closer they are , the more wobble they induce , and partly because , to be certain that they are looking at a new exoplanet , planet hunters want to see two complete orbits .
A planet 's orbital period depends on its distance from its star .
Jupiter , for example , takes 12 years to orbit the sun and would thus require the best part of a quarter of a century to be detected to an astronomer 's satisfaction .
There is also a fourth cause of bias , although it favours stars that are like the sun , at least in age ( the sun is about 4.5 billion years old ) .
Like a teenager , an adolescent star — one that is a mere billion years or so old — is volatile .
It spits fire that prevents astronomers from making observations of what is happening around it .
Researchers therefore concentrate their efforts on seeing the offspring of calmer , more sedate stars that are that little bit older .
This explains why red dwarfs are popular terrain for planet hunters .
They are smaller than the sun ( typically weighing between a tenth and a half of its mass ) and , because they burn at lower temperatures , they last a long time and are often very old .
Unfortunately for those seeking little green men , their coolness means that their “ habitable zones ” ( where the temperature is right for liquid water to exist ) are much nearer to the star than the Earth is to the sun .
And that , in turn , means planets in this region are likely to be tidally locked , as the moon is to the Earth , and show the same face to the star at all times .
This makes it hard for a planet to develop an atmosphere .
The upshot is that almost all of the worlds found so far are hot , mammoth orbs that rapidly revolve around stars smaller and darker than the sun .
They are thus quite unlike the planets of the solar system — and only one of those , namely Earth , is known to be hospitable to life .
Collector 's items
Planetary taxonomy is straining to accommodate the new worlds .
The distinction between different types of planet has already been broadened so that the solar system is now thought to contain three , rather than two , types .
The innermost — Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars — are rocky .
Then come the gas giants , Jupiter and Saturn .
Uranus and Neptune are also gas giants , in that they have no visible solid surface , but they now tend to be classified as a subgroup of “ ice giants ” that contain water in its solid form .
Small , icy objects such as Pluto are no longer regarded as planets , but in any case , they would be undetectable around another star .
Most of the exoplanets detected to date are gas giants .
Many are far more massive than Jupiter ( see chart ) .
Then there is a question of whether particularly massive planets are really stars that failed to ignite .
One school of thought says that if an exoplanet has a mass more than 13 times that of Jupiter , it is not a real planet , but rather a brown dwarf .
That is because it is capable , in theory , of sustaining the nuclear fusion which would transform it into a star .
If so , then some of the most massive exoplanets found to date might better be classified as failed stars .
One of the most interesting taxonomic discoveries so far was announced two weeks ago by Michael Gillon , a member of the Swiss team who works at Liège University in Belgium .
Dr Gillon was looking at an exoplanet circling a red dwarf called Gliese 436 .
This had been found by the American team using the stellar - wobble method .
However , Dr Gillon suspected that , viewed from Earth , this planet 's orbit might cross the disc of its parent star , a phenomenon known as transiting .
Transits of exoplanets are rare .
Even among those that tightly circle their parent star , only 10 % would be expected to transit in the Earth 's line of sight .
For those that orbit their stars at the distance of the Earth from the sun , that figure falls to less than 1 % .
Dr Gillon , however , was fortunate .
The planet in question is closer to its star than Mercury is to the sun — and it fell within the lucky 10 % .
By measuring the resultant dip in Gliese 436's light , Dr Gillon was able to calculate the exoplanet 's diameter .
Knowing both its size and its mass , he was then able to calculate its density , and thus make a plausible guess about its composition .
The orb in question would appear to be made , in part , of ice .
That would classify it as an ice giant somewhat similar to Neptune .
It probably has a rocky core surrounded by water and this water may — physicists are unsure about the behaviour of water in such extreme conditions — be in the form of hot ice .
The pressure of being at the centre of a planet would , in other words , have compensated for the temperature caused by being so close to a star .
It is the rocky planets , though , that excite most public interest .
The one that the Swiss team thinks it has discovered is in orbit around a star called Gliese 581 , some 20 light years from Earth .
Unfortunately , astronomers do not yet know if its orbit transits Gliese 581's disc , as viewed from Earth .
This means it may be impossible to discover its composition in the way that Dr Gillon did with the planet of Gliese 436 .
The team think it is rocky because it weighs only five times as much as Earth — too little for a gas giant .
The exoplanet may also lie in the habitable zone of the red dwarf that it orbits .
Detecting more such rocky exoplanets is the aim of a European spacecraft called COROT that was launched in December 2006 .
It is searching for exoplanets that transit their parent stars , as seen from 900 km above Earth .
The mission 's designers believe that the camera aboard COROT is sensitive enough to detect not merely transiting gas giants , but also rocky planets that are the size of Earth .
The spacecraft is also probing the interiors of stars by studying starquakes on their surfaces — in much the same way that geologists learn about the Earth 's interior by studying earthquakes .
Astroseismology , as this science is known , may allow astronomers to get a better idea of the ages of stars that are found to host exoplanets .
Given that exoplanets are thought to be formed soon after the birth of a star ( see article ) , knowing the age of the parent would date the offspring , too .
America 's space agency , NASA , also has plans to launch a dedicated rocky - planet hunter .
The Kepler mission is similar to COROT , but will be more sensitive .
Moreover , it will be placed in an orbit better suited to locating its quarry .
The European mission is hampered by its low orbit : the Earth , the moon and the sun periodically obscure its view .
Kepler will not suffer that indignity , because it will be placed in orbit around the sun , trailing behind the Earth .
If all goes well , the spacecraft should be launched early in 2009 .
Whether the rocky exoplanets bagged by these missions are able to support life will depend on whether they have atmospheres .
Detecting such ethereal breaths has only just come within the grasp of mankind .
Earlier this year two space - based telescopes , Hubble and Spitzer , were both used to probe exoplanet atmospheres .
Hubble saw how the upper atmosphere of a scorched gas giant closely orbiting its parent star was bleeding into space .
Spitzer , meanwhile , found a surprising lack of water in the atmospheres of two other gas giants .
To examine an alien planet 's atmosphere , the planet concerned must transit its parent star in the line of sight from Earth .
Starlight contains the signatures of the chemical elements that compose a star .
When an exoplanet passes in front of that star , its atmosphere adds further chemical signatures .
By subtracting the signals from the star from those of the combined system , it is possible to identify which gases are present in the planet 's atmosphere .
Without an atmosphere , all water on Earth would be frozen .
Whether there could be life on the Swiss team 's rocky planet depends very much on whether it has an atmosphere beneath which water could exist in its liquid form .
Some calculations suggest this is unlikely , and that any water on the planet would be steam .
A rocky future
Two further missions are planned to search for signs of life in the new haul of rocky planets that is expected to be found in the coming months and years .
America 's Terrestrial Planet Finder and Europe 's Darwin are still on the drawing board , but astronomers would like to use them to identify “ biomarkers ” such as oxygen in the atmospheres of exoplanets .
To inform this work , Lisa Kaltenegger of Harvard University and her colleagues have been assessing what the Earth 's atmosphere would have looked like over the past 4.5 billion years .
The idea is that planet hunters will be able to spot planets that have the potential to develop life , even if life does not yet exist there .
The researchers assume that 60 % of the Earth 's surface was shrouded by cloud at any given time in its history .
Throughout that history , about 70 % of the surface has been covered by oceans and 30 % by land .
Initially , the land was mostly rock and ice .
This slowly altered to today 's picture as vegetation emerged .
Some 30 % of the land is now covered by grass and another 30 % by trees .
Naked rock accounts for 18 % , snow covers 15 % and sand another 7 % .
By tracing the way they think life developed on Earth against this background , Dr Kaltenegger and her colleagues have come up with a model of how the composition of the planet 's atmosphere ebbed and flowed with the rise of various classes of organism .
They reckon it has always contained a lot of nitrogen , but that early carbon dioxide was mopped up by the formation of limestone while methane levels rose as a result of the exhalations of a group of bugs — then common , now rare — called methanogens .
Eventually , photosynthesis arrived in the form of cyanobacteria .
Their exhalations , oxygen , did for both methanogens and methane and created an atmosphere similar to the one that exists now .
The main upshot is that although oxygen is unquestionably a biomarker ( it is so reactive that it would vanish from any atmosphere unless constantly replenished ) methane may be one , too .
Which is awkward , as methane is found in atmospheres , such as that of Saturn 's moon Titan , where life is not thought to be present .
Another biomarker might be a planet 's colour .
Chlorophyll , the chemical that controls photosynthesis , is green for a reason .
It is tuned to the spectrum of the sun in order to absorb sunlight in the most efficient way possible .
The reflected green is the light it rejects .
That calculation could be made for any star , and the best colour for a chlorophyll equivalent worked out .
Perhaps if the exoplanet under investigation were orbiting a dwarf star , the little green men— or , at least the vegetation they eat — might turn out to be orange .
But Dr. Bea , an author of a blistering 2006 report on the levee failures paid for by the National Science Foundation , said erosion furrows , or rills , suggest that “ the risks are still high . ”
Heavy storms , he said , may cause “ tear - on - the - dotted - line levees . ”
Dr. Bea examined the hurricane protection system at the request of National Geographic magazine , which is publishing photographs of the levee and an article on his concerns about the levee and other spots on its
Web site at ngm.com / levees .
Corps officials argue that Dr. Bea is overstating the risk and say that they will reinspect elements of the levee system he has identified and fix problems they find .
The disagreement underscores the difficulty of evaluating risk in hurricane protection here , where even dirt is a contentious issue .
And discussing safety in a region still struggling with a 2005 disaster requires delicacy .
Hurricane season begins again next month .
The most revealing of the photographs , taken from a helicopter , looks out from the levee across the navigation canal and a skinny strip of land to the expanses of Lake Borgne .
From the grassy crown of the levee , small , wormy patterns of rills carved by rain make their way down the landward side , widening at the base into broad fissures that extend beyond the border of the grass .
Dr. Bea , who was recently appointed to an expert committee for plaintiffs ’ lawyers in federal suits against the government and private contractors over Hurricane Katrina losses , said that he could not be certain the situation was dangerous without further inspection and that he wanted to avoid what he called “ cry wolf syndrome . ”
But , he added , he does not want to ignore “ potentially important early warning signs . ”

Critics : HISD slow to act on ' Ghetto Handbook ' ' Ghetto ' booklet probed by HISD
Some ask why it took 3 months to investigate the item distributed by district officer
A crudely made " Ghetto Handbook " distributed by a Houston school district police officer sparked angry words Thursday from leaders in the district and the community — both because of its language and the fact that no action was taken for three months .
" This publication was completely reprehensible and HISD condemns it in the strongest possible terms , " Superintendent Abelardo Saavedra said in a written statement .
But some also questioned why it took so long for district officials to learn about the booklet and begin investigating .
The officer who first handed it out in May was suspended with pay this week , pending results of an investigation by the Houston Independent School District .
Officials refused to identify him but said he was ordered to go to diversity training .
The eight - page handout , which includes a few grainy photographs , purports to offer definitions that will enable the reader to speak Ebonics " as if you just came out of the hood . "
Ebonics is a nonstandard variety of English spoken by some black Americans .
The definitions include such terms as " foty : a 40 - ounce bottle of beer " ; " aks : to ask a question " ; and " hoodrat : scummy girl . "
The booklet — subtitled " Wucha dun did now ? " — names six HISD officers " and the entire day shift patrol " as contributors .
District spokesman Terry Abbott said , however , that a preliminary investigation has cleared those officers of involvement .
The officers did not respond to the Houston Chronicle 's e-mails seeking comment .
The booklet originally was handed out at a May 23 roll call at Barnett Stadium , Abbott said .
He said up to 15 dayshift officers and three supervisors attend the meetings .
One of the supervisors immediately collected the booklets , Abbott said .
But HISD leaders said they did n't learn about the incident until an oral complaint was made to the district 's Equal Employment Opportunity Office on Aug. 13 .
It was not clear who filed the complaint , and district officials did not have an explanation for the delay in their learning about the incident .
Abbott said HISD Police Chief Charles Wiley " is not doing any interviews because of the fact that it's an ongoing investigation . "
Saavedra expressed regret about the incident and said he has " mounted a very aggressive investigation . "
School board President Manuel Rodriguez Jr. said , " I 'm completely surprised and overwhelmed that it took us so long to find out about it .
In today 's age and time , there should be no room for that type . "
As of last school year , nearly 30 percent of HISD 's 202,000 students were black and almost 60 percent were Hispanic .
Some community leaders expressed outrage .
" It does concern me , " said Kashmere High alumna Carolyn Miller , president of the HISD Council of PTAs .
" That 's quite unfortunate that an officer felt a need to do that . "
Carol Mims Galloway , president of Houston 's NAACP chapter and a candidate for the school board , said the officer who created the document should be severely reprimanded , if not fired .
" It was really a slap in the African - American community 's face , " she said , adding that she believes black students in the district already are being shortchanged academically .
" We 're paying their salaries with our tax dollars , " Galloway said of HISD police .
" It does reflect on the district . "
She also questioned whether a supervisor really collected all of the booklets .
HISD trustee Larry Marshall called the document totally inappropriate , even if it were printed as a joke .
" These are very racially sensitive times , " he said .
" It was a huge mistake in judgment . "
Houston activist Quanell X said he will ask today that Chief Wiley and anyone involved in the incident be reprimanded .
" What I 'm angry about is that the supervisor did not file the complaint himself , " he said .
" The HISD police chief should have done more immediately , once this racist literature was brought to his attention . "

The 4th season - Story of the one person library and " full stack " librarian .
Acceptance of the word , however , also reignites an old argument , one most forcefully made by Eve Ensler in “ The Vagina Monologues . ”
Over a decade ago , Ms. Ensler wrote that “ what we do n’t say becomes a secret , and secrets often create shame and fear and myths . ”
Vagina , her widely performed series of monologues declared , is too often an “ invisible word , ” one “ that stirs up anxiety , awkwardness , contempt and disgust . ”
Dr. Carol A. Livoti , a Manhattan obstetrician and gynecologist and an author of “ Vaginas : An Owner ’s Manual ” ( Thunder ’s Mouth Press , 2004 ) , said vajayjay and other euphemisms and slang offend her and can render women incapable of explaining their symptoms to health professionals .
“ I think it ’s terrible , ” Dr. Livoti said .
“ It ’s time to start calling anatomical organs by their anatomical name .
We should be proud of our bodies . ”
“ It seems like a step backward , ” she added .
In a voice - mail message left for a reporter , Gloria Steinem said she hopes the women using vajayjay are doing so because they think it is more descriptive than vagina , not because they are squeamish .
Technically speaking , the vagina is the canal that leads from the uterus to the outside of the body , a fact that has led both Ms. Ensler and Ms. Steinem to write that vagina — while not a word that should be stigmatized — is inadequate because it is not inclusive enough .
It does not , they have pointed out , include the labia and clitoris , the nerve - rich locus of a woman ’s sexual pleasure .
“ I ’m hoping that the use of this new word is part of the objection to only saying vagina since it does n’t include all of women ’s genitalia , for instance the clitoris , in the way that vulva does , ” Ms. Steinem said .
Another view was offered by John H. McWhorter , a linguist and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute , who pointed out that the women associated with introducing the word — Ms. Winfrey , the Miranda Bailey character on “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” — are middle - age African - Americans .
“ The economy is still strong , job growth is still healthy , the unemployment rate is low , and the global economy is booming , ” said Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at the brokerage firm Charles Schwab .
“ But there are cracks here and those cracks seem to be gaining more of the market ’s attention than the stronger components .
We ’ll have to see which one takes hold . ”
Early yesterday , President Bush and four of his top economic and financial officials went on the airwaves to try and dispel worries about the economy .
They cited a Commerce Department report that showed that the economy rebounded in the three months that ended in June ; it grew 3.4 percent , which was up from a pace of 0.6 percent in the first quarter .
“ And so I want the American people to take a good look at this economy of ours , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ The world is strong — the world economy is strong .
I happen to believe one of the main reasons why is because we remain strong . ”
While markets did bounce up briefly early in the day , investors found little solace in the latest economic report or the soothing words from Washington .
When trading ended , the S.& P. had fallen 1.6 percent , or 23.71 points , to 1,458.95 ; it is now up 2.9 percent for the year after having been up 9 percent last week .
The Dow fell 1.5 percent , to 13,265.47 , and is up 6.4 percent for the year , about half what it was a week ago .
And the Nasdaq composite index fell 37.10 points , or 1.4 percent , to 2,562.24 .
With several swings , the stock market resembled a roller coaster ride — though one that probably provided little amusement for many investors .
The Dow , for instance , swung 254 points from its high to the nadir at which it ended the day .
With a half - hour left in trading , it appeared that stocks would close only modestly down for the day before they plunged — the Dow dropped about 135 points in 25 minutes .
View Slideshow Trevor Paglen 's subjects are good at keeping secrets — and their distance :
Many miles of secure federal land frequently surround the off - limits military installations that he goes to great lengths to photograph .
To zoom in on them , Paglen — a photographer and geography buff — developed what he calls limit - telephotography .
It 's a hack based on astrophotography , a technique normally used to shoot distant planets .
" It 's much more difficult to take a picture of something on the ground than of something trillions of miles away , " he says .
Paglen modded the lens mount on his standard - issue Canon digital SLR to accept high - powered telescope lenses ranging in focal length from 1,300 mm to 7,000 mm ( a typical telephoto is about 300 mm ) .
To capture the heavens , such lenses peer through at least 5 miles of relatively dense atmosphere .
Aimed at terrestrial subjects , they magnify and distort the up to 65 miles of air , dust , and smog that hovers between camera and subject .
The resulting shots , some of which go on exhibit in July at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco , are hazy abstractions that expose a certain truth , yet leave everything to the imagination .

The legendary BitTorrent site Suprnova.org will be back in action soon .
Sloncek , the former owner of suprnova.org decided to donate the domain to The Pirate Bay lads , who will relaunch the site in a few days , staying true to its original design .
The return of a Legend .
The Pirate Bay crew has been working on this secret project for quite some time now .
Back in April they wrote a cryptic post on their blog announcing that something was coming .
In a response to this announcement TPB admin Brokep told TorrentFreak : “ The past , the present and the future .
It ’s all the same , but one thing ’s for sure , we will radiate for weeks ” , today it became clear that he was referring to the resurrection of Suprnova .
In a response to this breaking news , the former owner of Suprnova told Torrent Freak why he decided to donate the domain : “ The domain was doing nothing .
I know that domain has some nostalgic value and some people would be more then happy to see it back online .
I do n’t use it , and TPB is the only team that I know will use it correctly . ”
“ I will be involved in the community [ Forums ] on a separated domain ” , Sloncek said and added , “ The site has to look almost exactly like it looked before .
They can upgrade it , but they cannot change it appearance completely .
We further agreed that the site has to be community orientated ( not private ) . ”
Together with the relaunch of Suprnova , which will be a torrent indexer and not have it ’s own tracker , a new community will be launched that will be linked to both Suprnova and The Pirate Bay .
The forums will be hosted on SuprBay.org and are already up and running ( more or less ) .
We also talked to Brokep , one of The Pirate Bay administrators and asked him why they decided to revive Suprnova .
He told us : “ We talked it over and decided it was
something people would have use for , it would help the torrent community and it would also signal that if you shut one down it will get back up again . ”
Here ’s a preview of the updated Suprnova logo .
The new site is scheduled to go live this week !
For the people who are relatively new to BitTorrent , here ’s a brief history of Suprnova ( previously posted here ) .
The Rise of Suprnova .
Suprnova.org launched in the fall of 2002 .
At that time it was one of the few BitTorrent sites on the Internet .
Suprnova was founded by Andrej Preston , a Slovenian teenager better known as Sloncek .
Initially he wanted to name the site Supernova , but that name was already taken .
Suprnova.org started as a fun project , with a very primitive setup .
In fact , it was hosted on a linux box at Sloncek ’s home in the early days .
As soon as Suprnova was ready to go public , he started to advertise the site among friends and on IRC , and it slowly started to attract more and more visitors .
The word about the “ universal BitTorrent source ” spread like wildfire .
It was no surprise that it did n’t take long before the traffic generated by Suprnova was maxing out the meager 16 kb /s upload capacity .
The increased popularity of Suprnova came around the same time when other torrent sites like donkax.com , bytemonsoon.com and torrentse.cx , decided to quit .
These sites were more or less forced to go offline , either due to bandwidth constraints , or cease and desist letters .
But Suprnova made it very clear that it was n’t going anywhere .
Suprnova continued to grow , and Sloncek spent most of the time looking for mirrors , to guarantee that the site stayed in the air .
At it ’s top it indexed almost 60.000 torrents and about 1.5 million visitors per day .
Suprnova had a very active community , and its forum was among the biggest on the Internet .
The fall of Suprnova .
In November 2004 Suprnova ’s ISP told Sloncek that the servers were taken into custody by the Slovenian police .
The raid was initiated by the French anti-piracy lobby RetSpan .
The police never contacted Sloncek about this personally , but is was a sign that things were about to change .
Around the same time Reuters wrote about Sloncek in one of their articles , which soon after spread out to the Slovenian press .
This was the turning point for Sloncek .
He later said : “ So I ended up reading about myself in Slovenian newspapers .
And right about that time , I had a feeling something was wrong .
I do not really know what the feeling was or where it was coming from , but I decided it was time to take SuprNova.org offline . ”
Sloncek eventually pulled the plug December 19 , 2004 , which marked the end of an era .
October 18 , 2005 , almost a year after the servers were raided , Sloncek received a letter form the prosecutor stating that the charges against him were dropped .
This was a great relief , and he later said : “ This has been a huge pressure on me and I think it left some permanent marks on me .
I hope none of you will ever have to go through something like this . ”
Early 2006 Suprnova.org shortly resurrected as a P2P news site , but that project ended after a couple of months .
Islamabad 's political and judicial core has been sealed off
Musharraf defiant
He defended his actions in a national address , saying he was curbing a rise in extremism in Pakistan .
Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has been replaced and the Supreme Court surrounded by troops , who also entered state - run TV and radio stations .
The moves come as the Supreme Court was due to rule on the legality of Gen Musharraf 's October election victory .
The court was to decide whether Gen Musharraf was eligible to run for re-election last month while remaining army chief .
The BBC's Barbara Plett reports from Islamabad that fears had been growing in the government that the Supreme Court ruling could go against Gen Musharraf .
Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , who recently returned to the country after years of self - exile to lead her party in planned parliamentary elections , was in Dubai on a personal visit when news of the declaration broke .
However , she immediately flew back to Karachi where she condemned Gen Musharraf 's decision .
It is not clear whether the parliamentary elections due in January will go ahead .
Gen Musharraf made no mention of them in his speech , but he insisted he wanted to restore democracy .
Suicide warning
Pakistan has been engulfed in political upheaval in recent months , and the security forces have suffered a series of blows from pro-Taleban militants opposed to Gen Musharraf 's support for the US - led " war on terror " .
In a lengthy televised speech late on Saturday , Mr Musharraf said the situation had forced him into making " some very painful decisions " .
" I suspect that Pakistan 's sovereignty is in danger unless timely action is taken , " he said .
He insisted his decisions were made for the benefit of Pakistan .
" Extremists are roaming around freely in the country , and they are not scared of law - enforcement agencies , " the president said .
As well as defending emergency rule to the Pakistani people , Gen Musharraf also appealed directly to his Western allies for patience .
" Kindly understand the criticality of the situation in Pakistan and around Pakistan .
Pakistan is on the verge of destabilisation , " he said .
" Inaction at this moment is suicide for Pakistan and I cannot allow this country to commit suicide . "
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the declaration of emergency rule was " highly regrettable " and called upon Pakistan to have free and fair elections .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband also expressed concern , saying it was vital Pakistan 's government " abides by the commitment to hold free and fair elections on schedule " .
New chief justice
Gen Musharraf 's address echoed the text of the declaration of emergency rule , which opens with a reference to the " grave threat " posed by the " visible ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of terrorist attacks " .
Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan in response to the news
The political and judicial core of Islamabad has been shut down , but the rest of the city is functioning normally , our correspondent says .
She says it is clear from reading the emergency proclamation the main target is the judiciary which is accused of interfering in government policy and weakening the struggle against terrorism .
Chief Justice Chaudhry and eight other judges refused to endorse the emergency order , declaring it unconstitutional , resulting in Mr Chaudhry 's dismissal .
A new chief justice has been appointed , officials say .
He is Supreme Court judge Abdul Hameed Dogar , a supporter of Gen Musharraf who was a member of the special tribunal appointed to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Mr Chaudhry .
Ms Bhutto's return from self - imposed exile last month came about with the co-operation of Gen Musharraf .
Our correspondent says that in the changed circumstances she will have to decide whether she is returning to lead the opposition against the president , or should wait on the sidelines in the hopes of securing an agreement with him .
Moore accuses CNN of ' libel ' Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This A prominent documentarian is using new media to refute attacks leveled against him by the old media .
Michael Moore posted a lengthy critique of a CNN " Reality Check " that attacked his newest film SiCKO , which examines flaws in the US healthcare industry .
In a heated exchange with Situation Room host Wolf Blitzer -- the second part of which is set to air Tuesday at 7 p.m. --
Moore said the four - minute report , which aired immediately before his appearance , was " biased . "
On his Web site , Moore and the " SiCKO Truth Squad " refuted many of the findings in Dr. Sanjay Gupta 's reporting , which concluded that Moore " did fudge some facts " in the movie .
" This is libel , " the Web site says .
" There is not a single fact that is ' fudged ' in the film .
...
We expect CNN to correct their mistakes on the air and to apologize to their viewers . "
Moore 's
Web site also posted links to discussions of his appearance on prominent liberal blogs , including Crooks and Liars , Huffington Post and Brad Blog .
( Moore also linked to RAW STORY 's report on the appearance posted Monday . )
Rachel Sklar , writing at Huffington Post , said the clip is " spreading around the net like wildfire , " and Brad Blog 's Brad Friedman applauded Moore 's " dead on - target ass - whooping to the hapless Wolf Blitzer and friends . "
Gupta backs up Moore 's finding that the US healthcare system is No. 37 on the World Health Organization 's rankings of healthcare systems around the globe .
But Gupta encourages viewers to " hold on " before believing Cuba 's healthcare system is better after Moore takes people there to receive treatment because Cuba ranks lower than the US , coming in at No. 39 .
SiCKO shows the WHO list , including Cuba 's placement below the US , so Moore says he 's not trying to deceive anyone .
" The fact that the healthcare system in an impoverished nation crippled by our decades - old blockade ( including medical supplies and drugs ) ranks so closely to ours is more an indictment of the American system than the Cuban system , " Moore 's Web site says .
In his piece , Gupta says Moore is wrong in asserting the US spends $ 7,000 per person on healthcare compared to Cuba spending $ 25 per person , putting the figure for the US at $ 6,096 per person and Cuba 's spending at $ 229 per person .
Moore links to a study from the Department of Health and Human Services that projected health spending for 2006 at $ 7,092 per capita and $ 7,498 for 2007 .
" As for Cuba , " Moore 's site says , " Dr. Gupta and CNN need to watch ' SiCKO ' first before commenting on it .
' SiCKO ' says Cuba spends $ 251 per person on health care , not $ 25 , as Gupta reports .
And the BBC reports that Cuba 's per capita health expenditure is $ 251 ! "
And Gupta is wrong in asserting Americans live just slightly longer than Cubans , Moore says .
" Just the opposite , " the Web site says .
" The 2006 United Nations Human Development Report 's human development index states the life expectancy in the United States is 77.5 years .
It is 77.6 years in Cuba . "
The CNN report also cites the fact that Americans have shorter wait times than everyone but Germans for non-emergency treatment like hip replacements or knee repairs .
Moore says this " is n't the whole truth " and that for sick Adults waiting for a doctor 's appointment , only Canadians have longer wait times .
In New Zealand , 81 percent of patients got a same - or next - day appointment for a non-routine visit .
The comparable figures were 71 percent in Britain , 47 percent in the US and 36 percent in Canada , Moore says , citing a Business Week article .
Moore also refutes CNN 's airing of a health care analyst explaining that citizens in other countries pay higher taxes to fund the more expansive healthcare programs .
The movie " never claims that health care is provided absolutely for free in other countries , without tax contributions from citizens , " Moore points out along with the fact that " half of all bankruptcies in the United States are triggered by medical bills , " according to MSNBC .
The " truth squad " did not mention the conclusion Gupta reached in his report , that " there 's one ( fact ) everyone agree 's on :
The system here should be far better . "
About 25 years ago Symbolics and Lisp Machines spun off from the MIT AI lab .
MIT licensed the intelectual property around a machine known as the CADR , or MIT CADR , to these companies .
This was a landmark event in the history of open source .
This event made it clarified a lot of people ’s thinking , particularly Richard Stallman .
Licensing the CADR community ’s code to private interests shifted the incentives around that Lisp community .
In effect MIT transfered ownership of the community , which it did not own , to private interests .
Where previously the motivations for community member were intrinsic , social , and in the final analysis about common cause afterward the motivations were explicit , commercial , and foremost monetary .
The resulting boom and bust of the community was quite a ride ; and just short of fatal .
Again and again over the last 25 years various parties have made a run at getting the MIT intelectual property licencing office to relinquish the rights to the CADR , to move them into the commons .
At long last Brad Parker has succeed .
Go Brad !
Looking at the code from today ’s vantage point is kind of recreational .
Most of the files are from 1980 .
There is one file dated 1973 ; making it the oldest file , who ’s data seems accurate , on my machine .
Lisp machines instruction sets were sympathetic to the implementation of dynamically typed languages .
With support for ephemerial garbage collection , exception handling , dynamic binding , etc. etc .
The CADR was microcoded .
The sources include all the microcode .
The 1970s marked the acceptance that people would get their own computer with a big display and related software .
The code contains a complete window system .
While object oriented programming runs back at least as far as Simula circa 1968 ; it did n’t really begin to win the day over efficency until people found they were racing each other to see how fast they could build a window system .
We still see people searching for the right cut point between class system and primitive types .
It ’s interesting to see that the class system in the CADR appears to have treating all the types all the way down as first class instances .
But it looks like this code does n’t use multiple inheritance !
When MIT did this , the larger Lisp community had lots of branch offices , each with it ’s own dialect of Lisp .
Common Lisp the ANSI standard dialect that attempted to reduce that diversity and create some standard around which people could rendezvous came latter .
The elegance of the Common Lisp dialect , particularly the beauty of it ’s original specification , was an important part of what triggered my decision to switch over to Lisp .
The dialect of Lisp used for the CADR is interesting .
Consider this routine that returns a tree of cons cells representing the class hierarchy :
; Returns a tree whose leaves are instances of CLASS - CLASS ( DEFMETHOD ( CLASS - CLASS :CLASS-CLASS-HIERARCHY ) () ( CONS SELF ( COND ( ( EQ CLASS - SYMBOL ' OBJECT - CLASS ) NIL ) ( ( ENTITYP SUPERCLASS ) (< - SUPERCLASS ': CLASS-CLASS-HIERARCHY ) ) ( T ( MAPCAR ( FUNCTION ( LAMBDA ( X ) (
Methods were apparently invoked by the function “ < -" and named using symbols from the keywords package , i.e. :CLASS -CLASS-HIERARCHY .
In common lisp methods are simply functions so where this code has (< - SUPERCLASS ': CLASS-CLASS-HIERARCHY ) in Common Lisp you ’d write ( CLASS - CLASS-HIERARCHY SUPERCLASS ) .
In that routine the object the method is working on is lexially bound to the variable SELF as it ’s fields ( or slots ) of the class instance .
That kind of syntatic sugar has fallen out of favor .
These days you ’d have to explicitly bind those .
I wonder about the quote on ': CLASS - CLASS-HIERARCHY ; was it already vestigial ?
The sources include some amusing litter .
At the time in the MIT used a networking design known as Chaosnet ; a variant of Ethernet .
Apparently the physical address of hosts on that net were selected so they revealed the machine ’s physical location along the cable .
Sort of how many nanoseconds your machine is from the terminator on the cable .
I ’d totally forgotten how fickle those early networks were .
I actually doubt that history would have unfolded very differently if MIT had relinquished the license back in 1980 rather than in 2005 ; but it ’s a debatable point .
Update : John Wiseman write : “ I worry that the Lisp community ’s fascination with the past is mostly pathology at this point . ”
Absolutely true .
All tiny ethnic enclaves have that problem .
Members of a diaspora can and ought to say such things .
Outsiders are best advised to mind their own business .
My former roommate Eric inspired this roundup ( and an overly dramatic round of gagging / hair - pulling / eye - gouging on my part ) by passing along a photo of this sign spotted on Marco Island , Florida — though it could have been anywhere on Main Street , USA .
( Note the small print at top , which reads : “ Signs sold in our gift shop . ” )
I think the only thing that could make this sign more irritating would be if it said — shudder — “ expresso . ”
This sign must be stopped !

Zawinul was renowned as one of the founders of jazz fusion
Zawinul , 75 , passed away at his home in Vienna .
Austrian media reports said he had been suffering from skin cancer .
The celebrated keyboardist enjoyed his biggest hit - the Grammy - winning Birdland - with Weather Report in 1977 .
Austrian President Heinz Fischer said Zawinul 's death meant the loss of a " music ambassador " who was known and cherished around the world .
" As a person and through his music , Joe Zawinul will remain unforgettable for us all , " the president said in a statement .
Born in Vienna , where he attended the Vienna Conservatory , Zawinul is credited with bringing the electric piano , as well as African and Middle Eastern rhythms , to mainstream jazz .
The artist emigrated to the United States in 1959 , where he played with jazz stars including Dinah Washington and saxophonist Cannonball Adderley .
Honorary grave
He went on to perform and record with the great Miles Davis on such chart - topping albums as In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew .
In the early 1970s , Zawinul founded Weather Report with saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bass player Miroslav Vitous .
Two years after the band split up , he launched the Zawinul Syndicate in 1987 .
A recent European tour celebrated the group 's 20th anniversary .
Zawinul was due to play at La Villette jazz festival in Paris this month , but was forced to cancel due to ill health .
The jazz star was married with three children .
Michael Haeupl , mayor of Vienna , said he would be given an honorary grave in the city .
Of all of the legal protections that we hold as American ideals and as examples to other nations as embodied in our Bill of Rights , the right of habeas corpus is the only civil liberty to be held so important by the Founders that it was included in the Constitution itself .
This week , the United States Senate voted to restrict that right of petition for grievance .
Such restriction was for enemy combatants held outside the United States , so why should any citizen care ?
Because a restriction on this fundamental right for some could mean restrictions for all of us down the line .
A right to challenge being held by the government for improper reasons is at the heart of our democracy -- where such right was established to secure our rights to liberty and freedom , and to stop imprisonment of opposition candidates for political reasons .
The right of habeas corpus is our firewall against the tyranny of the majority -- it dates back to the Magna Carta , which bound the king to the rule of law .
To threaten habeas corpus protections tears at the very fabric of rights in this nation .
Here is why : if you are arrested under false or bogus charges , or without any charge whatsoever as reason for your detainment , you have a right to petition a court to ask that the charges against you be detailed and justified under the laws of this country .
The state must justify its right to hold you under the law , or you must be set free -- they cannot hold you without just cause .
What the Senate is asking is that we simply trust that our government is doing the right thing , and that they are only holding guilty persons in our name , and that the military tribunals who have been holding hearings on detainments will adequately address all constitutional problems when many of these detainees have had difficulties in gaining access to legal counsel , and that all of this being done in the name of the United States should be considered acceptable when we afford one standard of justice to our citizens and a completely different standard of justice to those we deem not worthy of it simply because they are non-citizens held in our legal custody .
The Hamdi case gave the Supreme Court an opportunity to review habeas standards for detainees .
In his dissent , Justice Scalia stated " [ i ] f civil rights are to be curtailed during wartime , it must be done openly and democratically , as the Constitution requires ... " and went on to quote Alexander Hamilton from Federalist Number 8 :
" The violent destruction of life and property incident to war ; the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger , will compel nations the most attached to liberty , to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights .
To be more safe , they , at length , become willing to run the risk of being less free . "
" The Founders warned us about the risk , " Scalia noted in his Hamdi dissent , " and equipped us with a Constitution designed to deal with it .
" Many think it not only inevitable but entirely proper that liberty give way to security in times of national crisis ... " but , Scalia added , " that view has no place in the interpretation and application of a Constitution designed precisely to confront war and , in a manner that accords with democratic principles , to accommodate it . "
( Hat tip to Mark Marshall on this . )
As a result , even assuming that the relevant constitutional standard for a suspension of habeas corpus has been met , proposals to eliminate habeas review of enemy combatant classifications are premature .
In fact , it is not even clear that the courts would seek to extend such review to non-U.S. citizens held overseas .
The Supreme Court ruled that the writ was available to detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , largely because that territory is so completely controlled by the United States .
Moreover , to the extent that the Defense Department authorization amendment would effectively overrule that decision and eliminate habeas corpus review for individuals held at Guantanamo , it is unwise — legally and politically .
What the Senate did this week was to thumb its nose at the Founders and their vision of legal rights for all , regardless of the political expediency of the moment .
I rarely agree with Justice Scalia in philosophical terms , but in this particular matter , we see eye to eye .
And in this particular vote , the Senate is also thumbing its nose at the Supreme Court 's decision in Rasul v. Bush ( warning PDF ) , wherein the Court upheld the US statutory adherance in 18 USC 2441 to the Geneva Conventions and the Annex to the Hague Conventions
We join these international treaties for a reason .
In this particular case , these conventions and treaties provide protections for our men and women fighting overseas ( as one example ) , should they be taken prisoner , to ensure that they will not be tortured or treated badly .
They also establish clear ground rules for legal protections , for our citizens , as well as for citizens of other nations in our custody .
A lot of these principles were based on the rule of law as we practice it here in the United States -- or at least , as we practiced it at the time these treaties were negotiated .
The Constitution is not a document of convenience .
It is what we strive toward in this nation in terms of legal freedoms and rights , and to so blithely cast its principles aside for political expediency in the short term moment is shameful .
Further , our nation was founded on the principle that " all men are created equal . "
Each time we take a step away from that , we cheapen that ideal , and we trample on the sacrifices made by so many at the birth of this nation who paid dear with their lives so that their children , and their children 's children , might live in a nation that held up the idea of liberty and freedom from tyranny as a beacon to the whole of the world .
To say that an enemy combatant is less deserving of the protections afforded our citizens because he or she is not from this nation is morally wrong , let alone legally questionable under our treaty obligations .
To imprison a person for an indefinite period of time , with little to no legal recourse for determination as to whether or not that person has been lawfully held , undercutting any ability for oversight of the matter by a higher court , stands against everything this nation has fought for through the years -- and it cheapens those civil liberties that we have held out to other nations as better standards than their own .
We have lowered ourselves to the standards of nations we recently condemned for human rights violations , and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves for allowing this to happen .
This is not some casual decision to be made in haste , but one which must be well considered before taking any further step .
But do n't take my word for it , when even conservative legal scholars are saying that this is a bad idea .
Perhaps Lindsey Graham and his pals ought to take a second look at what they are proposing
This is a horrible precedent to set .
To say to the world that the principle of habeas corpus which began with the Magna Carta should only apply to some of the people under our jurisdiction is to set our selves up as the very tyrants we fought to overthrow at our Founding .
King George was n't a very good ruler back then , either .
For more excellent discussion on this issue , see Scotusblog and TalkLeft One further note :
It occurs to me that Karl Rove may be setting this up as yet another wedge issue .
I am reminded of his divisive speech wherein he stated that liberals wanted to give the 9/11 terrorists therapy and lawyers , and that the Republicans may be attempting to set this up as a " just more liberals arguing to give the terrorists lawyers " sort of argument .
To Karl and his pals , I say this :
If this is your plan , shame on you and every filthy little crony you get to go along with you .
The Constitution is not for your manipulation , and neither are the principles contained therein. :

MTV
News reports that the United States Department of Homeland Security has seized a hard drive containing the songs that Death Cab for Cutie guitarist and noted producer Chris Walla has been working on for his long - delayed solo album .
Walla said a courier was transporting the drive across the U.S. - Canada border when inspectors confiscated it and handed it over to Homeland Security 's computer - forensics division .
The Seattle - based musician said he is n't sure what the issue with his music is , but he did say the songs have a lot of political content .
Whatever the case , Walla is fortunate to have versions of the songs on tape , so he can finish them even if he never gets his hard drive back .
" Luckily , the tapes are Plan B , so while I 'm bummed about the whole thing , it could be a whole lot worse , " he told MTV .
" I still get to play music .
I mean , I 'm not at Guantánamo or anything like that .
I mean , my drive might be .

Let 's face it ; no one likes the interview process .
Well , certainly not the people being interviewed anyway .
You have to be on your best behavior , you only get one chance to get it right , and it 's like taking your driving test all over again .
Over the years I 've been to countless interviews .
To get my first job out of college I attended some 15 - 20 interviews a week .
Whether it was in Britain or over here in the States , the questions never really seemed to change from job to job .
Not only that , but the answers to them are usually the same , with your own personal interpretation of course .
Here I present 23 questions you 're likely to be asked , and how I have learned to answer them .
Why 23 ?
Because I had more than 20 and less than 25 .
Remember , being interviewed is a skill , and if you do the preparation you should ace it every time .
( See also : 12 Unique Ways to Score a Job Interview )
1 . So , tell me a little about yourself .
I 'd be very surprised if you have n't been asked this one at every interview .
It 's probably the most asked question because it sets the stage for the interview and it gets you talking .
Be careful not to give the interviewer your life story here .
You do n't need to explain everything from birth to present day .
Relevant facts about education , your career and your current life situation are fine .
2 . Why are you looking ( or why did you leave you last job ) ?
This should be a straightforward question to answer , but it can trip you up .
Presumably you are looking for a new job ( or any job ) because you want to advance your career and get a position that allows you to grow as a person and an employee .
It 's not a good idea to mention money here , it can make you sound mercenary .
And if you are in the unfortunate situation of having been downsized , stay positive and be as brief as possible about it .
If you were fired , you 'll need a good explanation .
But once again , stay positive .
3 . Tell me what you know about this company .
Do your homework before you go to any interview .
Whether it 's being the VP of marketing or the mailroom clerk , you should know about the company or business you 're going to work for .
Has this company been in the news lately ?
Who are the people in the company you should know about ?
Do the background work , it will make you stand out as someone who comes prepared , and is genuinely interested in the company and the job .
4 . Why do you want to work at X Company ?
This should be directly related to the last question .
Any research you 've done on the company should have led you to the conclusion that you 'd want to work there .
After all , you 're at the interview , right ?
Put some thought into this answer before you have your interview , mention your career goals and highlight forward - thinking goals and career plans .
5 . What relevant experience do you have ?
Hopefully if you 're applying for this position you have bags of related experience , and if that 's the case you should mention it all .
But if you 're switching careers or trying something a little different , your experience may initially not look like it 's matching up .
That 's when you need a little honest creativity to match the experiences required with the ones you have .
People skills are people skills after all , you just need to show how customer service skills can apply to internal management positions , and so on .
6 . If your previous co-workers were here , what would they say about you ?
Ok , this is not the time for full disclosure .
If some people from your past are going to say you 're a boring A - hole , you do n't need to bring that up .
Stay positive , always , and maybe have a few specific quotes in mind .
" They 'd say I was a hard worker " or even better " John Doe has always said I was the most reliable , creative problem - solver he'd ever met . "
7 . Have you done anything to further your experience ?
This could include anything from night classes to hobbies and sports .
If it 's related , it 's worth mentioning .
Obviously anything to do with further education is great , but maybe you 're spending time on a home improvement project to work on skills such as self - sufficiency , time management and motivation .
8 . Where else have you applied ?
This is a good way to hint that you 're in demand , without sounding like you 're whoring yourself all over town .
So , be honest and mention a few other companies but do n't go into detail .
The fact that you 're seriously looking and keeping your options open is what the interviewer is driving at .
9 . How are you when you 're working under pressure ?
Once again , there are a few ways to answer this but they should all be positive .
You may work well under pressure , you may thrive under pressure , and you may actually prefer working under pressure .
If you say you crumble like aged blue cheese , this is not going to help you get your foot in the door .
10 .
What motivates you to do a good job ?
The answer to this one is not money , even if it is .
You should be motivated by life 's noble pursuits .
You want recognition for a job well done .
You want to become better at your job .
You want to help others or be a leader in your field .
11 . What 's your greatest strength ?
This is your chance to shine .
You 're being asked to explain why you are a great employee , so do n't hold back and stay do stay positive .
You could be someone who thrives under pressure , a great motivator , an amazing problem solver or someone with extraordinary attention to detail .
If your greatest strength , however , is to drink anyone under the table or get a top score on Mario Kart , keep it to yourself .
The interviewer is looking for work - related strengths .
12 . What 's your biggest weakness ?
If you 're completely honest , you may be kicking yourself in the butt .
If you say you do n't have one , you 're obviously lying .
This is a horrible question and one that politicians have become masters at answering .
They say things like " I 'm perhaps too committed to my work and do n't spend enough time with my family . "
Oh , there 's a fireable offense .
I 've even heard " I think I 'm too good at my job , it can often make people jealous . "
Please , let 's keep our feet on the ground .
If you 're asked this question , give a small , work - related flaw that you 're working hard to improve .
Example : " I 've been told I occasionally focus on details and miss the bigger picture , so I 've been spending time laying out the complete project every day to see my overall progress . "
13 . Let 's talk about salary .
What are you looking for ?
Run for cover !
This is one tricky game to play in an interview .
Even if you know the salary range for the job , if you answer first you 're already showing all your cards .
You want as much as possible , the employer wants you for as little as you 're willing to take .
Before you apply , take a look at salary.com for a good idea of what someone with your specific experience should be paid .
You may want to say , " well , that 's something I 've thought long and hard about and I think someone with my experience should get between X & Y . "
Or , you could be sly and say , " right now , I 'm more interested in talking more about what the position can offer my career . "
That could at least buy you a little time to scope out the situation .
But if you do have a specific figure in mind and you are confident that you can get it , I 'd say go for it .
I have on many occasions , and every time I got very close to that figure ( both below and sometimes above ) .
14 .
Are you good at working in a team ?
Unless you have the I.Q. of a houseplant , you 'll always answer YES to this one .
It 's the only answer .
How can anyone function inside an organization if they are a loner ?
You may want to mention what part you like to play in a team though ; it 's a great chance to explain that you 're a natural leader .
15 .
Tell me a suggestion you have made that was implemented .
It 's important here to focus on the word " implemented . "
There 's nothing wrong with having a thousand great ideas , but if the only place they live is on your notepad what 's the point ?
Better still , you need a good ending .
If your previous company took your advice and ended up going bankrupt , that 's not such a great example either .
Be prepared with a story about an idea of yours that was taken from idea to implementation , and considered successful .
16 . Has anything ever irritated you about people you 've worked with ?
Of course , you have a list as long as your arm .
But you can't say that , it shows you as being negative and difficult to work with .
The best way to answer this one is to think for a while and then say something like " I 've always got on just fine with my co-workers actually . "
17 .
Is there anyone you just could not work with ?
No .
Well , unless you 're talking about murderers , racists , rapists , thieves or other dastardly characters , you can work with anyone .
Otherwise you could be flagged as someone who 's picky and difficult if you say , " I can't work with anyone who 's a Bronco 's fan .
Sorry . "
18 . Tell me about any issues you 've had with a previous boss .
Arrgh !
If you fall for this one you should n't be hired anyway .
The interviewer is testing you to see if you 'll speak badly about your previous supervisor .
Simply answer this question with extreme tact , diplomacy and if necessary , a big fat loss of memory .
In short , you 've never had any issues .
19 .
Would you rather work for money or job satisfaction ?
It 's not a very fair question is it ?
We 'd all love to get paid a Trump - like salary doing a job we love but that 's rare indeed .
It 's fine to say money is important , but remember that NOTHING is more important to you than the job .
Otherwise , you 're just someone looking for a bigger paycheck .
20 .
Would you rather be liked or feared ?
I have been asked this a lot , in various incarnations .
The first time I just drew a blank and said , " I do n't know . "
That went over badly , but it was right at the start of my career when I had little to no experience .
Since then I 've realized that my genuine answer is " Neither , I 'd rather be respected . "
You do n't want to be feared because fear is no way to motivate a team .
You may got the job done but at what cost ?
Similarly , if you 're everyone 's best friend you 'll find it difficult to make tough decisions or hit deadlines .
But when you 're respected , you do n't have to be a complete bastard or a lame duck to get the job done .
21 . Are you willing to put the interests of X Company ahead of your own ?
Again , another nasty question .
If you say yes , you 're a corporate whore who does n't care about family .
If you say no , you 're disloyal to the company .
I 'm afraid that you 'll probably have to say yes to this one though , because you 're trying to be the perfect employee at this point , and perfect employees do n't cut out early for Jimmy 's baseball game .
22 . So , explain why I should hire you .
As I 'm sure you know , " because I 'm great " or " I really need a job " are not good answers here .
This is a time to give the employer a laundry list of your greatest talents that just so happen to match the job description .
It 's also good to avoid taking potshots at other potential candidates here .
Focus on yourself and your talents , not other people 's flaws .
23 .
Finally , do you have any questions to ask me ?
I 'll finish the way I started , with one of the most common questions asked in interviews .
This directly relates to the research you 've done on the company and also gives you a chance to show how eager and prepared you are .
You 'll probably want to ask about benefits if they have n't been covered already .
A good generic one is " how soon could I start , if I were offered the job of course . "
You may also ask what you'd be working on .
Specifically , in the role you 're applying for and how that affects the rest of the company .
Always have questions ready , greeting this one with a blank stare is a rotten way to finish your interview .
Good luck and happy job hunting .

Guinness could really be good for you
The long - running ad campaign is well - known
The old advertising slogan " Guinness is Good for You " may be true after all , according to researchers .
A pint of the black stuff a day may work as well as a low dose aspirin to prevent heart clots that raise the risk of heart attacks .
Drinking lager does not yield the same benefits , experts from University of Wisconsin told a conference in the US .
Guinness was told to stop using the slogan decades ago - and the firm still makes no health claims for the drink .
The Wisconsin team tested the health - giving properties of stout against lager by giving it to dogs who had narrowed arteries similar to those in heart disease .
They found that those given the Guinness had reduced clotting activity in their blood , but not those given lager .
Heart trigger Clotting is important for patients who are at risk of a heart attack because they have hardened arteries .
A heart attack is triggered when a clot lodges in one of these arteries supplying the heart .
Many patients are prescribed low - dose aspirin as this cuts the ability of the blood to form these dangerous clots .
The researchers told a meeting of the American Heart Association in Orlando , Florida , that the most benefit they saw was from 24 fluid ounces of Guinness - just over a pint - taken at mealtimes .
We already know that most of the clotting effects are due to the alcohol itself , rather than any other ingredients
Spokesman , Brewing Research International
They believe that " antioxidant compounds " in the Guinness , similar to those found in certain fruits and vegetables , are responsible for the health benefits because they slow down the deposit of harmful cholesterol on the artery walls .
However , Diageo , the company that now manufactures Guinness , said : " We never make any medical claims for our drinks . "
The company now runs advertisements that call for " responsible drinking " .
A spokesman for Brewing Research International , which conducts research for the industry , said she would be " wary " of placing the health benefits of any alcohol brand above another .
She said : " We already know that most of the clotting effects are due to the alcohol itself , rather than any other ingredients .
" It is possible that there is an extra effect due to the antioxidants in Guinness - but I would like to see this research repeated . "
She said that reviving the old adverts for Guinness might be problematic - at least in the EU .
Draft legislation could outlaw any health claims in adverts for alcohol in Europe , she said .
Feelgood factor
The original campaign in the 1920s stemmed from market research - when people told the company that they felt good after their pint , the slogan was born .
In England , post - operative patients used to be given Guinness , as were blood donors , based on the belief that it was high in iron .
Pregnant women and nursing mothers were at one stage advised to drink Guinness - the present advice is against this .
The UK is still the largest market in the world for Guinness , although the drink does not feature in the UK 's top ten beer brands according to the latest research .

The Simpsons explains why Fox News , Fox Network are so different David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday May 21 , 2007 Print This Email This
In this video clip from The Simpsons , as Homer stares mesmerized at the set , Lisa asks the eternal question : " How can Fox News be so conservative when the Fox Network keeps airing raunchy shows ?
They do n't fit together . "
The explanation she gets from right - wing Springfield tv news personality Kent Brockman is , " Fox deliberately runs shows that will earn them huge fines they can then funnel through the FCC straight to the Republican Party .
Everybody in the media knows it but no one has the guts to say it . "
Costa Rica is hosting a conference on cluster bombs Tuesday in a bid to make the region the first area free of such weapons .
At the opening of the conference , Vice Minister of the Presidency Jose Torres said that Costa Rica had joined the fight against the use of such weapons , applying laws to bar their use .
Cluster bombs or cluster munitions are air - dropped or ground - launched munitions that spray 10 to 400 mini-bombs .
" This nation calls for a ban on the production , use and sale of such weapons and backs the notion of Latin America being the first region free of these weapons , " Torres said .
Speaking at the same meeting , Jose Manuel Hermida , working for Costa Rica 's United Nations Development Program , said " such weapons have serious effects on food security , causing hygiene problems , displacing communities , exacerbating poverty and limiting both local and national reconstruction and development capacity . "
Some 98 percent of cluster bomb victims are civilians , including many children .
Steve Goose , the executive director of Human Rights Watch , said he was optimistic that Latin America would act as a united force " to create a new 2008 treaty banning the manufacture of cluster bombs . "
The non-governmental organization Handicap International said 400 million people in 25 nations which are in " defacto mine fields " are at risks from cluster bombs .

Amazon - Software - Chef Luis Felipe Cabrera hat auf der O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference ( ETech ) in San Diego ein neues Projekt des Online - Händlers vorgestellt , bei dem Menschen künftig Computern helfen sollen .
Kernpunkt der Idee ist eine neue Web - Services - Plattform namens " Mechanical Turk " ( " mechanischer Türke " ) .
Die nutzt ein auktionsartiges System , um Aufgaben an Menschen zu delegieren , die für Computer zu komplex sind , wie die Erkennung des Unterschiedes zwischen menschlichen Gesichtern und Gegenständen oder die akkurate Mitschrift einer Tonaufzeichnung .
Cabrera nennt die Plattform keck " künstliche künstliche Intelligenz " , da diesmal ein Computer den Menschen bittet , ihm bei der Arbeit zu helfen – und nicht umgekehrt .
Um die Idee zu illustrieren , schilderte Cabrera einen Test , den die Amazon - Suchmaschine A9.com kürzlich durchgeführt hat .
Dabei wurden Durchschnittsnutzer gebeten , so genannte " Human Intelligence Tasks " ( HITs ) , zu erfüllen .
Also Aufgaben , die menschliche Intelligenz benötigen , weil Computer hier normalerweise versagen – etwa ein Gebäude oder Geschäft aus einem Bild eines ganzen Gebäudeblocks herauszusuchen , um den Bildausschnitt dann mit einer Adresse zu verknüpfen .
Die Teilnehmer erledigten bei dem
Test ihren Job nicht nur vollständig , sondern auch noch " außerordentlich schnell " , wie Cabrera sagt .
Amazon konnte die Bilder deshalb in seinen Suchergebnissen verwenden .
" Aber das ist nur die Spitze des Eisberges .
Der Test zeigt , wie man einen ' massiv parallelen ' menschlichen Rechner bauen könnte . "
Das Projekt entbehrt allerdings nicht einer gewissen Ironie .
Auf der ETech , auf der eigentlich die neuesten technischen Lösungen für das Web 2.0 präsentiert werden , erinnert Amazons mechanischer Türke an den berühmten " Schachtürken " aus dem 18 .
Jahrhundert .
Der war von dem ungarischen Erfinder Wolfgang von Kempelen einst als Schachautomat präsentiert worden , der in Gestalt einer türkischen Figur daherkam .
Könige ließen sich von dem Gerät faszinieren , das sogar einige wichtige Spiele gewann .
Allerdings war die Maschine ein einziger Schwindel : Von Kempelen hatte einfach einen Zwergen - Schachmeister hineingesetzt und sie mit Schaltern und anderem mechanischen Krimskrams ausstaffiert .
Amazons spaßige Namenswahl soll das Konzept der Künstlichen Intelligenz ( KI ) jedoch nicht verraten – tatsächlich gehört das Projekt zu einer ganzen Reihe von ähnlichen Experimenten , wie sich Menschen - und Computer - Intelligenz verknüpfen lassen .
Zwei der bekanntesten Konzepte sind Googles PageRank - Algorithmus und Amazons Empfehlungssystem .
Während Google die von Menschen gesetzten Links auf eine Seite als " Stimme " für die Qualität des Inhaltes eines Angebotes wertet , nutzt Amazon das Verhalten bisheriger Kunden , um Bücher und andere Produkte Neukunden anzupreisen , die ähnliche Kaufmuster zeigen .
Ein anderes Beispiel sind Angebote wie Flickr und del.icio.us , die von Menschen eingetragene Schlüsselbegriffe ( Tags ) verwenden , um komplexe Informationen wie das Thema eines Fotos oder den Verwendungszweck einer Website zusammenzufassen .
Von diesen unterscheidet sich Amazons mechanischer Türke aber in einem entscheidenden Punkt : Der Web - Service will jedem Nutzer , der die gestellten Aufgaben erledigt , Geld zahlen – Flickr und Co. tun das nicht .
Die meisten Aufgaben des mechanischen Türken sind eher einfach : Etwa Adressen und Eigentümer bei einer Wohnungsanzeige abgleichen oder bestimmen , ob eine Person auf einem Bild ein Mann oder eine Frau ist .
Das soll dann jedes Mal ein paar Cents bringen – der Dienst zahlt auf dem Niveau von Entwicklungsländern .
Derzeit arbeiten vor allem Studenten und Hausfrauen für den mechanischen Türken .
Demnächst könnten es auch vietnamesische Nutzer sein , die nebenher etwas dazuverdienen wollen .
" Wir sammeln derzeit demographische Daten der Nutzerbasis des Türken .
Viele User sind Mütter , die von zu Hause aus arbeiten , Studenten und Ausländer " , erklärt David Pfeiffer von DPA Software , einem virtuellen Softwareunternehmen aus Wisconsin , das selbst nur aus vier Mitstreitern besteht .
Die Firma entwickelt Anwendungen , um die Aufgabenstellungen des Türken auch nichttechnischen Nutzern deutlich zu präsentieren .
" Es sieht derzeit so aus , als ob wir uns in Richtung von Mitarbeitern bewegen , die keine bestimmten Kenntnisse haben müssen .
Normales menschliches Wissen reicht " , sagt Pfeiffer .
Für die Zukunft sieht Pfeiffer den Amazon - Service aber auch als Qualifizierungsdienst für Projektmanager , die nach Talenten Ausschau halten .
Im Gegensatz zu Konkurrenzdiensten wie dem Google Wizard , bei dem sich die Nutzer durch ein Kundenzufriedenheitssystem hocharbeiten müssen , können Projektmanager bei Amazon anhand der Antwortzeiten und - qualität selbst entscheiden , wen sie weiterbeschäftigen .
Aus diesem Grund soll die nächste Version von Pfeiffers Hauptprodukt , dem so genannten " HIT - Builder " , Bewertungs - und Ranking - Funktionen enthalten , damit Kunden herausfinden können , wer die beste Arbeit liefert .

How To Safely Borrow For A House Purchase
Buy a house without going broke !
So you ’ve set your sights on a house that ’s just perfect and you just cannot contain your excitement .
There ’s just one problem — you ’re not sure if you can really afford it .
But before you turn to the real estate professionals for advice , you may want to develop some idea about what kind of financing you ’re interested in and even what you could qualify for .
To be forewarned is to be forearmed .
The real estate industry is full of creative loans and fancy mortgages that can make your eyes blur and your wallet bleed .
So reading up on them a little before venturing forward with your home purchase can prevent you from falling prey to the potentially infectious enthusiasm of your mortgage lender .
As this About.com article discusses , the root of risk inherent in many mortgage products is in how these loans have made things too easy ; too easy for anyone to qualify for or afford homes that are * much * bigger than one ’s budget , allowing people to pretty much dig their own money pit , thereby enabling the fermentation of housing bubbles that subsequently turn into explosive busts .
To me , these loans appear designed to get you to somehow stre - e - e - tch your way into home ownership .
All I can say is : Buyer Beware .
How To Borrow Money Safely For A New House Purchase
Instead , if you ’re thinking of buying a home , keep these tips in mind :
Surround yourself with trusted and seasoned real estate professionals .
The people you decide to work and surround yourself with can make or break your home buying experience .
Screen them well and find the right guys or gals to help you out on your search .

Set a realistic budget and determine the types of homes that fit into your price range .
Sometimes , you really need to say NO to your inner voice .
Do n’t be tempted to “ upsize ” unless of course , you honestly have the money .
The money needs to be in your savings account and not simply promised to you by your boss in the form of next year ’s raise .
Know your true absolute maximum price limit , as this sticky point is what usually gets folks in over their heads , causing them to resort to creative loans .
To start with , use tools and calculators to help you formulate your budget .

Select a fixed rate mortgage as much as possible .
Interest rates are trending lower than they ’ve historically been so this would be the conservative option .
In 2002 , my lender was adamant about trying to get me to sign up for an ARM citing the ridiculously low rates then .
I steadfastly refused and stuck to getting a fixed rate mortgage ( while of course shrugging off the lender ’s disappointment ) and I ’m just so glad I stuck to my gut .

Make sure that even if you go for a more aggressive loan , that you are able to manage the payments comfortably regardless of what lies ahead in the future .
A big mistake people make about taking on debt is to believe that “ the future will take care of itself ” .
And that “ it will all work out ” .
They very well might , but they also may not , as we are seeing today with the waves of foreclosures that have hit the nation .
So if you own a riskier loan , you ’ll need to be more vigilant about managing it .

Here are some warning indicators that your mortgage stinks !

Be aware of the existence of mortgage fraud and how to protect yourself from it .
Keep your guard up with these pointers .
It is unfortunate that unscrupulous brokers in the real estate industry pitch their scariest loans to the most vulnerable home buyers .
If you ’re going to borrow money at all , doing so for a house is a terrific reason to take out a loan .
In fact , my mortgage is the only loan I like having :) .
Home buying can be a very exciting time but we need to keep our wits around us during such times of high emotion to avoid any possible actions we may regret later on .
So watch your step , borrow prudently and enjoy the home buying experience !

Today , the House of Representatives passed a bill that would add sexual orientation as a category to which existing federal “ hate crimes ” legislation would apply :
WASHINGTON , May 3 â € ”
The House of Representatives voted today to extend â€œhate crimeâ€ protection to people who are victimized because of their sexuality .
But the most immediate effect of the bill may be to set up another veto showdown between Democrats and President Bush .
By 237 to 180 , the House voted to include crimes spurred by a victimâ€™s â€œgender , sexual orientation or gender identityâ€ under the hate - crime designation , which now applies to crimes spurred by the victimâ€™s race , religion , color or national origin .
â€ œThe bill is passed , â€ Representative Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat who is gay , announced to applause , most of it from Democrats .
Similar legislation is moving through the Senate .
But even assuming that a bill emerges from the full Congress , it will face a veto by President Bush on grounds that it is â€œunnecessary and constitutionally questionable , â€ the White House said before the House vote .
The House did not pass the bill by a margin wide enough to override a veto , which requires a two - thirds majority .
The Senate is not expected to do so either .
I ’m about to write something I do n’t think I ever have here at The Liberty Papers ……..
President Bush is absolutely correct about this one .
The Federal Government does not belong getting involved in prosecuting crimes like this ; this should be exclusively a matter for the states .
Personally , I do n’t think very much of hate crime laws .
If you ’re assaulted , does it really matter why someone did it ?
And why is it right to punish someone more severely because of who their victim was ?
Nonetheless , if states choose to make assaulting someone because of their race , gender , sexual orientation , or religion , then they are free do so .
Andrew Sullivan is , not surprisingly , upset about the threatened Â veto and has this to say about the federalism argument :
The federalist argument equally applies .
If it is the position of the feds that this should be left entirely to the states , fine .
But to say that the feds have a role in matters of race and religion , but not sexual orientation again makes no logical sense , unless the federal government wants to send a strong message about the moral and human and political inferiority of gay people .
From my point of view , though , the federalism argument applies equally against other existing federal “ hate crimes ” laws .
Quite honestly , I think those laws should be repealed and the matter left to the states , where it belongs .
Moreover , though , as Dale Carpenter points out , there ’s more to this bill than just adding sexual orientation to existing laws :
Â The problem with this criticism , however , is that the bill does much more than simply add “ sexual orientation ” to the existing federal law on hate crimes passed in 1968 .
It ’s a whole new statute .
Protecting gays is only one element , though the most publicized .
The bill considerably expands federal jurisdiction over hate crimes in general , for all categories , by eliminating the current requirement that the crime occur while the victim is engaged in a federally protected activity .
That jurisdictional limitation has kept federal involvement very limited in an area where state authority has traditionally reigned .
The new law also calls for more federal resources to be expended on all classes of hate crimes .
The veto of an amendment merely adding sexual orientation to existing federal law would pretty clearly reflect an anti-gay double - standard .
A veto of this much more comprehensive bill does not .
Given this , the bill is positively screaming to be vetoed .
Hopefully , President Bush will follow through with his threat .
Ah , Halloween .
What began centuries ago as a ceremony celebrating the culmination of the harvest season has become a fête of horror and sex .
Truly a sign of civilized progress .
( Which should come as no surprise really -- you know what Freud says : " What comes between fear and sex ?
Fünf ! " ) *
Not that the ancient celebrations did n't seem fun .
It was believed that the conclusion of the harvest season was the one day a year that spirits could cross the line between the living and the dead , so people would dress in costume to blend in -- a tactic that would work great these days if the afterlife was rife with slutty nurses and construction workers .
But back then , it was all utilitarian .
The entertainment value was low .
There was no need to scare each other .
The life expectancy was 35 .
That was scary enough .
Likewise , these days who needs another Saw sequel when we 've got a bevy of incompetent men vying for the opportunity to rule our nation for the next four years ?
As evidenced by these five videos , politicians are way scarier than fiction .
We 'll save the slutty nurses for another time .

Tagline : " Like vampires , Joe Biden sucks . "
Sure , the comparisons could stop at cheap puns , but there 's so much more .
Vampires are known for their fat wallets , brazen attitudes , and lack of concern for others .
Biden , likewise , not a big fan of minorities .
Nor vampires .
When contacted for a quote on vampires , Biden said : " At least I 'm not black , because they always get killed first .
Which is strange because you would think they could outrun the vampires . "
Joe Biden : proof that you do n't have to be racist to be an asshole , but it helps .

The skeleton is a benign monster .
It seems frail , like it could n't really hurt you if it tried .
Kind of like Bill Richardson .
Until you realize that there 's no way to kill a skeleton because it 's already dead .
Kind of like Bill Richardson 's campaign .
Despite all his efforts to completely destroy his chances of becoming president , he just keeps showing up on TV again and again saying dumb things .
My advice ?
Well , a little compassion would n't hurt .
You know what they say , " Skeletons in closets should n't throw stones . "

Tagline : " Under certain circumstances a noticeable change takes place . "

Throw John McCain in front of an audience and he turns into Sergeant Slaughter , whooping , hollering , and looking for something to bomb .
He was thisclose to using air quotes around the words " mass murderer . "
That is the mark of a man who has lost his composure .

They should change his campaign slogan to " Mitt Romney -- He 'll Be There for You !

I do n't know why he was running so fast anyway .
It 's not like the terminally ill patient in the wheelchair was going to catch him .

Make no mistake , it takes an effort to appear this incompetent .

Mr Adebari said it was a great honour
Rotimi Adebari has been elected as first citizen of Portlaoise in County Laois .
The 43 - year - old fled from Nigeria in 2000 because of religious persecution .
After a few weeks , he and his family settled in the County Laois town .
In 2004 , he was elected in the local elections as an independent councillor and on Thursday he became mayor .
The move was the result of a voting pact between Fine Gael , Sinn Fein and independent councillors .
The father - of - four has completed a masters degree in intercultural studies at Dublin City University and now works for Laois County Council , co-ordinating an integration project for local immigrants .
Mr Adebari said it was a great honour to become Portlaoise 's first citizen , but that praise should be given to the people who elected him three years ago .
" Ireland is really changing .
The immigrant community in the town has been growing , especially since the accession countries joined the European Union on enlargement in 2004 , " he said .
However , he added : " That is not to say that I did not have my own share of the prejudice that would be out there against maybe Nigerians , or immigrants or asylum seekers . "
" But I do n't let the attitude of a very small minority over - shadow the fact that the people are wonderful . "
What makes home theater projectors so sexy , so compelling and so different from a regular old TV set with its LCD or plasma screen ?
We 're going to break it down for you , and let you know why it just might be worth it to consider putting together a dedicated home theater room — a temple devoted to the holy projector that makes watching a regular TV show feel just like a trip to a movie theater .
The best news is , a ticket to your own home theater is getting to be surprisingly affordable .
Advertisement
1 . You get a really big picture .
You get the most bang for your buck with a projector .
To get the largest practical LCD display with a 65 - inch screen , it 'll cost you at least $ 7,000 .
On the other hand , a projector can blast out a 120 - inch pic for a mere $ 3 K .
Sure , you 'll need to buy a screen , but you could probably just get away with painting some $ 200 Screen Goo on your wall ( we 've used it , and it works great but is crazy - expensive compared with regular old paint ) , or cheaper yet , paint your wall a light gray and you 'd still probably be satisfied with the picture quality .
2 . It feels just like a movie theater .
There 's just something about a projected image in a darkened room that elicits mystery , focuses your attention , and makes it feel like you 've dedicated yourself to the content on the screen .
There 's nothing incidental about watching a movie in a darkened room on a projector .
And even with a middle - of - the - road projector and average sound system , the end result when you watch a Blu-ray or HD DVD movie looks better than the old - timey analog projector at your local multiplex after that piece of film has gone through it a thousand times .
Which leads to our next point ...

3 . Go for Blu-ray or HD DVD for your home theater .
Might we recommend a dual - format player , such as the Samsung or LG models we 've told you about here on the Giz ?
The resolution on these HD discs is truly 1080 p , and if you 're going to invest in that kind of resolution , you might as well have a playback source that can crank it out .
4 . Do n't forget the audio .
You might already have a Dolby 5.1 system , but if you do n't , now 's the time to indulge .
You can get a home theater in a box ( HTIB ) system for very little money , but do n't spend less than $ 500 unless you 're nearly deaf .
Lots of the receivers now have HDMI inputs and switchers , letting you control all your components from there .
5 . Prices are getting astonishingly low , even for 1080 p projectors .
Our favorite so far is the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 1080 , and coming in a close second is the Panasonic 1080 p projector , both of which cost $ 3000 .
And , the next - gen version of both these models will roll out soon , costing even less than that , and have blacker blacks and better color .
Beware of cheap projectors , though , such as the Torpedo that costs $ 179 .
We have n't tried that one yet ( stay tuned for that ) , but the $ 500 BoxTV projector we did review was one of the worst , noisiest and clunkiest contraptions we 've ever tested .
Advertisement
6 . There is a downside to having a projector .
It works best in a dedicated room with no windows .
Sure , you could just watch movies at night , or install blackout curtains on your windows , but the best idea is to use a windowless basement room , install your speaker and projector cables before you put in the drywall , mount your projector to the ceiling and you 're good to go .
Advertisement
7 . If you like to use a TV as background noise , maybe a projector is n't for you .
We know a guy whose home theater is an homage to the multi-use room , that is , he placed an LCD display on the wall for daytime CNN watching and casual use , and has a projector mounted on the ceiling with a screen that lowers itself automagically when he wants to settle in for some serious movie watching .
8. Perhaps make plans for your theater now , but delay them for a bit .
While the writers ' strike is n't going to go on forever , it might last a while , meaning there will be fewer TV shows to watch .
But then , there 's always Blu-ray and HD DVD and , ahem , BitTorrent .
Advertisement
9 . Get a set of theater chairs for the full effect .
Three or four years ago , it was hard to find even a single reclining theater chair with cup holders that cost less than $ 1500 .
Now you can get a set of three in an arced arrangement for around that same price .
They 're basically three recliners lashed together , and they 'll let you watch a movie in blissful comfort .
10 . 1080 p is not always necessary .
But when you 're dealing with a projector , the screen size can get so gigantic that this choice could be crucial .
For instance , the difference between 1080 p and 720 p becomes apparent at 16 feet when you 're talking about a 123 - inch screen .
In fact , the THX recommended maximum viewing distance for that 123 - incher is 13.7 feet .
If your screen is going to be smaller than that , say , 60 inches viewed from 10 feet away , you may not be able to tell the difference between 1080 p and 720 p .
See this handy chart by Carlton Bale to determine the specifics for your viewing distance and screen size .
Smoke from the fire could be seen across London
Aerial footage
More than 75 firefighters tackled the blaze as 50ft ( 15 m ) flames engulfed the building in Waterden Road , Hackney Wick at about 1200 GMT on Monday .
Black smoke could be seen across the skyline and the Fire Brigade received more than 150 calls from the public .
Rail services were suspended between Dalston Kingsland and Stratford but roads in the area remained open .
The warehouse is on the western edge of the proposed site of the Olympic Village and was due to be demolished on Monday .
Assistant Commissioner Dave Brown , of the London Fire Brigade , said investigations were ongoing but the fire was not thought to be suspicious .
Health risks
He also confirmed that asbestos had been found on the site .
Professor Virginia Murray , of the Health Protection Agency , sought to reassure people over the substance .
She said that research showed it was usually long - term exposure to asbestos which causes a significant health risk .
The blaze has disrupted rail services in east London
Your pictures of the fire
" Our advice is not to touch any of the material that may have come from the fire and make sure that they ( members of the public ) get in touch with their local authority so that an appropriate clean - up can be undertaken , " she said .
The Olympic Delivery Authority ( ODA ) Chief Executive David Higgins said it would carry out a full investigation into the fire .
He said : " Initial indications would suggest that this was an accident rather than arson .
" We are in touch with local residents and are keeping them informed of the situation . "
He said that work was continuing in the rest of the park .
Transport disrupted
The blaze was close to the Channel Tunnel high speed rail link but Eurostar said the fire did not have an impact on services .
Flights from nearby London City Airport were also unaffected by the fire .
A Transport for London spokesman said services on the overground line from Richmond were terminating at Dalston Kingsland .
Fire crews were expected to remain at the site overnight to ensure the fire is damped down properly .
It seems like these days it is hard to find someone saying good things about their father .
I do n’t know if the overall quality of fathering is going down , if people do n’t appreciate their father as much , or if people just talk about it more these days , but almost every time you hear about someone ’s father , it ’s in a negative light .
Well , I ’m here to tell you that my dad is great .
I really could n’t ask for a better father than the one I got … sure we had a few disagreements , and there are a couple of areas where I wish he would have pushed me , but overall I do n’t think there is a better dad available .
So , now that I ’m a father myself , I have a lot of good stuff to look back on for lessons on how I should be a dad to my kids .
The most important thing about being a good dad is that it ’s about BEing a good dad … it ’s who you are , not what you do .
The things listed below are things a good dad should be , things that I learned not from my dad telling me , but from watching who he was ( and is ) .
Here we go , then , with 10 things my father taught me about how to be a good dad :
Be Calm Kids will always do things to provoke you , sometimes intentionally , sometimes not .
A good dad should keep his temper , not yelling or screaming , or throwing huge punishments for a minor offense just because he ’s angry .
After all , you do n’t really want to teach your kids to do those things , do you ?
Be Loving
It ’s important to remind your kids that you love them .
This includes telling them that you love them , but also other things , like being supportive when they need it , wiping away tears , and hugging them … no matter how big they get .
Showing you love them is just as important as telling them that you love them … but do n’t forget to tell them , too .
Be Patient Sometimes you may wish your kids would just get around to learning something already , or that they would finally be responsible and take care of their chores without having to be reminded 143 times .
It ’s at these times that you need to be patient and remember that kids are kids … give them time , give them your patience .
They are worth it .
Be Proud
It ’s sort of a cliche that fathers are proud of their children … but a lot of fathers do n’t realize how important it is to actually tell their kids , not just their friends and coworkers !
Your kids need to know that you ’re proud of them … and the things that they do that you show them you ’re proud of are the things they will try to do again .
If you show them that you are proud of their good grades , they will try to get good grades … if you show them that you are proud of them being a good person , or good with their siblings , or something else , they will do whatever it is that made you proud again ( or at least try ) .
Be Honest
It ’s important to be honest with your children .
It ’s important to be honest in general , really , but your kids will learn from you … and you want them to be honest , presumably .
If you do n’t want your children to know about something , whether because it ’s inappropriate for them or for other reasons , tell them that … do n’t just lie to cover it up .
Be Firm
When you set rules , make them stick .
If they are supposed to be home by 8:00 , and they walk in the door at 8:07 , they need to be punished , barring extenuating circumstances … and there should n’t ALWAYS be extenuating circumstances .
On the other hand , do n’t be unbendable … let them have a little freedom , and give them a break if the rule break is an exception , rather than the rule .
Be Yourself
It ’s important to be yourself around your children .
Some people are completely different people around their children than they are around other people .
Your children WILL see this , and it will have two negative effects : it will erode their trust in you ( You ARE being deceitful after all … you ca n’t honestly be two different people ) , and it will teach them that this is appropriate behavior for them as well .
You may find this second part affects you directly … they may be an entirely different person in front of you than they are around their friends .
Be Father First , Friend Second
It is awesome to not only be a parent , but also a friend to your child .
You need to remember which one comes first , however .
Kids need a dad more than they need a friend , and you ’re the best option for that … and if you wo n’t be a father to them , they ’ll be looking for that influence elsewhere .
Be Respectful
It ’s very important to teach your children to respect you … but it ’s also very important that you respect them .
This means giving them room to grow and learn , it means talking to them as an equal ( when you can … it ’s not appropriate when setting rules or punishment , for example ) , and treating them as their own individual person .
It means respecting their decisions when you can , even if it ’s not what you would have done , or not what you think is best for them .
That does n’t mean do n’t give advice … just accept that sometimes they need to make their own way .
It ’s the only way they ’ll ever grow up mentally and emotionally .
Be There
This could be a whole article by itself … and who knows , at some point it may be !
For this article , however , I ’ll keep it simple : Children need a father .
They need a father who is in their life , who pays attention to them , who is interested in them , who does things with them , and asks about them .
Time without attention , like in a marriage , is worse than no time at all .
Show them that they are important to you … give them your time AND attention .
That certainly does n’t cover everything involved in being a good father … but it ’s a pretty good start .
If you do the things above , or rather if you can be the things above , you will be well along the path to being a good father .
On the other hand , just because you fail at something from time to time ( ie fail to be calm … probably the easiest one to fail ) , that does n’t mean that you ’re NOT a good dad … you can pick yourself up and get back to it .
I have to say there IS one thing I learned for myself , though , something he could n’t have told me even if he ’d wanted to do so , and that ’s just how good it feels .
I love being a dad … it ’s one of the most fun and fulfilling things I have ever done , and it will make a lasting impact on both my kids and everyone they touch later in life .
There is no way that he could have conveyed just how rewarding it is .
He ’s doing a bit better on conveying how much fun it is to be a grandpa , but I think I ’d be happy to wait a while before experiencing that for myself .
The first video is in from Bush 's surprise visit to a remote and heavily guarded air base in Iraq 's western Anbar Province and it truly speaks volumes .
It 's clear that this was nothing more than a chance for the president to use the troops as props ( note the big thumbs up ! from Gen. Petraeus ) to spin his failing surge as U.S. troop levels surge as well .
MSNBC 's Contessa Brewer brought in Republican strategist Joe Watkins and former Senior Advisor to John Kerry , James Boyce , to talk about the presidential visit .
Boyce is on the money , calling this what it was -- a staged photo op .
Watkins tries to spin this as a positive move by the president , and that he wants to get in touch with the troops to find out what 's going on on the ground , but Boyce fires back , reminding him that if Bush really wanted to get things done in Iraq he'd stay for more than six hours , he 'd visit more than three times in four years and he would n't have ignored the Iraq Study Group 's recommendations .

The White House says the decision to have the president fly into Anbar was to show the successes of the surge in that region and touting this as " a symbolic expression of impatience with political paralysis in the nation 's capital . "
The truth of the matter is that the president is nowhere near an Iraqi city , he 's tucked away in a remote area and safe -- surrounded by soldiers .
I guess this is the best spin they could put on this seeing as how after four years of U.S. occupation , it still is n't safe enough for him to fly into Baghdad .
The examination of changing per capita GDP , driven by changes in the energy supply and national populations , will help us understand the distribution and extent of wealth and poverty over the next half century .
In order to gain more insight into how changes in energy will affect different parts of the world , this article will examine the impact of energy declines in specific countries .
We will disaggregate the global picture presented in the baseline energy article , and apply those changes to the specific energy circumstances of individual nations .
Those energy changes will be translated into their effect on national GDP .
The national population changes projected by the UN Medium Fertility Case will be used to translate the national GDP changes into average per capita GDP changes for each country .
In Part 1 I derived a scenario for the changing global energy supply picture between now and 2050 .
The conclusion in that article was that due to the rapid decline of oil and natural gas supplies , the total energy available to the world would drop by about 30 % in that time .
That single figure , however , does n't tell us much .
The picture is dramatically complicated by the fact that the world will be forced to transition from an energy economy largely based on fuels ( oil and natural gas ) to one based primarily on electricity generated from a variety of sources .
In addition , most of the world 's population growth in that time will occur in the energy - poor and economically - poor developing world .
Figure 1 : Total Energy Use , 1965 to 2050
Methodology
National Energy Budgets
The analysis in this article is supported by the global model of energy trends referenced above , that defines an individual supply curve for each energy source - oil , gas , coal , hydro , nuclear , solar and wind power .
In order to apply this to individual countries or regions , I started with the national energy consumption figures for 2006 found in the BP statistical Review of World Energy 2007 .
To establish each country 's consumption in 2050 I multiplied their current use of each energy source by its production increase or decline factor derived from the model .
In the case of renewable energy , which is not included in the BP data , I used an ad hoc approach to add some amount of renewable energy to each country 's budget .
To do this , I took the basic energy budget determined in the first step and increased it by 5 % , 10 % , 15 % or 20 % .
The assignment of a particular percentage to a given nation was to some extent arbitrary .
It was based on their current energy wealth and their current activity in the field of renewable energy .
As a result , countries like Denmark and Germany were given 20 % , countries like Canada and Australia were assigned 15 % , countries like Indonesia , Poland and Portugal gained 10 % , and nations and regions like Pakistan , Bangladesh and most of Africa were given 5 % ,
I recognize that these approaches for both classical and renewable energy ignore probable differences in supply evolution in individual countries - some countries may develop hydro power at a faster rate than the model suggests while others lag behind , for example , and some nations may develop a " Manhattan Project " approach to wind or solar .
Given the great degree of uncertainty inherent in this projection , though , I felt that such an approach was good enough to give the reader a feel for the nature and magnitude of the changes we may see over the next forty or fifty years .
National GDP
The standard economist 's position on the influence of energy on the economy has been based on a theory developed by Robert Solow in 1956 .
In Solow 's analysis economic growth was driven by two factors , capital and labour , both of which were quantified financially .
70 % of the money flow in the world goes to labour as salaries , 30 % goes to capital as rent , dividends etc .
Solow used the Cobb - Douglas equations to map the growth function of an economy as labour and capital increased .
He got nice curves , but unfortunately they under - predict observed economic growth by two thirds .
As reported in David Strahan 's excellent book , " The Last Oil Shock " ( pp. 116-123 ) , two physicists , Reiner Kummel and Robert Ayres , independently observed the global economic slowdown following the oil shocks of the 70s and 80s and wondered if the role of energy in the economy was being under-valued .
Their analysis convinced them that the price of oil ( which was used by Solow in his analysis ) underestimated the productive contribution of oil by a factor of ten .
In other words , to truly reflect the contribution of oil to the economy , it should be priced about ten times higher .
They developed their own economic model that started from Solow 's work but incorporated their findings about oil 's productive contribution , and found that their predictions matched observed economic growth perfectly .
The models by Kummel and Ayres predict that for every 1 % increase in energy inputs you get about a 0.7 % increase in GDP on average .
The immediate implication is that a reduction of 1 % in energy will cause a corresponding 0.7 % drop in GDP .
So if the world 's oil supply were to decline by 30 % the global GDP would lose 23 % of its value .
Once the national energy budgets were established by the method described in the previous section , I calculated their impact on GDP using the above ratio:a 1 % energy change gives a 0.7 % change in GDP .
As with the energy budget calculations , there are significant caveats .
The ratio observed by Kummel and Ayres is by no means axiomatic .
Many factors peculiar to a given country will act on its GDP , driving its performance away from the projections of a simplistic one - number model .
On the other hand , the same observation that was made above also applies here : given the inherent uncertainties , this approach should suffice to give the reader a feel for the shape and size of the coming changes .
The other caution applies to oil exporting nations .
The future energy budgets and GDP for countries like Saudi Arabia , Canada , Russia etc. are not well addressed by this generalized model .
Those nations have more options than do importing nations , since they can choose to retain their oil and gas as described in the Export Land Model ( PDF warning ) .
Such actions may reduce the decline in their GDP over the period being considered , though obviously at the expense of importing nations .
It is also possible that the deliberate witholding of oil from the world market could trigger military action by desperate and militarily capable importers .
Such resource wars would have unpredictable ( though necessarily negative ) consequences for the energy status and GDP of the otherwise well - endowed target oil producers .
National Population and Per Capita GDP
National population figures for 2006 were obtained from the CIA World Factbook .
The figures for 2050 were obtained from a private re-publishing of the projected medium - fertility data from the United Nations Population Fund report of 2001 .
National GDP figures were also obtained from the CIA World Factbook .
To ensure uniform comparisons they are Purchasing Power Parity ( PPP ) figures from 2006 .
Per capita GDP is derived by dividing the actual ( 2006 ) or projected ( 2050 ) national GDP by the actual or projected national populations .

Winners and Losers
The research disclosed some of the profound economic and demographic changes that will affect the nations of the world over the next four or five decades .
To start getting a sense of these changes , let 's first take a look at the top 10 and bottom 10 nations in terms of per capita GDP , in 2006 and 2050 .
All GDP figures are in 2006 dollars .
The 10 Richest Nations
Table 1 : Top 10 in 2006

The interesting thing about the winners is that the size of the group has barely changed , and while their GDP has declined , it has not gone down by much .
The average per capita GDP has dropped by about 30 % , mostly driven by the decline in the United States .
While this drop will be noticeable , given the high level of income that exists today it will not be beyond peoples ' means to accommodate .
The 10 Poorest Nations

It 's a very different story for those nations on the bottom of the ladder .
While the population of the bottom 10 countries has n't changed much , their per capita GDP has dropped a whopping 70 % .
The average income has fallen from $ 8.50 per day now to $ 2.50 per day ( in today 's dollars ) in 2050 .
Also notice the inclusion of Africa 's 1.4 billion people in this group .
As their average income is so low , probably a full billion people in this group will be trying to live on less than a dollar a day .
The primary reason for this precipitous drop is that the developing world gets much more of its energy from oil and gas .
When those sources start to decline , they have little hydro or coal , and no nuclear power to replace them with .
In addition , due to their lack of industrial infrastructure they will find it difficult to install enough renewable energy capacity to offset the decline to any significant degree .
On a national level , two factors seem to determine how well or poorly a country will fare .
These factors are its population change ( falling is good , rising is bad ) and how much coal vs. oil and gas they currently use .
Those countries that use a high proportion of coal relative to oil and gas will find their GDP somewhat more stable as time goes by .
Countries that use more oil and gas , but less coal , will be more severely affected .
This explains the anomalous performance of China : their population is falling and they use a lot of coal .
While their coal use is bad news for the global environment , China 's GDP will be well protected , dropping only 13 % by 2050 .
Three Case Studies
To clarify the picture we will now take a closer look at three nations that dominate the economic and energy news these days .
We will examine the specifics of their energy use and how that use will evolve until 2050 .
By translating their energy use into an estimate of their future GDP and then factoring in the changes in their populations , we will derive an estimate of their per capita GDP in 2050 .
United States : a Wounded Giant

Total 2006 939 567 567 66 188 0 2,326 301 $ 13,130,000 $ 43,607 2050 169 146 599 90 183 178 1,365 349 $ 9,333,733 $ 26,720
The energy picture of the USA is dominated by oil and natural gas , and the decline of those sources will determine the nation 's future .
Oil
The mathematical calculation of American oil consumption in 2050 indicates a drop of 82 % .
This results from multiplying the current consumption by the expected global decline in supply , under the assumption that most nations will experience broadly similar reductions given the free market for oil that exists today .
Is such an assumption warranted ?
Let us analyze the situation a bit further .
America currently consumes over 900 million tonnes of oil a year .
Of that total , 300 million tonnes are produced domestically and over 600 million tonnes are imported .
American domestic oil production has been in decline since 1970 , at a constant rate of around 2 % per year .
If that rate holds for the future , the USA will be producing about 130 million tonnes per year in 2050 .
In order to meet the calculated figure of 169 million tonnes in 2050 , America will have to import about 40 million tonnes of oil compared to 600 million today .
I believe that this is a reasonable expectation because of the imminent effect of the " Net Oil Export Problem " .
Under that scenario it is possible for global oil exports to go to zero quite rapidly , and according to the linked paper by Jeffrey Brown is it possible that this may happen by 2040 .
Accordingly , projecting American imports of 40 million tonnes per year in 2050 may even be optimistic .
It is possible , however , that such a level of imports could be secured by long term contracts or even military force .
Gas
Natural gas production in the USA has been relatively constant for the last 30 years , though this has required drilling ever more holes at an ever - rising cost to maintain the level of supply .
Gas imports have risen to about 15 % of overall consumption .
These indicators point to a coming peak ( in my opinion within the next decade ) , followed by a sharp decline for reasons outlined in my earlier article .
The projected drop of 75 % would be generated by a loss of imports and a decline in domestic production of 5 % per year from 2020 .
This is in fact less than the average 6 % decline rate I used in my earlier article .
Coal , Hydro and Nuclear
These sources follow the global patterns determined in the earlier article .
Coal use will be up marginally world - wide in 2050 , nuclear power will be down marginally , and hydro use will see a general increase of about 40 % over today 's values .
These changes seem reasonable given the current energy development patterns in the USA .
Renewables
As I said above , I assigned an arbitrary percentage of renewable power to each country based on its industrial capacity and its current level of involvement with renewable energy .
That meant that I allotted the USA an additional 15 % of their total energy in 2050 to account for wind and solar development .
The Changing Energy Mix
The energy mix of the USA stays quite diverse , though the growing role of coal is clear .
Because of their original heavy reliance on oil and gas , the total US energy supply in 2050 declines to about 60 % of its present level .
Figure 2 : USA Energy Mix in 2006
Figure 3 : Projected USA Energy Mix in 2050
GDP
Due to the 40 % decline in total energy , the American GDP will decline by about 30 % .
This is determined by applying the 0.7 multiplier determined by Kummel and Ayres to the energy decline .
Population and per capita GDP
According to the UN figures , the American population will have grown by about 16 % in 2050 .
This , combined with the expected 30 % drop in GDP , gives a decline of about 40 % in per capita GDP in 2050 .
This would still leave the USA as the 8th wealthiest country in the world in per capita terms , with the second largest GDP ( just behind our next case study , China ) .
China : a Coal - Fired Powerhouse
Table 6
Year Energy ( Mtoe ) Pop. ( x 106 ) GDP ( $ Millions ) Per Capita GDP Oil Gas Coal Hydro Nuc. Renew .
Total 2006 350 50 1,191 94 12 0 1,698 1,322 $ 10,700,000 $ 8,094 2050 63 13 1,257 129 12 147 1,621 1,478 $ 10,362,682 $ 7,013
China 's energy picture is dominated by coal .
Oil
Unlike the USA , Chinese oil production is rising , though slowly ( about 1.5 % per year ) .
However , their largest oil field , Daqing , has peaked .
This makes it quite probable that overall Chinese oil production will go into decline in the next decade .
In addition , China became a net importer of oil in 1993 and currently imports about half their requirements .
If they , like the USA , lose access to most of their imports over the next 40 years , a decline in domestic production of only 3 % per year would bring them to the projected level of oil consumption .
As in the case of the USA is is entirely possible that China will try to secure oil supplies outside of normal market channels , so they may end up with a bit more oil than I have projected .
Gas
Natural gas production in China has been rising rapidly in recent years , averaging 15 % annual growth since 2000 as China pursues an aggressive program of industrialization .
So far their production has kept pace with their usage , but a decline parallel to that of oil is inevitable over the next four decades , especially if they attempt to increase their extraction in concert with their economic growth .
The derived global mathematical ratio of 25 % by 2050 seems reasonable , though it is also reasonable to assume that China will try and secure foreign gas supplies either though long term contracts or military or economic warfare .
Coal
It is clear that China has placed enormous emphasis on their large endowment of coal .
Recent reports indicate that they have plans to build two or three coal - fired power plants per week for at least the next decade .
As a result , it 's possible that China may exceed the 6 % projected net global growth in coal power by 2050 .
If they do , it could give a large boost to their GDP and vault them well into the global lead .
Of course , there is always the question of the environmental damage done by coal , both from the CO2 production and localized pollution by soot , ash and heavy metals .
The extent to which this will restrain China 's development of coal power remains to be seen .
For now , we will leave the increase in China 's coal power output in line with the global model .
Hydro
The development of the Three Gorges Dam has left no doubt that China is serious about developing its hydro potential .
The increase of 40 % in hydro power postulated by the model seems entirely achievable , especially given China 's apparent willingness to sacrifice ecological concerns in favour of industrial development .
Nuclear
Nuclear power may see its strongest growth in China , growth that will be driven by the need for electricity that produces less greenhouse gases and enabled by the willingness of the central government to ignore the personal wishes of its citizens .
It is also likely that there will be less public opposition to nuclear power in China than in the West because of the relative weakness of their environmental movement .
China currently has 30 reactors planned and 86 proposed , a full third of the world total .
It is quite likely that the contribution of nuclear power proposed by the energy model will be too low in China 's case .
If that turns out to be the case , its contribution could push their GDP decisively past today 's level .
Renewables
One area where my model has perhaps been too generous to China is in the penetration of wind and solar .
To cover their increasing role I have allotted China an additional 10 % of their non-renewable energy budget .
However , while China may play a large role in manufacturing such equipment , it seems less likely that they will install it with much enthusiasm .
The Chinese system is much more sympathetic to large , centralized power sources and as such more likely to favour increased nuclear power over wind and solar .
In the final analysis the model 's pessimism with respect to nuclear power may be balanced by its optimism over wind and solar , with the net result being a wash .
Only time will tell .
The Changing Energy Mix
The role of coal in China 's energy picture is obvious .
As I said above , much of the increase in renewable energy in 2050 could be replaced by nuclear power , with the two sources essentially trading importance .
As they are both electrical sources , that realignment would make no difference to the outcome of this particular analysis .
The total Chinese energy supply in 2050 is projected to drop by about 5 % .
Figure 4 : China Energy Mix in 2006
Figure 5 : Projected China Energy Mix in 2050
GDP
Due to the 5 % decline in total energy , the Chinese GDP will decline by only about 3 % , which will still leave them with the world 's largest GDP .
Population and per capita GDP
According to the UN figures , the Chinese population will have grown by about 12 % in 2050 .
This , combined with the expected 3 % drop in GDP , gives a decline of only about 13 % in per capita GDP in 2050 .
India : a Nation in Distress
Table 7
Year Energy ( Mtoe ) Pop. ( x 106 ) GDP ( $ Millions ) Per Capita GDP Oil Gas Coal Hydro Nuc. Renew .
Total 2006 120 36 238 25 4 0 423 1,130 $ 4,156,000 $ 3,678 2050 22 9 251 35 4 16 336 1,529 $ 3,559,573 $ 2,328
For its population , India has a much smaller energy base than the USA or even China .
Oil
India 's oil production has been constant for the last decade , though its consumption and imports have been slowly rising .
India currently imports about two thirds of its oil requirements .
That level of imports leaves it in a very vulnerable position as the international export market dries up .
Its domestic production is barely enough to cover the mathematically projected oil consumption in 2050 ( 20 % of current consumption ) , so any decline in their production could drop India below even the projected 22 million tonnes per year .
Gas
Natural gas production in India has risen by 25 % since 2000 but its imports have recently shown a sharp rise - from 0 in 2003 to 20 % of their consumption in 2006 .
As in the case of China 's gas consumption , this is probably due to India 's ongoing industrialization .
The relatively small amount of natural gas used in India and their relatively healthy level of production means that even if depletion strikes other continental gas exporters India 's gas supplies may fare somewhat better than the model indicates .
Coal
Like China , India has placed great reliance on coal as a proportion of their energy supply .
It is likely that this dependence will continue in the years and decades to come .
As a result , it is possible that India may exceed the expectations of the model to some extent , especially as a growing population demands enough electricity to live a basic life .
On the other hand , the resulting ecological damage expected in China would also be expected in India , and might , to some extent slow the growth of coal power .
For now , the picture is unclear enough to warrant moving away from the model 's projections for coal .
Hydro
India 's hydro development is expected to be on par with the global
projection .
However , in this case the reduction of Himalayan glaciers due to global warming may reduce water flows faster than experienced in other parts of the world .
This reduction would slow the development of more hydro power , which would act to offset any gains in the coal sector .
As with coal , we will accept the projections for hydro , on the assumption that any shortfall could be broadly balanced by increased generation in other energy sectors .
Nuclear
India is also taking the development of nuclear power seriously , with 19 reactors currently in the planning or proposal stages .
There is a possibility for India to outperform the model 's projections over the next couple of decades , but this performance should be taken with a grain of salt .
A trend towards de-industrialization driven by declining oil and gas supplies may put the brakes on nuclear development after 2025 .
This trend could manifest not only as a loss of industrial capacity , but also in a loss of the capital required to support such a technologically intensive enterprise .
Renewables
There are significant opportunities for solar power in India , both in small photovoltaic installations and in the use of thermal solar generation .
At the moment there is n't much penetration of solar power in India , especially for utility - scale electricity .
There has been some installation of point application solar power , for running specific services like pumps , lighting etc . where grid feeds are not available .
As a result I have given India a 5 % allotment for renewable energy .
To put that amount in perspective , it would give renewables a greater role than natural gas by 2050 .
The Changing Energy Mix
India uses almost as high a proportion of coal as China , though their total energy supply is only a quarter the size .
As time goes on , coal will take on even more of the burden - not so much by choice as by default , as imported oil falls away .
It seems unlikely that renewable energy will be able to alleviate much of the 20 % drop in energy supplies projected to occur by 2050 .
Figure 6 : India Energy Mix in 2006
Figure 7 : Projected India Energy Mix in 2050
GDP
Due to the 20 % decline in total energy , in 2050 the Indian GDP will decline by about 14 % in today 's dollars .
Population and per capita GDP
According to the UN figures , the Indian population will have grown by about 35 % in 2050 .
This growth combined with the expected 14 % drop in GDP will give India a decline of 37 % in per capita GDP in 2050 .
This decline from $ 3,700 to $ 2,300 per person will represent a catastrophic drop below the poverty line for much of the Indian population .
The Big Picture
The easiest way to get a feeling for the global change this all represents is to divide the Earth 's population into three groups based on their national per capita GDP ( loosely speaking , the poor , the middle class and the rich countries ) .
The bottom group has an income of less than $ 4,000 per year .
The middle group has an income between $ 4,000 and $ 15,000 per year , and the top group has an income over $ 15,000 per year ( all numbers in 2006 dollars ) .
Here is how the number of people in each of these groups will change between now and 2050 :
Figure 8 : Per Capita GDP Distribution 2006 and 2050
The story here is the same as it was above .
In 2050 the size of the upper and middle classes remains almost constant , while the number of poor balloons to two and a half times its current level ..
Even worse , the average per capita GDP of the poor group drops from $ 2,900 today to $ 1,500 in 2050 , a drop of almost 50 % .
This is due to the burgeoning population of this group sharing the shrinking energy pie .
Another significant factor is the movement of a number of large and growing countries from the from the middle class to the poor group .
Who Are The Rich ?
The following tables give the countries that comprise the rich nations now and in 2050 - those with average per capita GDP over $ 15,000 per year .

As you can see , the world 's rich nations fare quite well in 2050 under this scenario .
The number of countries in " the club " drops by four , their population numbers shrink a little , and the per capita GDP of the group declines by 25 % .
Despite this , the rich nations are not going to escape the coming energy realignment unscathed .
The impacts they feel will be due to their heavy reliance on oil as a transportation fuel , and on the central importance of transportation to the modern industrial enterprise .
These effects will be addressed in a later article .
For now , the messages are that energy decline per se is not a lethal threat to the economies of the world 's wealthy countries , and that they will have far more options for dealing with energy changes than do the poor countries .
Who Are The Poor ?
The following tables give the countries that comprise the world 's poor nations now and in 2050 - those with average per capita GDP under $ 4,000 per year .

In sharp contrast to the outcomes expected for the rich countries , poor nations face a decidedly bleak future in 2050 .
The number of poor nations or regions jumps from 5 to 18 .
The total population of the group more than doubles while the average per capita GDP for the group drops by half .
Given the level of human misery that exists in the poor nations today , this is a decidedly ominous forecast .
Current statistics from The World Bank indicate that over a billion people today live on a single dollar a day - half of the population I listed above as comprising the poor of 2006 .
The growth in that population , coupled with the drop in per capita GDP , implies that well over twice that number will be desperately poor in 2050 - perhaps as many as 3 billion .
According to the same source , about half the world 's population today lives on less than $ 2 a day .
If the scenario developed in this article is close to being true , that number could double by 2050 .
That demographic and economic earthquake could leave 6 billion people - almost the size of today 's entire global population - trying to survive on such a pittance .
Conclusion
The conclusion is straightforward .
By 2050 well over half the world 's population will be desperately , abjectly poor , and even the rich will find themselves living in constrained circumstances as their average per capita income drops by 25 % .
Just at the time when foreign aid is most desperately needed , the nations that will be called on to supply it will be find themselves less able to deliver .
The implications for life and death in the poverty - stricken regions are dire indeed .
So far , these articles have examined only the impact of energy and demographics on the global economic picture .
Complicating factors which have not yet been addressed include : geopolitical upheavals ( primarily economic migrations and the threat of increased resource wars ) ; the effect of impoverishment on the food supply of the growing ranks of the destitute ; and the underlying drumbeat of ecological damage heralded by the droughts and floods of climate change , the loss of soil fertility and ground water supplies and the death of the oceans .
The prospects for the Earth 's poor are not likely to improve as we progress though this analysis .

WASHINGTON - Today , as two key House committees are scheduled to review FISA - related legislation , the American Civil Liberties Union urged lawmakers to keep the Fourth Amendment in FISA and require that the government get individual warrants before monitoring American phone calls and emails .
Both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are scheduled to mark up legislation aimed at fixing the controversial Protect America Act , which broadly expanded the government ’s ability to spy on Americans .
The bill being marked up is the RESTORE Act , which grants the government the use of " basket " warrants ( sometimes called " blanket " or " program " warrants ) .
Basket warrants raise major Fourth Amendment concerns as they do not require specific individuals be the targets of suspicion .
The ACLU is asking the Committees to amend the RESTORE Act to include individual warrants .
The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
" Allowing blanket warrants to be reviewed only once a year by a secret court does n’t come anywhere close to the rigorous privacy safeguards Americans deserve .
We urge both committees to examine Representative Rush Holt ’s bill , ‘ The FISA Modernization Act of 2007 ’ if they are looking for legislation that can pass constitutional muster .
" Congress is under no obligation to pass either of these bills - it can let the disastrous Protect America Act expire .
When the bill expires in February , FISA will still be intact and will allow for surveillance .
If Congress is determined to pass legislation to fix the Protect America
Act instead of letting it expire , then civil liberties concerns must be addressed .
We urge the committees to not let politics trump policy and to stand up for the document they swore to uphold - the Constitution .
" The ACLU adamantly opposes any provision that would give telcom companies amnesty for their role in warrantless wiretapping program .
The telecom companies broke the law while aiding the administration in the illegal domestic spying program and should not be let off the hook for their role .
The Administration has refused to comply with requests from Congress to provide the legal rationale behind the program , effectively digging its heels in like a spoiled child .
Congress should not be in the habit of rewarding the behavior of an overzealous and overreaching executive branch .
It certainly should not be offering amnesty to private corporations that violated the Fourth Amendment rights of its customers .
The telecom companies broke the law and violated the Constitution and they must face the consequences . "

The Nobel citation said Dr. Fert and Dr. Grünberg ’s work also heralded the advent of a new , even smaller and denser type of memory storage called spintronics , in which information is stored and processed by manipulating the spins of electrons .
Engineers have been recording information magnetically and reading it out electrically since the dawn of the computer age , but as they have endeavored to pack more and more data onto their machines , they have been forced to use smaller and fainter magnetic inscriptions and thus more and more sensitive readout devices .
It has long been known that magnetic fields can affect the electrical resistance of magnetic materials like iron .
Current flows more easily along field lines than across them .
The effect was useful for sensing magnetic fields , and in heads that read magnetic disks .
But it amounted to only a small change in resistance , and physicists did not think there were many prospects for improvement .
So it was a surprise in 1988 when groups led by Dr. Fert at the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides and by Dr. Grünberg found that super - slim sandwiches of iron and chromium showed enhanced sensitivity to magnetic fields — “ giant magnetoresistance , ” as Dr. Fert called it .
The name stuck .
The reason for the effect has to do with what physicists call the spin of electrons .
When the magnetic layers of the sandwich have their fields pointing in the same direction , electrons whose spin points along that direction can migrate freely through the sandwich , but electrons that point in another direction get scattered .

If , however , one of the magnetic layers is perturbed , by , say , reading a small signal , it can flip its direction so that its field runs opposite to the other one .
In that case , no matter which way an electron points , it will be scattered and hindered from moving through the layers , greatly increasing the electrical resistance of the sandwich .
The 200th anniversary of the death of Newton falls at this time .
One 's thoughts cannot but turn to this shining spirit , who pointed out , as none before or after him did , the path of Western thought and research and practical construction .
He was not only an inventor of genius in respect of particular guiding methods ; he also showed a unique mastery of the empirical material known in his time , and he was marvelously inventive in special mathematical and physical demonstrations .
For all these reasons he deserves our deep veneration .
He is , however , a yet more significant figure than his own mastery makes him , since he was placed by fate at a turning point in the world 's intellectual development .
This is brought home vividly to us when we recall that before Newton there was no comprehensive system of physical causality which could in any way render the deeper characters of the world of concrete experience .
The great materialists of ancient Greek civilization had indeed postulated the reference of all material phenomena to a process of atomic movements controlled by rigid laws , without appealing to the will of living creatures as an independent cause .
Descartes , in his own fashion , had revived this ultimate conception .
But it remained a bold postulate , the problematic ideal of a school of philosophy .
In the way of actual justification of our confidence in the existence of an entirely physical causality , virtually nothing had been achieved before Newton .
Newton 's aim Newton 's aim was to find an answer to the question :
Does there exist a simple rule by which the motion of the heavenly bodies of our planetary system can be completely calculated , if the state of motion of all these bodies at a single moment is known ?
Kepler 's empirical laws of the motion of the planets , based on Tycho Brahe 's observations , were already enunciated , and demanded an interpretation . *
These laws gave a complete answer to the question of how the planets moved round the sun ( elliptical orbit , equal areas described by the radius vector in equal periods , relation between semi-major axis and period of revolution ) .
But these rules do not satisfy the requirement of causality .
The three rules are logically independent of one another , and show no sign of any interconnection .
The third law cannot be extended numerically as it stands , from the sun to another central body ; there is , for instance , no relation between a planet 's period of revolution round the sun and the period of revolution of a moon round its planet .
But the principal thing is that these laws have reference to motion as a whole , and not to the question of how there is developed from one condition of motion of a system that which immediately follows it in time .
They are , in our phraseology of today , integral laws and not differential laws .
It was , no doubt , especially impressive to learn that the cause of the movements of the heavenly bodies is identical with the force of gravity so familiar to us from everyday experience .
The differential law is the form which alone entirely satisfies the modern physicist 's requirement of causality .
The clear conception of the differential law is one of the greatest of Newton 's intellectual achievements .
What was needed was not only the idea but a formal mathematical method which was , indeed , extant in rudiment but had still to gain a systemic shape .
This also Newton found in the differential and integral calculus .
It is unnecessary to consider whether Leibniz arrived at these same mathematical methods independently of Newton or not ; in any case , their development was a necessity for Newton , as they were required in order to give Newton the means of expressing his thought .
From Galileo to Newton Galileo had already made a significant first step in the recognition of the law of motion .
He discovered the law of inertia and the law of free falling in the Earth 's field of gravitation : A mass ( or , more accurately , a material point ) uninfluenced by other masses moves uniformly in a straight line ; the vertical velocity of a free body increases in the field of gravity in proportion to the time .
It may seem to us today to be only a small step from Galileo 's observations to Newton 's laws of motion .
But it has to be observed that the two propositions above , in the form in which they are given , relate to motion as a whole , while Newton 's law of motion gives an answer to the question :
How does the condition of motion of a point - mass change in an infinitely small period under the influence of an external force ?
Only after proceeding to consider the phenomenon during an infinitely short period ( differential law ) does Newton arrive at a formula which is applicable to all motions .
He takes the conception of force from the already highly developed theory of statics .
He is only able to connect force with acceleration by introducing the new conception of mass , which , indeed , is supported curiously enough by an apparent definition .
Today we are so accustomed to forming conceptions which correspond to differential quotients that we can hardly realize any longer how great a capacity for abstraction was needed to pass across a double barrier to the general differential laws of motion , with the further need to evolve the conception of mass .
But this was still a long way from the causal comprehension of the phenomena of motion .
For the motion was only determined by the equation of motion if the force was given .
Newton had the idea , to which he was probably led by the laws of the planetary motions , that the force acting on a mass is determined by the position of all masses at a sufficiently small distance from the mass in question .
Not until this connection was realized was a completely causal comprehension of the phenomena of motion obtained .
How Newton , proceeding from Kepler 's laws of the motion of planets , solved this problem for gravitation and so discovered the identity of the nature of gravity with the motive forces acting on the stars is common knowledge .
It is only the combination of — ( Law of motion ) + ( Law of attraction ) through which is constituted that wonderful thought - structure which enables the earlier and later conditions of a system to be calculated from the conditions ruling at one particular time , insofar as the phenomena occur under the sole influence of the forces of gravitation .
The logical completeness of Newton 's system of ideas lay in the fact that the sole causes of the acceleration of the masses of a system prove to be the masses themselves .
On the basis sketched Newton succeeded in explaining the motions of the planets , moons , comets , down to fine details as well as the ebb and flow of the tides and the precessional movement of the Earth — this last a deductive achievement of particular brilliance .
It was , no doubt , especially impressive to learn that the cause of the movements of the heavenly bodies is identical with the force of gravity so familiar to us from everyday experience .
Significance of Newton 's achievement
The significance , however , of Newton 's achievement lay not only in its provision of a serviceable and logically satisfactory basis for mechanics proper ; up to the end of the 19th century it formed the program of all theoretical research .
All physical phenomena were to be referred to as masses subject to Newton 's law of motion .
Only the law of force had to be amplified and adapted to the type of phenomena which were being considered .
Newton himself tried to apply the program in optics , on the hypothesis that light consisted of inert corpuscles .
The optics of the undulatory theory also made use of Newton 's law of motion , the law being applied to continuously diffused masses .
The kinetic theory of heat rested solely on Newton 's formulae of motion ; and this theory not only prepared people 's minds for recognition of the law of the conservation of energy , but also supplied a theory of gases confirmed in its smallest details , and a deepened conception of the nature of the second law of thermodynamics .
The theory of electricity and magnetism also developed down to modern times entirely under the guidance of Newton 's basic ideas ( electric and magnetic substance , forces at a distance ) .
Even Faraday and Maxwell 's revolution in electrodynamics and optics , which was the first great advance in the fundamental principles of theoretical physics since Newton , was still achieved entirely under the guidance of Newton 's ideas .
Maxwell , Boltzmann , and Lord Kelvin never tired of trying again and again to reduce electromagnetic fields and their dynamical reciprocal action to mechanical processes occurring in continuously distributed hypothetical masses .
But owing to the barrenness , or at least the unfruitfulness , of these efforts there gradually occurred , after the end of the 19th century , a revulsion in fundamental conceptions ; theoretical physics outgrew Newton 's framework , which had for nearly two centuries provided fixity and intellectual guidance for science .
Newton ’s theory of motion suffered its first shock from Maxwell ’s theory of electricity .
Newton on its limitations Newton 's basic principles were so satisfying from a logical standpoint that the impulse to fresh departures could only come from the pressure of the facts of experience .
Before I enter into this I must emphasize that Newton himself was better aware of the weak sides of his thought - structure than the succeeding generations of students .
This fact has always excited my reverent admiration ; I should like , therefore , to dwell a little on it .
Although everyone has remarked how Newton strove to represent his thought - system as necessarily subject to the confirmation of experience , and to introduce the minimum of conceptions not directly referable to matters of experience , he makes use of the conceptions of absolute space and absolute time .
In our own day he has often been criticized for this .
But it is in this very point that Newton is particularly consistent .
He had recognized that the observable geometrical magnitudes ( distances of material points from one another ) and their change in process of time do not completely determine movements in a physical sense .
He shows this in the famous bucket experiment .
There is , therefore , in addition to masses and their distances , varying with time , something else , which determines what happens ; this " something " he conceives as the relation to " absolute space . "
He recognizes that space must possess a sort of physical reality if his laws of motion are to have a meaning , a reality of the same sort as the material points and their distances .
This clear recognition shows both Newton 's wisdom and a weak side of his theory .
For a logical construction of the theory would certainly be more satisfactory without this shadowy conception ; only those objects ( point - masses , distances ) would then come into the laws whose relation to our perceptions is perfectly clear .
The introduction of direct instantaneously acting forces at a distance into the exposition of the effects of gravitation does not correspond to the character of most of the phenomena which are familiar to us in our daily experience .
Newton meets this objection by pointing out that his law of reciprocal gravitation is not to be taken as an ultimate explanation , but as a rule induced from experience .
Newton 's theory offered no explanation of the very remarkable fact that the weight and inertia of a body are determined by the same magnitude ( the mass ) .
The remarkable nature of this fact struck Newton also .
None of these three points can rank as a logical objection against the theory .
They form , as it were , merely unsatisfied needs of the scientific spirit in its effort to penetrate the processes of nature by a complete and unified set of ideas .
The theory of the electromagnetic field Newton 's theory of motion , considered as a program for the whole field of theoretical physics , suffered its first shock from Maxwell 's theory of electricity .
It was found that the reciprocal action between bodies through electrical and magnetic bodies does not take place through instantaneously acting forces at a distance , but through processes which are transmitted with finite velocity through space .
Alongside the point - mass and its movements there arose , in Faraday 's conception , a new sort of physically real thing , the " field . "
It was first sought to conceive this , with the aid of mechanical modes of thought , as a mechanical condition ( of movement or strain ) of a hypothetical space - filling medium ( the ether ) .
When , however , in spite of the most obstinate efforts , this mechanical interpretation refused to work , students slowly accustomed themselves to the conception of the " electromagnetic field " as the ultimate irreducible foundation stone of physical reality .
We owe to [ Heinrich ]
Hertz the deliberate liberation of the conception of the field from all the scaffolding of the conceptions of mechanics , and to [ Hendrik Antoon ]
Lorentz the liberation of the conception of the field from a material bearer ; according to Lorentz the physical empty space ( or ether ) alone figured as bearer of the field ; in Newton 's mechanics , indeed , space had not been devoid of all physical functions .
When this development had been completed , no one any longer believed in directly acting instantaneous forces at a distance , even in connection with gravitation , though a field theory for gravitation , for lack of sufficient known facts , was not unmistakably indicated .
The development of the theory of the electromagnetic field also led , after Newton 's hypothesis of action at a distance had been abandoned , to the attempt to find an electromagnetic explanation for Newton 's law of motion , or to replace that law by a more accurate law based on the field theory .
These efforts were not crowned with full success , but the mechanical basic conceptions ceased to be regarded as foundation stones of the physical conception of the universe .
The Maxwell - Lorentz theory led inevitably to the special theory of relativity , which , by destroying the conception of absolute simultaneity , negatived the existence of forces at a distance .
Under this theory mass is not an unalterable magnitude , but a magnitude dependent on ( and , indeed , identical with ) the amount of energy .
The theory also showed that Newton 's law of motion can only be considered as a limiting law valid only for small velocities , and substituted for it a new law of motion , in which the velocity of light in a vacuum appears as the limiting velocity .
The general theory of relativity
The last step in the development of the program of the field theory was the general theory of relativity .
Quantitatively it made little modification in Newton 's theory , but qualitatively a deep - seated one .
Inertia , gravitation , and the metrical behavior of bodies and clocks were reduced to the single quality of a field , and this field in turn was made dependent on the bodies ( generalization of Newton 's law of gravitation or of the corresponding field law , as formulated by Siméon Denis Poisson ) .
Space and time were so divested , not of their reality , but of their causal absoluteness ( absoluteness - influencing , that is , not - influenced ) , which Newton was compelled to attribute to them in order to be able to give expression to the laws then known .
The generalized law of inertia takes over the role of Newton 's law of motion .
From this short characterization it will be clear how the elements of Newton 's theory passed over into the general theory of relativity , the three defects above mentioned being at the same time overcome .
It appears that within the framework of the general theory of relativity the law of motion can be deduced from the law of the field , which corresponds to Newton 's law of force .
“ The whole development of our ideas concerning natural phenomena may be conceived as an organic development of Newton ’s thought . ”
Newton 's mechanics prepared the way for the theory of fields in a yet more formal sense .
The application of Newton 's mechanics to continuously distributed masses led necessarily to the discovery and application of partial differential equations , which in turn supplied the language in which alone the laws of the theory of fields could be expressed .
In this formal connection also Newton 's conception of the differential law forms the first decisive step to the subsequent development .
The whole development of our ideas concerning natural phenomena , which has been described above , may be conceived as an organic development of Newton 's thought .
But while the construction of the theory of fields was still actively in progress , the facts of heat radiation , spectra , radioactivity , and so on revealed a limit to the employment of the whole system of thought , which , in spite of gigantic successes in detail , seems to us today completely insurmountable .
Many physicists maintain , not without weighty arguments , that in face of these facts not only the differential law but the law of causality itself — hitherto the ultimate basic postulate of all natural science — fails .
The very possibility of a spatio - temporal construction which can be clearly brought into consonance with physical experience is denied .
That a mechanical system should permanently admit only discrete values of energy or discrete states — as experience , so to say , directly shows — seems at first hardly deducible from a theory of fields working with differential equations .
The method of [ Louis ] De Broglie and [ Erwin ]
Schrödinger , which has , in a certain sense , the character of a theory of fields , does deduce , on the basis of differential equations , from a sort of consideration of resonance the existence of purely discrete states and their transition into one another in amazing agreement with the facts of experience ; but it has to dispense with a localization of the mass - particles and with strictly causal laws .
Who would be so venturesome as to decide today the question whether causal law and differential law , these ultimate premises of Newton 's treatment of nature , must definitely be abandoned ?
AT&T's removal of Eddie Vedder 's anti-Bush sentiments from a webcast was not an isolated incident , according to a response issued by the company to Wired News .
The company 's initial response was that the deletion was a mistake , and that it " does not edit or censor performances . "
However , after confronted with an email sent to Wired News claiming that AT&T had erased artists ' political commentary from two previously - webcast shows , the company admitted that it had , in fact , excised political speech from " a handful " of its previous webcasts :
" It 's not our intent to edit political comments in webcasts on attblueroom.com .
Unfortunately , it has happened in the past in a handful of cases .
We have taken steps to ensure that it wo n't happen again . "
I do n't doubt that AT&T has fired whoever who hit the mute button every time they heard criticism of the government , and it 's highly likely that such editing will cease to occur .
Regardless , AT&T 's assertion that in the absence of net neutrality regulation it will not filter information traveling through its network based on political content now rings a bit hollow .

There is n’t really much Kool - Aid to drink in this instance , but I thought I might talk about how much mileage I have recently gotten out of using CGI :: Application , a web application framework .
There are two directions I could go with this .
One is for people who might be contemplating a Perl5 web framework and looking for someone to tip the balance one way or another , or maybe just give them a sense of what it would be easiest to do .
That essay and some associated points follow , and all but three of my regular readers probably want to skip it .
The other direction is some general rambling about abstraction in the abstract , which I might get to in a day or two .
+
Anyway , I had to start a little web application from scratch the other day , so I started looking for a framework , because I needed a lot of the sort of things you suspect someone has already written .
My criteria were as follows :
My choices are basically PHP or something in Perl5 , and PHP blows goat dick .
( I meant to assert that PHP is fantastically successful , and has everything you need , as long as you do n’t need to feel good about yourself in the morning , but why obscure the fundamental point ? )
I need it to be relatively lightweight , without too many hairy dependencies .
In particular , I would mostly like to stick with pure Perl and avoid modules which require compiling C on my target machine .
I would like for the basic abstraction to be simple and not terribly opinionated .
I want to use a nice template language for pages .
I looked at Catalyst , Jifty , and CGI : : Application .
The first two were interesting , but fell down on the dependency question .
For purely pragmatic reasons , I doubted it would be worth the effort installing them on my target machine , and I suspect I was right .
As it stands , I spent nearly a day on DBD ::SQLite , the single XS module I wound up using .
I ’d prefer not to talk further about that experience , beyond noting in passing that just because it feels wrong to wrap
perl Makefile .
PL make
in a CGI script , FTP it to the right location , and watch something build in your browser does n’t mean that you should n’t give it a shot .
CGI :: Application caught my attention because its core abstraction is basically a dispatch table in the context of use CGI .
Here is a concrete example :
# in FieldTrip.pm package FieldTrip ; use base ' CGI : : Application ' ; sub setup { my $ self = shift ; $ self -> start_mode ( ' viewtrip ' ) ; $ self -> run_modes ( ' viewtrip ' => ' viewtrip ' , ) ; } sub viewtrip { my $ self = shift ; return " Here is a trip .
" ; } 1 ; # and then in a wrapper script called ft.cgi ... use FieldTrip ; my $ ft = FieldTrip -> new ; $ ft ->run ;
ft.cgi can now be called like ft.cgi?rm=viewtrip , and you ’ll get the appropriate result .
Actually , you ’ll get it even without the runmode parameter , since viewtrip is also the start mode .
This is pretty darned simple .
It certainly did n’t require me to wrap my brain around much before I could evaluate its merits in real code .
CGI :: Application also comes with a plugin architecture , and the plugins have so - far tended to be nicely discrete pieces of functionality which work as advertised .
The above becomes something like this , with a little help :
package FieldTrip ; use base ' CGI :: Application ' ; use CGI :: Application : : Plugin:: AutoRunmode ; sub viewtrip : StartRunmode { my $ self = shift ; # etc. } 1 ;
Here ’s my list of plugins :
CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: DBH
CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: Redirect
CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: Session
CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: AutoRunmode
CGI :: Application :: Plugin:: Authentication
CGI :: Application :: Plugin::TT
Some other modules attracted me on the basis of simple / powerful :
Template Toolkit has nice syntax , any control structure you are likely to want , broad configurability , and good integration with CGI : : A. I used CGI :: Application : : Plugin : : TT , but there ’s another option called AnyTemplate .
Nate Wiger ’s SQL :: Abstract .
Class :: Accessor generates getter / setter methods for you , which saves a ton of boilerplate code .
DBD ::SQLite provides a DBI interface to SQLite and actually bundles a distribution of same .
I dind’t have access to MySQL , and probably do n’t need it for the 30 or 40 uses a day this thing is likely to see .
This has n’t been without its headaches , but overall I think it was the right idea .
In the end , I wound up with a project that looks a little like this :
FieldTrip.pm -
The app proper .
index.cgi - Wrapper script .
fieldtrip.db - Data store .
lib / - Dependencies .
pages / - Templates .
resources / - CSS , image files , JavaScript .
Thing.pm -
A base class which deals with pulling things out of the db and shoving them back in .
Subclasses provide a list of fields and a table to draw on , along with methods for things like “ render this notes field as HTML ” or “ calculate this person ’s age ” .
It is like the world ’s most ghetto quasi-ORM , and it was probably a mistake not to get Class : : DBIx working instead .
Within FieldTrip.pm , my runmodes all look like this :
sub viewtrip : Runmode { return $ _ [ 0 ] -> thing_out (
" Thing : : Trip " , ' View trip details ' ) ; }
Which involves some contortions elsewhere that I should probably simplify ( maybe by just generating view , edit , and save modes for each kind of Thing with Class : : Accessor ) , but is pretty close to declarative .
Adding a runmode can be as simple as four or five lines of code in FieldTrip.pm and an appropriately named template in the pages directory .
Mid -way through this project , I realized that I could spend a little extra time and sell a small application built on exactly the same framework to another client .
In order to do this , I had to put a single table in a SQLite database , create a 20 - line subclass of Thing.pm , and rewrite a couple of templates .
This was remarkably painless .

Journalism with a point of view is a fine thing .
It 's what I do .
The difference is that I say I 'm a liberal journalist while Fox executives and " reporters " insist they play it straight .
But everyone in the US knows that my description is true .
This is precisely why its fans watch it .
Walk into any bar , hair salon , gym or motel lobby in the country ; if the TV is tuned to Fox rather than CNN , you know that the owner or clientele or both are Republican .
It 's a secret - although not actually secret any more - sign of fraternity among conservatives , the way a solid red tie worn by a single urban man used to signal to other urban men that the wearer was indeed " that way " .
So everyone knows , but , because of the conventions of journalistic propriety , Fox can't admit that it 's a Republican outfit .
It would have no credibility with politicians if it did and would be too easily dismissed as " ideological media " .
To get around this problem , its marketers devised what must be the most deviously ingenious pair of advertising slogans of all time : " We report , you decide " and " Fair and balanced " .
And so , for a decade and more , Fox has got away with an amazing thing : it can call itself a " straight " news channel even while everyone knows it 's not .
It 's a great little racket .
Every so often , a Toto comes along and tugs at the curtain - earlier this year , for instance , the Democratic presidential aspirants agreed that they would not participate in any debates hosted by Fox because there was no point in getting up there and being asked questions merely for the purpose of providing footage that the eventual Republican nominee could use against them .
But these moments have been rare .
Last week brought an event with the potential to change all that .
Judith Regan , a former
Fox host perhaps best known in the UK as the , um , brains behind the OJ Simpson If I Did It mediapalooza , has sued her former employer for wrongful dismissal .
So what ?
So this .
Regan spent some portion of the dawn of the 21st century having an affair with NYC's then police commissioner , Bernard Kerik .
The commissioner was recently indicted by a federal prosecutor in New York for alleged misdeeds dating from his time as a public servant .
Kerik is a very close associate of presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani - so close that Giuliani once recommended Kerik to President Bush as homeland security director .
The nomination advanced far enough for Bush to stand at Kerik 's side at a press conference .
But suddenly , the doors blew open and the allegations against Kerik - that he'd renovated his home with ill - gotten gains , and more distressingly that he had suspected connections to organised crime - ended his nomination quickly .
Ever since then , the question has loomed over Giuliani : when did he know that the man he recommended to run America 's security was alleged to have mob ties ?
( A now deceased investigator once suggested that he warned Giuliani , but Giuliani says he has no memory of this . )
Regan , naturally enough given her special knowledge of the man , was questioned about Kerik by federal investigators .
And she now alleges that two executives of Fox News instructed her to " lie to , and withhold information from " the investigators about Kerik .
Regan charges that Fox executives did this because they feared the inquiry into Kerik might singe Giuliani , whose presidential ambitions , her complaint charges , Fox has long been intent on " protecting " .
Let 's linger over that for a moment .
Two executives of a major news organisation may have told a citizen to lie to federal investigators to protect a presidential candidate .
It 's a stunning charge .
If proven someday , Fox will no longer be able to hide behind the fiction that it's a neutral news outfit .
In the meantime , Democrats should ratchet up their refusal to pretend that Fox bears any relationship to news .
I 've always felt they should just boycott the network en bloc .
One can be pretty confident that if the situation were reversed - imagine a cable channel that was known as a Democratic house organ and run by , say , Bill Clinton adviser James Carville - Republicans would have done something like that long ago .
I asked Nancy Pelosi , the House Democratic speaker , about this last Friday , and she just replied wanly : " I think we have to reach out to all the viewers out there . "
I guess I did n't really expect her to say more on the record .
But if the day ever comes that Fox is no longer allowed to have it both ways , Democrats wo n't have to keep playing along with the rabbit - hole fiction that Fox is a genuine news - gathering operation .

DIGG THIS
Shame has vanished from Western “ civilization . ”
Hypocrisy has taken its place .
On September 28 , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown could be heard on National Public Radio decrying the use of violence against democratic protesters by the government in Burma .
Brown declared the British people ’s revulsion over the violence inflicted by the Burmese government on its people .
But Brown said nothing about the violence the British government was inflicting on Iraqis and Afghans .
George W. Bush also struck the blameless pose when he declared : “ The world is watching the people of Burma take to the streets to demand their freedom , and the American people stand in solidarity with these brave individuals . ”
Bush and Brown do not have the same sympathy for the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Neither Bush nor Brown stand in solidarity with those who are demanding their freedom from foreign occupation by American and British troops .
Indeed , Bush and Brown , as commanders in chief , are on a killing spree that makes the government in Burma look extremely restrained by comparison .
Why were British soldiers sent to kill Iraqis and Afghans ?
September 11 had nothing whatsoever to do with the UK .
No doubt but that the corrupt Tony Blair was paid off to drag the British people into Bush ’s Middle East war for American / Israeli hegemony , but Brown has done nothing to terminate Bush ’s use of the British military as mercenaries .
The NPR announcers also supported the Burmese people , but they , too , show little disturbance over Bush ’s five - year old wars that we now know were based entirely on lies .
Al Qaeda is not the Taliban , and Iraq had no WMD .
Neither country was a threat to the US .
Now that we know this , why does the media still give Bush and Brown a free pass to use violence against Iraqis and Afghans ?
To cut to the chase , what is the difference between Bush and Brown on one hand and the murderous Burmese government on the other ?
Bush and Brown are actually worse .
They pretend to be democrats concerned with what people actually want .
The Burmese government does n’t pretend to be anything but a military dictatorship .
Moreover , the Burmese government is clean by comparison as it has n’t committed acts of naked aggression — war crimes under the Nuremberg standard — by invading other countries and attempting to occupy them .
Despite all the killing Bush has accomplished , he thirsts for yet more blood .
Iran is in his and Israel ’s sights .
All indications are that Bush is going to attack Iran .
Propaganda , demonizations , and crass lies are pouring out of the Bush regime and its media and academic propagandists such as Columbia University president Lee Bollinger .
Both parties in Congress have lined up behind the coming attack on Iran .
The despicable senator Joe Lieberman even snuck language into a bill to give Bush the go ahead .
Who is going to stop Bush from a third war crime ?
Not his vice president , Not his national security adviser , not his secretary of defense .
Not his secretary of state .
Not Congress .
Not the US military .
Not the corporate fat cats .
Not the Israel Lobby .
Not the bought and paid for “ allies . ”
Not the anti-war movement .
Not the American people .
Certainly not the media .
Americans are content with whatever crimes their government commits as long as the justification is Americans ’ safety .
Americans ’ willingness to murder others out of fear for their own safety is a result of September 11 .
The antiwar movement is impotent , because it has accepted the government ’s 9/11 story .
To oppose a war when you accept the government ’s reason for the war is an indefensible position .
The Bush regime knows that if people will believe its 9/11 story , they will believe anything .
Propaganda silences facts , and Americans fall for one set of falsehoods after another .
The alleged 9/11 hijackers all came from countries allied with the US , principally Saudi Arabia , but Americans believe the government ’s lies that Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , and Syria are responsible .
Americans have been convinced that without “ regime change ” in these countries , the American superpower will remain helpless in face of stateless Muslims armed with box cutters .
Americans have been brainwashed to believe that Muslims hate us for our “ freedom and democracy , ” whereas in fact the problem is the US government ’s immoral foreign policy and interference in the internal affairs of Muslim countries .
Bush ’s message to the Middle East is clear :
Be a puppet state or be destroyed .
In the meantime , to prevent democracy and civil liberties from getting in the way of making Americans safe , Bush has set aside habeas corpus , due process , right to legal representation , privacy , and the separation of powers mandated by the US Constitution .
Otherwise , Bush says , we will lose the “ war on terror . ”
Bush says he has made Americans safe by ridding them of these constitutional impediments to their safety .
And once American bombs fall on Iran and Syria , those countries will be free and democratic , too , like Iraq and Afghanistan .
In leading Americans to this conclusion , Bush has sunk the United States to a new low in human intelligence and morality .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
But the research has so far been limited to mice , perhaps offering addicts one last justification for hanging onto the habit .
In the research , published in the American Journal of Physiology , mice were exposed to cigarette smoke and fed either a low fat diet or a feast .
The results show smoking mice might have eaten less but they still kept the kilograms .
Professor of pharmacology at the University of New South Wales Margaret Morris says if it is true , humans who smoke are probably losing muscle and other precious organs , not fat .
Increased appetite
She says people who quit smoking and then complain that they have actually put on weight probably have because of increased appetite .
" In many people and in our animals , cigarette smoke suppresses signals that increase appetite , " she said .
" So the powerful chemical message induced by smoking to suppress feeding and withdrawal of nicotine is unhelpful in that regard .
" So I think the message from this study is that using smoking to suppress body weight gain , if you 're overweight , is not going to be helpful . "
While the number of people smoking continues to fall , it has been tougher getting the message through to young women .
Dr Morris says although young women might think they look slimmer , they are now being told it is actually muscle not fat they are losing .
" Our work actually points out that this is a very powerful health message - if it 's true in humans - that the combination of these two behaviours is very , very unhealthy , " she said .
Dr Morris says it is important for more research to be done .
" It 's very hard to do these studies in humans , clearly , " she said .
" This is a long - term study , we 've fed the animals for seven weeks , the smoking was equivalent to moderate cigarette smoking in humans , we know that they had carboxyhaemoglobin levels in that range .
" So , if we can make the leap into humans , yes , I think it is quite important . "

BoomersTV party podcasts [ link ]
Last night I attended a party celebrating the launch of the BoomersTV series of shows on PBS .
About a year ago I helped set up their blog and in return they helped me set up video equipment for my copyright training video .
In the meantime they got funding and produced lots of shows .
The party included some " professional " media production people , so as a podcaster I had some time to talk " shop " -- and record some of it as podcasts that I think others interested in podcasting might like .
First I talked with John Osborne of Osborne Associates .
He 's a sound person .
He 's worked on lots of projects over the last 20 years or so and is doing reality TV stuff right now .
When I mentioned the mike I use in my " studio " ( a Shure SM7B ) he told me how he worked with Jean Shepherd for Disney who liked that mike .
I used to listen to " Shep " quite a lot as a kid on the distant station of WOR in New York so I loved hearing that .
I asked John lots of questions about equipment and stuff .
His answers were aimed at people looking to do a " professional " job , so some of the equipment mentioned fits that price range , but it 's really cool to listen to a pro even if you can't afford it .
Realize that this was all recorded in a quite noisy club , with music , bar , candlepin bowling , and the Patriots football on TV -- a good test for my equipment ( Sennheiser MD46 mike , Edirol R - 1 recorder ) and technique .
Next I talked to Mark Mills ( co- founder Nancy Mills ' husband , co-host of the show , certified financial planner , and currently executive producer of Greater Boston on WGBH - TV ) .
He talked about the show and then I asked him questions about funding , etc. , that might be of interest to others ( including podcasters ) interested in making a living in independent media .
To listen to the podcasts , look at the entries on my blog podcast page ( John Osborne and Mark Mills ) or subscribe to the podcast RSS feed .
They are about 14 and 12 minutes long , respectively .
Here are some pictures .
Bill Charette , BoomersTV co-founder provided the first four , I took the last one .
Bill is the one who helped me set up my video studio and more .
He has lots of experience , having worked on WGBH's Julia Child , Zoom , Frontline , American Experience , Nova , Masterpiece Theater , as well as 20 / 20 , The Today Show , and more .

Geek dinner in Cambridge and wikiCalc podcast [ link ]
Dave Winer is in town this week and he proposed a " geek dinner " at a food court in a mall in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
I met David Berlind right before and we recorded a podcast for ZDNet in my car in the parking garage ( a close place that was much quieter than the food court ) .
We talked about the new release of wikiCalc that I hope to have later next week ( it 's not out yet -- only the old version from November is available for download ! ) that takes advantage of AJAX , runs on more platforms , and more .
We then joined everybody for the dinner .
I recorded about 20 minutes of some of the people talking to each other ( see below ) and then did a demo of wikiCalc for many of my fellow geeks .
My laptop battery eventually died ( it started partially charged ) so I did a lot of the demo on someone else 's machine with wikiCalc running off of a cheap shared - hosting server .
It worked quite well -- AJAX has it 's benefits .
I 'll write more about that version when it 's ready .
To listen to the podcast of me talking about wikiCalc , check out the ZDNet podcast list -- hopefully they 'll post it sometime soon .
To listen to the podcast of the Geek Dinner , check out the entry on my blog podcast page , or subscribe to the RSS feed .

Lunch with Don Bulens discussing iSCSI and the VAR channel [ link ]
I had lunch today with Don Bulens , who long - term readers of this blog will remember as the CEO of Trellix for many years .
Don is now CEO of EqualLogic .
I run into people all the time who ask how he 's doing and what 's up with him , so I devoted some of our lunch time to recording a podcast .
You will find this of interest if you are interested in Don himself , in EqualLogic and the type of products it makes ( storage area network devices ) , or the VAR channel .
He explains what SANs and iSCSI in particular are all about ( IP - based network attached storage ) , why he joined that company , and what the VAR channel is like and how it compares to the Lotus Notes days when he helped develop the Notes VAR channel .
You can find a link to the recording on my blog podcast page , or subscribe to the RSS feed .
It 's 20 minutes long and takes up a little over 9MB .
It was recorded in a noisy restaurant , but came out pretty well considering .

Podcasting on location leads to recording nightmares [ link ]
I see why professionals like having a " sound person " on their crew .
All they seem to do is hold a mike on a boom near someone or sit there with earphones twiddling dials maybe once in a while .
But I wish I had one .
It is very hard to write a software program that runs the first time without bugs .
It 's also very hard to go into a live situation and consistently get recordings done well without experience .
A studio that 's already set up is one thing , but live on location is a real challenge .
I 've already mentioned how Cringely 's NerdTV interview with me had problems .
The battery in the mike he gave me failed .
His sound engineers spent a long time retrieving something half - decent from the echoes his mike picked up .
It seems that Dan Farber of ZDNet ran into the same type of problem with his recording of salesforce .
com 's Marc Benioff -- great interview but somewhat poor sound of Marc was the best they could get .
I 've had problems , too .
As I wrote in my write - up of a podcast with Microsoft 's Dan'l Lewin , only one of multiple tries at recording him worked in the restaurant , and I missed the most interesting material .
My podcast of the Berkman Center ODF meeting ended early when my batteries died .
My recording of Jay Walker the other day had minor problems when I did n't notice that the equalization was messed up for the first 30 minutes or so ( the mixer settings moved in transit ) .
With live stuff you do n't get to try again .
To help , I usually have a backup recording .
I use my iRiver flash MP3 player for that ( my main recorder is an Edirol R - 1 ) .
I either plug it in to the same source , or better yet , a backup source , or just use its internal mike .
That way I have at least something .
( I used that backup for some of the intro to Walker 's talk . )
Why am I writing this today ?
First : I listened to Dan Farber 's interview in the car to and from the meeting this morning .
I had n't seen his post about the problem , but as soon as Marc opened his mouth it reminded me of Cringely 's problem .
I 've gotten more and more sensitive to the quality of the sound .
I find that poor sound , especially recordings with lots of echoes , to be harder to listen to , and in some conditions ( like when listening while running on a noisy street ) unlistenable no matter how good the subject matter .
I want to be kind to my listeners and I want them to come back for more .
Second : I have been very nervous about recording the meeting today .
I did n't know if anybody else would be there recording .
Dave Berlind is away at a conference , so I could n't rely on him for a backup .
Worse yet -- he was relying on me .
Lots of people were relying on me and assuming I 'd " just do it " .
At first I thought the meeting would be like previous one 's I 've attended for Senator Hart 's committee which had many people seated around tables in a circle .
I went to a pro audio / video rental place used by the local TV camera people and found out about renting a good shotgun mike .
When I called the Senator 's office , they told me this meeting would mainly be the panel and that there would be microphones in front of everybody and that I could tap into the sound system .
That 's great .
I 've done that before and it works quite well , better than a mike at a distance would , so I did n't rent the mike .
So many times recently I would show up at an event carrying lots of equipment and it turns out that all I need to do is plug in to stuff that 's already there .
When I packed for today 's meeting , I took what I needed to deal with different types of sound systems .
I had cables of all sorts with all the different types of plugs , a mixer , earphones , power supplies ( I do n't want my batteries to go again ) , extension cords , and more .
Just in case , I brought my wireless lavalier mike ( that I used to do my software copyright training video ) .
The whole thing weighed a lot and I had a long walk from the parking lot to the State House , so I did n't bring my handheld wireless , or a mike stand , or other mikes .
When I walked into the room ( about 45 minutes early as suggested ) I found no sound equipment .
When the organizers showed up I found out that they could n't get the sound equipment for some reason .
Unfortunately I had neglected to check with them yesterday .
They did try to make this work , but now it 's my problem .
Also , they did n't want people passing a mike around a lot , since they felt that would break down some of the give and take .
( Having me run around that formal room thrusting mikes in people 's faces like I do at OSS SIG meetings would n't have been the dignified style the setting and attendees deserved . )
I ended up using my wireless lavalier ( a $ 400 or so Sony ) clipped to a folded index card .
I 'd move it ( and the backup iRiver ) from lectern to table ( in front of the panelists ) and back once in a while ( you can hear that quite clearly -- sorry ) .
For people asking questions in the back of the room , I 'd sneak over holding it several feet away from them , or just rely on the reflections off of the walls and turn up the record volume .
I sat at the side of the room with earphones .
Once I got home , I spent an hour or two with Adobe Audition adjusting some volumes , compressing the dynamic range , etc. , before releasing it as a podcast .
It sounds pretty good , but it's not what I was hoping for and was a lot more work .
Sigh .
Each time I learn something new .
My conversation with Microsoft's Alan Yates [ link ]
Alan Yates , General Manager - Business Strategy at Microsoft , was one of the speakers at the meeting today in the Massachusetts Senate Reading Room .
He made it clear from statements ( his first comments start at around 44:30 of the recording ) that he wants " more choice , additional standards " for " greater value " .
It sounds from things he says over and over like they see ODF catching on so they want to make sure their standard is accepted , too ( with hopefully , from Microsoft 's view I assume , most people using mainly theirs ) .
He talks ( 50:45 ) about making the Microsoft formats " utterly , completely , perpetually open by any measurement of openness at that point . "
He talks about comparing formats now .
He talks about performance and backward compatibility .
At 53:20 he talks about how they are moving , in continuing response to what 's happening in Massachusetts , to become more open , " ... to make absolutely , utterly , totally clear that anyone -- open source developer , anyone -- can use the technology " ( 54:10 ) , and that ( 54:40 ) " you wo n't ever be sued for using this technology , whether it 's a subset , whether it 's a superset , whether it's an extension , whether you 're just using part of it , whether you 're using the whole thing , it does n't matter -- you can use this technology with no concerns . "
At 55:00 : " Microsoft has never argued really against the Open Document Format in any shape or form , Microsoft is really concerned about Massachusetts opening up to more choice , more competition , competition between standards we believe is a very good thing in this rapidly evolving area of technology . "
I talked with him for a few minutes afterwards .
I asked him if Microsoft has started the development work for supporting ODF .
He said they are looking into it or something .
I said that for something like this they should have at least two competing projects already started .
I told him that I had been involved in word processing software development on and off probably longer than anybody in the room ( I was project leader of DEC 's WPS - 8 word processing software in the mid-1970 's that was sold for many years on the DECmate ) .
I am worried that the Microsoft formats could be designed around implementation issues we had in the days of the slow 386 chip , where we were not as concerned with interchange as we are today .
We 've learned from HTML about working with many machines .
We care more now about reading on the screen .
There are more web browsers ( especially if you include cell phones ) than there are users of Microsoft Word .
I told him that we are at a major point in time .
Word processing until now ( using the Microsoft Word format ) consists of only 10 - 15 years of material for most people -- we have decades and decades more ahead of us .
The formats we develop now should look to the future .
He said he sees the formats evolving .
I said that 's right , but we should decide what to evolve from .
Maybe we should change now to a different style of organization .
( I do n't know if ODF is that style nor if the Microsoft formats are not , but that needs to be discussed . )
He said that the major criteria they have for any variation ( as the standard is modified from what they propose ) is that it support the documents of the past .
I said that we should not make that the dominant criteria -- they 've broken things in the past .
( He said they 've learned their lesson not to . )
I think this is the time before it 's too late .
While Microsoft talks about incompatibilities that must be avoided , lumping them all together , I said we need to go over each incompatibility and see how important it is .
We need an open debate , since this , the office document formats , are so important to society .
Being saddled with the past for unspecified " fidelity " of a tiny fraction of 15 years of documents ( or less ) without an open process is wrong .
Microsoft can't do this alone .
Referring to a quote by one of his competitors , I said that most of the best minds do n't work at Microsoft and figuring out ways to solve incompatibilities should involve people outside who care .
He said they are having meetings with their partners .
I said they need something more inclusive that does n't involve going to meetings in Redmond , and that many people who could help do not have the time or money for such trips .
I suggested he look at the process being used for GPL 3 to be inclusive .
He said he'd look into it .
I thought some of you might find this of interest .
MA data formats forum [ link ]
This morning the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies and the Science and Technology Caucus held a meeting titled " An Open Forum on the Future of Electronic Data Formats for the Commonwealth " .
It was held in the Senate Reading Room , and I was able to record the meeting .
A view of the people sitting in the room
The meeting was moderated by State Senator Jack Hart and Representative Cory Atkins .
Also in attendance were the other co-chairs of the committee and caucus , Representative Dan Bosley and Secretary of Economic Development Ranch Kimball , and other legislators as well as many attendees from various constituencies .
The hosts ( Sen Hart , Rep . Atkins , Sen . Hart , Rep. Bosley , Rep. Atkins , Sec'y Kimball ) and panelists
John Palfrey , Bob Sutor , Alan Yates , Alan Cote , Judy Brewer , Linda Hamel , Peter Quinn ( showing a birth certificate in a paper bag ) , and Bob Sproull
Berkman Center 's John Palfrey gave an introductory address , and then we heard from the main panel : Bob Sutor of IBM , Bob Sproull of Sun Microsystems , Peter Quinn of MA ITD , Alan Yates of Microsoft , Alan Cote from the Secretary of State 's Office , and Judy Brewer from W3 C's Web Accessibility Initiative .
ITD 's Linda Hamel was also asked to speak from the floor .
There were then some questions and statements from the audience .
You can find a link to the recording on my blog podcast page , or subscribe to the RSS feed .
It 's 2 hours and 20 minutes long and takes up a little over 64MB .
Andy Updegrove did a real - time blog of the event .

MITX Fireside Chat with Jay Walker [ link ]
Tonight there was another MITX Fireside Chat .
This time was a little different .
The location was at the MIT Museum , not the Harvard Faculty Club , so no fireplace .
The interviewer was Wall Street Journal reporter Bill Bulkeley , not Scott Kirsner ( who has moved out of town ) .
What was the same as usual was a great speaker .
Tonight 's was Jay Walker , Chairman of Walker Digital and best known for his work with Priceline.com .
If you are interested in innovation , business models , the Internet , entrepreneurship , patents , or just general business , you would have loved this meeting .
I did n't take any notes ... but I did record it for podcasting .
It 's available now .
He talks about patents at about 35:00 , and at 54:45 , after talking about Open Source , he calls Microsoft the last of the Soviet - style software development places .
He 's quite outspoken .
Listen to the whole thing .
You can find a link to it on my blog podcast page , or subscribe to the RSS feed .
Jay Walker before the talk , Bill Bulkeley and Jay as he says something to the podcast audience
There were handheld microphones that were used for the PA system .
I recorded off of that , but I also put lavalier mikes on the two of them and made a separate recording .
I used the PA version for the introduction and my lavs for all of the rest .

Recording of Gartner 's Nick Gall at Open Source SIG [ link ]
As I wrote last week , Gartner Research 's Nick Gall spoke at the Mass Technology Leadership Council 's Open Source Special Interest Group meeting .
This was a preview of slides that were to be presented at Gartner 's Open Source Summit today .
Now that the time for the " official " presentation is over , I can post the recording .
If you are interested in what a major research / consulting firm has to say about Open Source , listen to this recording .
( Hint : They like it and Nick is very knowledgeable about the issues . )
Nick makes some specific predictions about the use of Open Source in the enterprise , the size of the market in dollars , where the dollars come from , and more .
There was a lot of give and take with the audience ( which included lawyers , someone from MySQL , and others ) about the GPL , licensing and business models , and more .
Attendee Paul Gillin has written some of this up on his blog , also saying that attending the meeting , all of which is available for free download , was " ... the best $ 50 I 've spent in a long time . "
( There was an admission fee . )
Nick Gall of Gartner
This morning , while listening to the Gillmor Daily where Steve Gillmor and ZDNet 's Dan Farber discussed some topics , I had a thought .
One of them said something and the other asked a question , giving an example from some specific new product .
This reminded me of this recording with Nick .
The people asking the questions , with follow up , were very knowledgeable because they are immersed in it in their work .
The questions and responses were deep .
This is different than listening to a plain speech ( no back and forth ) , and different than a normal reporter who is n't as deeply knowledgeable of the details .
There was lots of time to get into questions ( Gillmor recordings go on as long as necessary , sometimes an hour , and this meeting had hour - long talks ) .
This is something I really like about podcasting .
It lets those that want to the ability to go deeply into something and not be superficial .
Questions get asked by people reacting to what they hear who bring more information about related material .
Great stuff for people who want to learn .
To listen to Nick , you can find a link to the MP3 on the OSS SIG 's wiki page about it .
It is also in the podcast series from the SIG which you can subscribe to .
I 'm pretty happy with how well this podcast turned out .
I did all the audio work myself , as well as led the meeting .
The room included a " portable podium " with a microphone and a wireless mike .
I plugged my mixer into it and then recorded from that .
Not knowing what was going to be in the room , I had also brought my own wireless and wired mikes just in case as well as a wide assortment of cables .
I 'm recording with an Edirol R - 1 digital recorder that can automatically limit the peak volume of stuff that 's too loud .
( There 's a lot of variation as people hold the mikes . )

I 've written a Top 10 Sources page on podcasting [ link ]
The Top 10 Sources web site " officially " launched today , I am told .
It 's actually been up for a little while , and Dave Winer has been featuring an OPML list from it on Scripting News since November 23rd .
Today , though , is the day they are starting with publicity .
It 's also the day they posted a Top 10 Site I wrote on the home page , so I figured I 'd better write something about it here , too .
( I expected them to give someone else the honor and have a few days of my list being less obvious so I could get some feedback first . )
The Top 10 Sources web site consists of a directory of subject pages .
Each page is created by an individual who is hopefully knowledgeable about the subject .
On that page they explain a little about it and link to relevant web pages or sites .
In addition , there is a list of 10 particular web sites that they have selected .
At the bottom of the page some of the most recent RSS items from those ten selected web sites are automatically listed .
It 's sort of like looking over the shoulder of an " expert " to see their RSS aggregator output .
If you especially like a particular site you have a link there to it so you can find out more and subscribe with your own RSS reader / aggregator .
For those who are n't using an RSS reader this is also a painless way to start taking advantage of RSS feeds .
A few months ago John Palfrey , Top 10 Sources founder and publisher ( and separately well known for his work as executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society ) , asked me to do some work for them .
More specifically , he wanted me to create a Top 10 Site page related to podcasting and act as a consultant .
After finishing some other consulting and getting the wikiCalc alpha release out , I finally had time to start some work a week or two ago .
The first thing was to learn about their system by actually going through the process of creating a Top 10 Site page .
That 's helping me get my hands around what their site is really about and helps them by getting feedback as I learn , comment , and complain .
The first result is a simple page listing the podcasts I listen to most .
Podcasting is too big an area for one Top 10 list , but you have to start somewhere ...
For me to feel comfortable with such a list , though , I first wanted to create an introduction for people who do n't know what podcasting is so they would n't think my narrow choice of 10 was representative of the podcasting world .
So , like here on my personal web site where I have blog posts as well as essays , I first wrote a companion page that is an introduction to the podcasting genre , with links to some particular podcasts that I feel help a newcomer get a taste of the breadth of the genre , at least at the time it started to become " hot " .
The Top 10 Sources people had n't set up a feature in their content management system for writing such essays , but after a little looking at their pages , the CSS , and other markup I was able to create something that fit in .
I hope you find what I 've written for them helpful .
It is not meant as a definitive history of podcasting , but it will help you get a feel for its early days .
See " The Genre of Podcasting " and my " Podcasts " page listing my 10 ( actually only 9 ) .

Meeting about enterprise adoption of Open Source [ link ]
Yesterday , the Mass Technology Leadership Council 's Open Source Software Special Interest Group held a meeting titled " Open Source and the Enterprise : Enterprise Adoption " .
It was quite interesting and I was able to record it .
Attendees
It had two parts .
The first was Gartner Research analyst Nick Gall .
He gave a full preview of a presentation that will be given at Gartner 's Summit next week .
It was clear from his talk that Gartner sees a continuing strong adoption of Open Source .
His talk is really worth listening to if you care about Open Source , but ... at his request I 'm holding off posting it until after the for -pay , " official " talk is given because it included all their specific numbers , predictions , etc .
Check back late next week .
It was real a treat -- there was lots of give and take ( it lasted over an hour ) with the attendees who really know their stuff on this topic and were not shy to ask detailed questions .
Nick is quite knowledgeable ( heavy IT background and was an IP litigation attorney ) and answered in kind .
The second part of the meeting consisted of two presentations by local , large , IT users .
The first was from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts .
They use a little Open Source .
The second , which took up most of the time , was from two people at Fidelity Investments ' Center for Applied Technology .
They talked about Fidelity 's history with Open Source and very specifically how they are getting it under official control with new procedures .
That hour - long recording is available now .
If you are in any way connected with enterprise use of Open Source , it is worth listening to this recording .
The Fidelity people talk about why they use Open Source , why they like it sometimes more than similar products that are proprietary ( it 's not because of the lower up front cost ) , and how they determine what to let in , do training , etc .
There were lots of questions from the attendees , many of whom are lawyers and consultants .
Julie Atkins of BCBS of MA , Mike Askew and Chuck Pickelhaupt of Fidelity
A disclaimer : I was part of Fidelity 's internal training last week on this topic , and they say nice things about my training video ( at 42:00 into the recording ... ) which they 've purchased .
To listen , you can find a link to the MP3 on the OSS SIG 's wiki page about it .

End - to - end thinking [ link ]
An extremely important paper from the early 1980s , that I frequently make reference to , is Saltzer , Reed , and Clark's " End - To - End Arguments In System Design " .
Often cited as one of the basisses for the design and ultimate scaleability of the Internet , the term " end - to - end " is also often misunderstood .
As used in the paper , " end - to - end " means each " end point " ( such as the program on a PC ) communicating to other end points -- " end point talking to end point " .
It does not mean " end point and everything along the way including the final end point " .
The whole point of the paper is that you should minimize the special casing between end points .
A " smart " network that " knows " what the end points need is what the paper argues against .
The idea is to build simple , general purpose infrastructure that does n't assume certain specific uses .
Companies that brag that they have an " end - to - end solution " when they mean " soup - to - nuts " ( or as Bob Frankston likes to say , " womb to tomb " ) solution are really saying , according to the paper , " We have a brittle , hard to evolve system tuned to what we think we know today " .
David Reed , one of the paper 's authors , just posted on SATN.org " Epidemiology end - to - end " .
In this post , David applies the end - to - end argument as part of an analysis of a proposed system for pandemic management that requires tracking passengers sharing flights .
This post is very much worth reading and understanding .
First , though , read the original End - To - End paper so you understand where David is coming from .
( A paper related to the End - To - End one is David Isenberg 's " Rise of the Stupid Network " . )
The principles in the End - To - End paper are important .
Systems like the Internet that embody them have proven to scale well and meet unforeseen needs .
Systems that do n't often fail to scale well , often do n't meet our changing needs , and often get in the way of improvement .

Dan on NerdTV [ link ]
Robert X. Cringely posted an interview he did with me on the NerdTV website ( it 's show number 10 ) .
It runs a little over an hour .
The video is about 95 MB but there is also an MP3 audio - only version as well as a transcript .
I talk about the old days , learning to program , meeting Bob Frankston , business school , a bit about wikiCalc , Open Source , and more .
It was recorded in my living room .
Here 's Cringely adjusting the camera :

Special thanks to Cringely and his team for rescuing this video .
Apparently the mike I was wearing failed and they ended up , through hours of work with modern audio software , pulling my voice out of the background of the mike on his shirt .
Shalom Uncle Nissim [ link ]
It is with great sadness that I note the passing this morning of my uncle , Nissim Albalak , my father 's sister 's husband .
While I did not see him very frequently because he lived in Israel , he was a much beloved member of my extended family and it was always a treat when I could see him .
I remember him as a warm , quiet , loving man , always patient and paying careful attention in the background and getting things done quietly and well .
When we were around him and something needed to be done we always knew that Nissim took care of it .
He was born 80 years ago and lived in Jerusalem in his youth .
His family went back something like 9 generations in the city .
( Yes , there were Jews living there for many , many years . )
He spoke many languages fluently , including English , French , Ladino , Yiddish , Hebrew , Arabic , German , and Italian , having gone to French school , lived under British rule , etc .
We will all miss him .
May his memory be a blessing .

Dinner with Dan'l Lewin of Microsoft [ link ]
I was invited to a little dinner tonight , along with John Landry and some others , with the visiting Dan'l Lewin of Microsoft .
I managed to salvage a few minutes of podcast to share , mainly discussing Ray Ozzie a bit .
Earlier in the dinner we all introduced ourselves and Dan'l answered some questions about Live , but I found out that my new recorder does n't like being paused long enough to go to sleep or something and lost that section .
Sorry .
Basically , he sounded like he could n't say much and / or did n't know the answers and that we 'll find out more in the spring ( and is probably pretty happy the recording did n't come out ... ) .
He did n't seem keen on the idea of OWA - like ( Outlook Web Access ) versions of Word , Powerpoint , and Excel .
Some of us let him know that 's what we expected him to say but were surprised because it's what people want .
( I had already told him some about wikiCalc . )
The recording is in my Dan Bricklin 's Log Podcast series and is about 4 minutes long .
Another software licensing podcast episode [ link ]
Now that I 've released the wikiCalc alpha and have finished with the flurry of Massachusetts and ODF recordings , I 've found some time to catch up on my normal podcasting .
I have a show that I recorded last month for my Software Licensing series .
This one is with attorney Stephen Gold .
Steve advises various large company in - house lawyers and we discussed Open Source licensing and how they ( and he ) deal with it , especially with the GPL .
It is an interesting window into the corporate world , and shows why dual licensing can work as a business model today even in cases where it is n't as murky as it is with MySQL .
From what I understand of the GPL version 3.0 ( which is in development but wo n't be out for at least many months after much very public discussion ) this uncertainty ( and some of the certainty ) that drives dual license revenue will probably continue even after GPL 3.0 comes out .
In fact , GPL 3.0 could make it more common if some factions prevail .
More about the GPL 3.0 at a later date .
Eben Moglen , who is working on it , has agreed to do a podcast .
Once I have time to do proper preparation we 'll do it and I 'll post it .

I 'm working on a new product called wikiCalc [ link ]
After months of waiting , I 'm finally ready to explain my next product .
I wanted to wait until I had something you could actually use so there would be a better understanding of what it was and what it was n't .
As you 'll see , given the area , people could have all sorts of ideas and I have a pretty specific idea with a few twists .
I 've just posted an alpha version for download .
It 's missing lots of features and has had little testing but you 'll get the idea and it is useful in its own right ( I created the Alpha Test Home Page linked below and related pages with it ) .
I 've been working on this for a few months ( more if you include the time before coding began ) , but have been slowed down by a variety of things ( many of them listed in my blog ) .
Finally , I have enough to show so I can now answer people when they ask what I 'm up to .
The product is the wikiCalc program -- a web authoring tool that creates web pages .
It is for creating and maintaining web pages that include data that is more than just unformatted prose , such as schedules , lists , and tables .
It combines some of the ease of authoring and multi-person edit ability of a wiki with the familiar formatting and data organizing metaphor of a spreadsheet .
While you edit using a browser - based UI in a spreadsheet , with the A - B - C 1 - 2 - 3 grid showing , the final output , like printout from the productivity product , is static and only shows cell borders where you explicitly set them .
It handles freeform text in a wiki - like manner and works well with large blocks of text .
Screen shots of editing
I 've posted a short essay here on my blog called " About wikiCalc 0.1 " explaining what the program is and why I did it .
The program is currently only available as a download for Windows ( but will almost certainly be ready for Mac , Linux / Unix , and more at some point soon -- it 's written in Perl ) and only in the client - side version with publishing to any web server that supports FTP .
You can find a link to the download and a bit more information on the " wikiCalc Alpha Test Home Page " .

Fighting in Afghanistan is intense and dangerous
The Royal Anglian troops were picking their way through the thick mud-walled compounds and irrigation ditches of Kajaki on another early evening patrol .
It was not unusual for them to come under fire - it regularly happens when British troops push from their base out into the no-man 's land a few kilometres from the dam they are protecting .
They scrambled to their positions and returned fire - they were being attacked from a number of different directions .
As usual , the decision was made to call for air support and two American F - 15 fighters were soon buzzing overhead .
What happened next will be at the heart of the investigation .
Air power vital
A bomb was dropped , but rather than hitting the Taleban positions it struck a group of British soldiers - three were killed and two others injured .
" There are a handful of different reasons why this tragic incident may have happened , " said Lt Col Charlie Mayo , spokesman for the Helmand Task Force .
" We are investigating the circumstances , but we are not in a position at the moment , and I do n't think we will be for some time , to find out exactly why this happened . "
Officers insist they are making military progress
Air power is a vital part of the Nato arsenal and it gives the international forces a major advantage over the Taleban in terrain which makes fighting a guerrilla war even more difficult .
But even with modern guidance systems , mistakes can be made and civilians - as well as troops - have been killed over the past few months .
In December last year , Royal Marine Jonathan Wigley , 21 , from Leicestershire , died from injuries sustained in an American bombing raid .
He and his unit were ambushed in Garmsir , another town in Helmand .
They were outflanked and surrounded on three sides and the air power was needed to allow them to withdraw - but the bomb was dropped too close to British positions .
Canadian troops have also been killed or injured by US aircraft .
Many , many times , the bombs have saved the lives of hundreds of British troops
Brigadier John Lorimer
The intense nature of the close - quarter fighting does increase the risk as bombs are being dropped very close to Allied forces .
The commander of British forces in Helmand province , Brig John Lorimer , sent his condolences to the families of those killed .
" It 's a terrible tragedy and we have been working with the US air force a great deal out here and many , many times , the bombs have saved the lives of hundreds of British troops , " he said .
Officers insist they are making military progress , pushing Taleban fighters further back from the main towns and killing senior commanders .
But the mission is to try to win Afghan villagers over for the government and efforts to bring development , justice and better governance are proving challenging , as is mentoring the new Afghan National Army and police to take more of a responsibility for national security .
On the last day of the recent Reuters Media and Marketing Summit in New York , Warner Music Group CEO admitted that he was " fairly certain " that one or more of his seven children had downloaded music without the permission of the copyright owner , which Reuters referred to as stealing .
Despite the alleged infringers ' proximity to the major label head and his direct awareness of it without the use of ISP subpoenas , somehow no lawsuits were deemed necessary , although Bronfman said that his kids had " suffered the consequences " :
" I explained to them what I believe is right , that the principle is thatstealing music is stealing music .
Frankly , right is right and wrong iswrong , particularly when a parent is talking to a child .
A bright linearound moral responsibility is very important .
I can assure you they nolonger do that . "
So , the children of major label CEOs get a verbal explanation for infringing Warner 's sacred copyrights , while everyone else has to worry about getting sued .
I totally get it .
It 's like how if you 're a Bush niece who has a rock of crack cocaine fall out of her shoe while in court - ordered rehab for faking a prescription for anxiety medication , you only have to spend a few days in jail .

Although its been a widely - available ( and widely - used ) standard for years , the UPnP ( Universal Plug and Play ) standard and 76 specific UPnP fixes received official international standard status late last week .
In an overwhelming approval vote , the International Standards Organization / International Electrotechnical Commission Joint Technical Committee 1 ( ISO / IEC JTC 1 ) voted to recognize UPnP as an official standard of the body .
On the one hand , this is an almost anticlimactic turn of events , considering just how many devices support UPnP , but standard recognition has always been considered an important milestone for any product or service , and this is no exception .
For those of who you are n't familiar , UPnP is a descendant of the PnP ( Plug and Play ) technology that first debuted in Windows 95 .
Like the more simple PnP , UPnP was specifically developed to allow for seamless connectivity between a vast variety of devices , computers , and operating systems over virtually any type of connection .
Just as PnP suffered some growing pains ( earning itself the nickname Plug - n - Pray in the process ) , UPnP 's initial deployment was n't exactly smooth .
Soon after it was deployed as a feature in Windows XP , multiple critical flaws were discovered in XP 's UPnP implementation .
Microsoft addressed these issues via security updates , but the notion that UPnP " autoconfiguration " could be insecure still persists among some geeks .
As The Inquirer points out , UPnP 's technology has been exploited in the past to allow virus propagation , the standard has n't exactly standardized the printer driver market , and many devices still ship with UPnP service deactivated due to security concerns with the protocol itself .
UPnP 's goal of allowing a wide variety of devices to communicate seamlessly over a network is obviously an important one given the growing emphasis many devices place on point - to - point connectivity .
Speaking generally , device vendors still seem to have questions regarding the security of UPnP — hopefully formal recognition of the protocol as a standard will provide a firm footing to speed development of the security measures needed to close any loopholes that still exist within the protocol .
Oil prices have jumped nearly fourfold since 2000 because of an array of factors : increased demand from China and India , declining production in Venezuela and Mexico , and supply disruptions from political crises in the Middle East and Africa and bad weather in the United States .
Gasoline prices have periodically soared in recent years not only because of high crude prices , but also because of disruptions and tight capacity at American refineries .
A fast - moving but relatively weak hurricane , Humberto , formed in the gulf and plowed into Louisiana and Texas this morning , causing power outages and shutdowns at three refineries in Texas .
The shutdowns are expected to last only a day or two , but traders said they remained concerned that other storms could disrupt oil production in the gulf .
September is the peak month for hurricanes .
“ It could have been a lot worse , ” said Michael Rose , director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
Mr. Rose said he thought that the $ 80.09 close on the New York Mercantile Exchange was close to “ the crescendo top ” and that within the next couple of months “ I think we ’ll go back to the 70s and then test the upper 60s . ”
Recent price swings in crude oil came as hedge funds and other traders pulled back from investing in the oil market , distracted by a credit crisis roiling the financial markets over the last two months .
But many traders got back into the market in recent days as they sensed that prices might move higher .
Not only are storms threatening production in the gulf , but the oil market was generally unimpressed by an announcement this week from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
OPEC said it would increase output by a modest 500,000 barrels a day to put some downward pressure on prices , a tactic that has not worked .
Apple and Microsoft have always disagreed in how to display fonts on computer displays .
Today , both companies are using sub - pixel rendering to coax sharper - looking fonts out of typical low resolution screens .
Where they differ is in philosophy .
Apple generally believes that the goal of the algorithm should be to preserve the design of the typeface as much as possible , even at the cost of a little bit of blurriness .
Microsoft generally believes that the shape of each letter should be hammered into pixel boundaries to prevent blur and improve readability , even at the cost of not being true to the typeface .
Now that Safari for Windows is available , which goes to great trouble to use Apple ’s rendering algorithms , you can actually compare the philosophies side - by - side on the very same monitor and see what I mean .
I think you ’ll notice the difference .
Apple ’s fonts are indeed fuzzy , with blurry edges , but at small font sizes , there seems to be much more variation between different font families , because their rendering is truer to what the font would look like if it were printed at high resolution .
( Note : To see the following illustration correctly , you need to have an LCD monitor with pixels arranged in R , G , B order , like mine .
Otherwise it ’s going to look different and wrong . )
The difference originates from Apple ’s legacy in desktop publishing and graphic design .
The nice thing about the Apple algorithm is that you can lay out a page of text for print , and on screen , you get a nice approximation of the finished product .
This is especially significant when you consider how dark a block of text looks .
Microsoft ’s mechanism of hammering fonts into pixels means that they do n’t really mind using thinner lines to eliminate blurry edges , even though this makes the entire paragraph lighter than it would be in print .
The advantage of Microsoft ’s method is that it works better for on - screen reading .
Microsoft pragmatically decided that the design of the typeface is not so holy , and that sharp on - screen text that ’s comfortable to read is more important than the typeface designer ’s idea of how light or dark an entire block of text should feel .
Indeed Microsoft actually designed font faces for on - screen reading , like Georgia and Verdana , around the pixel boundaries ; these are beautiful on screen but do n’t have much character in print .
Typically , Apple chose the stylish route , putting art above practicality , because Steve Jobs has taste , while Microsoft chose the comfortable route , the measurably pragmatic way of doing things that completely lacks in panache .
To put it another way , if Apple was Target , Microsoft would be Wal - Mart .
Now , on to the question of what people prefer .
Jeff Atwood ’s post from yesterday comparing the two font technologies side - by - side generated rather predictable heat : Apple users liked Apple ’s system , while Windows users liked Microsoft ’s system .
This is not just standard fanboyism ; it reflects the fact that when you ask people to choose a style or design that they prefer , unless they are trained , they will generally choose the one that looks most familiar .
In most matters of taste , when you do preference surveys , you ’ll find that most people do n’t really know what to choose , and will opt for the one that seems most familiar .
This goes for anything from silverware ( people pick out the patterns that match the silverware they had growing up ) to typefaces to graphic design : unless people are trained to know what to look for , they ’re going to pick the one that is most familiar .
Which is why Apple engineers probably feel like they ’re doing a huge service to the Windows community , bringing their “ superior ” font rendering technology to the heathens , and it explains why Windows users are generally going to think that Safari ’s font rendering is blurry and strange and they do n’t know why , they just do n’t like it .
Actually they ’re thinking …
“ Whoa !
That ’s different .
I do n’t like different .
Why do n’t I like these fonts ?
Oh , when I look closer , they look blurry .
That must be why . “

FedEx to Launch Commercial Hybrid-Electric Vans in Europe
More Alternative Energy Articles
FedEx Express ( FedEx ) , a subsidiary of FedEx Corp and the worlds largest express transportation company , today announced plans to introduce 10 hybrid- electric / diesel vehicles to its European fleet , bringing the worldwide total of hybrid vehicles in revenue service at FedEx to more than 100 in North America , Asia and , now , Europe .
The vans , manufactured by Iveco , will initially be trialed close to the manufacturers site in Turin , Italy , and will be the first hybrid-electric / diesel vehicles operated by FedEx in Europe .
FedEx currently operates hybrid vehicles in the U.S. , Canada and Japan .
The van and the hardware that enables the vehicle to operate on both electric and diesel systems will be unveiled at the European Road Transport Show in Amsterdam , Oct. 24 through Nov. 3 , 2007 .
With nearly 100 hybrid- electric / diesel vehicles already on the road , knowledge of local regulations and a commitment to the development of alternative technology solutions , FedEx is the perfect company to operate these vehicles , said Robert W. Elliott , president , FedEx Express , Europe Middle East the Indian Subcontinent and Africa .
FedEx is making smart strategic investments in projects that will help drive the commercial development of new technologies for industry .
We expect these hybrid-electric vehicles to perform with increased fuel efficiency and decreased emissions , making them ideal for city and urban environments , Elliott said .
Iveco is recognized as a leader in the automotive field and a company with a strong history in supporting innovative new technologies .
Over the last two years , Ivecoand FedEx have joined efforts to develop a new Diesel - electric hybrid vehicle .
The Daily Hybrid , showing for the first time at the European Road Transport Show , provides the autonomy and fuel efficiency of a Diesel vehicle with zero-emission levels of the electric engine , said Stefano Sterpone , senior vice president , Iveco Sales & Marketing .
FedEx recognizes that effective environmental management is one of its most important corporate priorities , and is committed to implementing and helping develop new cost - effective green technologies that provide a real alternative for businesses and consumers in todays market .
This investment demonstrates FedExs continuing commitment to aid in the further development of hybrid- electric commercial vehicles across the globe , and reflects the growing commercial viability of this technology , said John Formisano , vice president of Global Vehicles , FedEx Express .
We have been pleased with the performance of other hybrid vehicles already in operation across our global fleet .
In 2004 , FedEx Express introduced the FedEx OptiFleet E700 , anenvironmentally - superior delivery truck , into its delivery fleet .
FedEx now has 95 hybrid- electric vehicles in service worldwide that have traveled more than one million miles , and has the largest fleet of hybrid- electric delivery vehicles of any transportation company within the United States .
For a while now , I ’ve fretted that we ’re turning into a nation of weenies and permanently enraged censors , that too many of us are afraid of letting disagreeable or uncomfortable ideas into the limelight .
If it ’s not the p.c. overreach of campus “ speech codes ” or the attempts to criminalize “ hate speech , ” it ’s the FCC ’s crackdown on cussing in PBS documentaries and the Secret Service ’s keeping protesters fenced off in “ free speech zones . ”
But during the last month , this impulse to squelch — indulged by the left and the right and the milquetoast middle — seems to have reached some kind of tipping point , as if we ’ve entered a permanent state of hysterical overreaction .
For me , the opening moment of this scaredy - cat season came during a radio interview I was recording with Sean Penn .
While we were discussing Into the Wild , his new movie celebrating balls - out American freedom , I asked about his recent visit to Venezuela .
Penn ’s endorsement of Hugo Chávez ’s socialism is fine with me , I said , but how did he square his embrace of Chávez with the régime ’s depredations against liberty in Venezuela ?
Penn tensed up , but he seemed game to thrash it out , to explain why I was a tool of the Republican Big Lie Machine — until his personal publicist , eavesdropping from the next room , popped in to insist that we stop speaking freely about restrictions on free speech in Venezuela .
Days later , the former president of Harvard , Larry Summers , was disinvited as a dinner speaker by the California university system ’s board of regents because of his controversial suggestion in 2005 that the underrepresentation of women in science might be the result of more than just sexism .
And at Stanford , students and teachers became apoplectic over the appointment of Donald Rumsfeld as a visiting fellow by the university ’s conservative think tank .
Then it was the East Coast ’s turn to get all hysterical and drama - queeny : During a single week at the end of September , everyone from the Daily News to the Democratic speaker of the New York City Council denounced Columbia for inviting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak ( and Hillary Clinton joined the mob in saying he should be turned away by police — at gunpoint ?— if he tried to go near ground zero ) ; Verizon refused to broadcast NARAL ’s abortion - rights text messages ; Bill O’Reilly ’s goofy can ’t - we - all - just - get - along attempt to sow racial harmony was called racist ; and Congress , after wasting its time officially condemning MoveOn.org for its stupid , over - the - top “ General Betray Us ” ad , was asked to waste its time condemning Rush Limbaugh ’s stupid , over - the - top crack that only “ phony soldiers ” criticize the war in Iraq .
Some of these episodes were trivial , some significant .
Some were about trying to prevent speech ( Ahmadinejad , Summers , NARAL ) , some only about stupendously overreacting to it ( O’ Reilly , MoveOn ) .
But they all reflect a common temperament : an instinct to repress the disagreeable or the impolitic .
Almost any argument about race , gender , Israel , or the war is now apt to be infected by a spirit of self - righteous grievance and demonization .
Passionate disagreement is n’t sufficient ; bad faith must be imputed to one ’s opponents : skepticism of affirmative action equals racism , antiwar sentiment equals anti-Americanism ( or terrorist sympathy ) , criticism of Israel is by definition anti-Semitic , and so on .
More and more people think they ’re entitled to the right not just to ignore or disapprove , but to veto and banish .
And the craven fear of triggering tantrums leads the responsible authorities — university administrators , politicians , corporate executives — into humiliating , flip - floppy contortions of appeasement .
Maybe , I tell myself hopefully , it ’s all a spasmodic reaction to the unfettered discourse that the Web and cable TV and talk radio have unleashed — that because freedom of expression is rather suddenly greater than ever in so many ways , people are trying desperately to reestablish limits on what can and ca n’t be asserted in their vicinity .
And no doubt this sort of panicky , anti-democratic exceptionalism — freedom of speech for us , but not necessarily for you — is fed by the chronic sense of emergency that has prevailed since September 2001 , when the White House press secretary warned that “ Americans … need to watch what they say . ”
Maybe the fever will pass .
Or maybe a lot of us are permanently losing our taste for liberty , devoted to “ freedom ” in the abstract but unprepared to endure all its messy particulars .
This struggle is yet another way in which we ’re still dealing , for better or for worse , with the legacy of the sixties .
The seminal student uprising , the takeover of the UC Berkeley administration building in 1964 , was driven by the all - American urge to expand the discourse :
The Free Speech Movement protesters , liberal and conservative , demanded the right to hand out political fliers on campus .
However , the following year , the émigré German Marxist Herbert Marcuse , newly tenured at UC San Diego , published his influential essay “ Repressive Tolerance , ” arguing that the free expression of every sort of idea lulls us into accepting a larger oppression .
We should not practice “ tolerance toward that which is radically evil , ” he wrote ; at a time “ of clear and present danger ” to progressive dreams , “ tolerance cannot be indiscriminate … it can not protect false words . ”
This was heady stuff to young American New Lefties , and even a lot of middle - aged liberal professors were seduced by the pseudo - heroism of shouting down speakers — if it was a matter , say , of preventing the South Vietnamese ambassador from addressing Harvard students .
Although it was the left that transplanted the earnest and awful Marxist - Leninist notion of “ political incorrectness ” to this country , once the idea was in the American air , everybody breathed it .
And today , with “ clear and present danger ” now a neocon term of art , the right also insists on practicing intolerance toward the “ radically evil . ”
When it came to Ahmadinejad ’s visit to Columbia , the New York tabloids and the fist - shaking throng were downright Marcusian .
“ What possible good might come from giving Ahmadinejad an honored forum for speaking ? ” a Daily News editorial screamed .
“ Some things are beyond discussion . ”
Sure , Ahmadinejad is a Fascistic provocateur , and his line on Holocaust scholarship — that he ’s only out to encourage intellectual freedom — is monstrously disingenuous .
But celebrated bad guys visit New York and speak at American universities all the time .
Iran is supplying weapons to men killing American troops in Iraq ?
In the seventies , when China and the Soviet Union were supplying North Vietnam with arms , Nixon toasted Mao in Peking , and Brezhnev visited the White House to work on détente .
Columbia and its president , Lee Bollinger , seem chronically unable to get the free - speech thing right .
Last fall , the men ’s hockey team had its season canceled simply for handing out a team recruitment flier with the ( funny ) tagline “ Do n’t be a pussy . ”
( Overreaction alert : Days later , the punishment was drastically reduced . )
That same day , Columbia students rushed the stage to prevent a campus speech by a right - wing anti-illegal - immigration militant .
( A nonpartisan group planned to invite the guy back to speak this fall , but a few weeks ago , “ after several productive conversations with other student leaders and our advisers , ” decided , uh , well , maybe not . )
And Bollinger ’s absurdly inhospitable , gauntlet - throwing introduction of Ahmadinejad mainly served the political interests of two people : Lee Bollinger ( Look , I ’m tough on the Israel - hater ! ) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( Look , I ’m persecuted by the Americans ! ) .
But at least the horrid little loon was allowed to talk .
Alarmingly , it ’s the legitimate scholarly speakers who are being denied venues because of what they have to say about Israel .
Last fall , the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee pressured the Polish consulate in New York to cancel a talk by NYU professor Tony Judt , who ’s in favor of Israel and the Palestinian territories ’ merging into a single country .
John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , professors at the University of Chicago and Harvard , respectively , were to appear last month at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs to discuss their new book , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy ; people objected — “ This one is hot , ” the council ’s president told Mearsheimer — and the talk was canceled .
Here and there , after an initial , instinctive display of spinelessness , calm and common sense reasserted themselves .
Verizon saw the error of its ways as soon as the Times reported on the company ’s refusal to take NARAL ’s business .
Even President Bush , after a bit of weaseling ( “ I ’m not sure I ’d have offered the same invitation ” ) , concluded that Ahmadinejad ’s speaking at Columbia was “ okay ” : “ An institution in our country gives him a chance to express his point of view , which really speaks to the freedoms of the country . ”
Not quite Voltairean courage , but not bad in the present climate .
Is it really so hard to let pretty much anyone say pretty much whatever he wants ?
We would all do well in these instances to ask if we ’re indulging in a double standard .
What if NYU were staging a talk by Avigdor Lieberman , the ferociously anti-Arab deputy prime minister of Israel — how would the folks who attacked Columbia respond to people loudly insisting that no possible good could come from giving an honored forum to such a thuggish enemy of peace ?
And consider the commandments of a typical college speech code , such as Ohio State ’s : “ Do not joke about differences related to race , ethnicity , sexual orientation , gender , ability , socioeconomic background , etc . ”
Does it really make sense to try to outlaw in a dorm what half the residents are watching Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert do every night on TV ?
When it comes to free speech , we need to let a hundred flowers bloom .
We need to chill .
We need to stop being pussies .

Download OpenShiiva 0.8.9
OpenShiiva on SourceForge
OpenShiiva forums
OpenShiiva is a fast and simple , single pass , video and audio , vob to mp4 converter .
Some features :
The syncing is quite good .
For those who remember the Finding Nemo trailer , it does it without problem .
And it also auto - deinterlaces it very well .
As far as I know , OpenShiiva is the only app able to sync on the fly ( but since it is open sourced ... )
Some quick notes about OpenShiiva :
Features OpenShiiva most probably wo n't support ( look at MediaPipe for these kind of features ) :
OpenShiiva would n't exist without these librairies :
OpenShiiva is meant to give an alternative to other , closed source , commercial software .
It is GPLed , giving back to the community .
( If you can code , you can help , if you can't , you can help too - documentation and graphism ) .
September 5 2004 OpenShiiva v0.8.9 is released .
You can download it here .
Xvid lib updated to today 's cvs version .
Small gui fixes .
A new icon ( thank you Henrik Wannheden ! ) .
I should also add that OpenShiiva is kind of a dead project currently , as I simply do n't have enough time for it .
If anyone is interested in maintaining it , please contact me .
The design makes it difficult to add major features , but some bug fixing ( especially with divx / 3ivx encoding ) would be nice .
December 1 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.8 is released .
You can download it here .
Xvid lib updated to december 1 cvs version .
Better progress indicator , thanks to a fellow coder .
September 16 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.7 is released .
You can download it here .
Main update in this release are : xvid dev-api - 4 cvs snapshot of today , ac3 normalizing , completely new gui .
June 29 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.6 is released .
You can download it here .
Main update in this release are : recent XviD version , 2 - pass encoding , QuickTime files on input ( though only DV streams were actively tested ) .
Gui fixes .
Though reading from QuickTime files was not planned , I found myself with DV material and decided to use my own app ...
June 17 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.5 is released .
You can download it here .
Main update in this release are : can use any even size , can change displayed size , added a temporal denoiser , changed the gui , fixed a lot of bugs ( and a few in the subtitle decoder , which should behave better now ) .
Probably added a few .
Limits the codec choice to Apple 's mpeg4 for audio and 3ivx / DivX for video .
Fixed xvid altivec : identical output than unoptimized version .
Finally , Regulus made a nice documentation .
Read it .
June 5 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.4 is released .
You can download it here .
Main update in this release are : using Apple 's aac engine , new scaling algorithms , mp4 file optimization and support for any Quicktime codec .
Now for aac encoding , this has been decided because it sounds better , it is faster , and even possible better sync ( the old resampler introduced problems ) .
The new scaling algorithms : fast bilinear , bilinear , bicubic , experimental , neirest neighbor , area averaging , luma bicubic / chroma bilinear ( default ) , gaussian , sinc , lanczos , bicubic spline .
For mp4 file optimization : moves the control information from the end of file to the beginning ( let 's you play a streamed file ) , reinterleaves the samples so that samples for a given instant in time are colocated , and finally removes any free blocks , so the optimized file can actually be smaller .
Now about support for any QuickTime codec : while the app will let you choose any codec , obviously it will not work for a non -mpeg4 codec .
It was found to work with 3ivx and Divx , though not Apple 's mpeg4 .
Also the app will also let you chose any audio codec , but again , obviously only mpeg4 audio will work correctly .
Please use with QuickTime 6.3 .
April 25 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.3 is released .
You can download it here .
Sorry for the long wait , but dealing with the end of the semester : exams , etc .
Fixed subtitles color bug , fixed no scaling bug , added ability to decode audio without reencoding it ( to get sync right while allowing you to use another app to encode audio : decoding audio is really fast and almost does n't affect processing speed ) and finally a black and white mode for these old movie you have ( Seven Samurai comes to mind ) .
Xvid altivec and audio resampling are now off by default since I had report of quality problems and sync problems respectively .
March 25 2003 OpenShiiva v0.8.2 is released .
You can download it here .
Main features of this update is support for the 3ivx codec , and support for subtitles , which was a requested feature .

The New York Times , October 4 , 2007

The Arctic ice cap melted this summer at a shocking pace , disappearing at a far higher rate than predicted by even the most pessimistic experts in global warming .
But we should n’t be shocked , because scientists have long known that major features of earth ’s interlinked climate system of air and water can change abruptly .
A big reason such change happens is feedback — not the feedback that you ’d like to give your boss , but the feedback that creates a vicious circle .
This type of feedback in our global climate could determine humankind ’s future prosperity and even survival .
Illustration by Jon Han for The New York Times
The vast expanse of ice floating on the surface of the Arctic Ocean always recedes in the summer , reaching its lowest point sometime in September .
Every winter it expands again , as the long Arctic night descends and temperatures plummet .
Each summer over the past six years , global warming has trimmed this ice ’s total area a little more , and each winter the ice ’s recovery has been a little less robust .
These trends alarmed climate scientists , but most thought that sea ice would n’t disappear completely in the Arctic summer before 2040 at the earliest .
But this past summer sent scientists scrambling to redo their estimates .
Week by week , the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo. , reported the trend : from 2.23 million square miles of ice remaining on Aug. 8 to 1.6 million square miles on Sept. 16 , an astonishing drop from the previous low of 2.05 million square miles , reached in 2005 .
The loss of Arctic sea ice wo n’t be the last abrupt change in earth ’s climate , because of feedbacks .
One of the climate ’s most important destabilizing feedbacks involves Arctic ice .
It works like this : our release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases around the planet causes some initial warming that melts some ice .
Melting ice leaves behind open ocean water that has a much lower reflectivity ( or albedo ) than that of ice .
Open ocean water absorbs about 80 percent more solar radiation than sea ice does .
And so as the sun warms the ocean , even more ice melts , in a vicious circle .
This ice - albedo feedback is one of the main reasons warming is happening far faster in the high north , where there are vast stretches of sea ice , than anywhere else on Earth .
There are other destabilizing feedbacks in the carbon cycle that involve the oceans .
Each year , the oceans absorb about half the carbon dioxide that humans emit into the atmosphere .
But as oceans warm , they will absorb less carbon dioxide , partly because the gas dissolves less readily in warmer water , and partly because warming will reduce the mixing between deep and surface waters that provides nutrients to plankton that absorb carbon dioxide .
And when oceans take up less carbon dioxide , warming worsens .
Scientists have done a good job incorporating some feedbacks into their climate models , especially those , like the ice - albedo feedback , that operate directly on the temperature of air or water .
But they have n’t incorporated as well feedbacks that operate on the atmosphere ’s concentrations of greenhouse gases or that affect the cycle of carbon among air , land , oceans and organisms .
Yet these may be the most important feedbacks of all .
Global warming is melting large areas of permafrost in Alaska , Canada and Siberia .
As it melts , the organic matter in the permafrost starts to rot , releasing carbon dioxide and methane ( molecule for molecule , methane traps far more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide ) .
Warming is also affecting wetlands and forests around the world , helping to desiccate immense peat bogs in Indonesia , contributing to more frequent drought in the Amazon basin , and propelling a widening beetle infestation that ’s killing enormous tracts of pine forest in Alaska and British Columbia .
( This infestation is on the brink of crossing the Canadian Rockies into the boreal forest that extends east to Newfoundland . )
Dried peat and dead and dying forests are vulnerable to wildfires that would emit huge quantities of carbon into the atmosphere .
This summer ’s loss of Arctic sea ice indicates that at least one major destabilizing feedback is gaining force quickly .
Scientists have also recently learned that the Southern Ocean , which encircles Antarctica , appears to be absorbing less carbon , while Greenland ’s ice sheet is melting at an accelerating rate .
When warming becomes its own cause , we might not be able to stop extremely harmful climate change no matter how much we cut our greenhouse gas emissions .
We need a far more aggressive global response to climate change .
In the 1960s , mothers learned that the milk they were feeding their children was laced with radioactive material from atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons and that this contamination could increase the risk of childhood leukemia .
Soon women organized themselves in the tens of thousands to demand that nuclear powers ban atmospheric testing .
Their campaign largely succeeded .
In response to the new dangers of climate change , we need a similar mobilization — of mothers , of students and of everyone with a stake in the future — now .

On TV , ' Extreme Caution ' vs. Free Speech Some wonder if Fox 's decision was about Field 's message , not her expletive .
Sept. 18 , 2007  -- The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences really liked Sally Field Sunday night .
Fox , it seems , did not .
While accepting an Emmy for best lead actress in a drama ( for her role as Nora Walker on ABC 's " Brothers & Sisters " ) , the 60 - year - old actress who memorably peppered her 1985 Oscar acceptance speech with the much - parodied assertion " You really like me ! " used her stage time to make an anti-war statement .
" At the heart of Nora Walker , she is a mother .
So surely this belongs to all the mothers of the world … and to especially the mothers who stand with an open heart and wait -- wait for their children to come home from danger , from harm 's way and from war , " Field said before stumbling over her words , appearing to lose her train of thought and blurting , " Let 's face it , if the mothers ruled the world , there would be no god----"
That 's when the sound and picture cut out , leaving Emmy viewers across the country to wonder what Field said .
She reportedly concluded that sentence with " damn wars , " but Fox , airing the Emmys on a time - delay , did not cut back to the stage after Field finished talking .
Now , after a year of highly publicized debates about what 's appropriate to say on air and what 's not , many people are wondering what exactly made the network jump : the expletive or the sentiment ?
Network Paranoia ?
In an e-mail statement Monday , Fox explained why they chose to censor three parts of Sunday 's Emmy broadcast .
( In addition to cutting away from Field , Fox also dropped sound during Ray Romano and Katherine Heigl 's speeches . )
" Some language during the live broadcast may have been considered inappropriate by some viewers .
As a result , Fox 's broadcast standards executives determined it appropriate to drop sound and picture during those portions of the show , " the statement said .
The network declined to comment on Field 's case specifically .
But Bob Thompson , Syracuse University professor of popular culture , speculates that Fox 's decision was about Field 's questionable language , not her anti-war message .
" FCC indecency rules have to do , essentially , with sex , poo-poo and pee pee , " he said .
" She did n't say any of that .
But my guess is that if she said , ' There 'd be no damn wars , ' they probably would have let it go . "
Despite George Carlin's infamous " Seven Dirty Words " monologue , the FCC does n't have a list of words it considers profane .
In its consumer fact sheet , the FCC defines profanity as " including language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance . "
With no black and white rules , it 's up to the networks to decide what words are appropriate for air .
And many allow " god ----" in scripted shows .
According to the Parents Television Council , a consumer advocacy organization that tracks instances of profanity , sex and violence in prime - time television , three shows on FX -- Fox 's basic cable channel -- frequently air the word without bleeping it .
NBC was the only network that allowed " god ---- " to air uncensored last year , once on " Scrubs " and once on " Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . "
Pressed on why they cut off
Field when their own cable channel and others condoned the use of the expletive , a spokesman from Fox said , " FX is a cable network .
In the current regulatory environment , the feeling [ for broadcast networks ] is that we have to err on the side of extreme caution . "
That may be because of the increased pressure to keep live events controversy - free , following the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show when Justin Timberlake infamously -- and , he claimed , accidently -- exposed Janet Jackson 's breast during a dance routine .
The FCC fined Super Bowl broadcaster CBS $ 550,000 for violating anti-indecency laws .
A Forum for Free Speech ?
Astronomical as those fines can be , John Macleod Gourlie , professor of communications at Quinnipiac University , thinks the networks are using them as an excuse to stifle free speech .
He said he would n't put it past Fox to blame its censorship of an anti-war rant on a relatively mild expletive .
" I see it as a total excuse , " he said .
" While I understand it , the concerns for money have engulfed the concerns for media to fulfill its functions . "
Even if Fox censored Field purely because of her expletive and not because of her message , Gourlie thinks they were wrong to do so .
He argues that , considering the Emmys aired at night , at a time when most children are in bed or at least not listening in rapt attention to a 60 - year - old actress at an awards show , Fox should have aired Field 's speech in its entirety , curse word and all .
" One should question the larger offense in a land where freedom of speech is a constitutional right :
Whether censorship in the name of other values is the right decision , and in the end , if all of those values that we want to serve are better served by allowing a greater openness of speech instead of having someone 's finger on a censor button , " he said .
Political Statements OK , F - Bombs and Jesus Jabs Not
Sometimes the call to censor content is made even before the networks get involved .
Last week , the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences decided to cut down the acceptance speech comedian Kathy Griffin gave at the Emmy Creative Arts Awards , a ceremony held before the main show and taped a week in advance of air , because the Catholic League took offense at her comments .
Accepting an Emmy for her reality show " My Life on the D - List , " Griffin joked , " A lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award .
I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus . "
She went on to hold up her statue and declare , " This award is my god now ! "
For as long as they 've won awards , actors have ruffled feathers with their acceptance speeches .
In 1974 , Marlon Brando famously refused to pick up his Oscar for " The Godfather , " instead sending to the podium a young woman dressed as a Native American to protest Hollywood 's use of Native Americans in film .
In 1993 , Richard Gere used his platform as an Oscar presenter to protest China 's policies in Tibet .
But when celebrities sprinkle their speeches with four - letter words , the networks spring to action .
In 2003 , U2 singer Bono incited an FCC investigation when he called his Golden Globe award " f---ing brilliant " onstage .
Later that year , Nicole Richie and Fox caught heat when she jokingly dropped the F - bomb while presenting at the Billboard Music Awards .
Thompson understands why networks cringe at the F - word .
But in Field 's case , he thinks Fox may have overstepped their boundaries .
" The thing about the Emmys is that they 're so comedy - oriented , and if you 're going to do comedy in 2007 , it 's going to have to include making fun of the administration , " he said .
" The fact that in 2007 we are still pushing bleep buttons for something like that underscores for me the incredibly sophomoric nature of the culture war .
That is just absurd . "
Whether or not Fox 's decision to cut Field 's speech had something to do with her implied protest of the Iraq War , anti-war advocates eventually got the last laugh .
David Chase , the creator of " The Sopranos , " offered a sharp , expletive - free critique while accepting the Emmy for best drama series , the final award of the night .
" In essence , this is a story about a gangster , " Chase said of " The Sopranos . "
" And gangsters are out there taking their kids to college , and taking their kids to school , and putting food on their table . "
" And , hell , let 's face it , " he mused , " if the world and this nation was run by gangsters … maybe it is . "
Yet others say that the results , while significant , risk tarring some men unfairly .
The findings , based on offenders serving prison time who volunteered for the study , do not necessarily apply to the large and diverse group of adults who have at some point downloaded child pornography , and whose behavior is far too variable to be captured by a single survey .
Adding to the controversy , the prison bureau in April ordered the paper withdrawn from a peer - reviewed academic journal where it had been accepted for publication , apparently concerned that the results might be misinterpreted .
A spokeswoman for the bureau said the agency was reviewing a study of child pornography offenders but declined to comment further .
Ernie Allen , who leads the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , which is mandated to coordinate the nation ’s efforts to combat child pornography , said he was surprised that the full study had not been released .
“ This is the kind of research the public needs to know about , ” Mr. Allen said .
Others agreed that the report should be published but were more cautious about the findings .
“ The results could have tremendous implications for community safety and for individual liberties , ” said Dr. Fred Berlin , founder of the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic .
“ If people we thought were not dangerous are more so , then we need to know that and we should treat them that way .
But if we ’re wrong , then their liberties are n’t going to be fairly addressed . ”
Everyone agrees that researchers need to learn more about online consumers of illegal child images .
The volume of material seized from computers appears to be doubling each year — the National Center collected more than eight million images of explicit child pornography in the last five years — and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales made child protection a national priority in 2006 .
Those who are arrested on charges of possession or distribution of child pornography generally receive lighter sentences and shorter parole periods than sexual abusers .
They do not fit any criminal stereotype ; recent arrests have included politicians , police officers , teachers and businessmen .

The news the MSM is n’t reporting is almost criminal in their neglect of the warning they have an obligation to pass along to the American people .
It seems that the Bush administration is pressing ahead with plans to implement a missile shield that Russia states will be met with retaliation :
Washington wants to locate interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic as part of a shield it says is essential to protect Europe from rocket attacks by what is calls “ rogue states ” such as Iran and North Korea .
Russia believes the shield is targeted against its missile arsenal and poses a threat to its national security .
President Vladimir Putin has suggested there would be unspecified retaliatory measures if the shield goes ahead .
Russia believes the shield is targeted against its missile arsenal and poses a threat to its national security .
President Vladimir Putin has suggested there would be unspecified retaliatory measures if the shield goes ahead .
Putin last month drew a parallel between the U.S. missile shield and the 1962 Cuban missile crisis , widely regarded as the closest the world has come to nuclear war .
LINK
If you read this article from Yahoo News , it raises concerns , but when you begin to understand the scope and depth of the matter , it gets worse .
Below are excepts from Putin ’s annual questions and answer session , which is carried live on Russian television .
Keep in mind that in the above statement , Putin spoke of : “ unspecified retaliatory measures if the shield goes ahead ” and then tied it the the US / Russian Cuban Missile Crisis : “ Putin last month drew a parallel between the U.S. missile shield and the 1962 Cuban missile crisis , widely regarded as the closest the world has come to nuclear war ”
Those are mighty strong words , especially when you take into consideration this statement made on November the 13th :
Russian Military Chief : America Evil Russia ’s Chief of general staff , General Yury Baluyevsky , told Russia Today T.V Channel , that the Russian Armed Forces were under no obligation to protect the world from the “ evil Americans ” .
( Emphasis added )
In an interview with the English - language , state T.V. , the top military chief cautioned that the “ insidious ” U.S. missile defense shield weapons system has nothing to do with countering Iran and is aimed squarely at Moscow , as tensions continue to heat between the two superpowers .
He was speaking of U.S.plans to place a radar and missile defense systems in both Poland , and the Czech Republic , supposedly to protect America and it ’s allies from Iran and other “ rogue ” states .
MORE
The above statement would make it appear that their have been countries that have approached Russia and sought their protection from the United States , and Russia is telling them it ’s their problem except for Iran , unless he has recently switched positions .
Of importance is that that Russia seriously considers the United States as being a serious enough risk to publicly state that Russia has no obligation to protect the world from US aggression ; this is getting ugly !
And then , after you ’ve digested that , Putin held his annual televised question and answer session for the Russian people , and some of his statement are particularly telling :
Putin goes live on TV phone - in to escalate nuclear war of words
President tells of new generation of weapons .
“ Grandiose ” plan to combat US missile shield ( Excerpts )
Mr Putin said Russia would defend itself if the US goes ahead with its plan ( Emphasis added ) to install elements of its missile shield in central Europe .
“ I can assure you that such steps are being prepared and we will take them , ” he said .
Analysts said Mr Putin 's latest remarks were designed to reassure his public that Russia still had an effective nuclear deterrent .
But they were also a message to Washington : that its new and costly missile shield was effectively useless against the latest Russian technology .
Mr Putin did not spell out details of his new weapons , which he hinted at in 2004 .
They are believed to be equipped with manoeuvrable warheads , which detach from the main missile during the final stage of descent .
Predictably , Mr Putin took several swipes at US foreign policy .
The US - led invasion of Iraq had been a failure , he said , as was its strategy of confrontation with Iran over its alleged nuclear programme .
Mr Putin , who met Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , on Tuesday in Tehran , declared : “ Direct dialogue with the leaders of states … is the shortest path to success , rather than a policy of threats , sanctions , and a resolution to use force . ”
MORE
Some of Mr. Putin ’s words were vague , but we have to ask ourselves what “ defending themselves ” actually means ; if Putin compares it to the Cuban Missile Crisis and places that much importance in it as did President Kennedy ’s position on that historic matter , it could mean retaliatory action for simply deploying the system .
It ’s hard to tell how serious Putin is , and where rhetoric begins and reality becomes the product of his “ promises ” to the Russian people .

Last week I met Mr. Sunagawa from LocationValue Inc. that runs Otetsudai Networks .
Otetsudai Networks is a very cool service that is one of these " perfect for Japan " things .
Because of the advanced aging population and the tendency for many of the younger generation to not be in a hurry to lock down full - time jobs , businesses are having an increasingly more difficult time filling posts - so much so that some businesses are having to close down , not because of lack of business , but purely because they can't staff their stores .
My sister has written about the Japanese youth behavior where less and less stuff is planned - the kids going out and using their mobile devices to meet up or deciding to do things while constantly keeping in touch with each other .
These swarming bands of kids are now adults and many of them do n't want to be tied down .
These " kids " are not becoming adults .
In a recent survey by Otetsudai Networks , most people surveyed cared more about freedom and flexibility than the pay when considering a part - time job .
Enter Otetsudai Networks .
With Otetsudai Networks , if you are willing to work , you sign up for the service with your skills and focus , take a GPS reading on your phone and then just hang out .
If you are looking for someone for say ... 3 hours to man a cash register or help wash dishes , you just send the request to Otetsudai Networks and within minutes , you have a list of people available .
The list shows what each person is qualified for , how others have rated their work and exactly how far away they are .
Typically you will receive a list of half a dozen or more people within a few minutes .
The businesses are rated too on a per-manager basis so when you 're hanging out with your friends and you get a request to go help at the corner convenience shop , you know how your peers have rated that particular guy who 's asking you to come and help .
You can also counter the request and say you 'd go if they paid you 2000 yen / hour instead of 1500 .
As more and more people start using this system , it 's liable to start filling a very important gap in the workforce .
It 's also a perfect example of a location based , peer - to - peer reputation based , mobile behavior oriented product for an aging society .
The website is otetsu.jp otet.jp , but most of the functionality is only available on the phone .
Update from Mr. Sunagawa :
1. The English name of the company is LocationValue Inc .
2. Employer will see only the name of applicants rather than all the
available people around .
" ... you have a list of people available " may sound
inaccurate .
3. primary URL of our web is otet.jp instead of otetsu.jp although otetsu.jp
would also be redirected to our site .
UPDATE 2 : They have about 45,000 users with 1,000 new users per week .
MIT researchers have discovered a hearing mechanism that fundamentally changes the current understanding of inner ear function .
This new mechanism could help explain the ear 's remarkable ability to sense and discriminate sounds .
Its discovery could eventually lead to improved systems for restoring hearing .
MIT Professor Dennis M. Freeman , working with graduate student Roozbeh Ghaffari and research scientist Alexander J. Aranyosi , found that the tectorial membrane , a gelatinous structure inside the cochlea of the ear , is much more important to hearing than previously thought .
It can selectively pick up and transmit energy to different parts of the cochlea via a kind of wave that is different from that commonly associated with hearing .
Ghaffari , the lead author of the paper , is in the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology , as is Freeman .
All three researchers are in MIT 's Research Laboratory of Electronics .
Freeman is also in MIT 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary .
It has been known for over half a century that inside the cochlea sound waves are translated into up - and - down waves that travel along a structure called the basilar membrane .
But the team has now found that a different kind of wave , a traveling wave that moves from side to side , can also carry sound energy .
This wave moves along the tectorial membrane , which is situated directly above the sensory hair cells that transmit sounds to the brain .
This second wave mechanism is poised to play a crucial role in delivering sound signals to these hair cells .
In short , the ear can mechanically translate sounds into two different kinds of wave motion at once .
These waves can interact to excite the hair cells and enhance their sensitivity , " which may help explain how we hear sounds as quiet as whispers , " says Aranyosi .
The interactions between these two wave mechanisms may be a key part of how we are able to hear with such fidelity - for example , knowing when a single instrument in an orchestra is out of tune .
" We know the ear is enormously sensitive " in its ability to discriminate between different kinds of sound , Freeman says .
" We do n't know the mechanism that lets it do that . "
The new work has revealed " a whole new mechanism that nobody had thought of .
It 's really a very different way of looking at things . "
The tectorial membrane is difficult to study because it is small ( the entire length could fit inside a one - inch piece of human hair ) , fragile ( it is 97 percent water , with a consistency similar to that of a jellyfish ) , and nearly transparent .
In addition , sound vibrations cause nanometer - scale displacements of cochlear structures at audio frequencies .
" We had to develop an entirely new class of measurement tools for the nano - scale regime , " Ghaffari says .
The team learned about the new wave mechanism by suspending an isolated piece of tectorial membrane between two supports , one fixed and one moveable .
They launched waves at audio frequencies along the membrane and watched how it responded by using a stroboscopic imaging system developed in Freeman 's lab .
That system can measure nanometer - scale displacements at frequencies up to a million cycles per second .
The team 's discovery has implications for how we model cochlear mechanisms .
" In the long run , this could affect the design of hearing aids and cochlear implants , " says Ghaffari .
The research also has implications for inherited forms of hearing loss that affect the tectorial membrane .
Previous measurements of cochlear function in mouse models of these diseases " are consistent with disruptions of this second wave , " Aranyosi adds .
Because the tectorial membrane is so tiny and so fragile , people " tend to think of it as something that 's wimpy and not important , " Freeman says .
" Well , it 's not wimpy at all . "
The new discovery " that it can transport energy throughout the cochlea is very significant , and it's not something that 's intuitive . "

WASHINGTON , July 3 — A factory that makes uranium fuel for nuclear reactors had a spill so bad that it kept the plant closed for seven months last year and became one of only three incidents in all of 2006 serious enough for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to include in an annual report to Congress .
After an investigation , the commission changed the terms of the factory ’s license and said that the public had 20 days to request a hearing on the changes .
But no member of the public ever did .
In fact , no member of the public could find out about the changes .
The document describing them , including the notice of hearing rights for anyone who felt adversely affected , was stamped “ official use only , ” meaning that it was not publicly accessible .
“ Official use only ” is a category below “ Secret ” and , while documents in that category are not technically classified , they are kept from the public .
The agency would not even have told Congress which factory was involved were it not for the efforts of one of the five commissioners , Gregory B. Jaczko , who named the company , Nuclear Fuel Services , of Erwin , Tenn. , in a memo that became part of the public record .
His memo said that other public documents would allow an informed person to deduce that the factory belonged to Nuclear Fuel Services .
Such secrecy by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is now coming under attack by influential members of Congress who complain that the agency is withholding numerous documents about the country ’s nuclear facilities in the name of national security , but that many withheld documents are not sensitive .
The lawmakers say the agency must move to balance its penchant for secrecy with the public ’s right to participate in the licensing process and its right to know about potential hazards .
Additional details of the 2006 incident are coming to light now because of a letter sent on Tuesday to the nuclear agency by the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
The committee chairman , Representative John D. Dingell , and the chairman of the oversight subcommittee , Representative Bart Stupak , both Democrats from Michigan , complained that the N.R.C. “ went far beyond ” the need to protect sensitive security information by keeping documents about Nuclear Fuel Services , a private company , from the public .
The agency , the congressmen complained , “ has removed hundreds of otherwise innocuous documents relating to the N.F.S. plant from public view . ”

SUB -PRIME CRISIS SERIES
Special reports from the USA Next : What can be done ?
US property crash deepens Foreclosure wave sweeps US
The scale of the losses that will hit Wall Street banks could approach half a trillion dollars as large numbers of sub - prime home loans go bad .
And the carnage in the financial markets could cause a credit squeeze that will dampen economic growth for years to come .
The US sub - prime crisis is leading to a wave of reposessions across the US that is having a devastating effect on the US housing market , and is likely to lead to the halving of the US economic growth rate in the next six months .
The reality is that most financial institutions have barely started to recognize the lower ' fair value ' of their impaired securities
Professor Nouriel Roubini , New York University .
At the root of the problem is the breakdown of the new model of mortgage lending , when instead of giving mortgages directly to their customers , banks borrowed money from credit markets to fund a growing volume of mortgages .
See how the new model of mortgage lending went wrong
But its biggest impact is likely to be on the financial sector , which made billions of dollars in profits in the past few years by betting heavily on the sub - prime market .
Already the big Wall Street banks have revealed losses totalling $ 50 bn ( £ 24bn ) , and the head of the biggest bank - Chuck Prince of Citigroup - and the biggest investment firm - Stan O'Neill of Merrill Lynch - have departed .
Show and tell SUB - PRIME LOSSES SO FAR Citigroup : $ 11bn Merrill Lynch : $ 8bn Morgan Stanley : $ 3.7bn Bear Stearns : $ 3.2bn UBS : $ 3.4bn Deutsche Bank : $ 3.2 bn Credit Suisse : $ 1bn Wachovia : $ 1.1bn IKB : $ 1bn : Source : Company reports
But experts estimate that the total losses facing the financial sector could amount to between $ 150bn and $ 450bn , and that many of the banks have hidden losses that have been concealed in off - balance sheet instruments like " structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) " .
The big Wall Street banks and investment houses who are most exposed could find their profits , and much of their capital base , wiped out .
To restore their profits , and indeed in some cases to remain solvent , they will be forced to sell off many assets and lay off many workers , as well as cutting the bonuses of their remaining staff and limiting their future lending .
The size of the financial sector in the US economy - with banks making up 30 % of the profits of all US companies last year - means that the effects will be felt both in the real economy and on the stock market .
And with $ 2.8 trillion in distressed mortgage bonds , including $ 1.3 trillion in sub - prime bonds , there is enough distress to go around .
Dick Syron , the head of Freddie Mac , a government - sponsored agency that also trades mortgage - backed securities , reckons he has never seen circumstances so bad , and that the credit crunch is having a " dramatic effect " on the US housing market .
Investors strike
But even that impact could be dwarfed by the effects of the credit squeeze spreading beyond sub - prime loans to other sectors of the bond market .
The non-government mortgage backed securities market has grown rapidly in recent years , and mortgages are now the largest part of the $ 27bn bond market .
But since 9 August , bondholders have effectively gone on strike , refusing to buy some $ 2.8 trillion worth of sub - prime , Alt - A , and other types of securities not guaranteed by government - sponsored agencies .
Meanwhile , the value of sub - prime mortgage - backed bonds has plummeted since the beginning of the year .
The fear is that the whole of the bond market , which funds everything from government debt to company borrowing to credit cards and car loans , will begin to dry up as investors worry about undisclosed problems .
According to US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , " although it was the problems with sub - prime mortgages that initiated the financial turmoil , credit concerns quickly spread into a number of other areas " .
" In the short term , these events do imply a greater measure of financial restraint on economic growth as credit becomes more expensive and difficult to obtain . "
Already there are signs that it is getting harder to sell bonds linked to credit cards and car loans , and there are worries that spreads on corporate bonds are tightening .
These events do imply a greater measure of financial restraint on economic growth as credit becomes more expensive and difficult to obtain
Ben Bernanke , chairman , Federal Reserve
The tightening of credit will hurt economic growth because in the US consumers have borrowed heavily to fund their consumption .
The latest figures indicate that consumer and business confidence is slumping both in the US and Europe as worries about the effects of the credit crunch grow .
How big are the potential losses ?
The credit markets are frozen because of uncertainty and lack of information .
No one knows how much mortgage - backed securities are now worth , and no one wants to sell them to find out .
Also , no one knows where these losses are hidden among the banks and other financial institutions .
The gargantuan scale of potential losses is terrifying investors in banking stocks - which have fallen by 30 % - as well as mortgage - bond investors .
There are three ways to estimate the size of the possible losses from the sub - prime crisis .
Estimate how many sub - prime mortgages will eventually end in foreclosure
Look at the current market valuation of sub - prime mortgage bonds
Look at the books of the major banks and estimate the size of their potential liabilities and the proportion of those which will turn into losses
The first method should give the best estimate of the long - term cost of the crisis .
The range of plausible estimates goes from $ 150bn ( US Federal Reserve ) to $ 450bn ( Moodys.com worst - case scenario ) .
POTENTIAL SUB - PRIME LOSSES
Sub - prime mortgages :
$ 1.3 trillion Distressed sub - prime mortgages :
$ 625 bn Foreclosed sub - prime mortgages :
$ 220 bn - $ 450bn Percent sub - prime foreclosed : 15 %- 25 % Current market value of sub - prime mortgages
$ 300 bn - $ 900 bn Sources : Federal Reserve , Moodys.com According to Mark Zandi of Moody's , there are $ 1.3 trillion - worth of sub - prime and other distressed mortgages that were issued in 2005 , 2006 and the first half of 2007 that will see their terms change for the worse in the next two years .
He estimates that about half of these , $ 625bn , are likely to go into arrears leading to court action , and that after reschedulings and foreclosures , about $ 220bn is likely to be lost , net of the auction sales of such properties .
Other organisations , such as the Center for Responsible Lending , also estimate that about 20 % of sub - prime mortgages will go into foreclosure .
But , as Mr Zandi points out , both his estimate and the Fed 's are very sensitive to changes in house prices .
If house prices were to fall by 20 % rather than 12 % as Mr Zandi 's model currently estimates , he says that the total losses could double to $ 450 bn .
And if the US goes into recession , or if the Fed raises interest rates to combat inflation , then the losses would also increase dramatically .
Meanwhile , fear has led the bond markets - through derivative trading - to cut the value of sub - prime mortgage bonds by an even larger amount .
Since the beginning of the year , sub - prime mortgage bonds issued in early 2007 have dropped in value by between 20 % and 80 % , depending on their bond rating .
Using an arithmetic average , and assuming that other mortgage bonds are equally distressed , this implies they have lost at least half their value , or $ 625 bn .
Truth or consequences
Measuring the likely losses faced by individual banks is an even more difficult task .
But what is clear is that most financial institutions have not begun to reveal the full scale of their potential losses .
" The reality is that most financial institutions have barely started to recognise the lower ' fair value ' of their impaired securities , " says Professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University .
" The credit crunch is getting much worse and its financial and real fallout will be severe . "
Some estimates suggest that banks may have vastly under-estimated their potential liability , especially in connection with off - balance sheet activities .
You do n't begin to get resolution of these questions until you get price discovery
Dick Syron , chairman , Freddie Mac
One look at Citigroup , using SEC data , suggested that their potential liability could be $ 343bn rather than the $ 55 bn they declared .
Another issue is how much of the potential liabilities may eventually have to be written off .
In recent announcements , Citigroup wrote off 20 % of its admitted $ 55 bn liability , while other banks have written off between 10 % and 40 % .
Another key measure of the stress on banks is the amount of so - called " tier 3 " capital they are carrying on their books .
These are risky loans that cannot be valued except by an economic model because there is no market for them ..
By that measure , the big investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are much more exposed , relative to their total capital , than Citigroup or Merrill Lynch .
Hidden losses Changes in US accounting rules which come into force on 15 November , known as FASB 157 , may force the big Wall Street banks to come clean on the scale of their losses - especially when accountants have to sign off their annual accounts in January .
It has been a bad year for many Wall Street banks
In particular , it may force them to reveal some of the hidden losses which they have concealed through the use of off - balance - sheet funds ( such as structured investment vehicles , or SIVs . )
These are bank - sponsored financial funds which buy up mortgages - using money borrowed from the short - term commercial paper markets - bundle them up and then sell them to the bond markets .
Thus the banks charge two fees - one at each side of the transaction - and officially have no risk , as they never owned the mortgages .
But in practice , when these funds go bad , the banks are liable either to continue to fund them , or to repurchase the underlying mortgages .
Currently the banks have an estimated $ 340bn in such SIVs , and since the market in short - term asset - backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) has dried up completely , they are forced to put up the short - term funding themselves .
Citigroup , JP Morgan Chase , and Bank of America are the most exposed by this measure .
Rescue fund
The big banks are hoping that they can rescue about $ 75bn of this debt , which they say is perfectly sound , by putting it in a special super - SIV , a plan endorsed by US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in the hope that it will calm the credit markets and help restart their normal functioning .
But even Mr Paulson now admits that the fund will do only a little to reassure investors about the broader mortgage - backed securities market .
And others are clear that the only thing that will restore confidence in the markets is the full disclosure of all the potential losses .
Dick Syron , the chairman of Freddie Mac , says he has experienced many financial crises during his work at the Federal Reserve .
" You do n't begin to get resolution of these questions until you get price discovery , " he says .
" The problem in the market is not just liquidity .
The problem in the market is lack of certainty and lack of information . "
Why did the financial sector get it so wrong ?
But why did it take so long for the banks and the mortgage bond market to realise the scale of the problem that sub - prime lending would cause ?
Abusive or fraudulent lending practices resulted in homeowners taking on mortgage obligations they could not afford , with terms they may not have fully understood
Randall Kroszner , governor , US Federal Reserve
The main reason was that the new system broke the link between the lender and the borrower .
The institutions who owned the loans - the people who bought bonds - had too little information about how dangerous they were .
They relied on the ratings agencies to reassure them that the complex mortgage bonds they were buying were indeed investment - grade .
But those ratings agencies did not understand how , under conditions of " stress , " i.e. , falling house prices , those bonds would fall in value .
And since most pension funds are managed by several different fund managers who all compete with each other to get the best quarterly rate of return , there was a strong incentive to buy as much as they could of these supposedly safe yet high - yielding bonds .
According to David Pitt - Watson , who manages the pension fund business at Hermes , the pension funds failed to exercise their rights to find out enough about what they were buying - or question the way the banks were run .
And he says the system did not give the right financial incentives to encourage lenders to be careful .
Wrong incentives
The system created challenges at the other end as well .
" Gone are the days when a homebuyer only went to the corner bank to take out a mortgage , " says US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
" Today the mortgage system is disaggregated and less personal ... a homeowner having trouble making payments does not know who to turn to for assistance . "
In addition , the new system of mortgage finance did not give the right financial incentives to ensure that proper checks were made on the individuals who applied for sub - prime mortgages .
The banks who offered mortgages and sold them on did not care as much whether the loans went into foreclosure .
They were paid a fee for selling the mortgage on , and another fee for servicing ( collecting the loan payments ) , and even got additional fees if they had to foreclose .
As the banks who sold on these mortgages were not putting up their own money as collateral , they no longer used their own in - house bank managers to assess the income of their borrowers and check the real value of the house they were giving a mortgage on .
Instead , they increasingly turned to mortgage brokers to sell them even more mortgages .
And there is evidence that the poorly - regulated mortgage brokers - whose job it was to check the income of potential mortgagees - and the home appraisers , who had to value the property - began to exaggerate both the income of their clients and the value of the homes , thus getting higher fees themselves .
" The sub - prime mortgage market in recent years was also accompanied by a deterioration in underwriting standards , says Fed governor Randall Kroszner .
" In some cases , abusive or fraudulent lending practices resulted in homeowners taking on mortgage obligations they could not afford , with terms they may not have fully understood . "
It is now up to the regulators and policy makers in Washington to correct the broken mortgage system - before the damage to home owners , banks and the US economy becomes too great .
But whatever is done , it is bound to be painful .
" We ca n't make all the pain go away , " says Mr Syron .
" " We can ameliorate it and most importantly we can try and prevent it happening again but we can't eliminate all of it . "
Further articles in this series will explore the attempts in Washington to repair the damage caused by the sub - prime mess , and its effects on the world economy .

What are these ?
Pro and anti-government protesters were locked out of the campus
There were scuffles as hundreds of supporters and opponents of the president gathered outside the venue .
Eyewitnesses said police used tear gas to hold the demonstrators back .
Student leaders had challenged Mr Ahmadinejad to meet them after he spoke at Columbia University in the US of the freedoms enjoyed by Iranian students .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says all gates to the university were locked and journalists were prevented from entering .
Tear gas
But from outside two groups of demonstrators were clearly visible , each of perhaps a few hundred students , our correspondent says .
One group was made up of government supporters .
Another group of opponents was chanting : " Death to the dictator . "
According to eyewitnesses police used tear gas when the protesters tried to break into the hall where Mr Ahmadinejad was speaking .
They also tried to prevent him leaving .
Protesters eventually dispersed once Mr Ahmadinejad left the university .
It was not a huge crowd but it was one of the first demonstrations against the government here in many months .
Mr Ahmadinejad faced similar dissent during a speech in December 2006 when students at Amir Kabir Technical University called him a dictator and set fire to his picture .
Speech omissions
It has also emerged that parts of a speech given by the president last week in the US may have been blocked by the state broadcaster , our correspondent adds .
During the speech Mr Ahmadinejad criticised those pressing for negotiations on the nuclear issue .
Much of the speech was carried live but those comments were not aired .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks were seen as criticism of supporters of former President Hashimi Rafsanjani .
It seems that Mr Rafsanjani may have some friends in the state broadcasting network who did not want the comments to be aired , our correspondent says .
[ Collected via e-mail , October 2007 ]
There will be a new Children ’s movie out in December called THE GOLDEN COMPASS .
It is written by Phillip Pullman , a proud athiest who belongs to secular humanist societies .
He hates C. S. Lewis ’s Chronical ’s of Narnia and has written a trilogy to show the other side .
The movie has been dumbed down to fool kids and their parents in the hope that they will buy his trilogy where in the end the children kill God and everyone can do as they please .
Nicole Kidman stars in the movie so it will probably be advertised a lot .
This is just a friendly warning that you sure wo n’t hear on the regular TV .
[ Collected via e-mail , October 2007 ]
I do n’t just generally dismiss a movie or book just because someone ‘ says ’ it ’s meant to be something else … but this is worth knowing if you plan to see it ( or plan to take your kids ) .
“ Hi !
I just wanted to inform you what I just learned about a movie that is coming out December 7 , during the Christmas season , which is entitled THE GOLDEN COMPASS .
It stars Nicole Kidman and it is directed toward children .
What is disturbing to me is that this movie is based on the first of a trilogy of books for children called HIS DARK MATERIALS written by Philip Pullman of England .
He ’s an atheist and his objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism .
I heard that he has made remarks that he wants to kill God in the minds of children , and that ’s what his books are all about .
He despises C.S. Lewis and Narnia , etc .
An article written about him said “ this is the most dangerous author in Britain ” and that Pullman would be the writer “ the atheists would be praying for , if atheists prayed . ”
Pullman said he does n’t think it is possible that there is a God and he has great difficulty understanding the words “ spiritual ” and “ spirituality . ”
What I thought was important to communicate is what part of the agenda is for making this picture .
This movie is a watered down version of the first book , which is the least offensive of the three books .
The second book of the trilogy is THE SUBTLE KNIFE and the third book is THE AMBER SPYGLASS .
Each book gets worse and worse regarding Pullman ’s hatred of God .
In the trilogy , a young girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle against a nefarious Church known as the Magisterium .
Another character , an ex-nun , describes Christianity as
“ a very powerful and convincing mistake . ”
As I understand it , in the last book , a boy and girl are depicted representing Adam and Eve and they kill God , who at times is called YAHWEH ( which is definitely not Allah ) .
Since the movie would seem mild if you viewed it , that ’s been done on purpose .
They are hoping that unsuspecting parents will take their children to See the movie , that they will enjoy the movie and then the children will want the books for Christmas .
That ’s the hook .
Pullman says he wants the children to read the books and decide against God and the kingdom of heaven .
If you decide that you do not want to support something like this , I suggest that you boycott the movie and the books .
I googled a synopsis of THE GOLDEN COMPASS .
As I skimmed it , I could n’t believe that in a children ’s book part of the story is about castration and female circumcision .

In a New York Times op - ed article on May 20 , 2007 ( " A Great Idea Lives Forever .
Should n’t Its Copyright ? " ) , Mark Helprin suggests that copyrights , like physical property rights , should last forever .
But in fact , copyrights and physical property rights are vastly different domains , both inherently and in their effects on society .
A closer look at the consequences of perpetual copyright shows Helprin 's suggestion to be based on faulty arguments .
At the core of Helprin 's article is the idea that physical and intellectual property are the same — that intellectual property ought to have the same term limit ( none ) as physical property .
Physical property is quite different in every respect from intellectual property .
Intellectual products by their nature are copied and shared freely and it is on the whole good for society that they be so .
Copyright law has from its inception in the early 18th century imposed a term limit upon intellectual property .
This limit recognizes the great benefit conferred upon the public , and on the common good , to the vast majority , if the state refrains from punishing those who copy and share works for violating an author 's " copyright , " after a certain point in time .
The framers understood that the state - created property monopoly of copyright was justifiable only to the extent that it would " promote the progress of Science and the Useful Arts . "
It created therefore a fixed , and originally very short , period of time in which one might sell copies of one 's works with state protection .
Without this protection , in the nature of intellectual things , piracy was naturally rampant .
After authors have been given a decent interval to exploit their property , the monopoly to the work is ended , and the work may be reabsorbed into the culture at large , be remixed into new works , for the public benefit for the rest of time : hence the name " Public Domain " which refers to the domain of this public good .
But why are intellectual and physical property different ?
How are the differences between laws related to the differences between domains ?
Would it really be so bad for society if they were treated the same way ?
This article explores the answers .
A misguided sense of public good
Helprin argues that copyright is for the " Public Good " , a stance that everyone can agree with .
But then Helprin turns the concept of " Public Good " on its head by asserting that the " Public Good " is something that can only be measured by profit : " ' Freeing ' a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit "
Helprin makes no mention of the " Public Good " that comes from the content of a work being placed into the Public Domain to be discussed in print , copied , derived , modified , mixed , , remixed , or respun into some new work .
He makes no mention of the Public Good that can come about by the creation of a body of brand new artistic expressions by others , without having to negotiate and pay for the privilege .
Ninth Circuit Court Judge Alex Kozinski aptly said that the public good requires a mix of public and private in the dissenting opinion for the 1993 White v. Samsung Electronics case :
“ Private property , including intellectual property , is essential to our way of life .
It provides an incentive for investment and innovation ; it stimulates the flourishing of our culture ; it protects the moral entitlements of people to the fruits of their labors .
But reducing too much to private property can be bad medicine .
Private land , for instance , is far more useful if separated from other private land by public streets , roads and highways .
Public parks , utility rights - of - way and sewers reduce the amount of land in private hands , but vastly enhance the value of the property that remains .
So too with intellectual property .
Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it .
Creativity requires a rich public domain .
Nothing today , likely nothing since we tamed fire , is genuinely new : Culture , like science and technology , grows by accretion , each new creator building on the works of those who came before .
Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it ’s supposed to nurture . ”
Copyright is a monopoly property right that has always been strictly limited to a term of years .
The mass of society has a tremendous interest in the public domain .
Those who suggest eliminating the great social good of the public domain must show the greater positive benefits of wiping the public domain out , benefiting only distant heirs only of those artists whose works have any significance beyond roughly a century .
Helprin has not .
All he does is refer to the metaphorical similarity he imagines between intellectual and physical property .
Copyright in the United States was created for one purpose only , as stated in the Constitution : " to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts " .
To destroy the public domain would postively harm the progress of science and the useful arts , killing off all creativity based on others ' older works , not to mention the huge public benefit to the world of being free to reprint and quote from older works without the gigantic hassles and accounting and transactions costs licensing negotiation with unascertainable groups of heirs .
The great blow to the public interest of eliminating the public domain also would confer a benefit of value only to an infinitesmal handful of those artists whose works retain any value at all , a century or more after publication .
Requiring the whole world to incur the enormous hassles of permissions and licensing to quote or copy , or create derivative works , of all old properties , would be an immensely costly burden imposed on the vast bulk of society , for the benefit a very few .
Helprin 's argument appears to be a complete misreading of what is " public good " and how Congress is authorized to achieve that " public good " .
A misguided concept of public domain
The United States Constitution gives the Congress the power to grant the author exclusive rights to their works for a limited time so long as it Promotes the Progress of the Useful Arts and Sciences .
Helprin argues that this final step of releasing the work into the Public Domain is a confiscation .
" Would it not be just and fair for those who try to extract a living from the uncertain arts of writing and composing to be freed from a form of confiscation not visited upon anyone else ? "
The only way this argument works is if Helprin completely ignores that Copyright grants a legal monopoly where no natural monopoly exists , that this monopoly is created and granted to authors only because doing so Promotes the Progress of Science and the Useful Arts , and that the cost of this monopoly is only justified by a balanced amount of Public Good it will create in the end .
Helprin 's argument ignores this balance , this tradeoff , and simply portrays Copyright as some sort of Natural Right and therefore the expiration of copyright and placing a work in the Public Domain is a " confiscation " .
The problem is that there is no basis for this Natural Right in the US Constitution .
The Courts have consistently reinforced the notion that Copyright is not a Natural Right .
The public , on the other hand , certainly posesses rights ( whether " natural " or not ) of free trade and free expression .
The right of free trade ordinarily would mean that any publisher has the right to bring out an edition of any book in competition with other publishers .
The right of free expression ordinarily would mean that anyone who speaks lawfully and truthfully may do so making use of others ' words as well as his own .
Yet the public refrains from exercising its full rights of free trade and free expression for a time , in order to encourage authors by providing a stable market for new works .
So nothing has been taken from the author when a copyright expires .
The public merely resumes its full rights , which for a time it generously refrained from exercising .
The U.S. Supreme Court has described the relationship of the public to a patentee in the case of Scott Paper v. Marcalus :
The aim of the patent laws is not only that members of the public shall be free to manufacture the product or employ the process disclosed by the expired patent , but also that the consuming public at large shall receive the benefits of the unrestricted exploitation , by others , of its disclosures ....
The public has invested in such free use by the grant of a monopoly to the patentee for a limited time .
( Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co. , Inc. , 67 USPQ 193 , at 196 .
1945 .
Stone , J. Emphasis added . )
The same words , with only a few modifications , describe the relationship of the public to a copyright holder as well :
The aim of the copyright laws ought to be not only that members of the public shall be free to reproduce the expression formerly monopolized under the expired copyright , but also that the consuming public at large shall receive the benefits of the unrestricted exploitation , by others , of the work 's expression .
The public has invested in such free use by the grant of a monopoly to the author for a limited time .
Extracting a living has nothing to do with infinite copyright terms
Helprin 's argument also invokes an emotional plea for authors as struggling artists and uses this as a basis for his argument that copyright should be infinite .
Would it not be just and fair for those who try to extract a living from the uncertain arts of writing and composing to be freed from a form of confiscation not visited upon anyone else ?
This does not stand up to even basic scrutiny .
Copyright terms are already set to expire 70 years after the author 's death .
If an author cannot " extract a living " while he is alive , how does making copyright terms last a thousand more years allow the author to " extract a living " when he is long - since dead ?
Helprin 's error is asserting that the problem of " extracting a living " as an author has something to do with the duration of copyright .
The two are completely unrelated .
Yes , the financial life of an artist , a writer , a musician , can be difficult .
The cause of that problem , however , is not that copyright terms are too short .
If copyright terms were a millennium in duration , it would not be any easier to " extract a living " as an author .
In fact , it would be harder , because they would find it more difficult and costly to build on earlier works , and more legally risky to draw inspiration from them .
Infinite copyright would impose unmanageable burdens on society
Helprin does not present the full costs of infinite copyright .
Instead he presents it solely from the point of view of the author 's benefit if their copyright were made infinite .
However , were the idea of infinite copyright to be taken to its full conclusion , then authors would be paying the heirs of all the ancient Greek tragedies every time they created a derivation of Homer 's Odyssey .
The works of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens would require permission from someone 's distant heir to have a character named " Romeo " or a story about the spirit of Christmas .
Many of Disney 's stories ( Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Sleeping Beauty , Cinderella , etc ) are repackaged versions of old fairy tales that are in the Public Domain .
Helprin is best known for his novel " Winter 's Tale , " which is loosely based on a Shakespearean work by the same name .
This raises the question as to whether Helprin intends to pay royalties to Shakespeare 's descendants .
The net effect of infinite copyright would tend to discourage the creation of new works , rather than encourage them , and the overall impact on the Public Good would be much more negative than whatever positive bonus comes from paying the thousandth generation of some author 's descendants .
This does n't include all the negative costs associated with the simple logistics of tracking the authors and their heirs for all eternity .
The owner of all personalty is one to one and relatively easy to ascertain , and the bill of sale simple .
In real estate , the owner is clearly recorded as to each part of one divisible pie .
Intellectual works are not like a pie .
They are divisible into many overlapping layers of rights both exclusive and non-exclusive each of which may not be mutually exclusive of the other .
Thus some copyright situations become complex , sometimes paralyzingly so .
It can take a specialist lawyer , not even a general practitioner , to figure out these complex relationships , and the transaction costs of locating , reading , and understanding a multiplicity of contracts , each of which has been generated independently of the others ( and often in conflict with them ) is high — very high .
In addition , many times contracts are missing , as authors are in the habit of blindly signing away rights to third parties without any awareness of what they are doing , over and over , without even bothering to retain a copy .
To reduce costs , corporations use paraprofessionals to administer rights .
This leads to ubiquitous errors ( as well as the occasional rent seeking fraud ) and to potentially conflicting claims of ownership , agency , authorizations to license , associated rights of notice and approval among many parties , including the creator , his or her licensing agent , publishers with various overlapping rights and interests , the beneficiaries and their heirs and assignees , and agents and attornies for all of the above .
The administration of complex copyright situations can be even more structurally complex than a routine mid-size corporate reorganization or bankruptcy and involve just as much if not more due diligence , at least in theory .
All these parties and contracts proliferate independently of each other making conflicts and errors common .
While copyright rights and interests can be tracked — and they are by businesses dedicated to the task when economically warranted — the vast majority of creations do not have any economic value a few years after creation , nothing that would justify the maintainence of an expensive transactional and payment apparatus that all of society would be endlessly forced to engage in for eternity .
Orphaned works
One outcome of the already existing copyright terms is the issue of " orphaned works " : works that are still thought to be protected by copyright , but the current copyright holder cannot be found because the original author disappeared , died , published anonymously , and so on .
Were copyright terms to be even longer , the problem of Orphaned Works would only be worse .
Differences between physical property and intellectual works
Tangible goods are rivalrous goods
For one person to gain some tangible item , another person must lose it .
For one person to gain the ownership of some piece of land , the previous owner must surrender ownership .
This is the ordinary state of physical property , and the laws around physical property are designed around this fact .
Property taxes , zoning laws , and similar legal constructs are examples of how the law relates to physical property .
Intellectual works are non-rivalrous
Intellectual works are ordinarily non-rivalrous .
It is possible for someone to teach a work of the mind to another without unlearning it himself .
For example , one , or two , or a hundred people can memorize the same poem at the same time .
Here the term " work of the mind " refers not to physical items such books or compact discs or DVD's , but rather to the intangible content those physical objects contain .
Because of the non-rivalrous nature of intellectual works , the possibility is higher than with rivalrous goods that an unrestrained market for new works will fail .
The initial publisher of the work , who pays the author , has the first - to - market advantage , but this might not be enough to compensate for the second - comer 's advantage in not having to pay the author .
Note that failure in an unrestricted market for non-rivalrous goods is not inevitable .
In 1998 the Kenneth Starr report on the Monica Lewinsky affair was offered by three competing publishers , and all seem to have enjoyed good sales .
But that was a case of a work for which there was certain to be a high demand , and for which no author had to be paid .
In other cases demand will be high enough to encourage second - comers , but not high enough for the first comer , the one who pays the author , to recoup .
Publishers will tend to hang back , waiting for someone else to take the chance on paying authors , so that few authors will be able to sell their new works ; or the publishers will collude , creating a de-facto form of private copyright without the limitations and accountability of statutory copyright .
Statutory copyright tries to prevent this sort of market failure by stabilizing the market for new works that must be purchased from their authors .
A publisher who takes a chance on a new work will , if the work be successful , have a limited period of monopoly control over the title .
This temporary freedom from sharp competition acts as an encouragement to publishers to seek out new works from authors , and to offer them to the public .
Deprivation
The owner of physical property can clearly be deprived of the use of their property by the act of confiscation .
But no such deprivation occurs when a work enters the public domain .
For this reason alone Helprin 's analogy is inapt .
This is the most powerful emotional argument the maximalists have on their side , and it is the one most easily demolished .
The previous copyright holder can still publish their works , or market them more effectively , or even amend and modify them , at which time they will receive the benefit of continued copyright protection .
Besides monetary differences , physical property and intellectual creations have deep differences in their respective uses by society .
While one 's ownership of some object may prevent someone else from owning the very same object , it often does not prevent that person from owning a physically or functionally identical one .
( While two people can't have the very same waterfront view , two people can own virtually identical cars . )
And because one can own a functionally identical object , another 's physical ownership does not generally impede one 's own personal behavior or use .
A copyright , however , impedes others ' behavior , and not just behavior but their speech , because to communicate something someone has already said , you must reproduce it ( orally , visually on paper , etc. ) .
To put it simply , a world in which physical property mirrored copyrighted intellectual property would be a world where no one could own anything without paying royalties for it to someone else .
If one happens to find Mr. Helprin 's article a most effective argument , and wants to convince others of the same point by using those very effective words , copyright can prevent such speech from taking place .
And because new creative works are often derivative in some ways from older works ( i.e. mixes of excerpts of older works , original transformations of various kinds ) , copyrights stifle the ability to create .
How many high school plays would be impossible if Shakespeare 's descendants charged a fee for every production ?
Copyrights are personal property only by analogy
Helprin 's entire argument is based on the analogy of a copyright to a piece of real estate .
This is an unsatisfactory analogy for a number of reasons .
To begin with , to the extent that a copyright is " property " at all , it is for the most part treated in law as personal property , not real property .
Besides this , even the analogy to personal property is imperfect .
In particular , the copyright law contains a provision known as " termination rights " ( of which Mr Helprin is perfectly aware , for he mentions them in passing ) which throw up an extreme exception to any claim that copyrights are property .
In the world of personal property , barring cases of unconscionability or failure of consideration , all sales are final .
If you sell your apple after you take one bite , you do n't get a second bite .
The termination rights are provided in copyright law precisely in order to provide authors a second bite at the apple .
But that makes a copyright quite unlike a property right .
If Mr Helprin truly believes that copyrights should be as much like property as possible , he should argue for the abolition of the termination - rights provisions .
But then , the more like personal property copyrights became , the less likely they would be to benefit authors and their heirs .
For in the nature of things , copyrights would almost always be sold irrevocably by the authors to publishers .
Authors in a strong bargaining position would get a royalty contract with a provision for a reversion of rights under certain circumstances .
Most would probably have to settle for less advantageous terms , or even find that they must sell the copyright outright for a lump sum .
In such a case their heirs would see nothing but what came from that one - time payment .
The existence of an expiration date , on the other hand , does not necessarily make a copyright unlike a piece of personal property .
A number of items of personal property can have expiration dates .
A goldfish that I buy at the pet store is my personal property , but it must eventually die .
An egg that I buy from the grocery store must eventually be eaten or go bad .
A bank check in my wallet is my property , but it may become invalid if it is not cashed within a certain time .
I might buy an option to purchase a commodity for a certain price within a certain time .
The option is my property while it lasts .
If I do not exercise the option , it expires , but I have not thereby been " stripped " of my property .
The expiration was inherent to the nature of the property .
Perhaps Helprin is not comparing the copyright to a piece of real estate , but instead is comparing the work - in - itself to the real estate , and the copyright to the title in the real estate .
The first part , the comparison of a work of authorship to a piece of developed land , is absurd .
The two are nothing alike .
It was noted in the earlier discussion of rivalrous and non-rivalrous goods that works of the mind are intangible .
One can carry a work of the mind -- the work itself -- in the mind .
One can not put a house itself into one 's mind .
The analogy fails .
But if we go ahead and make the analogy anyhow , comparing the work - in - itself to a piece of land , why should we compare it to a piece of privately - owned land , rather than to a piece of public property on which the author has made some improvement , in exchange for which the he gets the exclusive right to manage the improvement for a term of years ?
For example , if a builder were to build a bridge on public land , and be paid with the privilege of charging tolls for the use of the bridge for a limited term ?
Or if a builder were to build a tourist lodge in a public park , and be paid with an exclusive contract to manage the lodge for a term of years ?
So the analogy game can be played either way .
If anything , the inherently public and shared nature of works of the human mind would favor comparing the work - in - itself to a piece of public property , rather than to a piece of private property .
If we pass by these difficulties and let a work of authorship be considered analogous to a house built on private land , we come to the second part of Helprin 's analogy , which considers the copyright in the work analogous to the title in the house and land .
This part of Helprin 's analogy is even sillier than the first part .
If a private house is taken as the analog of a work of authorship , then the copyright would be analogous to a law passed by the state , forbidding all others from building " substantially similar " houses , even on their own land at their own expense .
( In the U.S. , the copyright law does precisely this , since it applies to works of architecture ) .
If a private house must be taken to be analogous to a work of authorship , the expiration of the copyright is analogous not to the revocation of the title to the house , but is instead analagous to the expiration of the anti-competitive law that forbids all others from using their property in the same way that the first builder used his .
So the only apt legal analogies to copyright come from the realm of state - granted monopolies , since that is what copyrights in fact are .
The closest analogy is that of a patent for an invention , which always comes with an expiration date .
Yet the expiration of a patent is not a " taking " .
It was a giving , of an exclusive privilege in exchange for an invention .
Rule against perpetuities
The suggestion that a perpetual copyright would place intellectual property on equal footing with physical property ignores the reality that the laws that govern physical property also limit the length of time a property owner can restrict the use of that property -- perhaps not surprisingly , the limit is commonly the lifetime of the owner plus a set number of years .
Under both common law and statute , an owner of physical property cannot place limits on its use for more than a certain number of years after the owner 's death ( the so - called " rule against perpetuities " ) .
For example , if I own land and want the land to only be used as the site of a church for my particular religion , I can do that .
I can even leave the property to someone in my will , and for a certain period of time after I die , I can make it so that the land continues to be used only as the site for my church .
But only for a limited time ; the law wo n't let me place a " perpetual " restriction on the land .
After the limited time expires , whoever has the property can do whatever they want with it : sell it ; keep the church ; tear down the church and build a park , a Wal - Mart , houses or a museum .
In other words , the law recognizes that dead people should n't be allowed to control the use of physical property that might be put to better use by the living .
The drafters of the Constitution made an analogous recognition of the value of limiting intellectual property rights when they wrote that an exclusive right to one 's ideas -- a restriction on others ' use of those ideas -- could only be enforced for a limited time .
We assume that it was James Madison who wrote the Constitution 's " progress " clause ; it is all the more meaningful therefore that , after retiring from the Presidency , Madison wrote a memorandum on " Monopolies [ and ]
Perpetuities ... " in which he makes it clear that the limit on copyright and patent was meant precisely to prevent perpetuities .
Perpetuities in land were , for Madison , one of the tools by which European feudal and ecclesiastical estates maintained their power over time .
He thus linked their erasure to political and religious liberty , writing that “ Perpetual monopolies ... are forbidden ... by the Genius of free governments .... ”
It might be objected that the rule against perpetuities is inapposite to Helprin 's point .
The rule agains perpetuities limits the term in which a dead owner 's will can restrict the use of a piece of land , but it does not prevent the existence , for an indefinite term , of a private title to the land .
However , the analogy to perpetuities is not as off - point as it may seem .
For Helprin , the copyright is first and foremost an author 's right .
Helprin 's argument roots itself in his view of the deep and personal relationship between the author and a work .
Yet for a copyright to be assumed by someone who is not the author at all is prima facie a violation of this relationship .
The inconsistency is resolved only if one supposes the existence of some sort of ongoing relationship between the author and the work .
Hence the copyright , in a world in which authors are inseparable from their works , has the character of a perpetuity .
Perpetuities in land , moreover , were not all that mattered to Madison ; his memorandum opens with a remark on what we now call intellectual property :
" Monoplies , tho ' in certain cases useful , ought to be granted with caution , and guarded with strictness against abuse .
The Constitution of the U. S. has limited them to two cases , the authors of Books , and of useful inventions , in both which they are considered as a compensation for a benefit actually gained to the community , as a purchase of property which the owner might otherwise withold from public use .
There can be no just objection to a temporary monopoly in these cases but it ought to be temporary , because under that limitation a sufficient recompence and encouragement may be given . "
( See : " Madison 's ‘ Detached Memoranda . ’ "
William and Mary Quarterly , 3d ser. , 3 ( 1946 ) : 534-68 . )
Surface glosses
Mr. Helprin writes :
" The flow and proportion of the elements of a work of art , its subtle engineering , even its surface glosses , combine substance and style indistinguishably in a creation for which the right of property is natural and becoming . "
Surface glosses ?
At this point , it seems to me that Mr. Helprin is confusing a physical painting , from the image depicted in the painting .
No one could feasibly claim that the property rights the owner of a particular painting enjoys should be stripped away after a period of time , nor is this reflected in the copyright law .
Instead , it is the exclusive right to reproduce , to modify , and to derive from that image new works that expires for the copyright holder .
Let 's take Picasso's painting , Guernica .
Clearly the painting on the canvas -- what we would call the original -- can be bought and sold forever .
However there is another Picasso painting called Guernica , and this is the reproduction of that original Art , in the millions .
Let 's assume for the moment that Guernica is covered by copyright ( or some other intellectual property right ) .
In this case , these millions of reproductions and copies have both value and existence independent of the physical version .
They operate in their own regime .
The peculiar nature of these copies , and the fact that one can make them without much effort , demands a different set of policies of fairness and encouragement .
This subset of the law contains copyrights .
But he does n't have his manuscript in mind .
He is thinking of the abstract virtual notion of the book as a reproducible intangible .
However when it comes to protection of that work , he conflates the two into one .
There 's no difference between these two classes of property -- tangible and intangible -- he claims , and this claim is central to his argument .
But if Mr. Helprin really believed that there was little difference between real and intellectual property , he should not be advocating the infinite extension of copyright , but the immediate elimination of it .
After all , if tangible and intangible property are truly so indistinguishable , then the current property laws should cover both .
Why have redundant laws ?
Who benefits from sale
And why assume it is his descendents who benefit from the sale ?
As a physical good there 's no need for the Art to remain in the ownership of Picasso 's descendents .
In fact , over the long - term , the parties who will make the most money from the sale and resale of this good are not Picasso's heirs , but the highest bidder .
The millions made in the future by this Art are zero benefit to Picasso himself .
To use Helprins ' example of a house one might build :
In the long - term , the greatest beneficiaries of a house will most likely not be the children of the builder , but a long chain of unrelated others that live in the future .
The builder himself gains nothing of that later value .
The benefits may stay in with his genes for a generation or two , if that , and then , if history is any guide , the benefits go to the wisest investor .
If the original Guernica ( or any of Picasso's other paintings ) had to return to the commons after Picasso's death , then that fact could diminish the value of his work during his lifetime , and thus affect his livelihood .
Is there any evidence that copies behave in the same manner ?
Is there any evidence that had copyright been infinite from the beginning of history -- and that any literary or artistic use of a character , phrase , or plot line from the Greeks , Romans , and the Bible would have required permission and probably payment to someone -- that society would be both wealthier and richer ?
It is hard to imagine .
Cultural economics : more money to dead authors means less for living authors
It has been remarked above that intellectual works are inherently non-rivalrous : access to an intangible good is not necessarily a zero-sum situation .
Nevertheless zero-sum arithmetic can influence the cultural marketplace .
This is most easily illustrated by means of an example .
A church denomination printing a hymnal will of course include old favorites .
They may also , however , encourage living writers to contribute words or music to the new hymnal .
A percentage of the price of each unit sold will be set aside to pay copyright royalties .
The money will be distributed among the various rightsholders whose works appear in the hymnal , in proportion to the size of their contributions .
An author who writes four stanzas of a new lyric will generally get more than an author who writes only one new stanza for an old lyric .
A composer who harmonizes an old tune will generally get less than a composer who writes a complete new tune with harmonization .
But all claimants will get a share .
However , if the publisher had to pay royalties to the eatates of George Herbert ( d. 1633 ) and J. S. Bach ( d. 1750 ) , it would probably do so .
Works by these old authors are enduring favorites .
The publisher excludes them from the collection at its peril .
But the more the publisher would have to pay to the estates of long - dead authors , the less it would have to pay living authors for their contributions .
Note that this does not necessarily work the other way .
If a hymnal contains much publici juris material , the pool of clearance money is not necessarily distributed among fewer claimants .
Instead the publisher may simply pocket a share of the clearance money in proportion to the amount public domain material .
Yet if there were no publici juris material at all due to copyrights lasting for centuries or millenia , the heavy toll paid to the estates of dead authors would inevitably be paid at the expense of living authors .
Helprin shows some knowledge of the book - trade where he writes
" Barnes & Noble is able to publish price - reduced non-copyrighted works not so much because it saves the 10 percent to 15 percent of revenue that would go to the gruel - eating authors , but because it saves the 50 percent that would go to the publishers .
Booksellers that publish their own titles benefit not from escaping the author ’s copyright , but the previous publisher ’s exercise of a grant of rights ( limited , authors take note , to 35 years ) .
“ Freeing ” a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit from , for example , “ The Garden Party , ” while the descendants of Katherine Mansfield will not . "
but his view is distorted .
It is true that most of the price of a copyrighted book does not go to author 's royalties .
Rather , it is the monopolist 's mark - up .
Books from which the copyright has expired are in general cheaper , page for page , than copyrighted books because the market for them is competitive .
The monopolist 's surplus has become a consumer 's surplus .
This is ordinarily considered a good thing .
The entire public -- including the descendants of Katherine Mansfield -- is ordinarily thought to benefit from free markets and the creation of consumer surpluses .
Comparisons to slavery
Helprin writes : " [ Copyright ] is , then , for the public good .
But it might also be for the public good were Congress to allow the enslavement of foreign captives and their descendants ( this was tried ) ; the seizure of Bill Gates ’s bankbook ; or the ruthless suppression of Alec Baldwin . "
Is Mr. Helprin seriously suggesting that the limitations on copyright are tantamount to slavery ?
No one compels an artist to create , he does it of his own volition .
Thereafter , if he chooses to share his work with the world , he is entitled to certain ( limited ) rights in exchange for that act of sharing .
Helprin correctly observes that copyright is designed to promote the public good but soon goes far off track .
The institution of slavery , he argues , was originally something Congress envisioned as being in the public good .
Helprin is , perhaps , referring to the Corwin amendment .
The amendment , which is still waiting to be ratified by 36 states , would have prohibited the federal government from preventing states from allowing slavery .
As such , it is commonly seen as a last ditch effort to prevent the Civil war , and was actually supported by Lincoln .
Arguably , Corwin 's amendment was suggested for the public good , but not for the benefit of slave owners -- it was attempted to prevent the country from going to war , a cause most justifiably in the public good .
What 's more , * ordinary * property rights governing land and chattel have evolved at common law in order to maximize the public good .
You always have to make tradeoffs between plausible - sounding " natural rights " like the right to have peace and quiet on your land and the right to enjoy your land by having loud parties on it .
You have to pick some legal regime to balance these interests , and it will inevitably exclude some " rights " that some constituency considers pre-legal .
Either Helprin thinks this process is illegitimate , and adopting one rule or the other inevitably " exclude [s ] from common equity the rights you seek to abridge , " or he really just does n't get what this " law " business is all about .
Copyright , patents and the idea - expression dichotomy
Helprin 's article is titled " A Great Idea Lives Forever .
Should n't Its Copyright ? "
Whether the title came from Helprin himself or a headline editor at the New York Times , it raises an important point .
The word " idea " must be carefully used in a copyright context because it sometimes occurs in that context in a narrow , technical sense , referring to one pole of what is called the " idea / expression dichotomy " .
It should be noted that the word " idea " is not always used so narrowly as to exclude expression .
Some 17th - and 18th - century writers , for example , are aware of what we now call the " idea / expression dichotomy " , but seem to prefer the terms " sentiment " or " thought " for the first pole of the dichotomy , rather than " idea " , and " language " or " expression " for the second .
Even today the word " idea " can be used broadly to include , rather than exclude , " expression " .
In the remainder of this section , however , " idea " will be used to refer to ideas in the narrow sense of the term , as distinguished from expressions , unless provided otherwise .
Copyright law has long distinguished between expressions , which can be protected under copyright , from ideas , which cannot .
Under this principle , the copying of major plot elements and characters from the book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail in The Da Vinci Code was held not to be actionable in copyright by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales ( Civil Division ) in Baigent v. Random House [ 2007 ] EWCA Civ 247 .
Ideas falling on the wrong side of the idea - expression divide have long been held to be within the province of patent law rather than copyright law .
In this regard a particularly revealing fact is that patent law , which does concern the protection of ideas , has never recognised a perpetual monopoly .
The traditional rationale for patent law is to incentivise the disclosure of new ideas by inventors in return for a time - limited monopoly .
In this manner the public obtains the benefit of disclosure of that idea , and in return the inventor gets a limited period of time in which to exploit his idea commercially .
After the patent period the idea enters the public domain and anyone is then free to improve upon that idea .
The patent system is therefore built around the very notion that any new idea must eventually enter the public domain , and encourages proactive disclosure of ideas ( and thus their entry into the public domain ) by means of a limited monopoly period .
In this discussion of Helprin 's essay , the so - called idea / expression dichotomy is important because the " dichotomy " is not always clear , especially in cases of " altered copying " : Designer Guild v. Russell Williams [ 2000 ] UKHL 58 ( United Kingdom House of Lords ) .
In the field of music , is a IV - V - I chord progression " idea " or " expression " ?
If it is " idea " , is it perhaps so only because it began as " expression " which was subsequently so widely copied that musicians came to abstract it as an idea ?
One law court might rule that plot elements and characters are " idea " rather than " expression " , but another might draw the line differently .
The only certain way of making sure that all " ideas " become publici juris is by making sure that all the expression containing those thoughts becomes publici juris as well .
If the distinction between ideas and expressions is merely one of degree of abstraction , having perpetual protection for expressions ( copyright ) but time - limited protection for ideas ( patents ) is unjustifiable .
The meaning of the Constitution
Helprin does not suggest amending the Constitution .
Rather , he suggests interpreting it so that the qualifying phrase " for limited times " could be taken literally to mean very long times , presumably centuries .
This interpretation suggests that this qualifying phrase is possibly extraneous language .
However , the U.S. Constitution is one of the most carefully prepared documents in history , and Helprin explicitly argues against Thomas Jefferson 's written rationale for the inclusion of " for limited times " in the Constitution .
Words in written law are intended to have a practical effect on lives of people .
The use of the word " limited " ( in this context ) requires a definable limitation with a practical importance .
Helprin would extend copyright to the limits of the endurance of civilizations and far beyond the practical point anybody could possibly care about or remember the original authors .
The " starving artist " canard
The more time that passes from a period of time , fewer are the artists and authors whose works are studied and appreciated .
Helprin suggests that the descendants of modestly successful writers might benefit from a further extension of copyright .
Yet this argument has no practical validity whatever : the possible remuneration is too small to be worth the effort of collecting .
Moreover , Helprin 's entire defense of the rights of descendants to property is overwrought and presumptuous .
We do n't hold people liable for the crimes or debts of their forebears : indeed , credit card companies write off substantial amounts due to people dying in debt .
Yet Helprin would have countless generations profit without effort from mere ideas ( or recordings ) of the past .

Spider Robinson's
Hugo award winning short story Melancholy Elephants follows a character named Dorothy Martin who goes to a powerful Senator in an attempt to kill a copyright bill that will make copyright terms last forever .
Dorothy argues to the Senator that there are a finite number of musical notes and therefore a finite number of appreciably different melodies , and that an ever longer copyright will mean no one will be able to recreate those same melodies into new songs .
This follows the " Only so many permutations " section above .
However , in 2003 Spider Robinson wrote that he believed that his children should be able to collect royalties on his writings after he dies .
He also defended the Copyright Term Extension
Act because if it had n't , " Steamboat Willie ( the Mouse himself ! ) would have slipped into the public domain . "
Robinson says he " would n't mind extending it ( terms ) further . "
Exactly when Mr. Robinson believes copyright should expire is not known :

Sadly this idea of perpetual copyright might have muddled some heads , and Egypt wants to ... copyright the pyramids !!!

How ridiculous !
They are thousands of years old !
Is the government the author ?
& how is this going to foster future innovation ?
Some just think of copyright as the longest term that could assure them a protected monopoly , without any intent on satisfying ( or even finding out ) the requirements for copyright .
Hopefully such reports would sober up the public and let it squeeze the greed of a few successful authors and their lobbies .
An argument against a Life - Plus - N year long copyright is put forth in Bounty Hunters : Metaphors for Fair Intellectual Property Law , which is available under a CC - BY license .
In " Bounty Hunters " , authors are paid for their labor of creating new works similar to the way a bounty hunter is paid for their labor of catching a fugitive .
Once a fugitive is caught , the world is forever a better place , however no one would ever seriously argue for paying a bounty hunter a yearly reward that lasts for all eternity .
The government 's job of setting any such reward or bounty would be to set it as low as possible but just high enough to get the job done ( i.e. , lowest successful bidder ) .
And American history , all the way up until 1976 , shows that authors were willing to create new works , new movies , new artistic expressions for the reward of a copyright of 56 years or less .
The Statute of Anne , the first fully - fledged copyright law , was a reaction to the status - quo of the time ( early 1700's ) , and replaced a regime remarkably like the one being proposed , except that then the authors had no option to even self - publish .
However , the push to return to that regime seems to be coming from the modern equivalent of the Stationers , not the authors who have not yet made their names and fortunes .
So in that sense , this proposal has already been tried -- and failed .
Yes , a real toilet - themed restaurant has just opened in Taipei , Taiwan .
Just about everything from the seats to bowls , and even the ice cream is toilet - inspired .
Though the concept may seem bizarre , the food does look quite tasty , or so we think .

By StrangeWork.com : Yesterday was International Talk Like a Pirate Day and boy was it big in the Web 2.0 world this year .
It seemed everywhere you looked there was a Pirate themed logo , Pirate jokes , and more ARRRS than you wanted to read .
Flickr changed their logo for the day and Meebo introduced new pirate buddy icons .
So why the change ?
Just a few short years ago Talk Like a Pirate Day was only followed by your local uber geeks in between games of D&D and reruns of Dragon Ball Z .
In this Web 2.0 connected world , trends like Pirate Day grow at a tremendous rate .
I have serious doubts that most people on Twitter posting ARRR this and ARRR that ( myself included ) were walking around their office calling their boss a LANDLUBBER !
The internet has always allowed people to be more open and the social networking aspect of Web 2.0 helps further that even more .
I did have a fun time reading the countless ARR Twitter updates throughout the day , and even posted a few of my own .
I would not be surprised if next year we are receiving invites to a Pirate only social network !
Quick , someone register ARRRRspace.com .
You never know !
On a side note I would love to see some traffic stats on TalkLikeAPirate.com for yesterday .
Knowing the site was bombarded with traffic yesterday and not seeing one AdSense ad makes my stomach hurt .
According to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees , about 1.2 million Iraqi refugees now live in Syria ; the Syrian government puts the figure even higher .
Given the deteriorating economic situation of those refugees , a United Nations report found last year , many girls and women in “ severe need ” turn to prostitution , in secret or even with the knowledge or involvement of family members .
In many cases , the report added , “ the head of the family brings clients to the house . ”
Aid workers say thousands of Iraqi women work as prostitutes in Syria , and point out that as violence in Iraq has increased , the refugee population has come to include more female - headed households and unaccompanied women .
“ So many of the Iraqi women arriving now are living on their own with their children because the men in their families were killed or kidnapped , ” said Sister Marie - Claude Naddaf , a Syrian nun at the Good Shepherd convent in Damascus , which helps Iraqi refugees .
She said the convent had surveyed Iraqi refugees living in Masaken Barzeh , on the outskirts of Damascus , and found 119 female - headed households in one small neighborhood .
Some of the women , seeking work outside the home for the first time and living in a country with high unemployment , find that their only marketable asset is their bodies .
“ I met three sisters - in - law recently who were living together and all prostituting themselves , ” Sister Marie - Claude said .
“ They would go out on alternate nights — each woman took her turn — and then divide the money to feed all the children . ”
For more than three years after the American - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Iraqi prostitution in Syria , like any prostitution , was a forbidden topic for Syria ’s government .
Like drug abuse , the sex trade tends to be referred to in the local news media as acts against public decency .
But Dietrun Günther , an official at the United Nations refugee agency ’s Damascus office , said the government was finally breaking its silence .
Could have fooled me , and did .
Was I ever gullible .
It really did seem like legislative leaders would honor their word and surrender the power to draw their own districts , a direct conflict of interest .
How much of a conflict ?
They ’ve been rigging the elections by choosing their own voters .
Gerrymandering , it ’s called , too often with a dismissive shrug that says , politicians will be politicians .
In the last three election cycles , only four seats have changed parties in 495 California legislative and congressional races .
But last week , for the second straight year , redistricting reform died quietly on the final day of the legislative session .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger shares the blame .
I actually thought he ’d insist that the Legislature hand over redistricting to an independent commission .
Figured he ’d play tough .
Make Democratic leaders an “ offer . ”
Call them into his corner office in the Capitol , stare them down and say something like :
Look , I ’ll endorse and campaign for your term limits ballot measure -- or I ’ll oppose it and raise money to beat the thing .
Your call .
But without redistricting reform , you people do n’t deserve a break on term limits .
The governor implied it , but apparently never held the gun to the temple .
And when time ran out on the regular legislative session , he called new “ special ” sessions for healthcare and water , but not for redistricting .
Why ?
Senate leader Don Perata ( D - Oakland ) did n’t have “ much interest , ” Schwarzenegger said .

Indeed , Perata had just told reporters that if the governor did call a special session for redistricting , “ I ’m not going to take it up .
There ’s an urgency in healthcare .
There ’s an urgency in water .
There is not an urgency in redistricting . ”
So Perata was n’t much interested .
So what ?
The Democratic leader does n’t hold many of the Republican governor ’s interests .
But it should n’t stop the governor from pursuing his priorities -- especially one like redistricting that he claims to “ feel very passionate about . ”
“ The person who did n’t do their job was the governor , ” says Republican Sen .
Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield , author of a combo constitutional amendment that would reform redistricting and relax term limits .
“ This was Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s moment and he ran from it . ”
Then , referring to the name Schwarzenegger once called Democratic legislators , Ashburn added : “ Maybe the governor has proven himself to be the ultimate ‘ girlie man . ’ ”

Sen . Alan Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) , author of another redistricting measure , says : “ I ’m critical of everyone .
It does n’t seem to me that at the end of the day anyone wanted to stand up and fight for this .
The leadership did n’t want to see it happen .
“ It was a complete , abject failure of the Legislature to do what it committed to the public it would do . ”
Let ’s back up and recall the precise promise .
In 2005 , Schwarzenegger was backing a goofy redistricting proposal on his special election ballot .
It would have forced a mid-decade redistricting , rather than waiting for the customary next census .
Worse , it would have required any redistricting to be approved by a statewide vote , a political consultants ’ bonanza .
Advertisement
If voters would reject the governor ’s ballot proposition , Perata told me , “ Our commitment .
. . is to fashion a bipartisan solution in a thoughtful way and put it on the ballot next year . ”
Ditto , said Assembly Speaker Fabian Nuñez ( D - Los Angeles ) .
The Schwarzenegger measure was soundly rejected by nearly 60 % of voters .
Then the Democratic leaders did n’t deliver .
Schwarzenegger , Perata and Nuñez last week suggested that maybe they ’d get it done next year and place a redistricting reform measure on the November 2008 ballot .
Has a familiar ring .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , on the Feb. 5 presidential primary ballot , only the term limits initiative is booked .
It would reduce the total years allowed in the Legislature from 14 to 12 , but permit all the time to be spent in one house .
Currently there ’s a six - year limit in the Assembly and eight - year cap in the Senate .
Without the measure , Nuñez and Perata will be termed out next year .
The Democratic leaders originally planned to pair term limits with redistricting as a marketable political reform package .
“ We ca n’t put one on the ballot without the other , ” Nuñez asserted early last year .
What happened ?
There are many excuses , but no justification .
It comes down to lack of either commitment or competence .
A lot of fingers are being pointed .
Advertisement
Perata , despite his original heat - of - passion pledge , shudders at the thought of giving up the gerrymandering power .
Yet , he did allow both the Ashburn and Lowenthal measures to pass the Senate and go to the Assembly , where they were denied committee hearings for weeks .
Nuñez worked hard on his own plan , but could n’t strike a deal with Republicans , the distracted governor or what one senior aide calls the “ goody - two - shoes ” reform groups .
One hang - up was over whether to allow the Legislature to continue drawing congressional districts or to make it hand the task to an independent commission .
It was feared that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) would raise millions to oppose any redistricting scheme that did n’t permit Democratic gerrymandering .
Conversely , GOP leaders insisted that the Democratic - dominated Legislature keep its hands off House seats .
The solution should have been easy : Strip only legislative redistricting from the Legislature .
It ’s not a direct conflict anyway for state lawmakers to draw House seats .
Advertisement
But negotiations apparently never got that far .
Tony Quinn , a former redistricting consultant for Republicans , thinks this legislative failure kills all chances for reform .
“ I do n’t believe there ’s any possibility of getting this in the future , ” he says .
“ It had to be tied to term limits .
Democrats had to get something to give up something . ”
Term limits should be eased .
But should they be eased while lawmakers still have the power to rig their own elections ?
That ’s a question we ’ll have to mull .

About 200 villagers have fallen ill from mysterious gases that spewed from a crater in southeastern
Peru believed to have been caused by a meteorite crash , officials and scientists say .
But they say no radiation has been detected .
Scores of residents of the farming village of Carancas began vomiting and complaining of headaches and dizziness after an apparent meteorite struck the area at the weekend , leaving a crater 8 metres deep and 20 metres wide .
" We have determined with precision instruments that there is no radiation , " says engineer Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute Ramirez says the illnesses may have been triggered by sulfur , arsenic or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the apparent meteorite strike .
"
It is a conventional meteorite that , when it struck , produced gases by fusing with elements of the terrain , " he says .
He also ruled out that the object was a satellite .
But not all experts are convinced that the ' crater ' was really formed by a meteorite , instead suggesting that natural geological processes could have led to the release of noxious gases into the atmosphere .
Nestor Quispe , mayor of the nearby town of Desaguadero , says about 200 sick villagers are being treated and that Carancas residents fear long - term side effects .
The director of the health ministry in the Puno region , Jorge Lopez , says none of the patients was in serious condition but that they would have to undergo blood and neurological tests as a precaution in three to six months .

The setup 's top center monitor clearly is smaller than the rest of the supposedly identical peripheral screens .
If anything , from this perspective , it should be bigger than the other wings , unless its recessed , which seems like a bad idea .
And the running cost for those monitors alone is in the $ 2000 - $ 2500 dollar range , according to froogle .
Does that mean the stand , which looks like the one from the 21 - inch alone , is worth 800 ?
Please , I 've seen houses of playing cards that looked more sturdy .
Also , the company 's website makes no clear statement about what video card and slots you 'll need to drive this many pixels .

The Aspartame Scandal
Betty Martini , Founder Mission Possible InternationaL
Previously published by Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation
The Thalidomide of the 90’s is Aspartame , otherwise known as Equal , Nutrasweet or Spoonful .
In May , 1992 an article in Flying Safety Magazine explained the dangers of this ubiquitous substance .
Some people have triggered aspartame related disorders with doses as small as that carried in a single stick of chewing gum .
This could mean a pilot who drinks diet sodas is more susceptible to flicker vertigo or to flicker - induced epileptic activity .
It also means that all pilots are potential victims of sudden memory loss , dizziness during instrument flight and gradual loss of vision .
Some pilots have experienced grand mal seizures in the cockpits of commercial airline flights and have lost medical certification to fly -- and with it their careers .
The FDA has received more than 10,000 consumer complaints on Nutra - Poison .
That ’s 80 % of all complaints about food additives , yet they remain comatose and have done nothing to alert the American consumer who assumes , since it ’s so highly advertised , that it must be safe as mother ’s milk .
If you are using aspartame and have headaches , depression , slurred speech , loss of memory , fibromyalgia type symptoms , loss of sensation in lower legs or shooting pains , loss of equilibrium , vertigo , anxiety attacks , chronic fatigue , vision loss , floaters , retinal detachment , seizures , heart palpitations , etc. , you have Aspartame Disease !
Many physicians are diagnosing multiple sclerosis when in reality it is methanol toxicity which mimics MS .
Get off this dangerous drug right away .
MS is not a death sentence , but methanol toxicity is !
Fifty - one percent of FDA approved drugs have serious risks and could cause adverse reactions that lead to severe or permanent disability or death .
The Center for Disease Control , Johns Hopkins University and the New Jersey School of Medicine estimate that 80,000 - 120,000 Americans are killed by prescription drugs every year .
That this atrocious holocaust persists has everything to do with money and nothing to do with public health .
Monsanto reaps $ 2 billion per year from the Aspartame toxic bonanza .
This can buy a lot of bureaucrats !
Does FDA mean Fatal Drugs Allowed ?
The FDA works for industry , not citizens .
FDA head Arthur Hayes overruled his own board of inquiry to approve aspartame and then went to work for their public relations firm .
Federal attorney Sam Skinner was assigned to prosecute Searle for fraudulent tests in their application , but switched sides and went to work for Searle ’s lawyers and the case died when the statute of limitations ran out .
Honest FDA toxicologist , the late Dr. Adrian Gross , wrote to Senator Howard Metzenbaum : " The views of the FDA ’s Center for Food Safety read like a script written for Abbott & Costello in the sense of their having perceptions inside - out and upside - down .
... FDA may have gone through the motions .
... such a ‘ process ’ or dance represents a farce and a mockery . "
Aspartame is a molecule composed of three components : aspartic acid , phenylalanine and methanol .
Methanol is wood alcohol that has killed or blinded thousands of skid row drunks .
It converts into formaldehyde and formic acid ( ant sting poison ) in the gut .
Formaldehyde , a deadly neurotoxin , is common embalming fluid , a Class A carcinogen .
Phenylalanine is also neurotoxic when unaccompanied by the other amino acids in proteins .
Aspartic acid causes brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders in experimental animals .
There are 92 documented symptoms including headaches , numbness , fatigue , blurred vision , heart palpitations , memory loss , dizziness , muscle spasms , weight gain , seizures , rashes , blindness , tachycardia , tintinnitus , joint pain , nausea , depression , hearing loss , irritability , slurred speech , anxiety attacks , loss of taste , vertigo and insomnia .
Nutrasweet is in about 9,000 foods and on every restaurant table for the same reasons tobacco is everywhere : Greed , Addiction and Profit !
The NutraSweet Company and sister Searle , whose chemists discovered aspartame while testing an ulcer drug , are owned by Monsanto .
If you are taking other medicine , consider possible reactions you may have .
In 1969 , Searle approached Dr. Harry Waisman to study the effects of aspartame on primates .
Seven infant monkeys were fed the chemical in milk .
One died after 300 days ; five others had grand mal seizures .
Searle deleted these findings when they submitted this study to the FDA !
The best way to understand NutraSweet is to think of it as a minute dose of nerve gas that eradicates brain and nerve functions .
Some diseases triggered by aspartame include brain tumors and other cancers , Alzheimer ’s , multiple sclerosis , diabetes , epilepsy , mental retardation , fibromyalgia , lymphoma , Graves disease , birth defects , chronic fatigue syndrome , systemic lupus , Epstein Barr , Parkinson ’s and ... death !
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology surveyed 80 people who suffered brain seizures after eating or drinking products with aspartame .
Said the Community Nutrition Institute : " These 80 cases meet the FDA ’s own definition of an imminent hazard to the public health , which requires the FDA to expeditiously remove a product from the market . "
America is seeing a tremendous increase in seizures .
Phenylalanine in aspartame lowers the seizure threshold in the brain and blocks serotonin production .
Today our nation is swept by a rage of violence .
Researchers attribute this in part to low brain serotonin levels inducing depression , rage and paranoia .
So President Clinton , Diet Coke in hand , programs billions of dollars to buy penitentiaries for the paranoid .
Fetal tissue cannot tolerate methanol and Dr. James Bowen calls NutraSweet instant birth control .
The fetal placenta can concentrate phenylalanine and cause mental retardation .
Aspartame tests on animals produced brain and mammary tumors .
No wonder breast cancer is growing exponentially !
During Operation Desert Storm truckloads of diet drinks cooked in the Arabian sun and at 86 degrees aspartame liberates methanol in the can !
Thousands of service men and women returned home with chronic fatigue syndrome and weird toxic symptoms .

Lazy workmen dug a trench around a parked car after failing to track down its owner .
Contractors working for Thames Water placed warning notices on the windscreen of the silver Volkswagen in Leyton , east London , to alert the owner of the planned works .
Scroll down for more ...
But the owner has still failed to remove the car .
As a result , builders were forced to dig up the road around the car , before pushing the vehicle over the gap .
One of the great misconceptions people seem to have about banks is that the money you deposit is still “ your ” money .
No , that money is now the bank ’s asset , and the account holders are essentially creditors </ hand - waving > .
That provides flexibility , but it can also lead to massive problems when things go bad .
In the largest US bank failure in 14 years , internet banking pioneer NetBank filed for bankruptcy protection last Friday .
As a result , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC closed NetBank , and ING acquired NetBank ’s deposit accounts .
I am ( or at least was ) a NetBank account holder , but I had less than $ 100,000 deposited , so my full account value was insured .
Others wo n’t be so lucky .
The 1,500 people with more than $ 100,000 in their accounts will become creditors to the bank ’s receivership .
I have known about NetBank ’s souring finances for a while , yet I kept my NetBank account loaded with a non-trivial ( for me ) amount of cash .
Why ?
Did I feel invulnerable ?
Was it supreme faith in the FDIC ?
Maybe a little of both .
The actual failure has snapped me back to my senses , and even though I did n’t get burned this time , you can be sure that I will be more proactive the next time around .
When a top U.S. commander in Iraq reported last week that attacks by Shi’ite militias with links to Iran had risen to 73 percent of all July attacks that had killed or wounded U.S. forces in Baghdad , he claimed it was because of an effort by Iran to oust the United States from Iraq , referring to " intelligence reports " of a " surge " in Iranian assistance .
But the obvious reason for the rise in Shi’ite - related U.S. casualties  ignored in U.S. media coverage of Lt. Gen.
Raymond Odierno ’s charge  is that the Mahdi Army of Moqtada al - Sadr was defending itself against a rising tempo of attacks by U.S. forces at the same time attacks by al - Qaeda forces had fallen .
In his press briefing on Aug. 5 , Odierno , the second - ranking U.S. commander in Iraq , blamed the rise in the proportion of U.S. casualties attributable to Shi’ite militias to Iran " surging their support to these groups based on the September report "  a reference to the much - anticipated report by Gen. David Petraeus on the U.S. ’ own surge strategy .
Odierno claimed intelligence reports supported his contention of an Iranian effort to influence public perceptions of the surge strategy .
" They ’re sending more money in , they ’re training more individuals , and they ’re sending more weapons in . "
He repeated the charge in an interview with Michael R. Gordon of the New York Times published on its front page Aug. 8 under the headline , " U.S. Says Iran - Supplied Bomb Is Killing More Troops in Iraq . "
In that interview , he declared of Iran , " I think they want to influence the decision potentially coming up in September . "
What Odierno framed in terms of an Iranian policy , however , can be explained much more simply by the fact that the U.S. military mounted more operations on Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army during the spring and summer .
The U.S. command has not provided any statistics on the targets of its operations in recent months , but news reports on those operations reveal a pattern of rising U.S. attacks on Mahdi Army personnel since March 2007 .
Between April 26 and June 30 , the U.S. command in Baghdad announced dozens of military operations in Baghdad  the vast majority in Sadr City  solely for the purpose of capturing or killing Shi’ites belonging to what were called " secret cells , " a term used to describe Mahdi Army units alleged to be supported by Iran .
In July the Mahdi Army resisted these raids in many cases .
On July 9 , for example , U.S. troops cordoned off an area in Sadr City and began searching for members of what the U.S. command called a " criminal militia " accused of planting roadside bombs .
According to the official military press release , the U.S. troops were " engaged by rocket - propelled grenades and small arms fire from numerous locations . "
In short , the rise in deaths of U.S. troops in Baghdad in July reflected the increased pace of U.S. operations against the Mahdi Army and the Mahdi Army ’s military response .
Odierno conceded as much in the same press conference : " Because of the effect we ’ve had on al - Qaeda in Iraq and the success against them and the Sunni insurgency , " he said , " we are focusing very much more on the special groups of the Jaish al - Mahdi [ Mahdi Army ] here in Baghdad . "
The major briefing by the U.S. command on alleged Iranian support for Iraqi Shi’ite militias in recent weeks appears to contradict Odierno ’s claim that intelligence showed increased Iranian assistance to those militias .
Brig .
Gen. Kevin Bergner told reporters on Aug. 2  after a " surge " in Iranian assistance had allegedly taken place  that the rate of training of militia groups in Iran had remained stable for a long time .
The transcript of the briefing also shows that Bergner did not claim any recent increase in financial assistance to the Mahdi Army .
Odierno ’s reference to " sending more weapons in " continued the practice of the George W. Bush administration to claim that Iranian officials actually ship weapons to Shi’ite militias in Iraq , despite the fact that no evidence of such a role has been found after four years of trying .
Odierno told the New York Times that explosively formed penetrators ( EFPs ) accounted for one - third of combat deaths suffered by " U.S. - led forces "  including Iraqi and British forces  in July .
But he said nothing about the proportion of total U.S. troops killed or wounded by them .
The Bush administration continues to assert that EFPs are provided by the Iranian government , despite numerous discoveries by U.S. forces of workshops manufacturing such devices in Iraq .
Odierno ’s charges are the latest addition to an ongoing Bush administration narrative about developments in Iraq that treats all Shi’ite activity outside the Iraqi government as reflecting Iranian policy .
Its central theme of an Iranian policy to drive the U.S. out of Iraq by killing U.S. troops , first introduced in January , has branched out into several sub - themes , one of which is that Sadr has lost control over the Mahdi Army .
The U.S. command has been claiming it has broken up into " rogue units "  also called " special groups " or " secret cells . "
Those " rogue units " in turn are said to have become instruments of Iranian policy .
Although the Mahdi Army operates on a highly decentralized basis , and some units have been involved in sectarian activities that Sadr did not approve , the U.S. military has never produced evidence that a significant number of units are no longer loyal to Sadr .
The " rogue units " line has been used to suggest that those units that were loyal to Sadr were cooperating with the United States and to justify U.S. attacks on the Mahdi Army both in Baghdad and in southern Iraq .
Gen .
Petraeus claimed publicly that Sadr had agreed in talks with Iraq ’s Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki to the deployment of U.S. troops to Baghdad ’s Sadr City district in return for assurances that searches and raids would be conducted in a " respectable manner . "
Sadr ’s spokesman in parliament said , however , that the understanding had been that Iraqi forces would conduct searches and that U.S. troops would intervene only if they faced resistance .
The spokesman said U.S. troops had violated the understanding .
At first , Sadr ’s troops stayed off the streets and did not resist U.S. troops .
But in March Sadr ’s office denounced the U.S. troop deployment in Sadr City and called on people to take to the streets in protest .
And a Shi’ite cleric loyal to Sadr exhorted followers at Friday prayers not to cooperate with the U.S. occupation of Sadr City .
On April 8 , Sadr issued a statement urged the Iraqi army and police to stop cooperating with the United States and told his guerrilla fighters to concentrate on pushing U.S. forces out of the country .
Thus it requires no Iranian hand to explain the escalation of the conflict between the Mahdi Army and the U.S. military that accounts for the changing pattern of U.S. casualties in Baghdad .

British troops feel ' devalued , angry ' and are ' suffering from Iraq fatigue ' , according to the head of the army , who warns that Britain 's military covenant is under strain .
In a stark assessment of the morale of British troops , General Sir Richard Dannatt warns that the pressures of waging two simultaneous campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan are ' mortgaging the goodwill of our people ' .
Dannatt 's comments are made in his Staff Briefing Team Report for 2007 , leaked to the Sunday Telegraph , in which he warns that the ' military covenant is clearly out of kilter ' .
The chief of the general staff writes : ' We must strive to give individuals and units ample recuperation time between operations , but I do not underestimate how difficult this will be to achieve whilst undermanned and with less robust establishments than I would like . '
Referring to overstretch , the report warns : ' The tank of goodwill now runs on vapour ; many experienced staff are talking of leaving ' .
Dannatt 's remarks will make uncomfortable reading for a succession of defence secretaries who are held responsible for failing to secure good financial settlements for the armed forces .
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the report , which airs the grievances of soldiers , is designed to provide feedback for the military top brass .
Farrar has a series of amendments to take money from the Governor ’s Office and redistribute it .
Under the Calendar Committee rules , you cannot shift funds from one article to another , which her first proposed amendment appears to do .
She mandates that out of the funds appropriated for Non-Medical Services , $ 3.8 M in each year of the biennium must be used for home - delivered meals to the elderly .
Guillen proposes that Department of State Health Services take an appropriate amount from the Medically Dependent Children ’s Program to conduct a study for establishing a pilot program for adults with autism .
Farrar proposes to strike $ 2.5 M for “ Alternatives to Abortion ” and redirect that amount to “ Early Childhood Intervention Services . ”
Thompson would likewise strike all funding for “ Alternatives to Abortion ” and redirect it to the Autism Program .
Another amendment ( author illegible ) would shift the Alternatives to Abortion Funds and increase the funding for Child Abuse Prevention Grants .
Farrar has a similar amendment .
Isett proposes to shift $ 6.5 M in federal funds for family planning services in each year of the biennium and increase MH and MR investigations for the Department of Family and Protective Services by that amount .
Farrar would shift $ 5 M in each year of the biennium from the Texas Residential Construction Commission ( Article VIII ) to the Department of State Health Services for testing for HIV and STD .
As I mentioned before , there may be a rule that prohibits shifting funds between articles .
I ’m going to shut this down for now and get to the Capitol .
More later .

On a recent interview , Richard ’s candidate managed to score zero - for - three .
Despite having recently graduated with a computer science degree , the student had a tough time solving the easiest of easy computer - science riddles : the Factorial .
Their conversation went something like this ...
Richard : Could you write a quick function that will find the factorial of any given number using recursion ?
Graduate : I do n't know what recursion is .
Richard : Ummmm .... then can you solve it iteratively ?
Graduate : Iteratively ?
Richard :
You know , like with a for - loop .
Graduate : Oh , OK , I think I can manage .
Richard let the student go off and solve the factorial problem .
Fifteen minutes later , he turned in the following :
public int factorial ( int n ) { int a = 0 ; for ( int i = 1 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) { i = i * ( i + 1 ) ; a = i ; } return a ; }
Did Medal of Freedom buy Tenet 's silence ?
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This Revealing that former CIA director George Tenet gave up $ 2 million in delaying publication of his memoir , an essay in The New Republic speculates President Bush or his father -- or someone close to them -- convinced Tenet to delay and write a book uncritical of the president .
Tenet began preparing an auction of his memoirs almost immediately after his 2004 resignation , garnering a winning bid of more than $ 4 million from Random House 's Crown Publishing Group , reports Patrick Tyler in TNR .
Tenet suddenly got cold feet when it came time to put ink to paper on the deal , and he ended up delaying a book contract for the next 18 months .
When it finally came time to ink a deal , the value of Tenet 's memoir was cut in half , and he settled for around $ 2 million from HarperCollins , Tyler reports , based on a source in the publishing industry .
" Which raises a question :
Why did a man who seemed so bent on cashing in put off writing his memoir -- at a loss of some $ 2 million ? "
Tyler asks .
" There can be no doubt that , while the delay was costly to Tenet , it was valuable to the White House , " Tyler writes .
" The net effect was to push the book 's publication date beyond the 2006 elections . "
At the time he was hemming and hawing over the book deal , Tenet received the Presidential Medal of Freedom , Tyler notes , but Tenet insists that 's simply a coincidence .
Tenet was n't " clear on what conversations he'd had with members of the Bush family during the 18 - month interval between actions , " the article notes .
Former Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar also hyped speculation of a Bush intervention in the publication delay .
" I knew President Bush called him , " Bandar , a close friend of Tenet , told Tyler .
" The question is : Was it 41 or 43 ? "
The article speculates President George H.W. Bush was more likely to have intervened , although both he and Tenet expressly deny such a meeting took place .
EXCERPTS FROM THE NEW REPUBLIC : # When I asked Tenet whether he had received a call from President Bush - - either one -- to express concerns about the book , he became quite agitated and said everything I had heard in that regard was a " complete fabrication . "
I was almost startled when he said , " I swear on my father 's grave " that no such counsel from the former or current president had been forthcoming .
A week or so later , when I asked him to put in writing what he wanted to reiterate about the matter , Tenet said this : " Neither President GHW Bush nor President GW Bush - - nor anyone acting on their behalf - - influenced me or sought to influence me .
No one . "
For his part , Bush Senior sent me the following statement : " It is absolutely not true .
I never discussed with George Tenet when or if he should write a book .
There is not even a semblance of truth to this . "
Whether or not Bandar 's theory is true , the Bush camp was clearly paying close attention to the book .
It was n't just the CIA that vetted Tenet 's memoir ; the White House press office did as well .
What 's more , according to a foreign diplomat who visited the Oval Office earlier this year , President Bush seemed well - briefed on the revelations in Tenet 's manuscript .
The visitor , whom I have known for years , asked the president about Tenet 's book in passing .
Bush replied that he understood the book would soon be cleared and that it contained no criticism of the president but had some tough words about " others " in the administration .
( The White House did not respond to a request for comment . )
In the end , the Bushies got just about everything they wanted out of what could have been a dicey situation .
For one thing , the book was n't nearly as nasty toward Bush as it might have been , especially given the depth of Tenet 's private disdain for Bush 's handling of the Iraq war and the Israeli - Palestinian dispute .
For another , the White House , armed with foreknowledge of the memoir 's contents , was able to put Tenet on the defensive from the moment the book appeared -- unlike when Richard Clarke 's book came out and the administration seemed caught off guard .

There are a lot of bad things said about Wikipedia , the ninth most - visited destination on the internet .
An encyclopedia that anyone can edit , critics argue , is one that is vulnerable to endless mistakes .
Such criticisms have been raised by skeptics since Wikipedia 's creation in 2001 .
Despite the critics , Wikipedia has grown to include 8.2 million articles in 253 different languages .
The English Wikipedia alone includes nearly two million articles , and has a word - length fifteen times that of the Encyclopedia Britannica .
Wikipedia is the single largest encyclopedia ever assembled , having long since surpassed the Yongle Encyclopedia of 15th century China .
The man credited with founding Wikipedia , Jimmy Wales — known to Wikipedians as " Jimbo " — was a finance major at Auburn University when the Mises Institute 's Mark Thornton suggested he read " The Use of Knowledge in Society , " a now - famous essay written by Austro - libertarian economist and Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek .
The essay argues that prices in the market represent a spontaneous order that results from the interaction of individuals with diverse wants , allowing them to cooperate to achieve complex goals .
According to a June 2007 Reason magazine interview , this insight of Hayek 's is what led Wales to found Wikipedia .
The rather lofty vision that inspired Wales ?
" Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .
That 's what we 're doing . "
While that ultimate goal imagined by Wales for Wikipedia has not yet come to fruition , there is no questioning the breadth and usefulness of Wikipedia .
Those who refused to believe that a user - generated encyclopedia could compete with the monolithic , traditional encyclopedia written by experts and organized by professional editors , were no doubt shocked when Nature magazine published a 2006 article comparing Wikipedia to the well - known Encyclopedia Britannica .
The article concluded that Wikipedia articles were comparable in accuracy and thoroughness to those of the older , paper encyclopedia .
According to a 2007 study by the Pew Research Center , Wikipedia is by far the most popular educational and reference destination on the web , with nearly a quarter of the total traffic to such sites going to the free encyclopedia .
According to the study , " Wikipedia has become the No. 1 external site visited after Google 's search page , receiving over half of its traffic from the search engine . "
All that traffic does not include sites that syndicate Wikipedia content , such as Ask.com .
Such syndication is free thanks to the special license agreement to which all contributors consent when adding content to the encyclopedia .
The GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) allows for royalty - free reproduction — in original or modified form — even in for - profit projects .
While some images in the project are utilized under " fair - use " doctrine , the vast majority of images and text are either subject only to the GFDL or are in the public domain .
But how does such a polycentric — even anarchic — system , composed of editors acting independently and for their own reasons , result in such an utterly useful resource ?
The answer goes back to the Hayekian inspiration for the project .
Because editors receive both psychological satisfaction and material usefulness from their contributions , the project has grown to include safeguards that help guarantee that the development of the project will move in a positive direction — towards broad , accurate articles that depend on reliable , verifiable sources .
One could very aptly describe the Wikipedia system for directing the development of the project as being a common law system of sorts .
The encyclopedia has basic policies — the constitutional law of Wikipedia — which require that articles be written from a neutral point of view , make use of verifiable sources , and include no original research .
Less concrete are " guidelines , " which are rules based on commonly followed interpretations of policies — very similar to judicial precedents — that help users to contribute in a manner that upholds the policies .
Guidelines are generally followed because they have been accepted by the community as the means by which to avoid editing disputes and thus direct more energy to productive ends .
Below guidelines are " essays " — arguably the dicta of Wikipedian law — which may be seen as the musings of individual users regarding certain conflicts or inefficiencies in the system .
Whenever a content dispute does arise between editors on the " talk " pages that accompany each article , there are a host of dispute resolution options available .
The community has created the " Third Opinion " board , where editors at loggerheads can request an outside perspective on a disagreement .
There is also the " Request for Comment " process , where one editor may request formal oversight by the community at large , and particularly by veteran editors whose informed opinions usually carry more weight than those of new users .
There are also the Mediation and Arbitration Committees , which are for solving more complex , ongoing disputes , and who actually refer to past precedents in making judgments .
Wikipedia 's reflection of market dynamics is most easily observed in what many people view as the project 's weakest areas : obscure articles that draw little traffic .
In articles about third - rate garage bands and other topics of limited interest , one will often find factual and typographical errors at a much higher rate than in high - traffic articles such as those on " England " or " Barry Bonds . "
The much higher demand for information about the latter topics means that many more eyes will be combing those much - demanded articles for mistakes .
Since Wikipedia is open to correction by anyone , it stands to reason that the articles attracting more potential editors will be of a higher quality .
Rather than a failure , this is a great demonstration of Wikipedia 's efficient allocation of resources .
The project , like any other , has a finite amount of productivity to apply to its various activities .
It is a positive thing that those articles in greatest demand — those about topics of popular curiosity — would be the ones that are the most complete and reliable .
The entire system , which is fabulously complex and robust to the contributing editor , is remarkably simple for the basic user , who only wants to find data on an unfamiliar topic .
So long as one exercises discretion in accepting information from Wikipedia , and so long as one 's research extends beyond the Wikipedia article to the sources it cites , Wikipedia is an exceptional resource that is unique to our generation .
Bills he is claimed to have run up on an array of luxury amusements include two top - of - the - range Chevrolet 4x4s , a thermal night vision kit for his Hummer H2 , dozens of designer watches and jewels , a selection of handguns and two Arab karaoke machines .
One takeaway meal came to almost $ 800 ( £ 391 ) .
And then there is the $ 2,500 item on a trip to a hotel in Casablanca that reads : " Girls : party night 5 " .
These , and scores of others , are detailed in documents filed to the high court in a claim against the ambassador , Prince Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz , a nephew of King Abdullah .
Last month , he was ordered to pay more than £ 3 m to his family 's former private secretary , Walid El Hage , a Briton of Lebanese extraction and a former director of an Arab bookshop in the UK , who spent many years as confidante to the ambassador and his father .
He claims he spent the money on their behalf .
The 54 - year - old ambassador ignored the court proceedings , and had judgment awarded against him by default .
But he now says he is hoping for an " amicable settlement " .
A meeting with the El Hage camp has been arranged for next week and the prince says he is seeking to have the court judgment set aside .
El Hage 's lawyer , Ian Bloom , says his client , who is abroad , declines to comment .
But those close to him say he believes the ambassador 's diplomatic immunity is uncertain , because the alleged debts were incurred before he took office .
In a normal case , a debtor 's property could be seized .
But under the Vienna convention , other diplomats and their London families currently get away with activities from shoplifting to refusing to pay the congestion charge .
According to the documents filed by El Hage , he picked up bills as the prince went on trips to Rome , Vienna , Casablanca and Paris in 2004 and 2005 , immediately before his posting to London .
As well as conventional , if large , bills for hotels , cars and security guards , the lists include charges for a variety of the world 's most sophisticated brand - name items .
There is a list of 43 luxury watches allegedly bought in just 18 months at a total cost of at least £ 350,000 .
They included a Patek Philippe for £ 23,000 and two Jaeger Le Coultres for £ 17,500 and £ 16,700 .
In January 2004 , it is alleged , the prince left Riyadh for a European trip .
He bought cutlery from specialist Paris shops Curty & Fils and Laguiole for € 22 , 990 ( £ 16,439 ) .
His family also allegedly invested in the must - have female fashion item - a crocodile Birkin bag listed at € 18,770 .
Outfits from the couturiers Lanvin allegedly cost a further € 150,000 .
A Beretta pistol ( €6,761 ) also figures on the list , along with a Cartier watch ( €27,000 ) and antique guns , shotgun , and swords ( €66,000 ) .
Back in Saudi , it is claimed the prince spent £ 1,200 on three ivory tusks with amber and turquoise , and a red and gold crystal set for £ 9,000 .
A fleet of Yamaha Grizzly , and Big Bear quad bikes set him back £ 13,000 .
But this was a small sum compared with the $ 183,000 which went on purchase and freight charges from the US for five highly sophisticated Raytheon thermal night vision cameras , to be fitted on his H2 Humvee US - army derivative vehicle .
A large US pick - up , a Chevrolet Avalanche , is listed as " full options $ 39,250 " .
A specialist off - road rally car , the Wildcat African Raid , built by a UK firm in Derbyshire , on a Land - Rover chassis is listed as £ 94,000 .
In March , the prince went on a further trip to Austria and on to Casablanca .
There was an alleged visit to the famous Swarovski shop on Vienna 's Kartnerstrasse of which it is said " almost any self - respecting Viennese lady has a Swarovski necklace , bracelet , or pair of earrings " .
The total bill was said to be $ 25,000 .
In Morocco , items read : " hotel extra suite expenses , rooms for girls etc $ 1,465 ... girls party night 5 $ 2,500 ...
Moroccan sweets arrangement to take away $ 250 ... HRH cash in hand $ 20,000 " .
One striking purchase listed is an " ST Dupont lighter limited edition " for $ 1,769 , which carries a mother - of - pearl and platinum rendering of the design of the Taj Mahal .
Back in Jeddah , the prince is said to have bought many Persian rugs , more vehicles and watches and gifts of amber .
As well as some low - calorie sweets , he also allegedly splashed out on the import of a suite of exotic pets , ( with cages ) including parrots , mynah birds and a Dr No-style white Persian chinchilla cat .
A large selection of guns also figure on the alleged invoices
These include two Czech CZ75D and CZ97B pistols , a French Famas assault rifle and a Micro - Uzi machine gun of Israeli origin .
The Austrian Glock 18C " special tactical weapon " is described in one advertisement as " particularly popular with VIP security personnel .
Nothing stops an assassination attempt faster than a hail of 9 mm bullets " .
According to the court claims , the ambassador 's luggage of choice is Delsey and Zero Halliburton aluminium suitcases , whilst in cigars , his preferences run to the latest offering from Cuba - the Cohiba Siglo VI " Canonazo " brand .
His alternative choice is alleged to be the Lusitanias Double Corona , described as " a truly great cigar " with " cedar wood , leather and cinnamon " .
The PR grandee Lord Bell last night issued a statement on the ambassador 's behalf .
It said that El Hage had worked for the prince 's father for 27 years until he suffered a stroke in 2002 .
" The nature of the relationship subsequently changed . "
Lawyers in Saudi Arabia were handling the claim , and had asked for receipts " in order to consider the expenses claimed and as appropriate to seek to reach an amicable settlement " .

In 1858 , Robert Fallon was shot dead , an act of vengeance by those with whom he was playing poker .
Fallon , they claimed , had won the $ 600 pot through cheating .
With Fallon ’s seat empty and none of the other players willing to take the now - unlucky $ 600 , they found a new player to take Fallon ’s place and staked him with the dead man ’s $ 600 .
By the time the police had arrived to investigate the killing , the new player had turned the $ 600 into $ 2,200 in winnings .
The police demanded the original $ 600 to pass on to Fallon ’s next of kin – only to discover that the new player turned out to be Fallon ’s son , who had not seen his father in seven years !
13 . Twin Deaths
On 2002 , Seventy - year - old twin brothers have died within hours of one another after separate accidents on the same road in northern Finland .
The first of the twins died when he was hit by a lorry while riding his bike in Raahe , 600 kilometres north of the capital , Helsinki .
He died just 1.5 km from the spot where his brother was killed .
“ This is simply a historic coincidence .
Although the road is a busy one , accidents do n’t occur every day , ” police officer Marja - Leena Huhtala told Reuters .
“ It made my hair stand on end when I heard the two were brothers , and identical twins at that .
It came to mind that perhaps someone from upstairs had a say in this , ” she said .
12 . Poe Coincidence
In the 19th century , the famous horror writer , Egdar Allan Poe , wrote a book called ‘ The narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym ’ .
It was about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker .
Some years later , in 1884 , the yawl , Mignonette , foundered , with only four survivors , who were in an open boat for many days .
Eventully the three senior members of the crew , killed and ate the cabin boy .
The name of the cabin boy was Richard Parker .
11 . Royal Coincidence
In Monza , Italy , King Umberto I , went to a small restaurant for dinner , accompanied by his aide - de- camp , General Emilio Ponzia - Vaglia .
When the owner took King Umberto ’s order , the King noticed that he and the restaurant owner were virtual doubles , in face and in build .
Both men began discussing the striking resemblances between each other and found many more similarities .
1 . Both men were born on the same day , of the same year , ( March 14th , 1844 ) .
2 . Both men had been born in the same town .
3 . Both men married a woman with same name , Margherita .
4 . The restauranteur opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto was crowned King of Italy .
5 . On the 29th July 1900 , King Umberto was informed that the restauranteur had died that day in a mysterious shooting accident , and as he expressed his regret , he was then assassinated by an anarchist in the crowd .
10 . Falling Baby
In 1930s Detroit , a man named Joseph Figlock was to become an amazing figure in a young ( and , apparently , incredibly careless ) mother ’s life .
As Figlock was walking down the street , the mother ’s baby fell from a high window onto Figlock .
The baby ’s fall was broken and Figlock and the baby were unharmed .
A year later , the selfsame baby fell from the selfsame window , again falling onto Mr. Figlock as he was passing beneath .
Once again , both of them survived the event .
9. Mystery Monk
In 19th century Austria , a near - famous painter named Joseph Aigner attempted suicide on several occasions .
During his first attempt to hang himself at the age of 18 , Aigner was interrupted by a mysterious Capuchin monk .
And again at age 22 , he was prevented from hanging himself by the very same monk .
Eight years later , he was sentenced to the gallows for his political activities .
But again , his life was saved by the intervention of the same monk .
At age 68 , Joseph Aigner finally succeeded in suicide , using a pistol to shoot himself .
Not surprisingly , his funeral ceremony was conducted by the very same Capuchin monk – a man whose name Aiger never even knew .
8. Photographic Coincidence
A German mother who photographed her infant son in 1914 left the film to be developed at a store in Strasbourg .
In those days some film plates were sold individually .
World War I broke out and unable to return to Strasbourg , the woman gave up the picture for lost .
Two years later she bought a film plate in Frankfurt , over 100 miles away , to take a picture of her newborn daughter .
When developed the film turned out to be a double exposure , with the picture of her daughter superimposed on the earlier picture of her son .
Through some incredible twist of fate , her original film , never developed , had been mislabeled as unused , and had eventually been resold to her .
7. Book Find
In 1973 , actor Anthony Hopkins agreed to appear in “ The Girl From Petrovka ” , based on a novel by George Feifer .
Unable to find a copy of the book anywhere in London , Hopkins was surprised to discover one lying on a bench in a train station .
It turned out to be George Feifer ’s own annotated ( personal ) copy , which Feifer had lent to a friend , and which had been stolen from his friend ’s car .
6 . Twins

Both had sons , one of whom was named James Alan and the other named James Allan .
The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women – both named Betty .
And they both owned dogs which they named Toy .
5. Revenge Killing
In 1883 , Henry Ziegland broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who , out of distress , committed suicide .
The girl ’s enraged brother hunted down Ziegland and shot him .
Believing he had killed Ziegland , the brother then took his own life .
In fact , however , Ziegland had not been killed .
The bullet had only grazed his face , lodging into a tree .
It was a narrow escape .
Years later , Ziegland decided to cut down the same tree , which still had the bullet in it .
The huge tree seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with dynamite .
The explosion propelled the bullet into Ziegland ’s head , killing him .
4. Golden Scarab
From The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche : “ A young woman I was treating had , at a critical moment , a dream in which she was given a golden scarab .
While she was telling me this dream I sat with my back to the closed window .
Suddenly I heard a noise behind me , like a gentle tapping .
I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the window - pane from outside .
I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in .
It was the nearest analogy to the golden scarab that one finds in our latitudes , a scarabaeid beetle , the common rose - chafer ( Cetonia aurata ) which contrary to its usual habits had evidently felt an urge to get into a dark room at this particular moment .
I must admit that nothing like it ever happened to me before or since , and that the dream of the patient has remained unique in my experience . ”
– Carl Jung
3. Taxi
In 1975 , while riding a moped in Bermuda , a man was accidentally struck and killed by a taxi .

In fact , he was riding the very same moped .
And to stretch the odds even further , he was struck by the very same taxi driven by the same driver – and even carrying the very same passenger !
2. Hotel Discovery
In 1953 , television reporter Irv Kupcinet was in London to cover the coronation of Ellizabeth II .
In one of the drawers in his room at the Savoy he found found some items that , by their identification , belonged to a man named Harry Hannin .
Coincidentally , Harry Hannin – a basketball star with the famed Harlem Globetrotters – was a good friend of Kupcinet ’s .
But the story has yet another twist .
Just two days later , and before he could tell Hannin of his lucky discovery , Kupcinet received a letter from Hannin .
In the letter , Hannin told Kucinet that while staying at the Hotel Meurice in Paris , he found in a drawer a tie – with Kupcinet ’s name on it .
1. Historical Coincidence
The lives of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , two of America ’s founders .
Jefferson crafted the Declaration of Independence , showing drafts of it to Adams , who ( with Benjamin Franklin ) helped to edit and hone it .
The document was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 .
Surprisingly , both Jefferson and Adams died on the same day , July 4 , 1826 – exactly 50 years from the signing of the Declaration of Independence .

Congressman Kucinich writes letter to Judiciary Committee head supporting impeachment of Vice President Cheney
On Friday , as the embattled legislation is pushed into committee , Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) wrote to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - MI ) in support of H. Res 799 , Articles of Impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Text of the letter appears below .
#
November 9 , 2007
The Honorable John Conyers , Jr. Chairman Committee on the Judiciary 2138 Rayburn HOB Washington , DC 20515
Dear Chairman Conyers
I am writing in support of H. Res. 799 , the Articles of Impeachment which were referred to the committee relative to the Impeachment of the Vice President of the United States of America .
Recent reports indicate that the Vice President is attempting to shape the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran to conform to his misperceptions about the threat Iran actually poses .
Much like his deceptive efforts in the lead up to the Iraq war , the Vice President appears to be manipulating intelligence to conform to his beliefs .
If the reports are true , they add additional weight to the case for impeachment .
I believe impeachment remains the only tool Congress has to prevent a war in Iran .
This information relates directly to the Article III charges in the resolution .
I urge your timely consideration .
Sincerely ,
/s/
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congress
The key piece of material evidence used by prosecutors to implicate Libya in the Lockerbie bombing has emerged as a probable fake .
Nearly two decades after Pan Am flight 103 exploded over Scotland on 21 December , 1988 , allegations of international political intrigue and shoddy investigative work are being levelled at the British government , the FBI and the Scottish police as one of the crucial witnesses , Swiss engineer Ulrich Lumpert , has apparently confessed that he lied about the origins of a crucial ' timer ' - evidence that helped tie the man convicted of the bombing to the crime .
The disaster killed 270 people when the London to New York Boeing 747 exploded in mid-air .
Britain and the US blamed Libya , saying that its leader , Colonel Muammar Gadaffi , wanted revenge for the US bombing of Tripoli in 1986 .
At a trial in the Netherlands in 2001 , former Libyan agent Abdulbaset al - Megrahi was jailed for life .
He is currently serving his sentence in Greenock prison , but later this month the Scottish Court of Appeal is expected to hear Megrahi 's case , after the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ruled in June that there was enough evidence to suggest a miscarriage of justice .
Lumpert 's confession , which was given to police in his home city of Zurich last week , will strengthen Megrahi 's appeal .
The Zurich - based Swiss businessman Edwin Bollier , who has spent nearly two decades trying to clear his company 's name , is as eager for the appeal as is Megrahi .
Bollier 's now bankrupt company , Mebo , manufactured the timer switch that prosecutors used to implicate Libya after they said that fragments of it had been found on a Scottish hillside .
Bollier , now 70 , admits having done business with Libya .
' Two years before Lockerbie , we sold 20 MST - 13 timers to the Libyan military .
FBI agents and the Scottish investigators said one of those timers had been used to detonate the bomb .
We were shown a fuzzy photograph and I confirmed the fragments looked as though they came from one of our timers . '
However , Bollier was uneasy with the photograph he had been shown and asked to see the fragments .
He was finally given permission in 1998 and travelled to Dumfries to see the evidence .
' I was shown fragments of a brown circuit board which matched our prototype .
But when the MST - 13 went into production , the timers contained green boards .
I knew that the timers sold to Libya had green boards .
I told the investigators this .'
Back in Switzerland , Bollier 's company was in effect bankrupt , having faced a lawsuit from Pan Am and having lost major clients , such as the German federal police to which Mebo supplied communications equipment .
In 2001 , Bollier spent five days in the witness box at the Lockerbie trial at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands .
' I was a defence witness , but the trial was so skewed to prove Libyan involvement that the details of what I had to say was ignored .
A photograph of the fragments was produced in court and I asked to see the pieces again .
When they were brought to me , they were practically carbonised .
They had been tampered with since I had seen them in Dumfries . '
Few people apart from conspiracy theorists and investigative journalists working on the case were prepared to believe Bollier until the end of last month , when Lumpert , one of his former employees , walked into a Zurich police station and asked to swear an affidavit before a notary .
Media Defender , a notorious anti piracy gang working for the MPAA , RIAA and several independent media production companies , just launched their very own video upload service called " miivi.com " .
The sole purpose of the site is to trap people into uploading copyrighted material , and bust them for doing so .
Media Defender is known for their shady tactics .
Besides launching video upload services , they also trap people into downloading fake torrents so they can collect IP addresses , and send copyright infringement letters to ISPs .
Fortunately , most of the IPs of these fake BitTorrent trackers are already blocked by blocklist software like PeerGuardian .
However , they still manage to collect the IP addresses of thousands of users who do fall for this trap .
And Now they try to do the same with their “ fake ” video download service .
They have registered a new domain and launched a video upload / download site with a web 2.0 - ish name : miivi.com .
Miivi claims to offer hight speed downloads of blockbuster movies like “ 300 ” ( do n’t download ) , hereby luring people into downloading copyrighted content .
Apparently the cease and desist letters they send to P2P users and video sharing sites like YouTube and other are not enough .
At the bottom of this article is a screenshot of the WHOIS info , it speaks for itself .
No matter how wrong ‘ piracy ’ might seem to some people , this is NOT the way to fight it .
My suggestion is : upload and download as much legal content as you can , titled “ THIS SITE IS A SCAM “ , let ’s see if their servers can handle the stress .
Update : Miivi is down now , seems like the plan worked ….
Update : they changed their WHOIS info .
Engineers last week finished work on one of the world 's most ambitious conservation projects : a doomsday vault carved into a frozen mountainside in the archipelago of Svalbard , a few hundred miles from the North Pole .
Over the next few weeks , the huge cavern - backed by the Norwegian government and the Gates Foundation - will be filled with more than a million types of seed and will be officially opened in February next year .
' This will be the last refuge for the world 's crops , ' said Cary Fowler , of the Rome - based Global Crop Diversity Trust , which is building the vault .
' There are seed banks in various countries round the globe , but several have been destroyed or badly damaged in recent years .
We need a place that is politically and environmentally safe if we are going to feed the planet as it gets hotter . '
New varieties of the world 's main plant foodstuffs - maize , barley , rice , wheat and other crops - are constantly being created by plant breeders as pests develop new ways to break down a strain 's natural resistance and as local climates change .
' The bread you eat today is made from very different wheat strains from the bread you had 10 years ago , ' said Fowler .
The old strains - which can date back hundreds of years - are a crucial resource , nevertheless .
Their seeds may prove invaluable as environments alter .
Varieties discarded for more bountiful but less hardy types could regain their usefulness .
By 2030 , for instance , current strains of maize will no longer be able to grow in South Africa because of rising temperatures .
Possessing old types of maize seed as a basic resource could be invaluable , say scientists .
National seed banks were meant to be the key defence but some have suffered serious damage , like those in Iraq and Afghanistan , which were destroyed by looters .
' The raiders were only after the glass jars in which the seeds were stored , ' said Fowler .
' They destroyed an incredibly valuable resource .
These countries were the birthplaces of agriculture . '
Typhoons caused major damage to a seed bank in the Philippines .
The only answer , Fowler 's trust decided , was to build an international doomsday vault , so the trust looked around for a site that was remote but accessible , and which was so cold that there would be no problem if the refrigeration equipment failed .
Svalbard , a group of islands far to the north of Norway but linked by a daily flight from Oslo , proved ideal .
For the past year engineers using highway tunnelling equipment have drilled deep into a mountain near Longyearbyen , the main settlement of Svalbard , and have created three main vaults .
Temperatures inside fluctuate around minus 4 degrees Celsius : not quite cold enough , say seed experts .
As a result , engineers are scheduled over the next few weeks to use refrigerating equipment to cool the vault to around minus 18 degrees .
Then it will be ready for its seeds , say scientists .
About 500 seeds from about 1.5 million types of crop - donated by individual countries - will be placed in envelopes and about 400 - 500 of these envelopes are stored in a single box .
Boxes will then be stacked like library books along shelves inside the vaults .
' National seed banks will still be the first line of defence for countries who need to develop fresh varieties of crops as environments change , ' said Fowler .
' But if something goes wrong there , they will be able to come here , take a hundred seeds or so , and use these to grow new strains .
This will be the last place we can turn to .'
This is an armored military vehicle manufactured by Zil russian factory – year is 1970 .
Who else but the Russians could ever dream up a corkscrew drive system ?
The major downside on this thing is that the suspension is missing .
It might be possible to mitigate that to some extent .
However the screw is still rigid whereas a track can change its shape follow the terrain .
That means you can use it screw propulsion for e.g.
a reconnaissance vehicle in very adverse terrain but not for a battle tank , APC or medivac vehicle .
Directional stability may not be the best , it should be possible to use a regular mechanical instead of a series hybrid transmission .
So the upsides are lower system complexity , better fuel economy and , lower drivetrain & fuel weight .
These are Russian screw vehicles , which seems to be an area in which they did some development .
I figure the plan was to make their enemy either scared shitless or paralyzed by awe of Russian mechanized genius / madness .
Or both .
I found out that the original screw propulsion vehicle was designed in 1944 , during WWII , by Johannes Raedel , a member of the German Army and veteran of the Eastern Front with Russia .
( Note : Raedel was originally spelled R’a ’del , with an umlaut ) .
He had observed that in the deep snows of Russia , tanks would dig out the snow under the tracks , and the tank would become high centered on snow pressed under the belly of the tank .
According to Siegfried Raedel , son of Johannes ..
” The idea evolved while looking at a meat mincer , also employing a screw type of compression .
He convinced army headquarters in Berlin to allow him to make a prototype of this machine .
At that time , Austria was annexed to Germany already and he was dispatched to the Austrian Alpine vehicle test centre at St. Johann in Tyrol .
Using whatever materials were available he built this prototype during the period of 10th Feb 1944 to 28th April 1944 .
It was tested extensively and the first page of this report is attached , together with a few pictures of the original .
It was very slow , but it would pull 1 ton !
It also had good climbing capabilities .
It would penetrate about 30 cm into the snow , no more . ”
The photos below are of Johannes testing the vehicle in Tyrol .
The woman and children were at a lodge at the top of a mountain , which the vehicle had climbed during testing .
Siegfried pointed out that “ something in the order of 7 tons of patent papers were taken out of Germany after the war .
What amazes me though is the fact that both the US and Russia seem to have had access to these papers – and this during the cold war period !
I also found that americans developed their own screw vehicle :
Chrysler Marsh Screw Amphibian ( 1964 )
Same principle as the DAF screw vehicle , this one can do 14 mph in the mud 8 mph in water and in the snow up to 20 mph .
The power came from a Chrysler 225 cubic inch , 140 hp , 6 cylinder gasoline engine .
An automatic gearbox was used to make the screws turn .
On hard pavement the only way to operate was to roll side ways but not at the same speed as the DAF
I can’t imagine what all those vehicles would do to a road …
Update :
This toy was build with the same tehnology , with Archimede ’s screw propulsion , a very unique control system and the ability to drive on both land and water .

Correction Appended
The passionate , sometimes rhythmic , language - like patter that pours forth from religious people who “ speak in tongues ” reflects a state of mental possession , many of them say .
Now they have some neuroscience to back them up .
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania took brain images of five women while they spoke in tongues and found that their frontal lobes — the thinking , willful part of the brain through which people control what they do — were relatively quiet , as were the language centers .
The regions involved in maintaining self - consciousness were active .
The women were not in blind trances , and it was unclear which region was driving the behavior .
The images , appearing in the current issue of the journal Psychiatry Research : Neuroimaging , pinpoint the most active areas of the brain .
The images are the first of their kind taken during this spoken religious practice , which has roots in the Old and New Testaments and in Pentecostal churches established in the early 1900s .
The women in the study were healthy , active churchgoers .
“ The amazing thing was how the images supported people ’s interpretation of what was happening , ” said Dr. Andrew B. Newberg , leader of the study team , which included Donna Morgan , Nancy Wintering and Mark Waldman .
“ The way they describe it , and what they believe , is that God is talking through them , ” he said .

times would fill one volume of a history book , at least .
Â
Those of us who attempt to keep abreast of the news are hard put to ferret out the important stuff from the fluff and connect the facts to one another in some kind of a dot pattern that yields a coherent picture .
Â
But , I will try . Â
Rupert Murdoch has succeeded in gobbling up The Wall Street Journal .Â
One more formerly objective , respectable publication to be reformated ala the New York Post . Â
The Supreme Court has handed down yet another corporate friendly , individual rights unfriendly decision that rewards Goodyear Tire Company for discrimination based on gender .
Â
And to heap insult upon injury , Goodyear has decided to sue the woman they underpaid for years , to cover their court costs .
Â
On top of that , congress has to prove that passing a Ledbetter law that protects the individual citizen from being persecuted by a corporate giant with billions of dollars at its disposal ; that in so protecting a persecuted individual it does not somehow cause damage to the persecutor by shaving off a bit of someÂ CEO ’s huge salary , stock options and bonuses .
Â
So , what is likely to happen to Valerie Plame ’s case if and when it reaches The Court ? Â
Just the kind of Court the right wing loves , one that pets the powerful and punishes the underprivileged , the victims of discrimination .

Canlı Bahis Nedir , Nasıl Oynanır ?
Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi canlı bahis canlı olarak oynanan iddaa ve casino oyunlarına denir .
İnternetten canlı bahis nasıl oynanır sorusu son zamanlarda çok sık sorulmaya başlanmış bir sorudur .
Son dönemde dünya genelinde oldukça yaygın hale gelen canlı bahis hem para kazanmak hem de eğlenmek isteyenler tarafından çok fazla tercih ediliyor .
Güvenilir canlı bahis sitelerinin yaygınlaşması sayesinde sadece bilgisayarlardan değil aynı zamanda cep telefonları üzerinden de bu sitelere kolayca erişim sağlayabiliyorsunuz .
Canlı bahis sitelerinde oldukça fazla bahis seçeneği bulunur .
Normal bir bahiste sadece sonuç odaklı bahis seçenekleri bulunurken canlı bahiste bundan katlarca fazlası bulunabilmektedir .
Bir kar şılaşma başladıktan sonra canlı olarak bahis oynanmaya açılır ve sonuç , gol sayısı , taç sayısı , korner sayısı , kart sayısı , sıradaki gol gibi farklı bahis seçenekleri bahisler arasında eklenir .
Bu sayede kullanıcılar istedikleri bahisleri seçerek kuponlarına ekleyebilirler .
Canlı bahisleri oynamak normal bahislerini oynamak ile aynıdır .
Kupon hazırlamak için öncelikle canlı bahislerden bir tanesini seçmeniz ve istediğiniz bahis seçeneğini kupona eklemeniz gerekiyor .
kuponlarınıza isterseniz birden fazla canlı bahis ekleyebilirsiniz .
Karşılaşmalar canlı olarak oynandığı için oranlar da anlık olarak değişmektedir .
Bu nedenle kuponlarınızı onaylamadan önce oranlara son bir kez göz atmakta fayda olacaktır .
Bedava Bonus Nedir ?
Canlı bahis sitelerinde bonuslar önemlidir .
Bonuslar hem kullan ıcıları siteye üye yapmak hem de kullan ıcıların kay ıplarını belirli oranda telafi etmek için kullanılır .
Bu nedenle her bahis sitesi kendine göre farklı bonuslar hazırlar ve bu bonusları kullan ıcılarına sunar .
Bu bonuslardan en bilindik olan ilk yükleme bonusudur .
Bu bonus sisteme ilk yükleme yaptığınız zaman sizlere verilen bedava bonus olarak adlandırılabilir .
Ancak bundan yararlanmak isteyen kullan ıcıların bazı şartları sağlaması gerekir .
Canlı bahis sitelerinde bedava bonus olarak adlandır ılan farklı bonuslar da yer alır .
Avrupa kupalarına özel bonuslar , basketbol karşılaşmaları için bonuslar , haftalık bonuslar , casino oyun bonusları , yükleme bonusları , kayıp bonusları ve daha fazlası kullanıcılar tarafından tercih edilebilir .
Hangi bonusu kullanacağı tamamen kullanıcının tercihine bırakılır .
Seçtiğiniz bonustan yararlanmak istiyorsanız o bonusa ait şartları sağlamanız yeterli olacaktır .
Tüm bu bonusların dışında herhangi bir şartı olmayan sadece sitedeki bahis ve casino oyunlarını denemeniz için sizlere verilen bonuslar da bulunuyor .
Bu bonuslar özellikle sitedeki oyunlar hakkında bilgisi olmayan ya da oyunları oynayarak tecrübe kazanmak isteyen kullanıcılar tarafından tercih edilmektedir .
Kaçak Bahis ve Kaçak İddaa Nedir ?
Ülkemizde bahis oyunları birçok farklı kurum tarafından oynatılır .
Son dönemde bu kurumlar internet üzerinden de bahis oyunları oynatmaya hatta canlı bahis oynatmaya başladı .
Bu kurumların devlet tarafından kontrol edilmesi ve vergilerin alınması bu kurumları yasal hale getiriyor .
Ancak yurtdışı kaynaklı olan ve ülkemizdeki vergilere tabi olmayan bahis siteleri ve kaçak bahis sitesi olarak tabir edilmektedir .
Her ne kadar bu sitelerin yurtd ışında geçerli lisansları olsa da ülkemizde bu lisanslar geçerli olmadığı için devlet tarafından bu bahis sitelerine girişler yasaklanmaktadır .
Kaçak bahis siteleri bahis çeşitliliği bakımından yasal bahis sitelerine göre daha fazlasını oyunculara sunar .
Ülkemizde oynanması yasak olan casino oyunlarının tamamına kaçak bahis siteleri üzerinden kolayca ulaşabilir ve oynayabilirsiniz .
Kaçak bahis sitelerine olan erişimler her ne kadar engellense de site giriş adreslerinin sürekli güncellenmesi ile kullanıcılar kesintisiz olarak siteye erişim sağlayabilirler .
Kaçak iddaa sitelerinde ayrıca oranlar da oldukça yüksektir .
Örneğin bir A kar şılaşması için beraberliğe 2.00 oran veriliyorsa kaçak bahis sitesinde bu oran 3.00 civarında olabilmektedir .
Oranların bu kadar yüksek olması ve kullan ıcıların istedikleri karşılaşmalara tek maç oynuyor olabilmeleri nedeniyle kaçak bahis sitelerine olan talep her zaman artmaya devam ediyor .
A screen shot of the Lunar Legacy home page , where users can submit a photo and message to go to the moon for $ 10 .
GOLDEN , Colo . – Silicon Valley giant Google Inc. is teaming with the X Prize Foundation to launch a commercial race to the Moon with $ 30 million in incentives to collect along the way .
The X Prize Foundation , headquartered in Santa Monica , Calif. , spearheaded the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize , which was created to jumpstart the development of private commercial transportation to suborbital space .
That prize was won by Scaled Composites of California , which is now building a commercial version of its winning vehicle for entrepreneur Richard Branson ’s Virgin Galactic Corp .
The Google Lunar X Prize sets the competition bar much higher than suborbital space .
“ This next major X Prize has a mission that goes far beyond suborbital flight , and extends the economic sphere of humanity 10 times farther beyond geostationary Earth orbit … all the way to the Moon , ” said Peter Diamandis , the X Prize Foundation ’s chairman and chief executive officer .
“ This competition will once again demonstrate that small teams of dedicated individuals can do what was once thought viable only by governments . ”
The goal of the new prize will be to land a privately funded robotic rover on the Moon that is capable of completing several mission objectives , such as : roaming the lunar surface to a distance of at least 1,640 feet ( 500 meters ) and relaying video , images and data back to Earth .
The X Prize Foundation and Google Inc. announced the international competition today during Wired magazine ’s NextFest festival in Los Angeles , which runs Sept. 13 -16 .
Mooncasting
The vision behind the concept — also dubbed Moon 2.0 as the second era of lunar exploration — is to have small robotic lunar explorers take the first commercial steps toward opening what the organizers believe to be a multi-billion dollar market for utilizing space resources beyond Earth , Diamandis said .
“ We do n’t care where you ’re from , what you ’ve ever done , where you went to school … if you can build a rover that lands and roves on the surface of the Moon you will win the Google Lunar X Prize purse , ” Diamandis said .
According to the summary of the Google Lunar X Prize competition guidelines , the winning team must successfully land a privately funded spacecraft on the lunar surface that survives long enough to complete the mission goals : roaming about the lunar surface for at least 500 meters and sending a defined digital data package — called a “ Mooncast ” — back to Earth .
The $ 30 million to be awarded is segmented into a $ 20 million grand prize , a $ 5 million second prize and a $ 5 million bonus .
Contestants have until Dec. 31 , 2012 , to qualify for the $ 20 million grand prize , which will drop to $ 15 million for missions accomplished any time between Jan. 1 , 2013 , and Dec. 31 , 2014 .
Teams will be required to send a Mooncast detailing their arrival on the lunar surface , and a second Mooncast that provides imagery and video of the journey roaming the lunar surface .
Collectively , data sets broadcast from the Moon to the Earth must equal roughly a Gigabyte of content .
Strategic alliances
Several strategic alliances have been established to support the new competition .
Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ( SpaceX ) of El Segundo , Calif. , for example , will give competing teams a 10 percent price reduction on a launch aboard one of its Falcon launch vehicles – identified as “ the first preferred launch provider ” for the competition in a Google Lunar X Prize press statement released today .
Additionally , the SETI Institute of Mountain View , Calif. , will make available its Allen Telescope Array to serve as a preferred downlink provider for communications from the Moon to Earth at no cost to competing teams .
On the educational track , the St. Louis Science Center in Missouri will coordinate a worldwide network of museums and science centers to take part in the contest .
The International Space University , based in Strasbourg , France , will conduct international team outreach and also facilitate the formation of a judging committee .
Those teams participating in the Google Lunar X Prize will make use of Internet and modern communication technologies .
Doing so will permit people around the globe to monitor the private Moon race and track those rovers that reach their lunar destination .
A Lunar Legacy Program also has been introduced .
With a $ 10 donation to the X Prize , participants will be allowed to upload a digital photo file and message to the winning Google Lunar X Prize vehicles traveling to the Moon .
Private sector exploration
“ The Google Lunar X Prize will allow every schoolchild , teacher and person on the planet to participate in going back to the Moon in a way that government exploration never could , ” said Bretton Alexander , executive director of space prizes for the X Prize Foundation in Washington .
Alexander said the competition “ harnesses the power and culture of the Internet to allow each of us to watch the development of the teams , send images and videos of ourselves to the lunar surface , and experience being on the Moon with the rovers . ”
“ Government space agencies around the world will reap the benefits of the Google Lunar X Prize in that they will be able to explore the Moon and beyond much better for far less cost once the private sector becomes a part of exploration , ” Alexander said .

In The Power Crisis Mythology , the 40 % Efficient Solar Cell and the Cost of the War in Iraq , I wrote :
Spectrolab , Inc. , a subsidiary of Boeing , has developed a solar cell technology that has a conversion efficiency of 40.7 % .
They accomplished this with a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
The annual budget of the U.S. Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory : $ 210 million
The cost of America ’s war in Iraq per day : $ 300 million The U.S. spends more on the war in Iraq in one day ( about $ 300 million ) than it does on the ANNUAL BUDGET for the primary government laboratory that is tasked with renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development .
As absurd as that is , a recipient of a grant from this lab has developed a 40 % efficient solar cell .
What if that lab had the funding equivalent of what the U.S. is spending on the war over a period of two or three days ?
In that post , I also wrote that the energy scarcity argument is like the American dream : you ’d have to be asleep to believe it .
But that was far too kind .
You ’d have to be retarded .
Or in on the swindle .
The world is suffering under a good , old fashioned shakedown .
Think about this obscene chart the next time you fill your vehicle with gasoline , or the lights go out , or your power bill goes up , or smog burns your throat :
Clean energy is expensive ?

DUE TO ITS SOMEWHAT GRAPHIC NATURE , THE PHOTO ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORY APPEARS AFTER THE JUMP .
24 year old macrodactyly patient Liu Hua from Jiangsu , the man with the world ’s largest hand ( Pic after the jump : NOT for the faint - hearted !! ) , has arrived at the Shanghai No. 9 People ’s Hospital for radical plastic surgery .
He was born with a left thumb , index and middle finger much larger than normal , which grew dramatically together with his arm as he grew older and this had a serious impact on his work and day - to - day life .
From Shanghai Daily :
When Liu was hospitalized in Shanghai last month , his left thumb measured 26 centimeters , his index finger was 30 cm and his middle finger 15 cm .
The overall weight of his left arm was about 10 kilograms .
“ It was the biggest hand in the world , ” said Chen Zuliang , a hospital official .
“ Liu ’s fingers stopped growing in recent years so plastic surgery was at last possible to correct the malformation . ”
On July 20 surgeons began a seven - hour operation to reduce the size of Liu ’s fingers and thumb .
Doctors removed 5.1 kg of flesh and bone in the procedure .
Doctors say Liu will have to come back to the hospital in another six months for surgery to reshape his left arm and shoulder .
He is now left with three fingers on his left hand — the thumb , the ring finger and his little finger , but it is hoped that with some training and rehabilitation , life will soon be back to normal for him , and he will no longer have to find ways and means to hide his hand whenever he goes out .

Gen Petraeus took over as head of US forces in Iraq in January
Petraeus interview
Speaking to the BBC's John Simpson in Baquba , Gen Petraeus said there was evidence that the recent troops surge was producing gains on the ground .
But he warned that US forces were engaged in a " tough fight " which will get " harder before it gets easier " .
His comments come as US calls for a rapid troop withdrawal gather strength .
Gen Petraeus was keen to emphasise that the ongoing unrest in Iraq is not something he expects to be resolved overnight .
" Northern Ireland , I think , taught you that very well .
My counterparts in your [ British ] forces really understand this kind of operation ...
It took a long time , decades , " he said .
The question is how can we gradually reduce our forces so we reduce the strain on the army , on the nation and so forth
Gen Petraeus
Battle looms in US Congress
" I do n't know whether this will be decades , but the average counter insurgency is somewhere around a nine or a 10 year endeavour . "
He went on to say that more important than the length of time it would take to stabilise Iraq was the number of US troops which would be required to remain in the country .
" I think the question is at what level ... and really , the question is how can we gradually reduce our forces so we reduce the strain on the army , on the nation and so forth , " he said .
He said everyone wanted the US forces to be able to leave , both Americans and Iraqis alike , but he said it was vital to ensure that " the gains that have been hard fought in places like Baquba and Ramadi could be sustained , maintained and even built on by Iraqi forces and Iraqi political leaders " .
The violence has subsided in Ramadi over the past six months - largely , correspondents say , because tribes have turned against al - Qaeda .
The Americans have taken parts of Baquba , but it is still unclear how much they control .
' Surge taking hold '
Gen Petraeus attributes this success to the recent surge in combat troop numbers , under which some 30,000 extra US troops have been deployed in Iraq , saying that although much work still remains to be done " the surge is achieving progress on the ground " .
US forces recently made gains in the insurgent stronghold Baquba
" In Baghdad for example , June was the lowest month for sectarian deaths in a year . "
By contrast , April , May and June were the deadliest three months for US troops since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
About 3,600 US soldiers have been killed in Iraq since the conflict began .
Gen Petraeus insisted it was not yet possible to see the full effect the surge was having as it took until mid-June to get all of the additional troops and equipment on the ground .
" I think again we need to see where we are in September when we 'll have had a couple of months of all of our forces .
We are still in the first month of the surge of operations that is following now the surge of forces , " he said .
Time running out
Gen Petraeus is due to return to Washington in September to report on the campaign 's progress .
In recent days four Republican senators have withdrawn support for President George W Bush 's Iraq strategy , adding their voice to a growing number calling for a new plan .
And this week will see a contentious debate in the US Senate over a major defence spending bill .
On Sunday the Pentagon announced that US Defence Secretary Robert Gates was cancelling a planned Latin American tour in order to focus on the upcoming clash .
According to BBC world affairs editor John Simpson , the debate is moving so fast in Washington that Gen Petraeus 's efforts , which might have saved the day for the Bush administration if they had been introduced three , or even two , years ago , may well have come too late .
Fifty states face voting machine lawsuits ; “ Uncounted ” documents DRE issues
Business as usual will not be the norm over the next 48 hours as Secretaries of State in all fifty states will each receive subpoenas in the National Clean Election lawsuit , according to an announcement made Monday night by activist Bernie Ellis at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville .
There is still time , Ellis said , to require a paper trail for the 2008 election .
The announcement was made in a panel discussion following the sold out Nashville premiere of the David Earnhardt film , Uncounted [ The Movie ] , which ended with a standing ovation for its writer / director .
The documentary film addressed the issue of voting machine error / failure , the need for a paper trail of votes , the political and business ties between government officials and manufacturers of these DRE ( Direct Recording Electronic ) voting machines , and the ease of tampering with such machines and “ flipping ” votes that are electronically counted .
“ I can not think of anything more important than to save the core of our democracy — the vote ! — David Earnhardt
The film also reviewed extensive cases of mechanical errors , lost votes , voters turned away from polls , incomplete ballots and the installation of uncertified software into voting machine reported from across the nation .
“ The lawsuit aims to establish that all computer systems ( or other systems ) which hide the ballots from the people for even a short period of time before the count is accomplished and the results are posted – are unconstitutional …
“ The lawsuit argues persuasively … that the use of computer and machine election systems violate each citizen ’s right to vote , as defined at least twice by the Supreme Court of the United States . ”
— Jim Condit Jr. , NetworkAmerica .
The lawsuit is aimed at prohibiting the use of all types of vote counting machines , and requiring hand - counting of all primary and general election ballots in full view of the public .
The lawsuit has raised significant constitutional questions challenging the generally accepted practices of state election officials of relying on “ black box ” voting machines to record and count the votes at each polling station , and allow tallying of votes by election officials outside the view of the general public .
In many cases , states have officially authorized voting “ systems ” that leave virtually no paper trail from which to audit the vote .
[ We The People Foundation [ 1 ] ] .
Ellis said that regardless of what voters are being told , there is still time to pass legislation that would mandate voter verifiable paper ballots in 2008 .
The Tennessee Voter Confidence Act of 2007 [ Senate Bill 1363 / House Bill 1256 ] , sponsored by Senator Joe Haynes and Rep. Gary Moore , mandates a paper trail .
“ Today in Tennessee , 93 of our 95 counties use nonverifiable , paperless touch - screen voting machines .
In 2006 , over one in every six Tennessee counties reported problems with this equipment .
Our state is not alone , but ( sadly ) it is now one of the worst states for voting security and accountability in this nation . ” — Bernie Ellis
What began as lawsuits in ten keys states including Iowa , Ohio , New York and Florida has burgeoned into a nationwide effort .
Earnhardt ’s film , which was ignored by corporate media during this world premiere , exposes the vulnerability in current technology of voting machines , or at least , the lack of oversight in acquiring and using them without hacking , flipping or under / overcounting votes , and other problems .
Earnhardt asked why , when it is so easy to get a printed receipt from anything from an ATM machine to the drive - through register at a Krispy Kreme , it should be so difficult to get a verifiable voting machine receipt .
The lawsuit seeks an Order from the Court prohibiting the use of all voting machines and to force election officials to instead utilize paper ballots and to count and total all votes by hand , always in full view of the public .
Plaintiffs from all fifty states have signed on to the lawsuit .
In the question and answer period following the screening , an Iraq veteran said he had pledged to protect his country “ from all enemies foreign and domestic ” and viewed the issues of voting machines as a domestic threat to voters across the country .

New Jersey Upholds DUI for a Man in Parked Vehicle
New Jersey appellate court decision upholds a DUI for a man sleeping in a parked truck under the influence .
A New Jersey appellate court yesterday upheld the principle that convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol ( DUI ) can be imposed on individuals who were not driving .
David Montalvo , 36 , found this out as he responsibly tried to sleep off his intoxication in his GMC pickup truck while safely stopped in the parking lot of the Market Place Deli on a cold February morning last year .
At around 5 am he awoke to see a Hamburg Police Department patrolman standing over him .
The officer had opened the door of Montalvo 's truck to rouse the man and insist that he take a breathalyzer test .
Montalvo refused .
He was arrested and forced to make a conditional guilty plea to the charge of DUI , intending to challenge the police officer 's actions as a violation of the Fourth Amendment .
Montalvo 's attorney argued that the patrolman could have no reasonable grounds to suspect that a sleeping man was involved in criminal activity .
Montalvo 's truck was running , in park , because according to weather records it was about 25 degrees Fahrenheit that Saturday morning .
" From the perspective of the officer on the scene , I do n't find at all that what he was doing was unreasonable , " Superior Court Judge Thomas Critchley Jr. said in his rejection of Montalvo 's argument .
" In fact , I find it would have been unreasonable to have stopped his inquiries at any point short of what he did .
"
The appellate court agreed that the officer was acting reasonably to render assistance to someone who may have been in distress .
"
The officer wanted to make sure the driver was ' okay , ' nothing was wrong with the businesses and that the truck was operating properly , " the appellate decision concluded .
" We are convinced that under the facts as observed by Officer Aaronson defendant was lawfully subject to limited inquiry based upon an objectively reasonable exercise of the officer 's community caretaking function .
" The appellate division affirmed Montalvo 's DUI conviction , meaning the sleeping motorist faces a civil remedial fee or " driver responsibility " tax of $ 3000 in addition to various other fines and fees of at least $ 1000 , plus his legal bills .

President Bush took another opportunity to bash the Democrat - controlled Congress today in a speech he delivered on global terrorism , saying that some members are “ behaving as if America is not at war . ”
“ I know that when I discuss the war on terror , some here in Washington , D.C. , dismiss it as political rhetoric , an attempt to scare people into votes , ” he said at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank .
“ Given the nature of the enemy and the words of its leaders , politicians who deny that we are at war are either being disingenuous or naive . ”
He went on to say : “ We are at war .
And we cannot win this war by wishing it away or pretending it does not exist . ”
For two weeks , the president has accused members of Congress  narrowly controlled by Democrats since January  of dragging their feet on legislation ranging from trade deals to children ’s health .
Today Mr. Bush criticized them for not helping him put measures in place to ensure national security .
Researchers in a multicenter international study have identified a new gene that , if mutated , may increase a woman 's risk of breast cancer by more than a third .
Further , the researchers found that the gene , HMMR , interacts with the well - known breast cancer gene BRCA1 .
Alternations in either gene cause genetic instability and interfere with cell division , which could be a path to breast cancer developing .
This leads researchers to not just a single gene , but a pathway that may be a potential target for treating or detecting breast cancer .
HMMR is mutated in about 10 percent of the population .
Mutations in the two main genes involved in breast cancer susceptibility , BRCA1 and BRCA2 , occur in about one of every 300 individuals , or less than 1 percent of the population .
" If we can identify variations of genes that are more common in the population that increase breast cancer risk , then targeting that gene for early detection or treatment will have a greater impact , " says Kristen Stevens , M.P.H. , a doctoral student in epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and one of the lead authors on the paper .
The study was an international collaboration with researchers from Spain , Israel and several centers in the United States , including the U - M Comprehensive Cancer Center .
Researchers started by developing a computerized network - modeling tool that allows many different types of existing scientific data sources to be analyzed easily to identify genes that impact cancer development .
The researchers started with four genes already known to play a role in breast cancer -- BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM and CHEK2 .
They were then able to see how each of these genes interacts with other genes in the body .
Through this model , HMMR emerged as a key player in breast cancer .
The authors then showed that alterations of either BRCA1 or HMMR can lead to genetic instability and interfere with cell division .

" These findings made us wonder whether HMMR might also be a breast cancer susceptibility gene , " says study author Stephen Gruber , M.D. , Ph.D. , M.P.H. , the H. Marvin Pollard Professor of Internal Medicine at the U - M Medical School .
Gruber is an associate professor of internal medicine and of human genetics in the U - M Medical School , and of epidemiology in the U - M School of Public Health .
He directs the Cancer Genetics program in the U - M Comprehensive Cancer Center , which focuses on inherited cancer risks .
To understand whether variation in HMMR increases breast cancer risk , the researchers looked at the genes of 923 Jewish Israeli women with breast cancer and similar women without breast cancer in a study led by Gadi Rennert , M.D. , director of the CHS National Cancer Control Center in Haifa , Israel .
The Ashkenazi Jewish population in Israel carries a higher risk of breast cancer than other ethnicities .
This component of the study found that women with a variation in the HMMR gene had a higher risk of breast cancer , even after accounting for mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes .
In particular , the risk of breast cancer in women under age 40 who carry the HMMR variation was 2.7 times the risk in women without this variation .
The researchers further verified the finding in a second group of Ashkenazi Jewish women in New York who had a family history of breast cancer but no identified BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and a third study of Jewish women with and without breast cancer in New York .
In total , 2,475 women with breast cancer and 1,918 healthy women were studied in Israel and New York .
Overall , the risk of breast cancer was 23 percent higher in women who had one copy of genetic variant , and 46 percent higher in women who had inherited two copies .
In addition , those women were diagnosed an average of 12 months younger than women from the control group , suggesting that HMMR is linked to early - onset breast cancer .

" Identifying genes involved in cancer in the general population is important , because not all of the causes of breast cancer have been found .
Through discoveries such as this , someday we might be able to more precisely estimate a person 's risk of cancer based on their genes , " says study author Laura Rozek , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral research fellow at the U - M Medical School .
Results of the study appear in the advance online edition of Nature Genetics .
In addition to the U - M authors , study authors were Miguel Angel Pujana , Jing - Dong Han , Lea Starita , Muneesh Tewari , Jin Sook Ahn , Gad Rennert , Victor Moreno , Tomas Kirchhoff , Bert Gold , Volker Assmann , Wael ElShamy , Jean - Francois Rual , Doublas Levine , Rebecca Gelman , Kristin Gunsalus , Roger Greenberg , Bijan Sobhian , Nicolas Bertin , Kavitha Venkatesan , Nono Ayivi- Guedehoussou , Xavier Sole , Pilar Hernandez , Conxi Lazaro , Katherine Nathanson , Barbara Weber , Michael Cusick , David Hill , Kenneth Offit , David Livingston , Jeffrey Parvin and Marc Vidal .
Funding for the study was from the National Cancer Institute , the National Institutes of Health , the Breast Cancer Research Foundation , the Niehaus , Southworth , Weissenbach Foundation , and the Koodish Foundation .

' CEOs must be servants of society , not masters '
A Correspondent in Ponoma , California | October 29 , 2007 10:56 IST
I
In a recent address at the Ahimsa Center at California State Polytechnic University , Ponoma , Gopalakrishnan said the true purpose of business in a society is to give back to the community or the people from whom the businessmen make money .
" Where does a businessman makes his money from ?
He makes his money from people � those who buy his company 's hamburgers , bus or airline tickets , clothes or even automobiles � and the cycle of money , like everything else in nature , has to be circulated .
So , there has to be movement ( of money ) , " Gopalakrishnan said .
Quoting William Hesketh Lever , the founder of Unilever , where he had worked for many years before joining the Tatas nine years ago , Gopalakrishnan recalled that the great entrepreneur said a year before his death that a businessman has to work like a bricklayer who lays out the streets and does the work with the knowledge that his work will always remain anonymous .
" Yet , centuries after he has done his work , people walk on that road with hopes in their heart , looking to new lands .
Never once would they remember the person who made the road that made their journey possible , " Gopalakrishnan said quoting Lever .
" I find that to be a touching expression .
Mahatma Gandhi also said so , by the way , but I am using a Western metaphor to bring out the point , " he said while delivering the talk on ' The Real Purpose of Business , ' co-hosted by the Ahimsa Center and the Center for Business and Design at the California State University , Pomona .
Introducing Gopalakrishnan to the packed audience , Dr Tara Sethia , director of the Center , said it is not difficult to make a connection between business and various types of violence such as predatory lending practices , credit traps , cut - throat competition , workplace exploitation and harassment , discrimination and abuse , and , of course , the violence to nature and environment .
" The recent recalls of toys and tires , pet food , health care products , et cetera remind us about the potential that exists in the business world to harm fellow human beings , animals and the environment .
Whether intended or not , many business practices do have violent consequences , " she said .
" However , the connection between business and nonviolence is not easily made .
It is true that many enlightened business leaders not only eschew exploitation and harm , but , in fact , actively embrace values of integrity , trust and transparency .
Can the culture of Ahimsa inform modern day business practices ?
Can businesses become vehicles of compassion and nonviolence ? " she asked .
" It is in this context that today 's program has a special significance .
It will help us appreciate a truly important , but generally unsuspected , connection between nonviolence and business , and the good that results or can result from this connection , " Sethia said .
In his address laced with humour , many anecdotes and references to books from the Bhagvad Gita to Mitch Albom 's Five People You Meet in Heaven , Gopalakrishnan sought to drive home the point as to how business leaders can rise to play a fruitful role in society and how business actions and practices could be grounded in values such as care , compassion , non-violence and courage .
He noted that long before the Unilever founder 's talk about bricklaying , Jamshetji J Tata , when he was asked how he made so much money and that he must be a very smart guy , said if he made a lot money it did not mean that he was a smart guy .
" ' It means somebody has put the money into me for me to be an instrument to redistribute this money to somebody else .
I earned this money from the people of India .
And therefore , the people of India I must return this money to , ' " he said , quoting the founder of the Tata empire .
" He set up the Jamshetji Tata Endowment Trust in 1892 , long before John D Rockefeller or Andrew Carnegie , " Gopalakrishnan said .
" As Tara says , the image of business is one of violence � it is one of calculation , analysis , profit , greed and a whole host of other unfavorable adjectives , " he said , adding that capitalism has always been perceived or associated with ruthlessness , greed and selfishness .
" Periodically , excesses have taken place in all countries and led to public debates , " he said .
Gopalakrishnan , whose book The Case of Bonsai Manager : Lessons from Nature on Growing , was published by Penguin India last year , noted that these days there is a great obsession in the world of business with the CEO as the hero .
" American business magazines , in particular , specialize in this -- that the CEO is the hero or the chairman is the hero -- he has a square jaw , big blue eyes , he barks out orders at people and the whole organisation performs ( thereby ) increasing shareholders ' value .
A mythology has been created around it , " he said .
But contrary to what one hears in the world of business , Gopalakrishnan said he has learnt this lesson that the CEO is not the biggest hero .
" He is the biggest servant of society and the company , although that is not the way the world sees him , " he said .
Noting that CEOs are genetically wired to be self - centered , he said CEOs are also supposed to be overconfident which is not bad at all .
But then , there are two kinds of overconfidence like there are two kinds of cholesterol , LDL and HDL , and both of them are not bad .
Like cholesterol when it comes to the overconfidence of CEOs , the bad ones are the ones who have external focus and the good ones are those that have internal focus .
" When I am focused on what I have to achieve , and I feel overconfident as to what is turning around my company , that is a case of good form of cholesterol .
But when I am focused on getting my story into the media , impressing my shareholders , ensuring that there is no successor , I have a bad kind of cholesterol , " he said amid laughter .
Citing the example of Arjun of the epic Mahabharata , who he described as a modern - day turnaround CEO , he said even though like a good CEO he was always in charge of the situation , his strategy to rescue Yadav women from Dwarka did not work and despite his power and might he could not succeed .
" This happens to modern - day CEOs .
They are successful in one company , but not in the next company they join , " he said .
" So , the first thing the modern day CEO has to learn is how to avoid the natural propensity to fan his ego .
He has to realize that he is the servant of society .
If he cannot first be the servant of society , how can be become the servant of the company he is serving ? " he said .
" I joined the Tatas nine years ago and I have found something unusual in the company .
Out of the $ 3 billion we make after tax a year , $ 1 billion goes to the Tata trusts in the form of dividend , capital appreciation , etc .
So , one third of our profits are really owned by the trusts .
It has now formed into a structure that nobody can change , " he said .
" In a sense , in my view it compels a CEO to be a servant of the society .
You will never find a Tata name among a list of India 's richest .
I am not dismissive , derisive about people whose names are there -- do not get me wrong -- but in a sense getting your name to the list fans that bad cholesterol that I just talked about , " Gopalakrishnan said .
He said the first lesson that he has learnt in his four - decade - long career in business is that contrary to what they teach in business schools and what the business magazines say , business has to be a servant of the society in which it operates .
Noting that joint stock companies have been the single - biggest instrument of economic progress in the last 100 years , he said that he firmly believed the same would be the case in the next 100 years as well .
" And not just in one country , but all over world managements and businesses and capitalist societies must come to terms in some structural way as to what is the real purpose of their existence .
And when they do that I think we will have more marvelous marriage or marvelous union of capitalism which is benevolent and for the good of the society , " Gopalakrishnan said in his closing remarks .

The New York Times had a fascinating article about a study of herd instinct .
It turns out that people prefer whatever they think other people like .
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/magazine/15wwlnidealab.t.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5124&en=79be2f770fc76c6d&ex=1334203200
Meanwhile , another study showed that the U.S. program of telling kids to stop having sex has been a dismal failure so far .
http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070416/us_nm/sex_abstinence_dc
Apparently the following message is not effective : “ Everyone LOVES sex .
I love , it .
All the other teachers love it .
Your older friends love it .
We all do it whenever we can because it ’s frickin’ GREAT .
But you should ignore the burning in your loins . ”
In defense of the U.S. abstinence education policy , a government official explained that the study only looked at the older methods .
He says the newer abstinence education programs might not be such a steaming mound of money - vaporizing bullshit .
The official was vague about what the new programs include .
Here are my best guesses :
1. Classes are now taught by less hot teachers .
2 . Each boy gets a rubber band and instructions to snap the tent in his pants .
3 . Each girl gets a rubber band in case the boy forgets his .
4. Unpopular kids are encouraged to have sex to make it less cool .
5. Catchy slogan : Masturbators are Winners !
I ’d write more , but I have to go earn money for the government to flush down the toilet .

President George W. Bush is trying to scare us .
On July 24 , 2007 , at Charleston Air Force Base , he mentioned al Qaeda 93 times in a 29 - minute speech .
For nearly all Americans , mention of al Qaeda brings to mind frightening images of the World Trade Towers crashing to the ground .
Nothing reminds us more compellingly of the threat that terrorists pose to our lives , even here in the United States .
The president ’s speechwriters are not fools ; they would not write such scripts for their boss unless they knew that he wanted to scare us .
So the intent is transparent .
But why does the president want to scare us ?
Will his doing so serve any useful purpose ?
In fact , no matter how much the president ’s rhetoric may frighten us , the American people at large can do nothing useful to deter terrorism by al Qaeda operatives .
What are we supposed to do ?
Be vigilant , the homeland - security authorities always tell us .
They give us no useful guidance , however , about what we are supposed to be vigilant of .
Should we watch for persons who act suspiciously ?
That ’s a huge , heterogeneous , and almost entirely innocuous group .
Should we keep our eyes peeled only for Arabian - looking persons who act suspiciously ?
That , too , includes an enormous number of persons , many of whom are not even Arabs , much less terrorists .
Besides , an individual or an action that looks suspicious in one person ’s eyes looks normal in another ’s .
Public reports of suspicious persons are likely to present thousands of false positives for every genuine potential terrorist and therefore to inundate the authorities in a flood of worthless information , prompting a multitude of fruitless investigations and diverting attention from any real terrorist who might be afoot .
Truth be told , being scared does us no good at all in this case , and Bush ’s advisers , because they are not dunces , must know full well that it does us no good .
But they hope it will do the administration some good , which explains why the president and his lieutenants continue to try to scare us about the alleged threat of terrorism here in America , as they have since 9/11 with almost drumbeat regularity .
In speaking about the politics of fear , some commentators talk as though the Bush administration is unusual in its resort to bogeyman rhetoric and related policies , but it is not .
All governments rely directly or indirectly on the cultivation of fear to prop up their rule .
If the people were not afraid , either of the government itself or of some threat from which the government purports to protect them , they would not submit to being fleeced and bullied as they are by their rulers , and the government would collapse .
Direct government threats against the people generally prove to be inefficient means of control , however , so all regimes , even the most tyrannical , resort to posing as the people ’s indispensable protector against a variety of hazards to life , health , and economic well - being .
Of course , people are not always equally scared , and therefore the extent to which they will submit to their government ’s abuses varies .
Immediately after 9/11 , for example , nearly all Americans were extremely frightened of further terrorist acts like those in New York and Washington .
Rumors of all sorts of threats circulated , pertaining to suitcase nukes , poison gases , toxic materials , deadly pathogens , and so forth .
For the government , this situation was a godsend because it greatly diminished the difficulty of pushing through the USA PATRIOT Act , nationalizing the airport - security industry , jacking up the rate of federal spending , running up the national debt , and taking many other measures that were rushed through while people were still in shock about the horrifying recent events and not inclined to question the wisdom of actions being taken in the name of enhancing their security .
Soon after 9/11 , however , the public ’s fright began to subside , as it always does after a crisis unless reinforced .
Then , midway through 2002 , the president and his chief subordinates mounted a strenuous campaign to promote new fears in order to gain support for the planned attack on Iraq .
This fear - mongering featured an alleged Iraqi capacity to employ directly or to pass on to terrorists so - called weapons of mass destruction .
The administration ’s campaign made repeated use of the imagery of the mushroom cloud , tapping into the ordinary American ’s deep - seated fear of all things nuclear .
Despite the government ’s substantial success in these efforts , the people ’s enthusiasm for the war that began in March 2003 , which was very high in the beginning , began to evaporate soon after the invasion , and it has diminished almost without pause ever since .
By now , of course , both the war and the president who launched it have become extremely unpopular .
Lately , in an attempt to thwart his increasingly vociferous partisan critics , the president has been attempting again to tie the war in Iraq to al Qaeda and 9/11 .
According to the Whitehouse fact sheet issued in connection with Bush ’s Charleston speech , “ The al Qaeda terrorists we face in Iraq are part of the same enemy that attacked the United States on 9/11 , and they still intend to attack us at home . ”
Well , not exactly .
The group known as al Qaeda in Iraq did not exist before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and various experts on terrorism — not simply the president ’s political enemies — agree that the invasion and occupation have created many more Islamic terrorists worldwide than existed previously .
As CNN ’s Michael Ware , who is based in Baghdad , remarks , “ It makes one wonder why the president is hammering this point home [ that al Qaeda in Iraq has links to the more extensive group led by Osama bin Laden ] when he glosses over the fact this war is creating more al Qaeda jihadis rather than reducing their number . ”
One need not wonder long , however , because the president ’s motives for playing the fear card on this latest occasion , by repeatedly invoking al Qaeda , are obviously the same as they were on the many previous occasions when he played it .
The president ’s speeches garner more attention from the news media than anyone else ’s views get .
Even if every terrorism expert on earth regards the president ’s statements as misleading , many people will never be exposed to that conflicting view — the average American ’s attention span for the fine points of foreign affairs is very short in any event — and therefore the president ’s scare stories will always produce the effect he desires to some extent , at least in the short run .
Otherwise , he would have abandoned this political tactic long ago .
Most Americans , however , have learned to disregard the president ’s scary declarations .
For them these statements have no more effect than the twenty - fifth scream in a grade - B horror film .

As the nation focused on whether Congress would exercise its constitutional duty to cut funding for the war , Bush quietly issued an unconstitutional bombshell that went virtually unnoticed by the corporate media .
The National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , signed on May 9 , 2007 , would place all governmental power in the hands of the President and effectively abolish the checks and balances in the Constitution .
If a “ catastrophic emergency ” — which could include a terrorist attack or a natural disaster — occurs , Bush ’s new directive says : “ The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government . ”
What about the other two co-equal branches of government ?

You are reading these words right now because 600 million years ago , an aquatic animal called a Hydra developed light - receptive genes — the origin of animal vision .
It was n't exactly 20 - 20 vision back then though .
Hydras , a genus of freshwater animals that are kin to corals and jellyfish , measure only a few millimeters in diameter and have been around for hundreds of millions of years .
Scientists at the University of California , Santa Barbara studied the genes associated with vision ( called opsins ) in these tiny creatures and found opsin proteins all over their bodies .
Though they do n't have eyes or any specific light - receptive organs , researchers think that the light - sensing proteins concentrated in the mouth area of the Hydras help them to use light sensitivity to search out prey .
Because studies of animals that evolved earlier , such as sponges , do n't show the same light sensitivity , scientists were able to pinpoint the Precambrian date that animal vision first started to evolve .
" We now have a time frame for the evolution of animal light sensitivity , " said study leader David Plachetzki , a UC Santa Barbara graduate student .
" We know its precursors existed roughly 600 million years ago .
These findings , detailed in a recent issue of the online journal PLoS ONE , counter arguments by anti-evolutionists that evolution can only eliminate traits and cannot produce new features , the authors say .
“ Our paper shows that such claims are simply wrong , " said co-author Todd Oakley , also a UC Santa Barbara biologist .
" We show very clearly that specific mutational changes in a particular duplicated gene ( opsin ) allowed the new genes to interact with different proteins in new ways .
Today , these different interactions underlie the genetic machinery of vision , which is different in various animal groups . ”

The surveillance state has long been one reason for paranoid souls to always worry about when the government is watching them and what they ’re doing .
They ’ve got money and technology , and the rumors that they can read email and phone calls have been going for years .
It ’s unclear how true those rumors may be , but there is at least a sense of understanding that the government probably is n’t big enough to actually keep an eye on all those communications .
So that ’s why they have to deputize snitches to rat you out if you stray outside the lines .
From Operation TIPS , to DARE officers encouraging children to rat on their parents for drugs , and actually giving 5th - graders little books on how to snitch on their neighbors for zoning violations .
The government is not only trying to make sure that adults are willing to snitch on fellow citizens , they ’re actively advocating for this to our children .
Now the IRS has expanded it ’s whistleblowing snitching program by offering bigger rewards to those who snitch on tax “ cheats ” [ Hat Tip : autoDogmatic ] :
Under a newly amended rule from the Internal Revenue Service , ordinary citizens can help the tax man cometh , or at least collect .
The new Whistleblower Office is the IRS ’s attempt to give incentives for you to rat out the tax cheats you know .
That ’s right .
If your employer , co-worker , landlord , neighbor or father - in - law is raking in fistfuls of cash and bypassing Uncle Sam , you can anonymously report the abuse to the IRS and snag a windfall from their dishonesty .
As long as the total amount of tax fraud comes out to at least $ 2 million ( including penalties , interest , and whatever else the government ultimately collects based on your report ) , you can get a 15 to 30 percent cut .
You got that ?
If you know of someone that is cheating on their taxes , and you report them , you can pull a nice big chunk of change .
Understand how insidious this is .
It is bad enough that you cannot trust your government to protect your rights , and you can generally count on them to violate them .
The government is now working to make sure you ca n’t trust your family , friends , coworkers , and neighbors either .
While things like California Whistleblower Law exists to protect people speaking out against corruption within their companies , this is just purely an attempt to create fear , and by doing so , extend the government ’s reach into your behavior .
I choose to follow laws which I believe to be legitimate or laws which , though illegitimate , cannot be broken without being caught .
When I live under the assumption that everyone is watching me , though , I can not even break illegitimate laws .
What will happen when someone in an area of restrictive gun laws owns an illegal firearm to protect his family , and his shady brother - in - law rats him out to get the feds to overlook the illegal home poker game he ’s running ?
What about the child with a grandmother like Angel Raich , who is illegally using medical marijuana , who reports this to the school principal because she ’s been brainwashed by the public schools into thinking her grandmother is doing something wrong ?
What would happen if one of my neighbors decided to rat me out to the Georgia excise authorities for homebrewing more than the allowed 50 gallons of beer per year ?
Is this a society in which we want to live ?

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
More than 150 people have abandoned a sinking cruise liner that collided with an iceberg in Antarctic waters , a Chilean navy captain told CNN .
The ship sent out a distress call at around 10 p.m. ET Thursday .
Passenger ship Explorer reported problems near the South Shetland Islands , south of Argentina .
The area is in a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom .
Capt .
Carlos Munita of the Chilean navy said they received a distress call from the Explorer , saying the vessel had hit an iceberg around 10 p.m. ET Thursday .
He added a Norwegian rescue ship had arrived at the scene .
Tour companies describe the Explorer as a passenger ship which runs tours between South America and Antarctica .
Some 154 people are reported to be on board ship , which carries a Liberian flag , including 100 passengers .
However the nationalities of those on board is not yet known .
Passengers and crew have been evacuated onto lifeboats , but the captain and the first officer are reported to have stayed on board .
" The great majority of people , including all the passengers , have been safely taken off the Explorer and are now being recovered by the first of the vessels to arrive on scene in response to the distress call , " Dave Jardine - Smith , head of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency 's ( MCA ) search and rescue team in England said .
" The passengers and crew from the Explorer have not been in lifeboats very long , " Jardine - Smith said .
" They should be , hopefully , in good condition .
We are told that there are no injuries . "
Earlier , Mark Clark , a spokesman for the MCA told the Press Association five ships were on their way to help the sinking vessel .
" She hit something and is taking on a serious amount of water , that is all we know . "
The temperature in the area is said to be at around minus 5C , with a sea temperature at around minus 1C , forecasters told the Press Association .
Stephen Davenport , senior forecaster with MeteoGroup , said : " It would n't take long for hypothermia to set in at that kind of temperature in the sea .
" They do get very bad storms down that way , and gale force winds especially , because there is no land in the way , " he told PA .
Lt. Matt Alex from the US Coast Guard Atlantic Area command center said the boat is owned by Gap Adventures , based in Toronto , Canada .

In an essay posted on The Oil Drum blog in January 2006 , I warned of an impending net oil export crisis , and I used what I called the Export Land Model ( ELM ) to illustrate the detrimental effect on net oil exports of declining production and increasing consumption .
Figure
One is a simple graph that illustrates the ELM .
As Matt Simmons pointed out several years ago , the critical problem with post - peak exporting regions is that we would have two exponential functions ( declining production and generally increasing consumption ) working against net exports .
From the point of view of importers , it is quite likely that we are facing a crash in oil supplies .
In my opinion , what I have described as the “ Iron Triangle ” is doing everything possible to keep this message from reaching consumers .
Until recently , I had never quantified what percentage of remaining Ultimate Recoverable Reserves ( URR ) on the ELM would be exported .
Note that the ELM is a simple mathematical model for a hypothetical exporting country , but the model is based on actual producing regions .
Also note that the percentage of production that goes to consumption at the start of a production decline has a significant effect on when a net exporter becomes a net importer .
For example , the top five net exporters , in 2006 ( Saudi Arabia , Russia , Norway , Iran and the UAE ) , consumed about 25 % of their total liquids production .
Offsetting this , many of the top exporters , based on our mathematical models , are at fairly advanced stages of depletion , especially the top three ( Saudi Arabia , Russia and Norway ) , which showed a combined 3.8 % decline in net oil exports from 2005 to 2006 ( EIA , Total Liquids ) .
In any case , the answer to the question of how much oil would be exported from the ELM follows ( I based URR on Texas URR versus peak production ) :
Assumptions :
URR 38 billion barrels ( Gb ) , peaking at 55 % of URR ( approximately same range as Texas and Saudi Arabia , based on the premise that Saudi Arabia has peaked ) ;
Post - peak production decline rate of 5 % per year ( approximately the same range as Texas , historically , and Saudi Arabia , currently ) ;
Post - peak rate of consumption increase of 2.5 % per year ( less than half the current rate of increase in consumption for top exporters ) .
Results :
Net exports go to zero in nine years ( note that the UK went from peak exports to zero exports in about six years ) .
From Year Zero and Peak Exports on the ELM , only about 10 % of remaining recoverable reserves would be exported .
Given the accumulating evidence for declining net oil exports worldwide , it ’s useful to remember what the conventional wisdom is regarding world net export capacity , i.e. , basically an infinite rate of increase in the consumption of a finite energy resource base .
While many economists do n’t have a problem with this , back in the real world an infinite rate of increase tends to be hard to sustain .
Figure Two
Figure Two shows Total US Crude Oil and Petroleum Product Imports , which have increased at about 5 % per year since 1990 .
In my opinion , we will see an epic collision between the conventional wisdom expectations of a continued exponential rate of increase in net oil exports , versus the rapidly developing new reality of an exponential decline in net oil exports .
My frequent coauthor , Khebab , is presently working on some mathematical models for production , consumption and net exports by the top net oil exporters .
Based on the data that I have seen so far , it will not be a pretty picture .
I suspect that the models may show that not much more than 25 % of the remaining URR in the top net exporting countries will be exported .
In regard to discussions of Peak Oil and Peak Exports , I have described what I call the “ Iron Triangle , ” which consists of : ( 1 ) Some major oil companies , some major oil exporters and some energy analysts ; ( 2 ) The auto , housing and finance group and ( 3 ) The media group .
If one resides in the oil industry leg of the Iron Triangle , and if one has concluded that Peak Oil is upon us , or extremely close , does one say , " We cannot increase our production , " and thereby encourage massive conservation and alternative energy efforts , or does one say " We choose not to increase production and / or we are temporarily unable to increase production for the following reasons ( fill in the blank ) ? "
The latter course of action would tend to discourage emergency conservation efforts and alternative energy efforts , and it would encourage energy consumers to maintain their current lifestyles , perhaps by going further into debt to pay their energy bills , and it would in general have the net effect of maximizing the value of remaining reserves .
I always find it interesting that people like Matt Simmons ( who are encouraging energy conservation ) are widely blamed by some critics for high oil prices , while some major oil companies , some major oil exporters and some energy analysts are -- in effect -- encouraging increased energy consumption .
The prevailing message from some major oil companies , some major oil exporters and some energy analysts can be roughly summarized as follows “ Party On Dude ! ”
Meanwhile , over on the other two legs of the Iron Triangle , the auto , housing and finance group is focused on selling and financing the next auto and house , and the media group just wants to sell advertising to the auto , housing and finance group .
The media group is only too happy to pass on the “ Party On Dude ” message to consumers .
To some extent , what we are seeing across the board , from large sectors of the energy industry to the auto / housing / finance industry , media and beyond , is the " Enron Effect , " i.e. , many people know that we have huge problems ahead , but their paychecks are dependent on the status quo .
The suburbanites are caught in the middle of this , although they have a strong inclination to believe the prevailing message from the " Iron Triangle . "
As in the movie " The Sixth Sense , " for most of us the automobile based suburban lifestyle is dead , but we just do n't know it yet , and we see only what we want to see .
However , it is increasingly difficult for many suburbanites to ignore reality as it slowly dawns on them that Jim Kunstler was right when he said , “ Suburbs represent the biggest misallocation of resources in the history of the world . ”
We shall probably soon see that hell hath no fury like a Formerly Well Off suburbanite who just had his SUV repossessed and his McMansion foreclosed .
At least those of us trying to warn of what is coming can try to be ready with a credible plan to try to make things " Not as bad as they would otherwise be , ” when it becomes apparent to a majority of Americans that we cannot have an infinite rate of increase in the consumption of a finite energy resource base .
How 's that for a campaign slogan ?
I recommend FEOT -- Farming + Electrification Of Transportation ( EOT ) , combined with a crash wind + nuclear power program .
Alan Drake has written extensively on EOT issues , for example in “ Electrification of transportation as a response to peaking of world oil production . ”
In simplest terms , we are soon going to need jobs for hordes of angry unemployed males , and in my opinion “ FEOT ” is a way to put them into productive jobs .
On an individual basis , I would also recommend “ ELP , ” which is summarized in the following article : “ The ELP Plan : Economize ; Localize and Produce . ”
Good luck to all of us .
We are going to need it .

Greetings .
Ready to turn over the keys of your vehicle to the cops , or that clever hacker in the next lane ?
How about that creepy guy following you on a lonely country road ?
GM apparently plans to perhaps make this all possible .
It 's been announced that they 'll be equipping nearly two million of their 2009 model vehicles ( that have OnStar installed ) , with the capability to be remotely shut down to idle via OnStar commands at the request of law enforcement .
The claim is that owners will have to give permission first for this capability to be enabled .
Bull .
I do n't care what OnStar 's privacy policy says , if the technical capability for this function is present , OnStar will have no practical choice but to comply when faced with a law enforcement demand or court order , whether or not owner " permission " was ever granted .
This new capability will also create an irresistible challenge to the hacker community -- and perhaps criminal organizations -- to try find ways into the OnStar system for triggering this fun -- one way or another .
It 's impossible to hack OnStar ?
Would you bet your life on that ?
Unfortunately , this is yet another laudable idea that 's being " driven " into the marketplace before all of the negative ramifications have been thought through or fully understood .
And how long will it be before such systems are mandated , one might wonder ?
OnStar has long been the subject of various privacy concerns .
This new capability appears to be the most serious privacy - related issue for OnStar to date .

One of the biggest decisions every webmaster must make is what company to use for domain hosting and if a separate online backup service is necessary .
But , that ’s only part of the story .
Before deciding where to host , you ’ll need to decide whether you are going to need a dedicated server , virtual server or shared server for your website (s ) .
My preference is using a virtual server in a cloud and using DirectAdmin for the control panel .
Through a series of articles , I will explain why I prefer that configuration , provide tips on setting up your server , offer advice on backing up your files and a discuss variety of other topics related to VPS and cloud hosting .
“ RAWSTORY — A federal judge ordered the Bush administration to issue two scientific reports on global warming , siding with environmentalists who sued the White House for failing to produce the documents , ” AP reports Wednesday .
Excerpts :
U.S. District Court Judge Saundra Armstrong ruled Tuesday that the Bush administration had violated a 1990 law when it failed to meet deadlines for an updated U.S. climate change research plan and impact assessment .
Armstrong set a March 1 deadline for the administration to issue the research plan , which is meant to guide federal research on climate change .
Federal law calls for an updated plan every three years , she said .

Will the GOP election theft machine do it again in 2008 ?
by Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman
October 19 , 2007
With record low approval ratings for the Bush / Cheney regime and the albatross of an unpopular war hanging from the GOP 's neck , do you think that a Democratic presidential candidate will win the White House , get us out of Iraq , and end our long national nightmare ?
Think again – the mighty election theft machine Karl Rove used to steal the US presidency in 2000 and 2004 may be under attack , but it is still in place for the upcoming 2008 election .
With his usual devious mastery , Rove has seized upon the national outrage sparked by his electoral larceny and used it as smokescreen while he makes the American electoral system even MORE unfair , and even EASIER to rig .
Thus the administration has fired federal attorneys when they would not participate in a nationwide campaign to deny minorities and the poor their access to the polls .
It has spent millions of taxpayer dollars to install electronic voting machines that can be " flipped " with a few keystrokes .
And under the guise of " reforming " our busted electoral system , it is setting us up for another presidential theft in 2008 .

started a fascinating little discussion about why people are irritated by cell phone use in places where face - to - face conversation would be perfectly OK ( that is , not in a movie theater or library , but , say , in a restaurant or grocery store ) .
His first guess was that it was a holdover from the recent era when mobile phones were a luxurious ostentation , but that does n't sound quite right to me .
Speaking personally , it does n't annoy memuch , butin the first comment said what I was going to say , that many people reflexively talk much more loudly into telephones than they would to a physically present person ( even though this usually does no favors for the transmitted sound quality ) .
I wonder if this is correlated with the phone 's audio volume setting -- maybe if the voice at the other end sounds quiet to you , you 'll talk louder to compensate .
Another phenomenon thatmentioned is that cell phone conversations will sometimes cause people to tune out their surroundings and cause delays when , say , they 're standing in line ( though face - to - face conversations can do that too ) .
But further down , proposed ainteresting and plausible theory , that the widespread annoyance at this has to do with our expectation of how a conversation sounds .
If you hear two people talking to each other with the cadence and pauses characteristic of a conversation , it registers as " two people talking to each other " and it 's possible to tune it out as not of interest ( unless you 're eavesdropping ) .
If you only hear one side of that conversation , it does n't sound like a conversation but like a series of disconnected utterances , and the " utterance possibly addressed to me " detector in your head triggers over and over and over .
It makes some sense that the level of annoyance would vary greatly from person to person ; when I 'm concentrating on something I 'm notoriously oblivious even to people directly addressing me , so this may not be as irritating to me .
What makes me find this theory plausible is that I know how easily a tiny change in the timing of a conversation can derail it completely .
If you 've ever talked to somebody over a satellite link or laggy videoconferencing system that adds a quarter - second or longer delay to every utterance , you know what I 'm talking about .
Our social expectations about such things as the pause between statements in a conversation when both parties have something to say are delicately tuned .
Maybe cell phones need outward - directed speakers that constantly mutter " mwa wah mwa " like an adult in a Charlie Brown cartoon .
THAT will make them less annoying !
BREAKING : Bush blocks
Miers from appearing before House Judiciary Committee , contempt charges possible Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This After the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from former top Karl Rove aide Sara Taylor , the House Judiciary Committee announced that the White House has asked former Counsel Harriet Miers to not even appear before a similar hearing in the firing of 8 US Attorneys on Thursday .
The refusal to appear could open Miers to criminal contempt charges when the panel convenes tomorrow , according to a letter sent to her attorney .
" We are aware of absolutely no court decision that supports the notion that a former White House official has the option of refusing to even appear in response to a Congressional subpoena , " says the letter from Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) and Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif . ) .
Taylor appeared Wednesday before the Senate panel and answered some of its questions while refusing to answer others on executive - privilege grounds .
Miers refusal even to appear Thursday , the letter states , " could subject Ms. Miers to contempt proceedings . "
" I am extremely disappointed in the White House 's direction to Ms. Miers that she not even show up to assert the privilege before the Committee , " Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , the committee 's chairman , said in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" We understand that the White House has asserted privilege over both her testimony and documents , and we are prepared to consider those claims at tomorrow 's hearing . "
Miers attorney , George Manning , informed the panel his client would not appear in a letter sent late Tuesday evening .
" It is disappointing that Ms. Miers has chosen to forego this opportunity to give her account of the potential politicization of the justice system , " Rep. Linda Sánchez , Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law chairwoman added .
" Our investigation has shown - through extensive interviews and review of documents - that Ms. Miers played a central role in the Bush Administration 's decision to fire chief federal prosecutors .
Sanchez still called on Miers to testify .
" I am hopeful that Ms. Miers will reconsider the White House 's questionable assertion of executive privilege and give her testimony on the firing of U.S. Attorneys , " she said .
Ever wondered just how large the biggest truck in the world is ?
Well , the Terex Titan holds that record , measuring a whopping 66 feet long and standing proud at 22.6 feet tall .
When its dump box is extended , it is capable of standing at 56 feet tall , the equivalent of five stories .
I suppose Michael Bay ought to incorporate the Terex Titan into the Constructicons when he comes out with future Transformers movies .
Heck , even the wheel is a massive 12 feet in height .
You ’d be surprised to know that this truck was commissioned and built in 1974 .

Creators of the Storm Worm Trojan have introduced a change to their malware that could help administrators trying to fortify their ISPs and networks against the prolific pest .
PCs infected by Storm in the past week or so use a 40 - byte key to encrypt traffic sent through Overnet , a peer - to - peer protocol that helps individual bots connect to other infected machines , according to Joe Stewart , a senior researcher with SecureWorks , a provider of security services and software .
The change effectively segments the Storm botnet , estimated by Stewart to contain from 250,000 to 1 million machines , into smaller networks because each node must know the password to unencrypt the Overnet traffic .
Storm burst on the scene early this year after a flurry of emails carried subjects promising information about a winter storm that was savaging Northern Europe .
Many of the recipients ended up getting infected by a Trojan that made their PC part of a network of infected computers .
Criminals use such botnets to send spam and carry out distributed denial of service attacks , in which servers are flooded with more data than they can handle .
Since then , Storm has waged a series of ever - changing attacks , including pump - and - dump stock spam , fraudulent e-card messages and emails that promise racy pictures or romance to the lovestruck .
The Storm botnet is hard to eradicate using traditional techniques because it relies on P2P technology , rather than connecting through a single command and control server .
New Weapon
The widespread use of encryption would provide a new weapon for administrators to fight back against Storm .
Until now , one of the only ways to protect a network from the Trojan was to block all P2P traffic .
That was fine for corporations and other organizations , but often proved problematic for ISPs and university networks .
Encrypted Storm traffic looks significantly different than regular P2P traffic sent using the Overnet protocol , making it relatively easy to write firewall rules that block the former while still allowing the latter , Stewart says .
A researcher for the Bleedingthreats blog has devised a generic set of signatures that look for certain UDP packet sizes typical of Storm .
The balkanizing of bots into distinct botnets could be a sign that the Storm authors plan to sell services to spammers or other cyber criminals .
But so far , there is little evidence such plans are in place , because Storm is only segmenting bots into two groups : those created in the last week and those created earlier .
Stewart says there could be other reasons for breaking bots into smaller groups , such as the desire for more nimble and manageable networks . ®
A Santa Barbara company may have a simple solution for wind energy -- all from taking a look at a different part of the plane .
While most wind turbines these days are built as propellers , Gene Kelley is convinced that wings are a better answer for capturing wind energy .
Though the physics and work that has gone into his invention can get complex , the underlying concept of his " WindWing " is basic enough for a child to understand .
Anyone who has stuck a hand out of a car window has felt how the WindWing works .
As the hand is tilted upward , the wind pushes the hand up .
As it tilts downward , the wind pushes it down .
The resulting up - and - down motion , or oscillation , is what gives the WindWing its power .
Kelley , a flight buff with decades of aviation experience added to his work as a " human factors engineer , " said the use of a wing as opposed to a propeller creates a simpler and more efficient way to capture the energy of the wind .
The wing concept could be applied to water as well .
Kelley said it could apply to any flowing , fluid medium .
For now , the company is focusing on the WindWing to prove the concept .
He filed a patent application in 2005 and is awaiting its approval .
" We want to build a better way of harvesting energy from whatever renewable source there is , " Kelley said .
Kelley , who started a company called InnovaTech LLC for his research about 14 months ago , has a diverse background when it comes to invention .
In his 40 years of experience , he 's worked on projects from coal mines to aircraft carriers .
He was on the research team that developed the " rumble strips " that let drivers know when they 're veering off the road .
Kelley started W2 Energy Development Corp. about five months ago to develop the concept of the WindWing .
His original thought was to create inexpensive , portable power for emergencies around the world , such as tsunamis and earthquakes .
He had planned to create a foundation to build and give away the technology .
But it turned out the best way to develop the technology was through a corporation , complete with opportunities for investment that would bring in money to drive the development .
Kelley still hopes to build a foundation to achieve his original philanthropic goal .
The first step after starting W2 was to build a prototype that would prove that the basic concept was valid .
Months of work and scavenged parts went into building the prototype that now sits in a small room in the back of a hangar at the Santa Barbara Airport .
Kelley and David Buckalew , W2 vice president for information resources , built the prototype with a lot of trial and error .
The wings were constructed of sheets of metal in Kelley 's backyard and parts of the device come from the mechanism used to control a car window , plus the kinds of weights you would find at your local gym .
Other parts were custom made by a machine shop .
The prototype consists of four wings on one end and weights on the other .
The weighted end of the bar is short -- one foot long compared to the 10 feet on the other end where the wings sit .
Kelley compares the balancing of the bar on its central support pole to balancing weight on a teeter - totter .
Increasing lift
Because the lever is built at a 10 - 1 ratio , the force of the wind is magnified , so that 200 pounds of lift on the wings translates into one ton of useful force .
In practical application , the ratio will be determined by factors such as wind conditions and wing length .
When a fan is turned on in the prototype room , the 6.7 mph breeze starts to push the wing end upward .
When the wings reach the top , a position sensor is tripped and the orientation of the wings tilts downward , changing their " angle of attack . "
The wings are then pushed downward until they reach the bottom and the wing angle changes again .
The system moves gently , with springs on the central pole that compress as the bar reaches the top and bottom of its movement and springs back to give the bar a shove in the opposite direction .
That means energy is n't lost in turning the lever .
The up - and - down flapping hints at one of the system 's benefits over its propeller - equipped kin -- that it is less likely to kill birds .
In the actual working model , a rod and pump or generator would be attached to the weighted end .
As it moves up and down with the wind , it could be used to compress air , pump water or generate electricity .
" It 's going to be a very , very successful technology , " said Ron Pretlac , chief operating officer .
" Because of the applications , it creates a whole variety of new solutions . "
Wind energy currently provides less than 1 percent of the electricity used in the United States , according to the American Wind Energy Association .
The association supports President Bush 's assertion that up to 20 percent of the nation 's electricity could come from wind .
Reducing carbon dioxide emissions
If 10 percent of wind power potential from the nation 's 10 windiest states was captured , it could reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by almost one - third , the association reports .
Wind energy is a hot place to be these days , said Christine Real de Azua , assistant director of communications for the American Wind Energy Association .
" There 's a lot of opportunity and wind energy attracts a lot of new concepts , " she said .
" It 's all very exciting . "
She said demand has grown at such a rate that wind turbines are sold out through this year and into next .
Companies are investing in more manufacturing facilities to meet that demand .
Those at W2 are convinced their approach could convince more people of the merits of wind power .
Most important is the matter of efficiency .
Real de Azua said the industry " manufactures and produces wind turbines that are proven and reliable and efficient in the market . "
A wind turbine today will convert up to 45 percent of the energy from the wind it encounters into electricity , said John Dunlop , technical services senior engineer for the American Wind Energy Association .
Propeller turbines have increased in productivity as blades were improved , maintenance was scheduled for when the wind was slow and people were able to operate turbines for longer periods of time , he said .
Kelley does n't disagree that the propeller turbines can capture energy from they wind they come in contact with , but he 's concerned about all the wind those three blades are missing .
That 's because the three blades have a small surface area that makes contact with the wind at any point in time .
He said it ends up equating to capturing only 5 percent of the wind energy in a column of air .
The wind also tends to hit different parts of the blades at different speeds , so the propeller is constantly having to make adjustments , which takes energy .
With the WindWing , the wings put more surface area in contact with the wind .
This provides more lift , which translates into more power .
The WindWing is about 40 to 60 percent efficient at getting power from the wind , W2 reports .
Several WindWings could be stacked on a single tower , so that those at different levels could each be adjusted to get the most out of the different wind speeds .
The angle of the wings can be adjusted so that there is a high angle for a light wind and a low angle for a strong wind .
The company is researching how many WindWings can be stacked on the same pole .
The design is also scalable , so that the wings could range from the size of a conference room table to that of a Boeing 747 " jumbo jet . "
Those at W2 said it would take far fewer towers to get the same amount of power generated by propeller turbines .
A single WindWing could replace eight to 12 propellers , Kelley said .
There 's also the lower cost .
Because of its simple design , the WindWing would be less expensive to make .
A cheaper option
A utility - scale propeller turbine , with blades that can reach more than 40 meters in length and generate 1.8 megawatts of power , can run more than $ 1.5 million .
Smaller , residential - or farm - sized turbines run from a few thousand to up to $ 80,000 , according to the American Wind Energy Association .
Though it is still in the early stages of development , Kelley said the WindWing could cost as little as one - tenth of what it costs for a propeller turbine .
Of course , the location of the installation and other factors could affect the cost .
Then there are the little pluses , such as the ability to mount solar cells on the wings , letting them do double - duty in power generation .
It all comes down to a system that makes more sense for users and the environment , Kelley said .
The idea has generated international interest .
Though those with the company did not want to talk specifics , they said they were pursuing possibilities for both the WindWing and its close companion , the WaterWing , which could be used to pump water out of aqueducts or generate power from pipelines .

Kelley said W2 is trying to raise from $ 5 million to $ 7 million in its first round of financing as it moves from the proof - of - concept prototype to a new WindWing prototype that is larger and more functional with more controls .
The company also is looking for land to lease where it can construct a cluster of three different sizes .
That could be accomplished in the next six months .
Once constructed , the site could act as a live demonstration of the technology .
That could help W2 move into the market .
The company is looking at all the different entry points to the market , including the farmer who needs to water crops , the household user and the industrial complex in need of power .
W2 also wants to build political support .
But when the people behind W2 stand around the prototype as it waves up and down in the hangar , the discussion is n't about money or political will .
" Can you imagine taking this to Africa and using this to drill for water ? "
Buckalew asks .
Pretlac notes it could be used to drill for water , pump and purify the water and then distribute it .

' Snappy ' has been feeding off the wildlife in the country park
The snapping turtle , which is native to America , was first spotted by head warden Dennis Manning 17 years ago .
Then it measured 10in ( 25 cm ) , but after feeding off ducks and moor - hens , has grown to 2ft ( 60 cm ) and 20 lb ( 9kg ) .
It is now being moved from Caldicot , Monmouthshire , to the Tortoise Trust rescue sanctuary in west Wales .
The freshwater turtle , which has been named Snappy by wardens , was thought to have been released at the park by owners who did not want it .
Known as an aggressive species , it has a long spiky tail , claws and a sharp beak and " will eat anything it can catch " .
It will be under the water like a submarine and when it spots something it wants to eat , it will shoot its neck out really fast and drag it under
Caldicot Country Park head warden Dennis Manning
The turtle is usually found in the wild in the Americas , spreading from Canada to Florida and as far south as Ecuador .
" It is like a submarine killer , " said Mr Manning .
" It will be under the water like a submarine and when it spots something it wants to eat , it will shoot its neck out really fast and drag it under .
" It does n't have teeth , just a very sharp beak .
I had been wondering why our moor - hen and duck population had been on the decrease , " he laughed .
Mr Manning first saw the creature when it had been dug up in a mechanical digger .
" He was excavated by the digger and so we put him in a bucket and put him back , " he said .
Snake survey
" Back then it was only small and we did n't really know what to do with it .
" I next saw him about 10 years ago and he was quite a lot larger than the first time .
He was walking from the pond . "
Snappy was finally caught by another park warden , Phil Marshall , as he carried out a survey of snakes in the park .
" He saw him walking along and quickly picked him up and put him in his wheelbarrow , " said Mr Manning .
It was caught making its way to a pond on the park
" He must be about 30 years old now , " said Mr Manning .
" We have had a lot of terrapins released here which we can re-home quite easily but he 's a bit too big for that and he 's quite dangerous too .
" He is a ferocious eater and could take your finger off if he bit you .
" We are not sure if he is a common snapper turtle or an alligator snapper .
Either way , he is n't native to this country and nor to our wildlife .
" It 's just a shame people do n't think about what they are doing when they release animals like this in the wild . "
It is not the first strange creature spotted by the wardens at the park - a boa constrictor snake was discovered there 10 years ago but was run over before it could be captured .
The House bill would permit the government to conduct surveillance for 45 days before submitting it to court review and approval .
( Mr. Bush is wrong when he says the bill would slow down intelligence gathering . )
After that , ideally , the law would require a real warrant .
If Congress will not do that , at a minimum it must require spying programs to undergo periodic audits by the court and Congress .
The administration wants no reviews .
Mr. Bush and his team say they have safeguards to protect civil liberties , meaning surveillance will be reviewed by the attorney general , the director of national intelligence and the inspectors general of the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency .
There are two enormous flaws in that .
The Constitution is based on the rule of law , not individuals ; giving such power to any president would be un-American .
And this one long ago showed he can not be trusted .
Last week ,
The Times reported that the C.I.A. director , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , is investigating the office of his agency ’s inspector general after it inquired into policies on detention and interrogation .
This improper , perhaps illegal investigation sends a clear message of intimidation .
We also know that the F.B.I. has abused expanded powers it was granted after 9/11 and that the former attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , systematically covered up the president ’s actions with deliberately misleading testimony .
Mr. Bush says the law should give immunity to communications companies that gave data to the government over the last five years without a court order .
He says they should not be punished for helping to protect America , but what Mr. Bush really wants is to avoid lawsuits that could uncover the extent of the illegal spying he authorized after 9/11 .
It may be possible to shield these companies from liability , since the government lied to them about the legality of its requests .
But the law should allow suits aimed at forcing disclosure of Mr. Bush ’s actions .
It should also require a full accounting to Congress of all surveillance conducted since 9/11 .
And it should have an expiration date , which the White House does not want .
Ever since 9/11 , we have watched Republican lawmakers help Mr. Bush shred the Constitution in the name of fighting terrorism .
We have seen Democrats acquiesce or retreat in fear .
It is time for that to stop .

A poem lovely as a tree .
Poems are made by fools like me ,
But only God can make a tree .
Joyce Kilmer
A tree ’s a tree .
How many more do you need to look at ?
- Ronald Reagan
The problem
Matching string sequences is a problem that computer programmers face on a regular basis .
Some programming tasks , such as data compression or DNA sequencing , can benefit enormously from improvements in string matching algorithms .
This article discusses a relatively unknown data structure , the suffix tree , and shows how its characteristics can be used to attack difficult string matching problems .
Imagine that you ’ve just been hired as a programmer working on a DNA sequencing project .
Researchers are busy slicing and dicing viral genetic material , producing fragmented sequences of nucleotides .
They send these sequences to your server , which is then expected to locate the sequences in a database of genomes .
The genome for a given virus can have hundreds of thousands of nucleotide bases , and you have hundreds of viruses in your database .
You are expected to implement this as a client / server project that gives real - time feedback to the impatient PhD.s .
What ’s the best way to go about it ?
It is obvious at this point that a brute force string search is going to be terribly inefficient .
This type of search would require you to perform a string comparison at every single nucleotide in every genome in your database .
Testing a long fragment that has a high hit rate of partial matches would make your client / server system look like an antique batch processing machine .
Your challenge is to come up with an efficient string matching solution .
The intuitive solution
Since the database that you are testing against is invariant , preprocessing it to simplify the search seems like a good idea .
One preprocessing approach is to build a search trie .
For searching through input text , a straightforward approach to a search trie yields a thing called a suffix trie .
( The suffix trie is just one step away from my final destination , the suffix tree . )
A trie is a type of tree that has N possible branches from each node , where N is the number of characters in the alphabet .
The word ‘ suffix ’ is used in this case to refer to the fact that the trie contains all of the suffixes of a given block of text ( perhaps a viral genome . )
Figure 1 — The Suffix Trie Representing " BANANAS "
Figure 1 shows a Suffix trie for the word BANANAS .
There are two important facts to note about this trie .
First , starting at the root node , each of the suffixes of BANANAS is found in the trie , starting with BANANAS , ANANAS , NANAS , and finishing up with a solitary S. Second , because of this organization , you can search for any substring of the word by starting at the root and following matches down the tree until exhausted .
The second point is what makes the suffix trie such a nice construct .
If you have a input text of length N , and a search string of length M , a traditional brute force search will take as many as N*M character comparison to complete .
Optimized searching techniques , such as the Boyer - Moore algorithm can guarantee searches that require no more than M+N comparisons , with even better average performance .
But the suffix trie demolishes this performance by requiring just M character comparisons , regardless of the length of the text being searched !
Remarkable as this might seem , it means I could determine if the word BANANAS was in the collected works of William Shakespeare by performing just seven character comparisons .
Of course , there is just one little catch : the time needed to construct the trie .
The reason you do n’t hear much about the use of suffix tries is the simple fact that constructing one requires O ( N2 ) time and space .
This quadratic performance rules out the use of suffix tries where they are needed most : to search through long blocks of data .
Under the spreading suffix tree
A reasonable way past this dilemma was proposed by Edward McCreight in 1976 , when he published his paper on what came to be known as the suffix tree .
The suffix tree for a given block of data retains the same topology as the suffix trie , but it eliminates nodes that have only a single descendant .
This process , known as path compression , means that individual edges in the tree now may represent sequences of text instead of single characters .
Figure 2 — The McCreight Suffix Trie Representing " BANANAS "
Figure 2 shows what the suffix trie from Figure 1 looks like when converted to a suffix tree .
You can see that the tree still has the same general shape , just far fewer nodes .
By eliminating every node with just a single descendant , the count is reduced from 23 to 11 .
In fact , the reduction in the number of nodes is such that the time and space requirements for constructing a suffix tree are reduced from O ( N2 ) to O ( N ) .
In the worst case , a suffix tree can be built with a maximum of 2N nodes , where N is the length of the input text .
So for a one - time investment proportional to the length of the input text , we can create a tree that turbocharges our string searches .
Even you can make a tree
McCreight ’s original algorithm for constructing a suffix tree had a few disadvantages .
Principle among them was the requirement that the tree be built in reverse order , meaning characters were added from the end of the input .
This ruled the algorithm out for on line processing , making it much more difficult to use for applications such as data compression .
Twenty years later , Esko Ukkonen from the University of Helsinki came to the rescue with a slightly modified version of the algorithm that works from left to right .
Both my sample code and the descriptions that follow are based on Ukkonen ’s work , published in the September 1995 issue of Algorithmica .
For a given string of text , T , Ukkonen ’s algorithm starts with an empty tree , then progressively adds each of the N prefixes of T to the suffix tree .
For example , when creating the suffix tree for BANANAS , B is inserted into the tree , then BA , then BAN , and so on .
When BANANAS is finally inserted , the tree is complete .
Figure 3 — Progressively Building the Suffix Tree
Suffix tree mechanics
Adding a new prefix to the tree is done by walking through the tree and visiting each of the suffixes of the current tree .
We start at the longest suffix ( BAN in Figure 3 ) , and work our way down to the shortest suffix , which is the empty string .
Each suffix ends at a node that consists of one of these three types :
A leaf node .
In Figure 4 , the nodes labeled 1,2 , 4 , and 5 are leaf nodes .
An explicit node .
The non -leaf nodes that are labeled 0 and 3 in Figure 4 are explicit nodes .
They represent a point on the tree where two or more edges part ways .
An implicit node .
In Figure 4 , prefixes such as BO , BOO , and OO all end in the middle of an edge .
These positions are referred to as implicit nodes .
They would represent nodes in the suffix trie , but path compression eliminated them .
As the tree is built , implicit nodes are sometimes converted to explicit nodes .
Figure 4 — BOOKKEEPER after adding BOOK
In Figure 4 , there are five suffixes in the tree ( including the empty string ) after adding BOOK to the structure .
Adding the next prefix , BOOKK to the tree means visiting each of the suffixes in the existing tree , and adding letter K to the end of the suffix .
The first four suffixes , BOOK , OOK , OK , and K , all end at leaf nodes .
Because of the path compression applied to suffix trees , adding a new character to a leaf node will always just add to the string on that node .
It will never create a new node , regardless of the letter being added .
After all of the leaf nodes have been updated , we still need to add character ‘ K ’ to the empty string , which is found at node 0 .
Since there is already an edge leaving node 0 that starts with letter K , we do n’t have to do anything .
The newly added suffix K will be found at node 0 , and will end at the implicit node found one character down along the edge leading to node 2 .
The final shape of the resulting tree is shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 — The same tree after adding BOOKK
Things get knotty
Updating the tree in Figure 4 was relatively easy .
We performed two types of updates : the first was simply the extension of an edge , and the second was an implicit update , which involved no work at all .
Adding BOOKKE to the tree shown in Figure 5 will demonstrate the two other types of updates .
In the first type , a new node is created to split an existing edge at an implicit node , followed by the addition of a new edge .
The second type of update consists of adding a new edge to an explicit node .
Figure 6 — The Split and Add Update
When adding BOOKKE to the tree in Figure 5 , we once again start with the longest suffix , BOOKK , and work our way to the shortest , the empty string .
Updating the longer suffixes is trivial as long as we are updating leaf nodes .
In Figure 5 , the suffixes that end in leaf nodes are BOOKK , OOKK , OKK , and KK .
The first tree in Figure 6 shows what the tree looks like after these suffixes have been updated using the simple string extension .
The first suffix in Figure 5 that does n’t terminate at a leaf node is K .
When updating a suffix tree , the first non -leaf node is defined as the active point of the tree .
All of the suffixes that are longer than the suffix defined by the active point will end in leaf nodes .
None of the suffixes after this point will terminate in leaf nodes .
The suffix K terminates in an implicit node part way down the edge defined by KKE .
When testing non -leaf nodes , we need to see if they have any descendants that match the new character being appended .
In this case , that would be E .
A quick look at the first K in KKE shows that it only has a single descendant : K . So this means we have to add a descendent to represent Letter E .
This is a two step process .
First , we split the edge holding the arc so that it has an explicit node at the end of the suffix being tested .
The middle tree in Figure 6 shows what the tree looks like after the split .
Once the edge has been split , and the new node has been added , you have a tree that looks like that in the third position of Figure 6 .
Note that the K node , which has now grown to be KE , has become a leaf node .
Updating an explicit node
After updating suffix K , we still have to update the next shorter suffix , which is the empty string .
The empty string ends at explicit node 0 , so we just have to check to see if it has a descendant that starts with letter E . A quick look at the tree in Figure 6 shows that node 0 does n’t have a descendant , so another leaf node is added , which yields the tree shown in Figure 7 .
Figure 7 — The tree
Generalizing the algorithm
By taking advantage of a few of the characteristics of the suffix tree , we can generate a fairly efficient algorithm .
The first important trait is this : once a leaf node , always a leaf node .
Any node that we create as a leaf will never be given a descendant , it will only be extended through character concatenation .
More importantly , every time we add a new suffix to the tree , we are going to automatically extend the edges leading into every leaf node by a single character .
That character will be the last character in the new suffix .
This makes management of the edges leading into leaf nodes easy .
Any time we create a new leaf node , we automatically set its edge to represent all the characters from its starting point to the end of the input text .
Even if we do n’t know what those characters are , we know they will be added to the tree eventually .
Because of this , once a leaf node is created , we can just forget about it !
If the edge is split , its starting point may change , but it will still extend all the way to the end of the input text .
This means that we only have to worry about updating explicit and implicit nodes at the active point , which was the first non -leaf node .
Given this , we would have to progress from the active point to the empty string , testing each node for update eligibility .
However , we can save some time by stopping our update earlier .
As we walk through the suffixes , we will add a new edge to each node that does n’t have a descendant edge starting with the correct character .
When we finally do reach a node that has the correct character as a descendant , we can simply stop updating .
Knowing how the construction algorithm works , you can see that if you find a certain character as a descendant of a particular suffix , you are bound to also find it as a descendant of every smaller suffix .
The point where you find the first matching descendant is called the end point .
The end point has an additional feature that makes it particularly useful .
Since we were adding leaves to every suffix between the active point and the end point , we now know that every suffix longer than the end point is a leaf node .
This means the end point will turn into the active point on the next pass over the tree !
By confining our updates to the suffixes between the active point and the end point , we cut way back on the processing required to update the tree .
And by keeping track of the end point , we automatically know what the active point will be on the next pass .
A first pass at the update algorithm using this information might look something like this ( in C - like pseudo code ) :
Update ( new_suffix ) { current_suffix = active_point test_char = last_char in new_suffix done = false ; while ( ! done ) { if current_suffix ends at an explicit node { if the node has no descendant edge starting with test_char create new leaf edge starting at the explicit node else done = true ; } else { if the implicit node ' s next char isn ' t test_char { split the edge at the implicit node create new leaf edge starting at the split in the edge } else done = true ; } if current_suffix is the empty string done = true ; else current_suffix = next_smaller_suffix ( current_suffix ) } active_point = current_suffix }
The Suffix Pointer
The pseudo - code algorithm shown above is more or less accurate , but it glosses over one difficulty .
As we are navigating through the tree , we move to the next smaller suffix via a call to next_smaller_suffix ( ) .
This routine has to find the implicit or explicit node corresponding to a particular suffix .
If we do this by simply walking down the tree until we find the correct node , our algorithm is n’t going to run in linear time .
To get around this , we have to add one additional pointer to the tree : the suffix pointer .
The suffix pointer is a pointer found at each internal node .
Each internal node represents a sequence of characters that start at the root .
The suffix pointer points to the node that is the first suffix of that string .
So if a particular string contains characters 0 through N of the input text , the suffix pointer for that string will point to the node that is the termination point for the string starting at the root that represents characters 1 through N of the input text .
Figure 8 shows the suffix tree for the string ABABABC .
The first suffix pointer is found at the node that represents ABAB .
The first suffix of that string would be BAB , and that is where the suffix pointer at ABAB points .
Likewise , BAB has its own suffix pointer , which points to the node for AB .
Figure 8 — The suffix tree for ABABABC with suffix pointers shown as dashed lines
The suffix pointers are built at the same time the update to the tree is taking place .
As I move from the active point to the end point , I keep track of the parent node of each of the new leaves I create .
Each time I create a new edge , I also create a suffix pointer from the parent node of the last leaf edge I created to the current parent edge .
( Obviously , I ca n’t do this for the first edge created in the update , but I do for all the remaining edges . )
With the suffix pointers in place , navigating from one suffix to the next is simply a matter of following a pointer .
This critical addition to the algorithm is what reduces it to an O ( N ) algorithm .
Tree houses
To help illustrate this article , I wrote a short program , STREE .CPP , that reads in a string of text from standard input and builds a suffix tree using fully documented C++.
A second version , STREED .CPP , has extensive debug output as well .
Links to both are available at the bottom of this article .
Understanding STREE.CPP is really just a matter of understanding the workings of the data structures that it contains .
The most important data structure is the Edge object .
The class definition for Edge is :
class Edge { public : int first_char_index ; int last_char_index ; int end_node ; int start_node ; void Insert ( ) ; void Remove ( ) ; Edge ( ) ; Edge ( int init_first_char_index , int init_last_char_index , int parent_node ) ; int SplitEdge ( Suffix & s ) ; static Edge Find ( int node , int c ) ; static int Hash ( int node , int c ) ; } ;
Each time a new edge in the suffix tree is created , a new Edge object is created to represent it .
The four data members of the object are defined as follows :
first_char_index , last_char_index : Each of the edges in the tree has a sequence of characters from the input text associated with it .
To ensure that the storage size of each edge is identical , we just store two indices into the input text to represent the sequence .
start_node :
The number of the node that represents the starting node for this edge .
Node 0 is the root of the tree .
end_node :
The number of the node that represents the end node for this edge .
Each time an edge is created , a new end node is created as well .
The end node for every edge will not change over the life of the tree , so this can be used as an edge id as well .
One of the most frequent tasks performed when building the suffix tree is to search for the edge emanating from a particular node based on the first character in its sequence .
On a byte oriented computer , there could be as many as 256 edges originating at a single node .
To make the search reasonably quick and easy , I store the edges in a hash table , using a hash key based on their starting node number and the first character of their substring .
The Insert ( ) and Remove ( ) member functions are used to manage the transfer of edges in and out of the hash table .
The second important data structure used when building the suffix tree is the Suffix object .
Remember that updating the tree is done by working through all of the suffixes of the string currently stored in the tree , starting with the longest , and ending at the end point .
A Suffix is simply a sequence of characters that starts at node 0 and ends at some point in the tree .
It makes sense that we can then safely represent any suffix by defining just the position in the tree of its last character , since we know the first character starts at node 0 , the root .
The Suffix object , whose definition is shown here , defines a given suffix using that system :
class Suffix { public : int origin_node ; int first_char_index ; int last_char_index ; Suffix ( int node , int start , int stop ) ; int Explicit ( ) ; int Implicit ( ) ; void Canonize ( ) ; } ;
The Suffix object defines the last character in a string by starting at a specific node , then following the string of characters in the input sequence pointed to by the first_char_index and last_char_index members .
For example , in Figure 8 , the longest suffix “ ABABABC ” would have an origin_node of 0 , a first_char_index of 0 , and a last_char_index of 6 .
Ukkonen ’s algorithm requires that we work with these Suffix definitions in canonical form .
The Canonize ( ) function is called to perform this transformation any time a Suffix object is modified .
The canonical representation of the suffix simply requires that the origin_node in the Suffix object be the closest parent to the end point of the string .
This means that the suffix string represented by the pair ( 0 , “ ABABABC ” ) , would be canonized by moving first to ( 1 , “ ABABC ” ) , then ( 4 , “ ABC ” ) , and finally ( 8 , ” ” ) .
When a suffix string ends on an explicit node , the canonical representation will use an empty string to define the remaining characters in the string .
An empty string is defined by setting first_char_index to be greater than last_char_index .
When this is the case , we know that the suffix ends on an explicit node .
If first_char_index is less than or equal to last_char_index , it means that the suffix string ends on an implicit node .
Given these data structure definitions , I think you will find the code in STREE .
CPP to be a straightforward implementation of the Ukkonen algorithm .
For additional clarity , use STREED .CPP to dump copious debug information out at runtime .

Programming at Python Speed
A Conversation with Guido van Rossum , Part III
by Bill Venners
January 27 , 2003

Summary
Python creator Guido van Rossum talks with Bill Venners about the source of Python 's famed programmer productivity and the joys of exploring new territory with code .
Guido van Rossum is the author of Python , an interpreted , interactive object - oriented programming language .
In the late 1980s , Van Rossum began work on Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands , or Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica ( CWI ) as it is known in Dutch .
Since then , Python has become very popular among developers , who are attracted to its clean syntax and reputation for productivity .
In this interview , which is being published in six weekly installments , Van Rossum gives insights into Python 's design goals , the source of Python programmer productivity , the implications of weak typing , and more :
In Part I : The Making of Python , Van Rossum describes Python 's history , major influences , and design goals .
In Part II : Python 's Design Goals , Van Rossum talks about Python 's original design goals — how he originally intended Python to " bridge the gap between the shell and C , " and how it eventually became used on large - scale applications .
In this installment , Van Rossum discusses the source of Python 's famed programmer productivity and the joys of exploring new territory with code .
Productivity and Finger Typing
Bill Venners : I 've met many people who like Python because they feel more productive using it .
When I went from C++ to Java , I found myself way more productive in Java .
People who know both Java and Python usually tell me they are way more productive in Python .
Where does the productivity come from when programming in Python ?
Guido van Rossum :
There are many different sources .
One is that Python requires a lot less typing .
Bill Venners : Finger typing ?
Guido van Rossum : Finger typing .
It would n't surprise me if the amount of typing Python requires is five times less than Java for a typical piece of code .
That would be the ratio .
When you have that much less code , it 's so much easier to maintain , and also to change .
This is all very informal , but I heard someone say a good programmer can reasonably maintain about 20,000 lines of code .
Whether that is 20,000 lines of assembler , C , or some high - level language does n't matter .
It 's still 20,000 lines .
If your language requires fewer lines to express the same ideas , you can spend more time on stuff that otherwise would go beyond those 20,000 lines .
A 20,000 - line Python program would probably be a 100,000 - line Java or C++ program .
It might be a 200,000 - line C program , because C offers you even less structure .
Looking for a bug or making a systematic change is much more work in a 100,000 - line program than in a 20,000 - line program .
For smaller scales , it works in the same way .
A 500 - line program feels much different than a 10,000 - line program .
Python 's Powerful Data Types
Bill Venners :
Do you consider less finger typing the main source of productivity when programming in Python ?
Why do people feel more productive ?
Guido van Rossum : Another source of productivity is Python 's powerful built - in data types .
Take arrays , for example .
Python does not require you to declare an array size .
You do n't need to worry that what you want to hold does n't fit in the number of elements you 've declared .
Our array type is flexible .
It has maybe a dozen methods .
You can insert elements in the middle and everything else just moves up automatically .
You can delete .
You can also slice : work on a slice of an array at a time .
If you want a function to act on a piece of an array , for example , you can just pass a slice as a single argument .
You do n't need to pass in the original array with a start - and - stop index .
Python has a very efficient and powerful dictionary type , which is like an associative array or hash .
The dictionary type is used a lot internally by the Python implementation .
That almost guarantees that it is efficient , because we spent a lot of time making the language efficient .
But you can use the same dictionary data type for your application .
Dictionary is probably the main data type that every application uses .
Over the years Python 's data types have collected a lot of useful functionality .
The data types are powerful .
That makes Python very powerful .
And yet because Python has a very small set of data types , it does n't feel like you have to spend a year learning the language before you know everything that 's there .
The minimal finger typing and powerful data types work together to make your program small , and make you feel more productive .
Weak Typing and the Standard Library
Bill Venners :
To what extent do Python 's weak typing and libraries help programmers feel productive ?
Guido van Rossum :
Weak typing probably helps you feel productive , because it lets you bend the rules a bit when deciding what goes into your array .
You can have an array of numbers that occasionally has something else inside , if that does n't bother you .
A single sort method sorts arrays of completely heterogeneous elements , as long as you can compare them individually .
You do n't have to commit to integers and floating point numbers , for example .
They all mix properly .
You also have long integers , which are arbitrary precision integers .
In many cases , this is useful — either because you need just a little more than 32 bits , or because you need a lot more than 32 bits .
Long integers are available in Java , but they 're in a separate package and are much harder to use because you do n't have operator overloading .
In Python , you can just write x + y , and it does n't matter whether x and y are small integers or integer numbers with several thousand bits .
People also feel more productive due to the " batteries included " feeling : the standard library includes many things .
The standard library has implementations of the various Internet protocols — HTTP , FTP , NNTP , IMAP , POP , SMTP .
There 's a higher - level API to which you just give a URL and it returns something that acts like a file .
You can just read bytes from it and it gives the data corresponding to that URL on the remote site .
A lot of necessary functionality is already in the libraries , available with minimal typing .
In addition to the standard library , the Python community has produced many third - party libraries .
For years the standard library did n't have cookie support , but there was an excellent third - party cookie module .
About one or two years ago that cookie module was added to the standard library ; however , it was available to people who needed it long before then .
All those aspects let people feel more productive .
Exploring with Code
Bill Venners : I 've heard that one of the problems with Python is that it invites less design .
Because people can so easily write their programs quickly in Python , they tend to just charge ahead without any planning .
Do you think verbosity , such as the verbosity of Java compared to Python , tends to make people want to plan more ?
Guido van Rossum : Planning is good and bad .
If you know where you 're going , planning is good .
If you do n't know what you 'll encounter on the way , you should be more open - minded and improvisational .
I certainly see a place for planning , but if the language forces you to plan everything , there may be trips you 'll never undertake because it would require too much thinking ahead .
You 're then inhibited by fears that you do n't know how to do something .
In Python , you can start doing that something and discover how to do it on the way .
You can build something quickly , get it on the road , obtain feedback , and then design the next one based on greater understanding of the problem domain .
Bill Venners : I often feel that creating software is like mixing cement .
It starts out soft and hardens over time as you stir it .
You can't see everything in advance , so you can't plan everything up front .
You can make a plan , but once you try it you realize it would be much better to do it another way .
So you iterate .
Each time you iterate you move towards a better solution , and the body of code that depends on your choices grows .
Eventually it all just kind of hardens .
You end up with released interfaces that you 're stuck with .
Guido van Rossum :
And then you really have to be backwards compatible .
Bill Venners :
So perhaps being able to make changes gets you farther ahead before things harden .
Maybe things do n't harden as early in Python because you go through the iterations more quickly .
Guido van Rossum : Yeah .
I always feel that the interesting programming jobs are the ones in which you do n't know exactly where you 'll end up .
Implementing another spreadsheet is boring .
There have been many spreadsheets .
We know what the user interface should be like .
We know what the right implementation techniques are .
We know a whole bunch of things .
Yes , you can write another spreadsheet .
You can probably plan it very well , because you can do a feature - by - feature checklist of all the other known spreadsheets .
I want this .
I want that .
I want to fix this problem with this particular one .
I want to avoid that bug .
That 's easy , but it 's not very interesting .
I like programming problems where you think , " There has to be something really interesting over there , but I can't see it clearly . "
All you can do is move one step over there , with a small bit of code , and start exploring to see it more clearly .
And maybe it actually was n't there , it was over here .
Or it had a different shape than you thought initially .
Maybe it was n't interesting at all , and you did n't waste a lot of time .
The danger of planning is that you plan for the contingencies you know about , but by definition you do n't plan for things you do n't know you 'll encounter .
So when you do encounter an unexpected event in your programming endeavor , you have to fix many interfaces and change multiple method signatures .
If you 've already committed to your original plan and that 's no longer where you 're going , then you have a problem .
I 'm not particularly worried by the fact that people say you can prototype more easily in Python , but eventually the Java version makes it easier to build a robust large system .
You can prototype in Python .
Once you 've explored the space more , you can do the planning and design that the Java version requires .
If you start writing in Java knowing as little as you did when you started writing the Python version , you 'll waste way more time exploring than actually building the system you 'll eventually build .
The Python world has some nice examples of this .
Early on , when the Web was just becoming interesting for things like shopping online , a small company called eShop was developing various commerce servers .
e Shop had proprietary protocols and proprietary applications , and it realized that it should just be able to use a Web server and Web browser .
The developers decided to do a prototype in Python .
Because they used Python , the eShop developers were the first to release a beta version compared to many other startups doing exactly the same thing .
They never actually released working code after their beta release , because the company was acquired by Microsoft .
Microsoft spent two or three product revisions to eventually replace all the Python code with C++.
But if eShop had n't started in Python , it would never have released something interesting enough for Microsoft to acquire in the first place .
That also happened with Yahoo .
Yahoo Mail started out as a successful Python application .
Again , because the developers used Python , they could respond quickly to the user feedback .
And that 's an application that almost everybody can use .
They saw many things wrong with their application , and they responded to that quickly and added new features .
Because they were doing something new , they did n't know exactly what people would need from an email Web application .
It is different from a program that has your email on your computer .
Access times are different .
All sorts of things are different .
So they were learning about what those differences were .
And again , I think Yahoo may now have replaced all the Python code with C++ or some other language , but the Python prototype was essential in order to get there .
