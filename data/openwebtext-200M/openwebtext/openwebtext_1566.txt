Nopalito in NoPa is a bit of a trek from the Dogpatch .
So whenever we have an unyielding craving for carnitas we make it ourselves with this really simple recipe .
It ’s really simple but it takes quite a bit of time , after all carnitas is slowly braised pork .
We like to use pork loin , a leaner cut of meat , bring the tasty fat back in with bacon ( anything tastes better with bacon ) , and then balance the flavor with freshly squeezed orange juice .
Our version of carnitas was actually inspired by my mom ’s adobo .
Dennis fondly calls it cardobo — carnitas plus adobo .
For those not quite familiar with Filipino adobo , it ’s slow - cooked , pickled meat in spices and vinegar .
The inspiration does not come from the flavor but comes from the way my mom makes chicken and pork adobo .
She slowly cooks the meat in vinegar and water , boils away the liquid and gently fries the meat until they are nicely browned and sometimes , crispy .
Perfect with a big heap of steaming hot rice .
Carnitas Recipe
1 - 1/2 lbs pork loin
2 strips smoked thick - cut bacon
1 large orange , or 1/3 cup fresh orange juice
2 tsp Kosher salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp onion powder
freshly ground black pepper
Cut the pork loin into 1 - to 2 - inch pieces .
Place the meat in a large pot , large enough so that the pork pieces rest in a single layer at the bottom .
Add water to just cover the meat .
Cut the bacon widthwise into 1/2 - inch strips .
Add the bacon , freshly squeezed orange juice , Kosher salt , garlic powder , onion powder , and black pepper .
Bring to a boil , reduce the heat immediately to a simmer , cover the pot , and cook gently until tender for about 2 hours .
Remove the cover , turn up the heat to medium , and allow the liquid to boil away .
Once the liquid is boiled away , turn down the heat , and fry the meat gently until they are nicely browned .
If you prefer big chunks of meat leave the pieces as they are but if you prefer them shredded then break them up using a wooden spoon .
Since pork loin is a leaner cut of meat , we like to stir in all the caramelized goodness and fat with the meat before removing the meat from the pot .
Taste a piece and season with salt and pepper if needed .
Serve these tasty carnitas on warm corn tortillas , either by themselves or with rice and beans .
Garnish with chopped onions , chopped cilantro , a slice of avocado , and a spritz of lime .
Make a quick and simple pico de gallo by chopping some tomatoes , onions , cilantro , and jalapeños ; mixing them all together and adding some lime juice .
Top your carnitas with pico de gallo and add a generous heap of easy homemade guacamole made from fresh avocados , chopped onions , chopped cilantro , cayenne powder , lime juice , and salt .
So tasty .

Venezuela ’s energy authorities and the Association of Wind Energy proposes to install in the country for the next 15 years , 10 thousand megawatts of wind power generation .
The president of the Association of Wind Energy in Venezuela , Oswaldo Ravelo said that currently are providing technical lectures at various universities in the country to promote the use of this wind energy source .
‘ We have two projects that we have submitted to the Ministry of Science and Technology , one is to make the study of all the coast to identify areas where wind can be put to future generation , and the other is to identify how much wind energy potential we have in the country , " said Ravelo .
The president of Wind Energy Association in the country adding that those 10 thousand megawatts would represent 10 % of the projected demand for 2025 , considering a growth of 6 % .
On the issue of wind energy , the Minister of People ’s Power for Electricity , Ali Rodriguez Araque , said that in Paraguana ( Falcon ) and La Guajira ( Zulia state ) studies indicate the possibility of placing up to 10 megawatts of wind power .
‘ We are preparing for the installation of wind power generation increased in Venezuela , " he said .
" These are advantages that Venezuela should take , it is not enough that we have oil , and increasingly it is not used for electricity generation and transport ‘ he said .
Also , the National Executive works in the incorporation of solar energy through photovoltaic cells in isolated areas of the country .
‘ In addition , we are studying a very ambitious project to replace all water heaters on electricity and gas , by solar , because it is absurd that in a tropical country we are consuming as much electricity and gas , " stated Rodriguez Araque .
All these plans are part of the Revolutionary Government policy to seek independence generation the country has of the Guri hydroelectric dam , which currently supplies about 70 % of the population .
The towers of the 24 wind turbines of the first wind farm in Venezuela will be installed in June and July this year , said Stella Lugo , governor of Falcon state , where the wind farm is built .
The wind farm Paraguaná will have 100 megawatts in its final phase .
The power plant is part of Venezuela policy to diversify its energy sources for electricity production , which now depends on more than 70 percent of hydropower .
Galp plans to build four wind farms in La Guajira , Isla de Coche , Isla Margarita and Chacopata , amounting to a total power of 72 MW and almost € 90 million .
Almost 4.000 kilometers of coast to the north of Venezuela are more than enough to establish wind farms , able to produce one of the cleanest types of energy .
Gamesa breaks into the Venezuelan market with the installation of 100 MW in what will be the country ’s first wind farm .
The company will supply 76 wind turbine generators to PDVSA amounting to almost € 116 million through its subsidiary MADE .
Gamesa positions itself as one of the main wind turbine suppliers in the Latin American market by closing this deal .
These wind turbines will be destined to what will become the first Venezuelan wind energy facility , located in the Paraguaná peninsula in the state of Falcón .
Through the installation of the country ’s first wind energy project , Gamesa will contribute to attaining the goal of generating clean energy in Venezuela .
This agreement , amounting to almost € 116 million , includes the supply and overseeing the installation and start - up of the wind turbine generators , along with two years of operation and maintenance .

Visa and DeviceFidelity are working to allow iPhone users to make payments by simply waving their iPhone in front of a contactless payment terminal .
The new technology , developed by DeviceFidelity and certified by Apple , combines a protective iPhone case with a secure memory card that hosts Visa ’s contactless payment application , called Visa payWave .
The technology will work for both iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G devices .
i Phone users will be able to make Visa mobile payments in retail stores , at fast food restaurants , in taxis , during sporting events , and also make purchases at vending machines that have contactless payment terminals .
Visa claims that “ thousands of merchants throughout the U.S. ” have already upgraded their payment terminals to allow consumers to make Visa mobile payments .
The technology will also work with a majority of smart phones that have a slot for a memory card .
“ By simply inserting the card into the memory slot on their phone , mobile users can transform their existing mobile phones into a Visa payment device , ” according to the company .
Visa has already rolled out a similar technology in Malaysia and Japan , where consumers can make mobile payments in stores and restaurants .
The mobile payment application can be password protected and utilizes advanced security technology to uniquely identify each contactless transaction .
In addition , all Visa mobile payments are backed by Visa ’s global processing network and analyzed for potential fraud in real - time .
If a mobile device is lost or stolen , account holders should contact their issuer , as they would if their card was lost or stolen .
The issuer can immediately deactivate the account .
Market trials of the payment - enabled iPhone are scheduled to start this summer .

While the fight for survival from relegation has ended and the title almost entirely in the hands of Chelsea all heads turn to the Eastlands for Wednesday ’s exciting match between Tottenham and Manchester City .
The 4th best defense in the Premier League , Tottenham , faces the 4th best offensive team , Manchester City as they fight till the death for 4th place and a chance to play in Champions League football next year .
Neither team has finished in the top 4 since the Premier League began back in 1992 and a win will put them in pole position to play in the Champions League next year .
Heading into Wednesday ’s match both teams have suffered injury woes to their keepers with Shay Given out with a shoulder injury and Heurelho Gomes doubtful after suffering a late groin injury in their 1 - 0 win over Bolton .
City have been rescued with the services of Márton Fülöp on loan from Sunderland whilst Tottenham have Carlo Cudicini on the bench who ’ll be ready to fill in for the injured Brazilian .
The last time these two sides met Tottenham were able to beat City 3 - 0 , but three days later Mark Hughes was sacked and the current Italian manager , Roberto Mancini , came to fill in .
Since the last game in December Manchester City has significantly changed it ’s lineup with Kolo Toure , Nigel De Jong , Adebayor and Tevez the only familiar faces from the teams last encounter .
While Tottenham have n’t really changed their roster much this year they have had a few injury woes that have held them back over the past few weeks .
Their strength rests in the depth of their roster , boasting a skillful bench with the likes of Aaron Lennon and a handful of other quality midfielders and strikers who are game changing performers .
Manchester City ’s most experienced player , Patrick Vieira , has n’t been the best in the midfield but showed some promise last week in his performance against Aston Villa .
He ’ll be hoping to keep this up and even perform better against his old rivals Tottenham .
Tottenham have had a poor away record this year only beating teams like Hull , West Ham , Portsmouth , Blackburn , Wigan and Stoke .
With 6 losses and 5 draws away Tottenham will be put to the test as they face a City side that has only lost at home to Manchester United and Everton this entire season .
However Tottenham are boasting the 4th best defense in the league with only 37 goals conceded , 6 less than City .
Manchester City on the other hand come into Wednesday ’s match with 72 goals scored this season while Tottenham have scored 64 .
With the recent performances of Gareth Bale and Luka Modric the Hotspurs have much to hope for as they try tilting the balance in their 6 - 5 - 6 away record .
The real pressure is now on Manchester City as a tie would force them to rely on Burnley to defeat the Hotspurs , so only a win will suffice the money strapped club at the Eastlands .
The match kicks off on Wednesday at 12:00 PST so make sure you watch this thriller as the seasons story reaches it ’s climax .

I almost had forgotten about the champagne mangoes ripening in a paper bag sitting on my kitchen counter .
They were leftovers from my mango - rhubarb pie the other day .
After quickly browsing through my pantry supplies , I pulled out a tub of Straus yogurt from the fridge and laid it out on the counter together with my bear - shaped Marshall ’s Farm thistle honey squeeze bottle , some cardamom and my blender , which I have n’t used in quite a while .
A sweet mango lassi would be perfect , I thought .
As I was having my lassi epiphany , I wrote a quick email to my friend , Chinmay , and asked him how he makes his .
I just wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing .
Mango Lassi with Cardamom and Honey Recipe
1 large mango , or the equivalent of 1 - 1/ 2 cups mango
1 - 1/2 cups plain yogurt
1 to 2 Tbsp honey
1 Tbsp cardamom
strawberries or raspberries for garnish
Massage your mangoes well , Chinmay said .
He instructed me to hold the top and the bottom with my left hand and use my right to massage the mango while rotating it around the top - bottom axis .
Chinmay is a chemical engineer like myself and after reading his “ top- bottom axis ” instruction I suddenly missed being a nerd .
He said that massaging the mangoes is very important because it loosens up the pulp .
How do you cut a mango ?
Champagne mangoes have long flat seeds in the center and the best way to cut them is by cutting parallel to the seed .
Using a sharp chef ’s knife , start just off the centerline and cut parallel to the seed .
If you come into contact with the pit , follow the contours of the pit and continue cutting .
You ’ll get three pieces : the pit and two so - called cheeks of mango pulp .
Using a spoon , scoop the mango pulp out of the cheeks and toss them into a blender .
Add plain yogurt .
Chinmay made it very clear to use plain unflavored yogurt .
The sweetness of the mango lassi should come from the mangoes , he said , and not from the yogurt .
Alternatively , buttermilk can be used instead of yogurt .
Add some cardamom and honey and blend everything well together in a blender .
To make a chunkier mango lassi , Chinmay recommended simply whisking the mangoes and yogurt together .
Garnish with fresh strawberries or raspberries and enjoy .
Sweet and refreshing .
This recipe makes approximately two 8 - ounce glasses of lassi .
To make more , keep the 1 - to - 1 ratio of mangoes - to - yogurt .

Doctors could soon be prescribing a dose of dark chocolate to help patients suffering from liver cirrhosis and from dangerously high blood pressure in their abdomen , according to new research presented April 15 at the International Liver CongressTM 2010 , the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Liver in Vienna , Austria .
According to the Spanish research , eating dark chocolate reduces damage to the blood vessels of cirrhotic patients and also lowers blood pressure in the liver .
Dark chocolate contains potent anti-oxidants which reduce the post - prandial ( after - meal ) blood pressure in the liver ( or portal hypertension ) associated with damaged liver blood vessels ( endothelial dysfunction ) .
The data also showed that eating dark chocolate may exert additional beneficial effects throughout the whole body .
In comparison , white chocolate , which contains no beneficial ' phytochemicals ' , did not result in the same effects .
Professor Mark Thursz , MD FRCP , Vice Secretary of EASL and Professor of Hepatology , at Imperial College London said : " As well as advanced technologies and high science , it is important to explore the potential of alternative sources which can contribute to the overall wellbeing of a patient .
This study shows a clear association between eating dark chocolate and portal hypertension and demonstrates the potential importance of improvements in the management of cirrhotic patients , to minimise the onset and impact of end stage liver disease and its associated mortality risks . "
Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver as a result of long - term , continuous damage to the liver .
In cirrhosis , circulation in the liver is damaged by oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant systems .
After eating , blood pressure in the abdominal veins usually increases due to increased blood flow to the liver .
This is particularly dangerous and damaging to cirrhotic patients as they already have increased blood pressure in the liver ( portal hypertension ) and elsewhere which , if severe , can cause blood vessel rupture .
Thus , eating dark chocolate may ultimately prevent this potential threat to cirrhotic patients .
In this study 21 cirrhotic patients with end stage liver disease ( child score 6.9±1.8 ; MELD 11±4 ; hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HPVG *) 16.6±3.8mmHg ) were randomised to receive a standard liquid meal .
Ten patients received the liquid meal containing dark chocolate ( containing 85 % cocoa , 0.55g of dark chocolate / Kg of body weight ) while 11 patients received the liquid meal containing white chocolate which is devoid of cocoa flavonoids ( anti- oxidant properties ) according to body weight .
HVPG , arterial pressure and portal blood flow ( PBF ) ** were measured at baseline and 30 minutes after meal administration , using a US - Doppler .
Both meals caused a highly significant but similar increase in portal blood flow with a + 24 % increase in dark chocolate compared to +34 % in those patients who received white chocolate .
Interestingly , post - prandial hyperaemia *** was accompanied by an increase in HVPG resulting in a statistically significant increase ( 17.3±3.6mmHg to 19.1±2.6mmHg , p=0.07 ) for those patients eating dark chocolate and those receiving white chocolate ( 16.0±4.7mmHg to 19.7±4.1mmHg , p=0.003 ) .
Post - prandial increase in HVPG was markedly reduced in patients receiving dark chocolate ( +10.3±16.3 % Vs +26.3±12.7 % , p=0.02 ) .
* HVPG is blood pressure in the liver
**PBF refers to blood flow in the liver
*** Hyperaemia refers to increase blood flow to tissues

In the ongoing financial crisis in Ashtabula County , the Sheriff ’s Department has been cut from 112 to 49 deputies .
With deputies assigned to transport prisoners , serve warrants and other duties , only one patrol car is assigned to patrrol the entire county of 720 square miles .
“ I did the best with what they ( the county commissioners ) gave me .
If it was n’t enough , do n’t blame me , do n’t blame this department , ” said Sheriff Billy Johnson .
Johnson said he is suing the commissioners to get a determination of whether he should use his limited budget to carry out obligations defined by law or put more patrol cars on the streets .
“ I just ca n’t do it anymore , ” he said .
“ I have to have the court explain to the commissioners and to me what my statutory duties are . ”
The Ashtabula County Jail has confined as many as 140 prisoners .
It now houses only 30 because of reductions in the staff of corrections officers .
All told , 700 accused criminals are on a waiting list to serve time in the jail .
Are there dangerous people free among the 700 who can not be locked up ?
“ There probably are , ” Sheriff Johnson said , “ but I ’m telling you , any known violent criminal , we ’re housing them .
We ’ve got murderers in there . ”
Ashtabula County is the largest county in Ohio by land area .
Ashtabula County Common Pleas Judge Alfred Mackey was asked what residents should do to protect themselves and their families with the severe cutback in law enforcement .
“ Arm themselves , ” the judge said .
“ Be very careful , be vigilant , get in touch with your neighbors , because we ’re going to have to look after each other . ”
Ashtabula County gun dealers and firearms instructors tell WKYC their business has really picked up since the Sheriff ’s Department cutbacks began some months ago .
“ That ’s exactly why they are coming , so that they can protect themselves , ” says Tracy Williams , a certified firearms instructor in Jefferson .
“ They do n’t feel that they are protected .
They want to be able to protect themselves . ”
Williams says interest in his classes has doubled recently , and many of those coming are people who he would not normally expect to have interest in obtaining a concealed carry permit .

Given the recent commentary about the reforms proposed for the news media sector , you would be forgiven for thinking Google and Facebook are the only game in town .

The planned reforms arose from last year ’s Digital Platforms Inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) , which focused squarely on the corporate behaviour of these two tech behemoths .
It is clear Google and Facebook will be the first platforms regulated under the draft mandatory code that will potentially force them to pay for content produced by Australian news media companies .
The move is a response to what the ACCC describes as “ a significant bargaining power imbalance [ … ] between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook ” .
This idea that news companies are essentially stuck with Google and Facebook , for better or worse , is a common view .
Yet while that might have been true a few years ago , media companies are realising there are other ways to cultivate readers , and there ’s no need to be beholden to tech platforms that generate clicks but do n’t want to pay for the privilege .
In the mid-2010s , many news companies seemed to follow Facebook ’s every move .
When Facebook promoted video , the media invested in video .
When it down - ranked clickbait headlines , content writers frantically altered their style to maintain their presence in the news feed .
Newsrooms have had a similarly dependent ( albeit less direct ) relationship with Google .
The focus on adapting to Google and Facebooks ’s algorithms completely changed newsroom practices over the past decade , as journalists have weighed editorial considerations against audience metrics .
Is this still the case ?
This dependency developed at a time when major platforms , particularly Facebook , were engaging substantially with the distribution of news .
But in recent years this trend has declined , as governments have begun to regulate platforms in response to concerns over “ fake news ” .
Facebook performed perhaps the most public pivot , changing its algorithm in January 2018 to promote content from users ’ friends and family .
As a result , traffic to news sites fell , leaving profit - starved media companies to pursue alternative strategies or simply lay off staff .
In our research , published earlier this year , we spoke to 15 Australian journalists and editors who had collectively worked across 11 media companies after the dust had settled from the 2019 crisis .
We asked them whether their companies still depend on Facebook for traffic , or whether they have moved to other platforms , or are now doing something else entirely to cultivate their readership .
Breaking up with Facebook
Many respondents , particularly those who had worked at newer companies focused on social media , revealed they had followed the demands of the Facebook algorithm at times .
They had pivoted to video and had focused on share counts .
However , respondents working at older media companies also noted that lots of readers still visited their publication ’s home page , which challenges the idea that companies depend totally on Facebook .
Companies were also exploring different ways of generating revenue .
These included placing ads inside content ( known as native advertising ) and holding events .
The standout trend , however , was a renewed focus on subscriptions , ensuring that a certain percentage of readers actually paid money for the news product at some point .
The Conversation ( which does not charge for access to its content ) was one of the newsrooms that saw a steep drop in traffic as a result of the January 2018 algorithm change .
As such , it has pivoted its digital strategy to prioritise the channels over which it has the most control , particularly its daily newsletter .
That ’s not to say companies have stopped trying to engage with big platforms .
Many are consciously trying to make their news easy to find via Google search ( a process called search engine optimisation .
Some companies ( including The Conversation ) have also begun distributing news through Instagram ( which is owned by Facebook ) .
Yet although the big platforms are doubtless here to stay , our research reveals a distinctly changed relationship between news and social media , compared with the past decade .
Many companies , particularly newer ones like Buzzfeed and Vice , previously built huge audiences off the back of social media , and grew at a dizzying rate as a result .
Now , companies are more interested in securing a stable revenue stream than in harvesting clicks .
The pandemic effect
This has become even more important amid the economic chaos caused by COVID - 19 .
Advertising spending has dried up , leading to another round of media industry layoffs .
This suggests news media are still struggling to secure an alternative income stream to plug the hole in advertising revenue .
The big question is whether big tech platforms will step in and help fill the gap by making financial contributions to news providers .
Google ’s current campaign against the draft mandatory code suggests they are deeply unwilling to do this .
Our research shows the relationship between news media and big tech platforms is far from straightforward .
This is supported by a recent survey , which found that while many young people access news through social media , older people still prefer television or news websites .
Not every Australian gets their news via social media .
There may come a time when platforms become the central access point for news , but it has n’t happened yet .
This does n’t mean the ACCC should abandon platform regulation , but it does mean news companies are probably wise to find other ways of reaching their readers while they still can .

The Financial Crisis and the Scientific Mindset
Paul J. Cella III
In the last two years , the American political economy has undergone extraordinary transformations .
The attempt to understand them will surely occupy economists , political scientists , historians , and many others for decades to come ; it will be the work of generations .
But already from today ’s vantage , the shape of what went wrong is becoming clear , and the dangers posed by the U.S. response to the financial crisis are now visible in outline .
Looking back , one of the striking revelations of the past two years of recession is that the pattern of real - estate development and capital investment in America has been driven for two decades and more by a very peculiar system of finance — one that depends on an intricate infrastructure of speculative debt ; one that is enabled by modern technology and wedded to abstraction and formula ; and one that , it turns out , can only be maintained , in a pinch , by intervention from the state .
And how the state has intervened .
Faced with a horrifying cascade of failure in financial markets , much of it related to the bursting of a housing bubble , policymakers chose to substitute for the private capital that once financed real - estate development the public capital of the commonwealth .
The schemes by which government managed its rescue of speculative finance bewilder the mind : liquidity facilities and capital injections and quantitative easing , weird acronyms in dizzying abundance — TARP , TALF , CPFF , AMLF — and a thousand other arcane techniques .
Taken as a whole , these interventions constitute a kind of technocratic revolution in capitalism , and a decisive step toward socialism in the United States .
But it is a curious socialism , concentrated in the labyrinth of financial engineering , and manifesting itself above all in the socialization of much of the risk associated with this engineering .
So how did we get to the point where the experiment of an advanced capitalist economy suddenly shorn of its finance system was a real and pressing possibility ?
How did the prosperity and liberty of our land become hitched to the peculiar system of high finance that grew up in the past quarter century , and that nearly flew to pieces before our eyes ?
The Wreck of Shadow Banking
Partly this is a tale of the failure of a particular system of debt finance .
More deeply , it is a narrative of the failure of the modern mind , for much of the reckless grandiosity of modern technological civilization is evident in the peculiar features of the finance crisis .
In that sense we might say that shadow banking is a synecdoche for modern technological hubris .
What is shadow banking ?
It is one of a handful of terms — structured finance is a more technical one , ghostly economics a more evocative one — used to describe the infrastructure of debt finance that provided the conduits for capital from around the world to flow into the American housing sector .
It is best understood as a technological innovation amalgamating computing power and probabilistic modeling to vastly expand the various world markets in debt securities .
The late journalist Mark Pittman , in an authoritative 2008 report for Bloomberg , called it “ the biggest U.S. export business of the twenty - first century , ” a “ made - in - America technology ” that world financiers “ coveted ” and emulated , “ much as consumers around the world craved other emblems of American ingenuity from Coca - Cola to Hollywood movies . ”
Shadow banking , Pittman explained ,
funds most of the world ’s credit cards , car purchases , leveraged buyouts and , for a while , subprime mortgages .
The system , which pools loans and slices up the risk of default , made borrowing cheaper for everyone , creating a debt culture that put credit cards in wallets from Seoul to São Paulo and enabled people to buy luxury cars and homes .
It also pumped out record profits for banks , accounting for as much as one - fifth of their revenue over the last decade .
A shadow bank is a financial institution operating outside the heavy regulation of the traditional banking sector , but basically doing the same thing that traditional banks do : borrowing short and lending long .
The crucial feature is that it mostly functions off balance sheet , outside the regulatory apparatus , and out of sight of those not actively working in it .
It is , in Pittman ’s words , “ a method of lending without using capital , ” which “ works by taking anything that has regular payments — mortgages , car loans , aircraft leases , music royalties — and channeling the money to a trust that pays bondholders principal and interest . ”
The capture of these payments by advanced probabilistic modeling is known as securitization , and forms the shadowy or ghostly character of this business .
By a wide variety of complicated artifices , future payments are converted into present value , with little capital expended in these machinations , and plenty of fees extracted .
There is some irony in the fact that this wild and unregulated industry made its best profits by means of facilitating the flow of capital into U.S. housing , a sector of the economy which has for generations featured extensive and elaborate — and largely unapologetic — government meddling .
Since at least the New Deal , it has been a sustained policy of both parties to encourage and subsidize home ownership .
In a sense , we might say that the debacle of 2008 combined the ruin of both a heavily regulated sector with a history of constant state intervention and a largely unregulated sector with a history of exuberant inventiveness .
So capital generated from a kind of globalized field of laissez - faire brashness was plowed into the stolid old housing sector , long the beneficiary of state support .
In addition to the usual players in the housing sector — the regional banks , the massive financial conglomerates , the government - sponsored enterprises — this was also accomplished through the shadow banks .
Shadow banking also involves big industrial firms that few would normally think of as finance giants .
These institutions make use of their top credit rating to carry on a brisk trade in certain classes of debt security , or derivatives on said securities .
By 2008 , these corporations had realized such massive profits on their shadow banking operations that it is not too much to say that they had become huge unregulated banks , with auxiliary industrial arms attached to them .
According to James Stewart , writing in The New Yorker , even the Secretary of the Treasury did not know of the high - tech bank run on one such institution , American International Group , Inc. , only three days before a collapse at that firm so calamitous as to force the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to nationalize it at extraordinary cost .
A similar high - tech bank run nearly brought General Electric to grief six months later .
Neither A.I.G. nor G.E. is a bank in the traditional sense of the term .
Yet they played ( or , in the case of G.E. , still play ) an indispensable role in the infrastructure of world bond markets .
Shadow banking compromised the integrity of the ratings agencies — Moody ’s , Standard & Poor ’s , Fitch .
There may have been flat - out corruption in some cases .
These firms are entrusted to rate the credit - worthiness of bond issuers .
From their ratings interest rates on debt securities are derived .
In the case of structured finance , these agencies in many instances appear to have basically sold their imprimatur in exchange for lucre from the shadow bankers .
Shadow banking also involves the almost impenetrable trade in credit derivatives , instruments confected out of mathematical abstractions and probability models on the credit risk of an underlying bond .
The story of how a single formula devised by a Chinese - born actuary would be applied by financiers operating in the credit derivatives market with such abandon as to expose the entire infrastructure of high finance to ruin is useful as an exemplar .
All of Wall Street — all of world finance , even — hinged on this man ’s formula for risk assessment , which relied on data from the market for the instrument known as the credit - default swap .
The formula appeared truly to bring order out of chaos ; by its power , the nettlesome ingredient of uncertainty seemed to retreat toward a vanishing point .
In a “ brilliant spark of mathematical legerdemain , ” as finance journalist Felix Salmon put it in Wired magazine , the formula “ made it possible for traders to sell vast quantities ” of new debt instruments , “ expanding financial markets to unimaginable levels . ”
From this and other tricks was our new system of ghostly economics constructed — “ an imaginary universe of known probability distributions , ” as business professor Amar Bhidé , a visiting scholar at Harvard , acidly described it in Critical Review .
This system eventually became the conduit for gigantic sums of global capital flowing into American investments .
Indeed , shadow banking is inextricably tied to globalization .
Capital poured from all around the world , from Europe and China and small - town pension funds in distant lands , into ( among other things ) the U.S. real - estate market , all chasing fractionally higher yields on debt instruments .
Losses on U.S. mortgage - backed securities literally bankrupted Icelandic banks and little Norwegian and Australian towns .
The ghostly economics involved a mathematical device called “ tranching , ” whereby massive collateralized securities were sliced into categories of risk , the better for marketing , and repackaged for sale .
Throw a handful of investment - grade bonds in with a mass of junk bonds , repackage it as a new security , and the ratings firms could be expected to stamp it a AAA instrument .
The layman may perhaps be forgiven for interpreting this as analogous to shaking a bit of sugar over a pile of rotten fruit and selling it as candy .
Shadow banking was conducive , too , to wild and ruthless speculative runs , by permitting a kind of end - run around the regulatory controls on the practice of naked short selling .
If investors thought a firm might be on the verge of failure , they could go out into the credit derivatives market and purchase instruments like the credit - default swap , which pays out , as the name implies , in the event of default .
The exotic intricacies of ghostly economics proliferated over the past few decades .
Much of it proved , contrary to learned expectation , to be strangely fragile when the going got rough .
Wall Street managed to develop whole fields of real - estate finance speculation so divorced from actual real estate as to require advanced mathematical training in order to really grasp the connection .
The Wall Street mathematicians — or “ quants , ” as they have been dubbed — understood the tenuous connection between their pristine equations and gritty reality , but their managers and employers seemed not to , and built mountains of speculation that could not be borne by private capital .
When the formulas failed , when the derivatives trade spun out of control and firms faced collateral calls in excess of a large state ’s annual budget , public capital would have to ride to the rescue .
All this amounted to an enormous and ruinous breakdown of modern financial infrastructure , from the most basic theory to the latest exotic product .
The grandest sophistication of our sophisticated civilization came unglued .
For several weeks , the wreck of shadow banking looked like it just might drag the country into a painful depression .
To escape this fate , policymakers and central bankers commenced with interventions into the private economy on an unprecedented scale .
The Error Concerning Property
At the back of the labyrinthine complexities of the financial crisis resides a particular cast of mind .
That modern finance failed is plain enough , but it is not too much to say that the modern mind itself broke down .
What deeper failures of the mind does the failure of finance disclose ?
First , there is an error about property ; next , there is an error about man .
It will be useful to examine them separately , though in truth they derive from the same source , and together they compose an extraordinary and ruinous instance of the overreach of Rationalism .
At the very heart of the crisis and the subsequent bailouts is the elegant excellence of the engineered abstraction , produced by mathematical brilliance and computing capacity .
All the messy variations of human activity in the area of real - estate finance could , seemingly , be brought under the reliable authority of graceful formulas .
Every wager could be safely hedged , once the appropriate calculations were run .
The modern mind broke down on account of its infatuation with abstraction .
That mind is singularly susceptible to falsely imagining that ideas are more real than men .
The power of the lapidary theory over the modern mind has been often remarked .
The whole of the twentieth century was marked by calamitous wars driven by the imperial impulse of what Edmund Burke called “ armed doctrines . ”
Armies , impelled by their doctrines , rolled over half the earth , leaving behind blood and smolders .
In finance , this failure of the modern mind , its subjection to the allure of formula and abstraction , took on another aspect : the reduction of property to mathematical abstraction .
The nature of property itself seemed to transform under the influence of these abstractions .
The old and familiar debt instrument known as a mortgage is already an abstraction from real physical property .
Pooling these instruments into complicated securities is another step of abstraction .
And , in still further steps of abstraction , probabilities concerning default rates on property debt were converted into revenue streams that could be securitized .
Credit - default swaps were rolled into new revenue streams and resold .
Collateralized debt obligations were “ squared . ”
Little fragments of land and housing , from neighborhoods of enormous variety all across the country , were converted by statistical abstraction into an unfathomable infrastructure of debt securities .
The complexity of these securities exceeds the power of the unaided human mind ; formulas and models are necessary to apply probability rules to such enormous data sets .
Property was transfigured , with help from computers , into equations .
It is all very bewildering , this enfolding web of abstraction and statistical capture .
A friend of mine who knows it backwards and forwards speaks of it , with a touch of mockery , as “ rocket science ” finance .
Of the week that rocket science failed , he said to me , “ Imagine you woke up and the sky was green instead of blue . ”
Or again : “ What if you looked , and found that the sun was rising in the west ? ”
No doubt our ironists , when they manage to get their minds around it , will have plenty of fun at the expense of the quants whose devilish formulas brought finance to its knees .
By the end , finance capitalism had produced something awful and enervating — an extraordinary attenuation of the human roots of prosperity , property and capital .
It turned property into a ghost , and midwifed the incursion of government into private enterprise on an unprecedented scale .
And so the reckless risks of Wall Street have been socialized , and our economy transformed , due in part to our own intellectual subjugation to the sirens ’ song of abstraction , by which property is turned into revenue into securities .
Absent the mesmerizing power of elegant formula and computational capacity on the modern mind , it is doubtful that a market in exotic abstractions with such attenuated attachment to real property would have even been conceivable , much less that it would grow to such size as to expose world finance to annihilation .
The trigger for what is being called the Great Recession was a globalization of the bank run , amplified by the ghostly economics of abstraction , formula , and computing power .
The Error Concerning Man
Wall Street trusted probabilistic abstraction in lieu of that older method of investment , which operates , as Professor Bhidé puts it , according to “ subjective judgments in the holistic manner of a common - law judge , ” who considers “ all the relevant precedents and features of the case at hand , ” and anticipates “ the possibility of mistake and ignorance . ”
A newfangled machine of “ blind diversification , ” facilitated by the faith in technical mastery , replaced the ancient sanity of humility before the unfamiliar .
Here we touch upon the second error the modern mind evinced in the financial crisis : a misunderstanding of human being .
It is foolish in the extreme to ever imagine that any mathematical formula , no matter how subtle , can properly capture the mystery that is man .
This is the simple wisdom that modern finance forgot .
Our mental imaginings and computations , no matter how precise , are but approximations of the real world as it is .
Our perception , even aided by machines and computers , is strictly limited .
Our technical capacity is considerable , but there is still much that is beyond us .
Wall Street , at the very pinnacle of financial engineering , came to believe that derivatives on statistical abstractions were more real than men — and certainly more real than their houses .
The financiers supposed that the economics of man can be perfectly figured by formula , by imitating the computation and abstraction of hard science .
The political philosopher Michael Oakeshott set down a memorable sketch of this frame of mind in his famous essay “ Rationalism in Politics . ”
If an inappropriate and extreme Rationalism was pervasive in the late 1940s , when Oakeshott put pen to paper , it is all the more so today — especially given the prestige we have granted to computers and probability modeling .
The Rationalist “ has no sense of the cumulation of experience , ” Oakeshott writes , “ only of the readiness of experience when it has been converted into a formula . ”
Eschewing “ the customary and the traditional , ” the Rationalist prefers “ formalized abridgment ” ; “ the character which the Rationalist claims for himself is the character of the engineer , whose mind ( it is supposed ) is controlled throughout by the appropriate technique and whose first step is to dismiss from his attention everything not directly related to his specific intentions . ”
The essence of Rationalism is “ the sovereignty of technique ” ; and the history of Rationalism is “ the history of the invasion of every department of intellectual activity by the doctrine of the sovereignty of technique . ”
Few departments of intellectual activity are more vulnerable to this invasion than finance capitalism .
The Rationalist ’s engineering mindset at the heights of finance fashioned “ formalized abridgments ” of human activity , which in time came to dominate the infrastructure of finance .
These abridgments commanded a deep respect and trust among financiers ; and as the empire of finance spread across the economies of the West with remarkable ease , the abridgments became the very undergirding of Western prosperity .
At the summit of finance capitalism , the precepts of Rationalism reigned : “ The superiority of the unencumbered intellect lay precisely in the fact that it could reach more , and more certain , knowledge about man and society than was otherwise possible . ”
Nowhere , perhaps , was this trust in “ more certain knowledge about man and society ” more potent — and ultimately more disastrously misguided — than in the London office of A.I.G. , where financiers commenced to write credit - default swaps on everything that moved .
As the finance journalist Michael Lewis put it in Vanity Fair , “ In a financial system that was rapidly generating complicated risks , [ the A.I.G. Financial Products unit in London ] became a huge swallower of those risks . ”
For a time this business was immensely profitable , but at back of it was the Rationalist faith in formalized abridgments , in experience transformed into formula .
No one , it seems , imagined a financial disruption of a scale sufficient to degrade the value of all the underlying securities attached to the swaps , thus forcing the colossal collateral calls and default events which laid waste this titan of American industry .
When the abridgments of experience and tradition proved deficient , Rationalism was undone .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury had to construct a rescue under extreme duress ; and the result is that now the objective observer will search in vain to discover an aspect of real - estate - related finance that is not in some way supported , cosseted , or protected from disaster by the state .
The Ruin of Rationalism
But the disgrace of Wall Street did not really discredit Rationalism .
To some extent , it has been insulated from popular critique by the very complexity of its machinations : it is extraordinarily difficult for the layman to pick apart the arcana of high finance , and indeed , even initiates often fail to grasp the whole .
But just as importantly , the fullness of the failure of Rationalism , the breakdown of the supposed sovereignty of technique , has been masked by government intervention .
Flailing finance availed itself of the instruments of the state , having learned from lesser crises that it could expect rescue .
Charles Gasparino of CNBC has written of “ three decades of subsidized risk , ” by which he means that for a generation and more finance capitalism has rested on the coddling support of government .
As he puts it , “ nearly to the minute he was forced to file for bankruptcy , former Lehman CEO Dick Fuld believed the government would n’t let Lehman die .
After all , government largess had always been there in the past . ”
The industries of banking , investment banking , shadow banking , structured finance , mortgage finance , securitization , commercial paper , whole swaths of the simpler bond markets — they are now , in effect , socialized .
Even when the exceptional Federal Reserve and Treasury operations roll to a stop , as they have already begun to , can anyone in his right mind doubt that they will rev back into motion the moment a new crisis calls for them ?
This symbiosis of speculative finance and state bailout — the expectation that , off at the end , the government will be there to save us from our folly — is fairly labeled a kind of technocratic despotism .
Has there ever in history been such an astonishing dedication of public resources to rescue what is , at base , a misapprehension about what it means to own property and what it means to be man ?
Economics blogger Steve Randy Waldman has given this dreary despotism perhaps its most concise articulation : “ When credit expansion reaches its natural limit , let the debtors default , but make creditors whole with new money .
‛ Moral hazard , ’ rather than a problem , is the goal of the operation . ”
Without the reckoning of full failure — the public acknowledgement that abstraction and abbreviation overreached — the fundamentally mistaken mindset that undid Wall Street has not been discredited .
That mindset , unchastened , will again dominate finance capitalism .
It will crowd out that spirit of free enterprise that has been the glory of our Republic .
For having once been so massively bailed out by the American taxpayer , Wall Street will know that its next breakdown , too , will be relieved by the rapid intercession of the benevolent state .
Babies know the difference between good and evil at six months , study reveals
At the age of six months babies can barely sit up - let along take their first tottering steps , crawl or talk .
But , according to psychologists , they have already developed a sense of moral code - and can tell the difference between good and evil .
An astonishing series of experiments is challenging the views of many psychologists and social scientists that human beings are born as ' blank slates ' - and that our morality is shaped by our parents and experiences .
Good rabbit , bad rabbit : Simple experiments involving babies have shown that we have a strong morality instinct from an early age
Instead , they suggest that the difference between good and bad may be hardwired into the brain at birth .
In one experiment involving puppets , babies aged six months old showed a strong preference to ' good ' helpful characters - and rejected unhelpful , ' naughty ' ones .
In another , they even acted as judge and jury .
When asked to take away treats from a ' naughty ' puppet , some babies went further - and dished out their own punishment with a smack on its head .
Leading research : Professor Paul Bloom , of Yale University , said a series of morality tales featuring puppets were shown to babies of varying ages
Professor Paul Bloom , a psychologist at Yale University in Connecticut , whose department has studied morality in babies for years , said : ' A growing body of evidence suggests that humans do have a rudimentary moral sense from the very start of life .
' With the help of well designed experiments , you can see glimmers of moral thought , moral judgment and moral feeling even in the first year of life .
' Some sense of good and evil seems to be bred in the bones . '
For one study , the Yale researchers got babies aged between six months and a year to watch a puppet show in which a simple , colourful wooden shape with eyes tries to climb a hill .
Sometimes the shape is helped up the hill by a second toy , while other times a third character pushes it down .
After watching the show several times , the babies were shown the helpful and unhelpful toys .
They showed a clear preference for the helpful toys - spending far longer looking at the ' good ' shapes than the ' bad ' ones .
' In the end , we found that six - and ten - month - old infants overwhelmingly preferred the helpful individual to the hindering individual , ' Prof Bloom told the New York Times .
' This was n't a subtle statistical trend ; just about all the babies reached for the good guy . '
Two more tests found the same moral sense .
In one , the researchers devised a ' one - act morality play ' , in which a toy dog tries to open a box .
The dog is joined by a teddy bear who helps him lift the lid , and a teddy who stubbornly sits on the box .
They also made the babies watch a puppet cat play ball with two toy rabbits .
When the cat rolled the ball to one rabbit , it rolled the ball straight back .
But when the cat rolled it to the second rabbit , it picked up the ball and ran off .
' In both studies , five - month - old babies preferred the good guy - the one who helped to open the box ; the one who rolled the ball back - to the bad guy , ' said Professor Bloom .
When the same tests were repeated with 21 - month - old babies , they were given a chance to dish out treats to the toys - or take treats away .
Most toddlers punished the ' naughty rabbit ' by taking away treats .
One even gave the miscreant a smack on the head as a punishment .
Although the studies appear to show that morality is hard - wired into babies brains , some psychologists urged caution .
Dr Nadja Reissland , of Durham University , said babies started to learn the difference between good and bad from birth .
' Everything hinges on who decides what is normal , ' she said .
' By saying pushing the ball up the hill is helpful , the researchers are making a moral judgement .
The babies might just prefer to see things go up rather than down .
' In the other test , perhaps the bear closes the box to prevent the dog from getting in there because there is something dangerous inside .
It is like a mother keeping children out of an area where there is something harmful . '
PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana ( Reuters ) - U.S. scientists will embark on a second mission on Tuesday to investigate whether a catastrophic Gulf of Mexico oil spill is damaging deepwater marine life and the surrounding environment .
Samantha Joye , a University of Georgia marine sciences professor who is part of the research team , said the two - week government - funded mission will focus on a plume of dispersed oil that she says is from the leaking BP undersea well .
The plume , which is roughly 20 miles long , six miles wide , and 100 feet thick , was discovered by the R.V. Pelican , a research ship , on its first mission .
Tests showed that about 30 percent of the oxygen in the plume has been depleted , which could threaten marine life -- mussels , clams , crabs , eels , jellyfish , shrimp and even sharks .
“ It appears to be radiating from the spill site , so that ’s why we think it ’s a mixture of emulsified or dispersed oil , little oil fragments that are generated by the actual eruption of the fluid from the sea floor , ” Joye said in an interview with Reuters .
She said she was “ 99.8 percent sure ” the plume , first spotted as “ deep hydrographic anomalies ” , was spill - related and said it was quite possible that other , smaller , plumes existed .
“ We need to go out there and track and map the plume features and see how they are changing with time .
Is oxygen dropping and if so , how fast ?
Is it microbial activity that is causing that , ” Joye said .
Another unknown is the exact composition of the plume and the extent to which dispersants , sprayed and pumped into the water by BP to break up the oil , were changing its chemistry , she said .
London - based BP says it could try on Wednesday to shut off the well that has caused a major U.S. ecological disaster , threatening fishing communities in four states , and has also stirred a political storm since it blew out last month .
‘ DEAD ZONE ’ IN WATER ?
Eleven scientists from universities in Mississippi , Georgia , North Carolina and California will embark on the Pelican , which will depart from Gulfport , Mississippi and join six other research vessels working in the Gulf .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has five such vessels in the area .
NOAA , a federal agency , said the Pelican mission ’s initial findings were premature , in what some critics said appeared to be part of a concerted effort to play down the environmental impact of the leak .
BP for weeks also maintained that determining the precise rate at which oil was gushing into the sea mattered little compared to its efforts to stop the flow , leading to criticism that it was trying to avoid accountability for what could be the biggest oil spill in U.S. history .
Images of oil washing onto beaches and coating entire islands in Louisiana ’s fragile wetlands , as well as those of birds covered in oil , have highlighted the environmental threat posed by the leak .
But undersea damage , though it remains invisible , could be equally costly , according to Joye .
One likely cause of the depleted oxygen in the plume is the increased activity of microorganisms chewing up the oil and gas in the water , and the danger is the creation of an anoxic , or dead , zone in the water .
“ That would kill anything that ca n’t run from it , ” said Joye , who said the scientists are racing to catch up with what was effectively a lost first month after the leak began .
Little if any light penetrates at depths of 2,625 - 4,593 feet where the plume is located .
A further planned voyage in August and September will try to determine how far the plume has affected the food web .

Yet Palinspeak still differs from statements like Brownback ’s in degree .
It ’s a rather extreme case — an almost instructive distillation of the difference in public conceptions of language in Charles Eaton and Robert Byrd ’s time versus our own .
“ Folksy ” is only the beginning of it — “ You betcha , ” - in for -ing , and “ Say it ai n’t so , Joe ! ” during her debate with Joseph Biden indeed make her sound accessible , ordinary , unpretentious .
This , however , is America as a whole , and no one should be shocked that a public figure would strike this note .
“ You betcha ” hits the same chord in Palin ’s fans as the equally folksy — and close to meaningless -- “ Yes , We Can ” intoned in a preacherly “ black ” way did when a certain someone else was saying it .
Folksy is America ; it always has been , but is especially so now .
What truly distinguishes Palin ’s speech is its utter subjectivity : that is , she speaks very much from the inside of her head , as someone watching the issues from a considerable distance .
The there fetish , for instance — Palin frequently displaces statements with an appended “ there , ” as in “ We realize that more and more Americans are starting to see the light there ... ”
But where ?
Why the distancing gesture ?
At another time , she referred to Condoleezza Rice trying to “ forge that peace . ”
That peace ?
You mean that peace way over there — as opposed to the peace that you as Vice - President would have been responsible for forging ?
She ’s far , far away from that peace .
All of us use there and that in this way in casual speech — it ’s a way of placing topics as separate from us on a kind of abstract “ desktop ” that the conversation encompasses .
“ The people in accounting down there think they can just .... ”
But Palin , doing this even when speaking to the whole nation , is no further outside of her head than we are when talking about what ’s going on at work over a beer .
The issues , American people , you name it , are “ there ” — in other words , not in her head 24 / 7 .
She has n’t given them much thought before ; they are not her .
They ’re that , over there .
This reminds me of toddlers who speak from inside their own experience in a related way : they will come up to you and comment about something said by a neighbor you ’ve never met , or recount to you the plot of an episode of a TV show they have no way of knowing you ’ve ever heard of .
Palin strings her words together as if she were doing it for herself — meanings float by , and she translates them into syntax in whatever way works , regardless of how other people making public statements do it .
There ’s a fine line between crazy and entrepreneurial .
If you bark at the moon to make it go away , you are considered crazy .
But if you start a business for which there is less than a 5 % chance of success , you are considered an entrepreneur .
If you feel the need to turn a light switch on and off exactly seven times before leaving a room , you have OCD .
If you need to run exactly five miles every day before breakfast to feel right , you are considered disciplined and athletic .
On one hand , it is clearly different to engage in activities that have no practical value versus ones that do .
Or ones that might .
But what if the reason you engage in practical activities has nothing to do with your ability to reason , and everything to do with being lucky that your particular brand of crazy has some utility ?
That blurs the line .
I often think I was one lucky break away from being the crazy uncle who could n’t stop drawing pictures .
For me , drawing was as much a compulsion as a career decision .
From my earliest age , I drew on everything that would stand still .
It ’s an extraordinary bit of luck that my compulsion turned out to be practice .
Warren Buffett modestly says he was lucky that his brain is wired in a way that suits the times .
A few hundred years ago he would have been the crazy peasant who was always talking about ways to increase crop production if only he had the capital .
A Muslim , a Christian , and a crazy guy walk into a room .
The one thing you can know for sure is that at least two out of three of them organize their lives around things that are n’t real .
And that ’s the best case scenario .
Atheists would say all three have some explaining to do .
And atheists are the minority , which is the very definition of abnormal .
My wife and I often have very different recollections of events .
And not just the little details .
Sometimes our shared memories do n’t even feature the same mammals , themes , or points .
The scary part is that we do n’t realize these differences until we have some reason to compare memories , which does n’t come up that often .
Every now and then there will some independent way to verify whose memory is accurate , and it is sobering to discover how many of the problems are on my end .
A lot of my so - called life is apparently a patchwork of delusions .
The best you can hope for in this life is that your delusions are benign and your compulsions have utility .

When it comes to a toothache , the brain does n’t discriminate .
A new imaging study shows that to the brain , a painful upper tooth feels a lot like a painful lower tooth .
The results , which will be published in the journal Pain , help explain why patients are notoriously bad at pinpointing a toothache .
For the most part , humans are exquisitely tuned to pain .
The brain can immediately distinguish between a splinter in the index finger and a paper cut on the thumb , even though the digits are next - door neighbors .
But in the mouth this can be more difficult , depending where and how intense the ache is .
“ We do n’t know much about tooth pain , ” comments dentist and neuroscientist Alexandre DaSilva of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who was not part of the new research .
The new study is one of the first to address the puzzle of toothache localization , he says .
In the study , researchers led by Clemens Forster of the University of Erlangen - Nuremberg in Germany analyzed brain activity in healthy — and brave — volunteers as they experienced tooth pain .
The researchers delivered short electrical pulses to either the upper left canine tooth ( the pointy one ) or the lower left canine tooth in the subjects .
These bursts of electrical stimulation produced a painful sensation similar to that felt when biting into an ice cube , Forster says , and were tuned such that the subject always rated the pain to be about 60 percent , with 100 percent being the worst pain imaginable .
To see how the brain responds to pain emanating from different teeth , the researchers used fMRI to monitor changes in activity when the upper tooth or the lower tooth was zapped .
“ At the beginning , we expected a good difference , but that was not the case , ” Forster says .
Many brain regions responded to top and bottom tooth pain — carried by signals from two distinct branches of a fiber called the trigeminal nerve — in the same way .
The V2 branch carries pain signals from the upper jaw , and the V3 branch carries pain signals from the lower jaw .
In particular , the researchers found that regions in the cerebral cortex , including the somatosensory cortex , the insular cortex and the cingulate cortex , all behaved similarly for both toothaches .
These brain regions are known to play important roles in the pain projection system , yet none showed major differences between the two toothaches .
“ The activation was more or less the same , ” Forster says , although he adds that their experiments might have missed subtle differences that could account for why some tooth pain can be localized .
Because the same regions were active in both toothaches , the brain — and the person — could n’t tell where the pain was coming from .
“ Dentists should be aware that patients are n’t always able to locate the pain , ” Forster says .
“ There are physiological and anatomical reasons for that . ”
DaSilva agrees that the brain ’s inability to tell top - tooth pain from bottom - tooth pain “ pairs really well with what we see in the clinic . ”
Understanding the pathway from tooth to brain may help researchers devise better treatments for acute tooth pain , such as cavities or infections , and more - chronic conditions , DaSilva says .
One such condition is phantom pain that persists in the mouth after a tooth has been removed .

The Family Court has approved the sterilisation of an 11 - year - old girl .
Family Court judge Paul Cronin found that the performance of a hysterectomy on the child , identified only as Angela , was " in the child 's best interests " .
Angela has Rett syndrome , making her profoundly disabled and unable to talk or use sign language .
The court , sitting in Brisbane , heard that Angela acted in a similar way to a three - month - old baby .
She has to be fed and cared for and has no bladder control .
This story appears in the May 3 issue of ESPN The Magazine .
Shortly after Roy Halladay 's second National League at - bat resulted in a 35 - foot RBI single , Phillies manager Charlie Manuel got the idea to take a stroll to the other end of the dugout to have a brief chat with his newest power hitter .
Partway there , Manuel took a look at Halladay -- eyes fixed on the field like a hawk on a lizard --- and realized something important :
He 's had better ideas over the course of his 66 years .
But Ol ' Charlie did n't get where he is in life by avoiding risk .
Turning back would be an admission of defeat , perhaps even a slight embarrassment for a leader of men .
So he kept going .
When he got to Halladay , Manuel said something folksy and good - humored , because he knows no other way .
Whatever was said , it did n't take long , and Halladay honored Manuel 's remarks with a slight nod and a slighter smile .
He did not say a word .
He did not turn his head .
Two days later , as Manuel told the story from the visiting dugout at Nationals Park , just steps from the scene of the incident , he said , " Well , you learn your players as you go along .
I learned Roy is n't much on small talk . "
Manuel laughed , but in truth , he probably got what he expected from Halladay .
As third baseman Placido Polanco says of the 6 - foot - 6 , 230 - pound righthander , " You do n't want to go to the mound to talk to Roy .
You just look at him and say to yourself , I 'll just stay here . "
In mid-December , when the Phillies completed a trade with the Blue Jays to bring Halladay to Philadelphia , Manuel was understandably excited .
The Phillies , seeing Halladay as the difference between being league champion and world champion , had tried to pry him from Toronto before last July 's trade deadline , but the teams could n't agree on a deal .
Halladay 's desire to play for a contender was so strong that he had to turn off the TV during the World Series between the Phillies and Yankees .
He 'd come so close , and it was just too painful to watch .
On the day the trade finally happened , Manuel placed a call to Halladay .
It went to voice mail .
Manuel welcomed Halladay to the Phillies , congratulated him on his career to that point and told him how thrilled he was to have him as part of the National League champs .
As an aside , Manuel said , " You do n't have to worry about calling me back . "
And so Halladay did as instructed :
He did n't worry .
He did n't call back .
Not that day .
Not that week .
Not that month .
But in mid-January , Manuel answered his phone and heard , " Charlie , this is Roy Halladay .
Sorry it took me so long . "
" Do n't worry about it , Roy , " Manuel responded .
" I 've got you penciled in . "
NATIONAL HALLADAY
When Roy Halladay was traded to Philadelphia last December , fans were geeked -- not because pitchers have an advantage the first time through a new league ( not true ) but because the big righty figures to dominate the NL ( true that ) .
Check out the numbers below from Baseball Prospectus .
In the first chart , you see the numbers of all pitchers who switched league ( either way ) from 1954 - 2009 .
They had pretty much the same stats before and after they moved .
As you 'll see below , pitchers moving from the AL to the NL have seen a major boost in their ERA in recent years .
In the wild - card era , pitchers who 've switched from the AL to the NL have shown a big improvement .
It 's not a bad deal for pitcher or manager :
Roy does n't worry about Charlie , and Charlie does n't worry about Roy .
Manuel 's main concern is tamping down expectations , including his own .
There are endless opportunities for reverie during a baseball season , and this is prime fodder :
In the NL , facing lineups with 11 percent fewer big league hitters , freed from the brutal American League East and supported by the best offense outside the Bronx , just how good can Roy Halladay be ?
The possibilities seem boundless , like some wild bank error in the Phillies ' favor .
Since 2002 with Toronto , Halladay averaged 16 wins for a team that struggled to finish in the top three of its division .
Despite his age -- Halladay turns 33 on May 14 -- he is actually getting better .
In each of the past two seasons , he led the majors in strikeout - to - walk ratio ( 5.28 in 2008 , 5.94 in 2009 ) and the AL in complete games ( nine each year ) .
In fact , he threw more complete games over the past two years than any of the 29 other teams .
Now , instead of facing 8 - 9 hitters like Nick Swisher and Brett Gardner , Halladay will face 8 - 9 hitters like the ones he saw on Opening Day : Nationals light - hitting shortstop Ian Desmond and pitcher John Lannan .
In 2009 , the last two hitters in AL lineups batted .248 with a .311 OBP and a .374 slugging percentage .
Those numbers certainly are n't great , but compare them with the NL bottom - feeders : .217/.285/.314 .
In the second inning on Opening Day , Halladay faced Desmond and Lannan with a runner at second and nobody out ; he whiffed both rather effortlessly .
Overall , he went seven innings , allowed one run and struck out nine -- typical .
In his second start , he threw a complete game and beat the Astros , 2 - 1 .
The bottom third of Houston 's lineup , including pinch - hitters , went 1 - for - 8 .
" The difference between the big pitcher and the average pitcher is that the big pitcher gets the outs he should get , " Manuel says .
" The big guy does n't have problems with the bottom of the order .
Without having to face a DH , if Roy gets through the bottom of the orders , he 'll finish more games . "
Halladay 's first two National League outings set the mind racing .
This is a pitcher who made 14 of his final 18 starts last year against the Red Sox , Yankees and Rays .
He allowed three earned runs or fewer in nine of those 14 and threw four complete games .
What happens when you set him loose on the Nationals , Astros and Pirates ?
Ace or Ticking Timebomb ?
There 's an old baseball bromide that a pitcher , any pitcher , owns the advantage his first time through a new league .
According to the theory , hitters need time to ascertain tendencies and patterns , allowing pitchers to get outs until the hitters complete their dossiers and adjust .
Statistics show this to be patently false ( see chart ) , but baseball is starting only now to value statistics over bromides .
There is significant statistical evidence , however , to demonstrate that pitchers moving from the AL to the NL improve their ERAs by more than half a run .
This can be attributed , at least in part , to the difference in offensive output between the leagues ; after all , AL lineups contain nine big league hitters rather than eight .
If Halladay continues to dominate in his first time through the league , he wo n't be bucking a trend or tweaking an average ; he 'll just be pitching like himself .
Averages , after all , do n't apply to him .
If the average league - switchers -- your everyday Edwin Jacksons or Nate Robertsons -- are half a run better pitching in the National League , how much better will baseball 's best pitcher be , especially when he 's backed by an offense featuring Ryan Howard , Chase Utley and Jayson Werth ?
No one knows for sure , but almost everyone has something to say about how good Halladay already is .
" Here 's how good he is , " says Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer , who 's now an Orioles broadcaster .
" Last year , Mike Maddux , the Rangers pitching coach , ran up to me and said , ' I just saw Halladay for the first time !
He 's unbelievable ! ' " Mike Maddux , remember , is the older brother of Greg Maddux , who won four straight Cy Youngs in the mid-'90s .
Halladay has become Greg Maddux , with a 92 - 94 mph fastball that always looks the same coming out of his hand but sometimes darts right , sometimes left .
Nationals infielder Adam Kennedy , who faced Halladay for years in the AL , says this of his heater : " It looks hittable , and it is hittable .
You just can't do anything with it .
It hits the bat like a shot put .
Putting him in this league with that lineup ?
It 's almost unfair . "
Phillies backup catcher Brian Schneider says Halladay not only throws five pitches -- fastball , slider , cutter , curve , changeup -- but , in scouting terms , he also throws five plus pitches .
That 's three or four more than most pitchers have .
" If a batter takes away something , Roy goes to another plus pitch , " says Schneider .
" He 's even better when you catch him than when you try to hit him . "
So , Charlie Manuel , just how good can Halladay be ?
" I do n't let my mind go there , " says the manager .
" I just think it 's best to let Roy go out and pitch . "
Manuel wants to let it go at that , you can tell , but he can't help himself .
The temptation is too great .
Standing in the dugout , he shifts his legs and nods his head a few times , as if rolling the words around inside before speaking .
" I will say this : I know he can win 20 . "
Manuel pauses .
His eyes drift out onto the field with a faraway look .
In a low rumble , he adds , " And maybe more . "
Reports of Halladay 's intensity are in danger of reaching satire .
It 's hard to say where truth stops and apocrypha begins .
Put it this way :
Wars have been launched with less preparation than Halladay puts in before every start .
He treats distractions , or perceived distractions , as threats .
He is the first one to the ballpark , even when teammates or coaches strive to get there before him , even when he gets hit in the head the day before .
One time in Pittsburgh , Halladay was beaned by a line drive , yet when Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston arrived the following day , more than six hours before game time , Halladay was running in the outfield .
Halladay is all business on the mound , but even he can't hide his joy to finally be pitching for a contender .

Baseball players , in general , have turned looking busy into performance art .
And starting pitchers are usually the least busy players in the clubhouse .
They have their between - start routines -- throwing , running , shagging flies during batting practice -- and you best not go near most of them on the day they pitch .
But in reality , the job is n't as labor intensive as most .
Pitchers are reliably around their lockers , checking their phones or listening to music or trying to figure out what to do next .
" There 's one place you
almost never find Roy : at his locker , " Manuel says .
" He 's either running or throwing or looking at video or doing something to help himself get better .
He 's just almost never around . "
Not surprisingly , Halladay wo n't be the basis for the clubhouse cutup character in Major League IV .
" He 'll engage in small chatter , " says pitching coach Rich Dubee , looking as if he 's trying to recall such an instance .
" It just does n't happen very much . "
Teammates have tried to loosen Halladay up , but they 've found it 's a rough road .
His idea of socializing is to discuss opposing hitters while watching video .
Some of the pitchers have coaxed a few laughs by joking about the attempts of young righthander Kyle Kendrick to stay close enough to Halladay to learn his secrets .
" He 's pretty extreme with everything he does , " says young lefty J.A. Happ .
" But he 'll laugh -- sometimes . "
To call Halladay 's routine structured is an insult .
There is comfort in rote , of course .
It originates
as formulaic repetition -- five fastballs , five sliders , five cutters , five curveballs , five changeups --
before morphing into an unthinking progression of nearly subconscious habits .
For many athletes , repetition serves as the gateway to the elusive and amorphous " zone , " where the world seems to slow and excellence becomes effortless .
Halladay strives not only to visit the zone but also to take up permanent residence .
When Class - A pitcher Jarred Cosart , one of the Phils ' better prospects , showed up a few weeks early to spring training in Clearwater , Fla. , he found himself working out with Halladay , who lives nearby .
" I tried to do all the reps , but I realized I could n't finish a Roy Halladay workout , " Cosart says .
So the 19 - year - old righthander asked the veteran for advice on getting in shape .
One of the first things Halladay told him to do was develop a routine .
Cosart thought he understood the concept : work hard , develop the proper mechanics , do the right things often enough that they become second nature .
But he quickly learned his idea of routine was nothing more than a vague outline .
A Halladay routine differs from a normal routine the way a housefly differs from a space shuttle .
Here are some of the details Cosart learned about the Halladay routine :
He catches the throw from the catcher in the same spot in front of the mound every time ; he takes the same number of steps back up the mound after every pitch ; he even has an idea of how many breaths he wants to take between pitches .
Outside the insular world of sports , tics such as these might denote a level of quirkiness that warrants concern -- " That 's Bob , our janitor .
He always sweeps the floor in a series of concentric three - foot hexagons " -- but in the baseball world , it 's considered dedication to the craft .
The devotion to repetition and routine is often the difference between the average athlete and the Roy Halladays .
" I was blown away , " Cosart says .
" When you 're around him , you start to realize why he 's so good .
Everything he does has a purpose . "
It 's nearly comical to watch Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz between innings when Halladay pitches .
After the Phillies make their third out , Halladay -- providing he is not on deck or on the bases -- practically launches his lanky frame , which is roughly 78 pecent legs , out of the dugout and toward the mound .
Ruiz , whose 5 - foot - 10 frame is roughly 22 percent legs , bounds out in desperate hope of reaching the catcher 's box before Halladay reaches the pitching rubber .
" I do n't want to be late , " Ruiz says .
" Roy likes to get out there and get to work .
He 's ready , so I have to be ready . "
What , exactly , are the Phillies getting ready for ?
Setting a franchise record for wins ?
A second World Series title in three years ?
" We ca n't get ahead of ourselves , " Dubee says .
" Roy just has to pitch every fifth day , and we 'll add it up at the end . "
But just because they say it does n't mean you have to believe it .
Manuel openly says his team can win 100 games ( the team record is 101 ) , and there 's no question the Phillies believe Halladay is the piece they were missing last year .
And after one trip through the league , or maybe before , the rest of baseball may have no choice but to agree .
It would have been instructive to hear from Halladay on some of these topics , but a one - on - one interview did n't fit into his opening - week regimen .
Asked if he could spare a few minutes to answer questions for this story , Halladay said , " I 'm going to pass .
I did a lot during spring training , and now I 'm just going to shut it down . "
He did turn his head , though .

More and more parents from around the country are recounting horrific flu jab experiences amid mounting controversy over adverse reactions to the seasonal flu vaccine .
Australia 's chief medical officer , Professor Jim Bishop , has urged doctors not to use the vaccine on children under five , following more than 250 reports of adverse reactions - a figure experts and parents fear is being severely underestimated .
In Queensland , health authorities are also investigating the death of a two - year - old Brisbane girl , which may be linked to the flu vaccine .
As the vaccine saga unfolds , whether or not to vaccinate has also been a hot topic in online parenting forums such as Essential Baby , where hundreds of mothers and fathers have expressed their fears and detailed nightmare stories of their children 's reactions .
Perth mother Marrisa Moir told ABC News Online her two - year - old son began gagging and squealing in the bath about four hours after having the flu vaccine on April 9 .
She says Rohan , who has Global Developmental Delay with hypotonia - a condition where milestones are not met at expected ages - has regressed since the ordeal .
" He started staring off into space with this weird look on his face then his eyes rolled back and started going bright red and watering , " she said .
" I grabbed him out of the bath and then he started shaking uncontrollably .
He could n't stand or hold anything , he was shaking that much .
" He curled his arms over his chest and kept gagging and letting out squeals and I had no idea what the hell was going on . "
Ms Moir says she drove " like a mad woman " to get her son to the Princess Margaret Hospital .
She said he passed out on the way there .
" The doctor said it was a febrile convulsion and that 30 minutes was pretty long , " she said .
" She [ the doctor ] thought it was related to the flu needle he'd had and also said they have had quite a few cases of the same thing happening . "
Ms Moir says since the post - flu vaccine seizure , Rohan has continued to experience mild seizures lasting about 10 seconds .
" We had an EEG [ electroencephalogram ] today to monitor that , " she said .
" He has gone backwards since having the major seizure in regards to his development and his muscles are a bit weaker .
" We are working on physio and play skills again to get him up to speed , but I 've been told it could take some time . "
' It was horrible '
Another mother , from North Ryde in New South Wales , says her 18 - month - old daughter woke in the middle of the night in a puddle of vomit with a soaring temperature and high heart rate .
Lydia says her daughter Sophie had the flu vaccine on the morning of March 30 .
" I was assured by the GP that Sophie would probably not have any side effects and , at worst , she would develop a mild temperature , " Lydia said .
" At 3.00 pm Sophie started shuddering , became very distressed and felt hot .
I gave her Panadol and put her in a tepid bath about 20 minutes later as she was so hot .
" At about 3.40 pm her temperature reached 40 degrees .
She then started vomiting .
I telephoned the GP who told me to give her Nurofen and Panadol and to take her to hospital if her temperature did not come down in half an hour .
" Her temperature , thankfully , started to come down ... but at about 8.30 pm , Sophie woke up in a huge pile of vomit , was very distressed and had a high temperature .
She also had a rash on areas of her arms that looked like hives .
" My husband noticed her heart was racing so we took her to Royal North Shore Hospital [ St Leonards , Sydney ] . "
Lydia said the nurse at the hospital told her she had seen " many " children with high temperatures and vomiting after receiving the flu injection .
" The doctor on duty also informed us that he had seen three other children that day alone with similar symptoms following the injection , " she said .
Lydia says she and her husband are concerned about whether the vaccine will continue to affect Sophie in the future .
" My husband and I were very worried .
We have never seen her that sick in her whole life .
She has never had a 40 degree temperature , " Lydia said .
" She also has never thrown up as much as she did that day and night .
She was so distressed .
It was horrible .
I would have never got this done to my perfectly healthy child if I was informed about the possible reactions . "
And it seems the adverse reactions are not just occurring in children under the age of five .
A mother from Bardon , in Brisbane 's west , says her three children aged four , six and eight all suffered rapidly rising temperatures in excess of 39 degrees Celsius , severe headaches and repeated vomiting .
She says the shots were administered by a GP , who " was very much of the opinion that the reactions were a response to the vaccine " .
Reporting channels
The Federal Government says it has a national reporting line set up for individuals and health professionals to report adverse drug and vaccine reactions , which it says has been in place for decades .
Queensland and Western Australia 's health departments both say the onus is on doctors to record adverse reactions to vaccines .
But some parents have told ABC News Online that health authorities dismissed their concerns that their child 's reaction may be linked to the flu vaccine .
Jim Hocking from Armadale , near Perth , says both his children had to be hospitalised within days of receiving the flu vaccine in June last year .
" We 've ended up with two really sick kids in the space of a week .
We have n't taken them to any playgroups , they have n't been around any kids that have been notably sick and now they 've absolutely crashed in a day or two , " he said .
Mr Hocking said he and his wife told doctors at the Armadale hospital that their children had just had the flu vaccine , but he says there has never been any follow - up and he has no idea if their cases were ever reported .
" You 're at a public hospital , you 're being dealt with as an emergency case .
The only avenue we 've been able to raise it with is with our local GP , " he said .
" At the end of the day we have n't had any follow - up from anybody . "
Mr Hocking says he is worried that health authorities may view cases in isolation if there are no clear channels of reporting reactions .
" It is worrying ... if they do n't know that there 's a problem .
I guess with any injection they give it would be an advantage to have someone to call to say there 's been a reaction .
It would make sense to certainly have an easier way to report your concerns , " he said .
Earlier this week , Kirsten Maloney from the ACT complained that her daughter 's reaction to the flu vaccine had so far not been recorded by ACT officials .
The ACT 's chief medical officer , Dr Charles Guest , has said there are no reports of serious reactions to the vaccine in the ACT .
But Ms Maloney says her daughter was admitted to hospital after she received the injection .
" There was an adverse drug reaction report filled out by one of the pharmacists at Canberra Hospital , and all the doctors that we talked to and the paediatricians that we spoke to acknowledged that it was most likely the reaction to the flu shot , " she said .
" I do n't understand how [ Dr Guest ] does n't know about that . "
Brisbane mother Jodi Hahn said her son reacted 12 hours after having the swine flu vaccine , but authorities told her he probably had croup .
Five weeks after her son was rushed to hospital with febrile convulsions , vomiting and fever , Queensland Health has finally agreed to officially record his case as a reaction to the vaccine .
Peter Collignon , a professor of infectious diseases from the Australian National University , says the number of recorded cases of adverse reactions is probably underestimated , given authorities have no system in place to monitor people 's reactions .
He says an effective surveillance system should monitor thousands of people for one or two weeks after vaccination before rolling out the vaccine to the entire population .
" We need a better system than voluntary notification to the TGA [ Therapeutic Goods Administration ] that there 's a problem , " he said .
" Because whenever you do that you really underestimate how much of a problem there is . "
Health authorities are investigating the recent spike in reports of reactions .
This is one of the most embarrassing things I 've ever heard a politician say :
" Maverick " is a mantle McCain no longer claims ; in fact , he now denies he ever was one .
" I never considered myself a maverick , " he told me .
" I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities . "
This is n't where some politician denies having said something you can then dig up in the Congressional record .
He 's denying a label that he 's cultivated relentlessly for a decade at least .
Among people who just barely follow politics , it 's the one thing they know about McCain .
I 've thought for a while that McCain looks pretty safe in his primary fight against J.D. Hayworth .
But denying that he 's ever thought of himself as a maverick just dynamites McCain 's credibility to the point where he risks becoming a joke .
We know that JPMorgan is not substantially increasing lending anytime soon .
And we also know that banks are recapitalizing courtesy of a steep yield curve and near zero rates , what I would call free money .
What I did n’t know is how free these funds truly were .
An investor friend pointed out something curious buried deep in JPMorgan Chase ’s financial report from Q1 2010 , namely that they were effectively paid five basis points to borrow money .
Here ’s a close - up of the numbers in question .
This is on page five of the document embedded below .
It shows you that JPMorgan Chase earned an average yield of 3.24 % more on its assets than it paid out on its liabilities .
This huge margin is in large part due to a steep yield curve and zero rates .
The interesting bit is highlighted in red .
That is the interest rate that JPM had to pay for Fed Funds i.e. for money borrowed from the Federal Reserve . *
The number is – 0.05 % .
That ’s right , negative 0.05 % for what were $ 271.9 billion in repo liabilities .
That ’s unbelievable !
* Technically , JPMorgan borrowed from other primary dealer repo counterparties ; see note at bottom .
JPMorgan Chase says in the footnote that this :
Reflects a benefit from the favorable market environment for dollar - roll financings in the first quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Favorable indeed !
But how favorable ?
Let ’s take a look at past JPM filings to see .
JPMorgan
Chase does this earnings release financial supplement the same way every year .
And it has the last five years ’ worth online , which I consulted .
Here ’s what I found .
You can see how the yield spread has steadily increased over the past six years to where JPMorgan Chase is now making a spread that is 1 1/2 % greater than it was in 2004 .
Moreover , the interest it has paid on repos has plummeted .
Fed Funds rates started coming down in mid-2007 when the subprime crisis blew up , but they fell off a cliff after Lehman hit the wall in September of 2008 .
As of Q1 2010 , JPMorgan Chase was being paid to borrow $ 271 billion .
Talk about free money !
I sure wish I could get a deal like that .
Hat tip , Scott .
JPMorgan Chase 1Q2010 Supplement
Update :
The point I am trying to make is that the interest carry is enormous and that banks are borrowing for next to nothing .
It just so happens that JPM ’s dollar - rolls made the net rate come out negative which makes this example all the more pointed .
A commenter felt my reference to borrowing " from the government " was misleading .
I have stricken that reference now .
Note that technically Repo counterparties are largely banks lending and borrowing excess reserves from one another .
So , they are not really borrowing from the government .
However , the Fed has set the Fed Funds rate at 0.00 - 0.25 % .
It controls the Fed Funds rate to within that range by making repurchase and reverse repo agreements that are collateralized loans to primary dealers of Treasury securities .
The supply and demand dynamics in the repo market are largely controlled by the Fed in order to maintain the repo rate at the specified level set by the Fed .
So , while the repo market participants may be borrowing from each other , in essence they are borrowing from the Fed .
The repo rate is set and controlled by the Federal Reserve .
You could suspend all counterparty transactions in the market and have dealers just repo with the Fed and the net effect would be the same .
* And I know some people argue that the Federal Reserve is not a part of the Government because the U.S. Government does not own shares .
But , all profits after payments are paid to the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve is acting on behalf of the Federal Treasury .
Also note that not all repo agreements are for Treasury securities .
Other collateral can be used in interbank transactions , while the Federal Reserve had only accepted Treasuries before it relaxed standards in the wake of the Lehman collapse .
I hate badly cooked meat with a passion .
Why ?
Well sure , I admire the hard - working farmers and respect the death of the animal that lived only to provide me with sustenance .
And yeah , I 'm as cheap as the next guy and am certainly never in the mood to abuse $ 50 worth of tender , expensive , spring lamb .
Get the Recipe Perfect Slow - Cooked Rack of Lamb for the Grill or the Stovetop
But really , the reason is even more selfish .
I 'm contractually obligated to taste every iteration of every recipe I develop — even the failures .
I 'd prefer to keep the ratio of delicious to non-delicious bites as high as possible , thank you .
So this week , when I decided to tackle lamb racks — one of the most expensive ( try $ 20 + per pound ) and potentially delicious meats out there — I figured my work would be easy .
I mean , I 'd already tackled Perfect Prime Rib , which is the beefy equivalent .
Could the ovine parallel really be all that different ?
As it turns out , yes , it can .
Rack Opinions
To roast a lamb rack with the traditional method , you place your seasoned racks in a ripping hot oven ( around 450 °F ) , and basically hope that the center reaches the perfect medium rare ( around 125 to 130 °F ) , just as the exterior hits that deep - golden - brown - but - not - yet - black sweet spot .
This is much easier said than done .
Differences in the size of the rack , uneven oven temperatures , strange air circulation patterns , and difficulty finding the exact center of the lamb with your thermometer are just a few of the problems that can affect the outcome .
Worse , even if you manage to pull out the lamb at the exact right moment , the best results you can possibly expect from an oven still are n't that great .
It 's the age - old " gray zone " problem .
Essentially , it comes down to the fact that meat cooks from the outside in .
In a high temperature cooking environment ( say , the oven , a hot skillet , or the grill ) , by the time the very center of the meat has reached a perfect 125 °F medium rare , the outer layers are already overcooked .
Indeed , slicing open a lamb rack cooked in a 450 °F oven reveals a distinct temperature gradient :
The center is 120 °F , which is technically rare ( apparently , my thermometer probing skills need to be improved — but you get the idea ) .
At this point , the meat is still dark red , barely warmed , and slippery in texture .
Not ideal for me .

The next 1/2 - inch is at 130 - 140 °F , in the medium - rare to medium range .
The meat is pink , just barely firm but still juicy , and fat has begun to render and melt , increasing the juiciness and flavor of the meat .
This is the ideal target temperature for the entire rack .

Meat fibers have considerably contracted , juices have been expelled , and the meat is will be tough and dry .

The crust is reasonably well developed this time , but can be a crap shoot that depends on several difficult - to - control factors .
With a large prime rib , solving this problem is easy .
Simply slow - cook the beef at a very low temperature ( say , 200 to 250 °F ) to minimize the temperature gradient until the center reaches your desired finished temperature .
Afterwards , crank the oven up as hot as it goes , and pop the beef back in just to give it a crisp , crackly crust , carve , and serve .
Attempting this exact same technique on a lamb rack proved disappointing .
While the initial low - temperature cook was successful , it 's the high temperature sear that 's the problem .
With diminutive lamb racks , even the 15 minutes it takes to achieve a great crust in a hot oven is too long — the racks end up hopelessly overcooked .
Time to get back to basics .
The Searing Truth
So how to we get around this problem ?
Simple : take the lamb racks out of the fire , and into the frying pan .
While searing an entire beef prime rib on the stovetop would be impractical , small lamb racks are easy to maneuver .
I seasoned another batch of chops , placed them in a 200°F , and cooked them until their centers reached 125 °F .
I then removed them from the oven and seared them in a ripping hot skillet , carefully browning all sides until a deep , flavorful crust had developed .
It was a success , revealing the beauties pictured below .
As you can see , the temperature gradient has been drastically reduced , showing a mere 1/8 th - inch or so of mildly overcooked meat , and the crust is a deeper brown . *
* More astute readers will pick up the batch of bare , pale fat on the bottom part of the chop on the right .
This is due to the fact that the crust was so appealing on coming out of the pan that I instinctively picked it off and ate it before remembering I had to shoot a photograph .
My sincere apologies .
" Whoah , nice rack ! " I exclaimed , just as my wife happened to walk through the front door , precipitating a disapproving glance .
I was talking to the lamb dear , to the lamb .
Thus far , I was pretty darn happy with my results .
I 'd proudly serve this to any guest in my home .
But there were still a couple of things bothering me .
First off , the method was n't completely , 100 % foolproof .
As my first batch of lamb indicated , finding the exact center of such a tiny piece of meat with the tip of a thermometer can be a little difficult , meaning that my lamb racks had window of error of about 5 °F in either direction .
Moreover , the recipe does n't give much certainty in terms of timing .
Due to the sporadic nature of oven heating , I found that one batch of lamb might come to temperature in 20 minutes , while the next could take over 35 , making timing side dishes an exercise in futility .
These were hardly a problems worth losing sleep over perhaps ;
But for an OCD like myself , they were like glaring , festering , pustulating wounds in the middle of my otherwise blemish - free recipe .
I 'd have to figure out a better way to do this .
" I Can't Believe It 's Not Sous - Vide "
The answer , of course , lay in breaking out my $ 450 Sous - Vide Supreme and cooking the lamb in a vacuum - sealed bag in a precisely controlled 125 °F water bath , finished by a quick sear on the stove top .
Perfect , foolproof results , and the ability to hold the cooked lamb for as long as I want , making timing side dishes a snap .
But wait — what 's that you say ?
You do n't have a $ 450 low - temperature water oven ?
I do n't blame you .
In fact , there 's a whole legion of people out there on the interwebs who have figured out ways of cobbling together DIY low - temp water baths ( the more accurate term for " sous - vide , " which technically refers only to the vacuum element ) .
The problem with those is that most of them fall into two categories :
Category 1 : The rice cooker , aquarium bubbler , PID controller , which is accurate , but requires a fair amount of DIY know - how , and costs a couple hundred dollars to hack together .
The rice cooker , aquarium bubbler , PID controller , which is accurate , but requires a fair amount of DIY know - how , and costs a couple hundred dollars to hack together .
Category 2 : The pot of water on the stove , fiddle with the heat as necessary method , which is inaccurate , and requires you to hover around the stove for the entire cooking time , which can be up to several hours .
I 'd rather watch a Jaleel White and Olsen twin marathon that do that .
Convinced that there was a fast , easier , cheaper , and more foolproof way to achieve the same results , I started poking around my kitchen .
Essentially , in order to create a low - temperature water oven , all you need to do is keep a large body of water at the same temperature for a couple of hours .
Suddenly , a big red logo caught my eyes :
Even though a cooler is designed to keep things cool , there 's no reason why it should n't perform equally well at keeping hot things hot , right ?
The principles are the same — the interior of the cooler is separated from the outside environment with two layers of plastic with a vacuum in between them .
Heat transfer is minimized , thus any volume of hot water inside the cooler should stay hot for a long , long time .
That 's pretty exciting .
The other part of precision low - temperature cooking is vacuum sealing the food .
This is necessary primarily because when placed in the water bath , any air bubbles left in the bag will insulate the food within , causing uneven cooking .
That said , the strong vacuum provided by a commercial chamber vac or a food saver are completely unnecessary for most cooking applications .
In fact , the only thing you need to do is ensure that your cooking bag has no bubbles in it .
Thanks to a tip I gleaned a couple of weeks ago from Dave Arnold of the French Culinary Institute , achieving this is a snap .
It uses the simple property of displacement .
All you have to do is place your food in a regular zipper - lock bag , seal the zipper most of the way , then slowly dip it into a large volume of water , keeping the zipper - lock end above the water line .
As you submerge it , air should be steadily squeezed out ( sometimes a little coaxing is necessary ) , and the bag will conform to the shape of its contents .
Once you get the the very top , seal the bag , and there you go : food sealed in a perfectly air - free environment .
Now to put it to the test .
I sealed my seasoned lamb racks into gallon - sized zipper lock bags , then filled my picnic cooler up with water at 130 ° F ** ( figuring it would lose a few degrees as I place the cool lamb inside ) , dropped in the lamb , sealed the lid , draped the cooler with a few towels to help retain more heat , crossed my fingers , and waited for an hour .
** Which serendipitously is the exact temperature that hot water comes out of my kitchen tap , sparing me the need to even heat water on the stovetop
Right on !
In all that time , the temperature had only dropped 2.6°F , and the lamb was a perfect 125 °F in the center .
In fact , I found that even after 3 hours , the water was still at a comfortable 124°F !
Of course , this all depends on how good your cooler is and how warm your kitchen is , but mine is certainly not top - of - the - line , and my kitchen is not overwhelmingly hot , so it 's a good bet that most people can get similar results at home .
All that was left was to take the lamb out , pat it dry with paper towels , and sear it in a hot skillet to give it a nice golden brown crust .
The verdict ?
The best lamb I have ever cooked at home .
Perfectly evenly cooked from edge to center , beautiful , crackly , crispy , melt - in - your - mouth crust , and on top of that , the ability to hold it in the water bath for up to three hours , meaning that dinner is on the table when I say it is , not the lamb gods .
Moreover , with grilling season right upon us , this method promises an exciting new way to get perfectly grilled food .
Fill up my cooler with hot water and bagged chops and steaks , seal it , bring it out next to the grill , then pull the meat out of the bags as needed to finish off on the hot grill just before serving .
Simple !
So there you go : a the world 's cheapest DIY sous - vide , low - temperature water oven rig .
Does this mean that a more expensive sous - vide machine has no place ?
Of course not .
I 'll continue to use mine for it's accuracy and ability to hold temperature indefinitely , but this is certainly the best alternative I 've seen for the home cook who only occasionally wishes to cook in this way .
By the way : for those of you who prefer to cook their beautiful lamb racks to well done , here 's an idea : stuff yourselves in the cooler and save the lamb for the rest of us !
( I kid .
Sort of . )

Full disclosure : I just know that I 've heard of this idea—using a cooler for low - temp cooking — somewhere before , but after doing extensive online searching , looking through my books , and checking old emails , I can't for the life of me figure out where .
Perhaps I had n't heard of it from anywhere else , but ...
If you at some point told me this idea , please come forward — I do n't want to claim credit for someone else 's inspiration !

Doctor
Who 's oldest and deadliest monsters are back — and some new concept art shows how the twisted , maniacal minds at the BBC recreated them in a new , terrible image .
Plus here 's why Doctor Who season five is must - see television .
Advertisement
Minor spoilers ahead ...
So at this point , three episodes of the Matt Smith era of Doctor Who have aired in the U.K. , and the first episode is about to air tonight on BBC America .
If you 're just starting to watch the show now , you 're in for a major treat .
The first few episodes really do feel like a whole new first season of the venerable time - travel show , and Matt Smith 's Doctor is absolutely bubbling with energy .
Also , Karen Gillan is instantly likable and effervescent as new companion Amy Pond .

One thing that 's becoming clear after a few episodes , too — the Eleventh Doctor is a bit more fallible , perhaps , than the Tenth .
Not surprisingly , given Steven Moffat 's apparent love of the Fifth Doctor , Peter Davison , we 're seeing some glimpses of Davison in Smith 's portrayal .
( Alongside the Patrick Troughton influence everyone 's already mentioned . )
Smith 's Doctor is frequently out of his depth and not sure what 's going on — until he makes a brilliant deduction , of course .
In the Dalek story , especially , the Doctor is not the know - it - all we might have been expecting him to be .
In tonight 's debut , " The Eleventh Hour , " we get to see the Doctor tossed in the deep end , with only minutes left to save the Earth from annihilation , with no high technology at his disposal .
He literally hits the ground running , although he also drives a fire truck at one point .
Smith won us over in his first hour , and he 's just gotten better since .
We 'll have a fuller recap of " The Eleventh Hour " tomorrow , but it 's well worth checking out .

And today 's new British episode , " Victory Of The Daleks , " is tremendous fun as well , mostly thanks to the double act of Winston Churchill and Professor Bracewell , both of them bouncing off the Doctor and Amy .
The Daleks have come up with their daftest scheme yet — yes , dafter than turning people into pigs and zapping the Empire State Building with Dalek DNA — and amazingly , it makes sense .
The Daleks regain a smidge of the menace they lost during the last few years of Dalek Overkill , and there are deeper mysteries that we can't wait to discover the answers to .
It 's an amazing time to be following Doctor Who .
When Obama appointed Salazar to the Interior job , I hoped against hope that the corporate dirtbag would n't be as bad as I thought he'd be .
But as always , the " business as usual " Beltway revolving door wins again .
Heckuva job , Ken !
In the weeks since BP's Deepwater Horizon well started spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , there 's been increasing attention to the " cozy " relationship between the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) and the oil industry it 's supposed to regulate .
How cozy ?
Just last summer the Obama administration tapped a BP executive to serve as a deputy administrator for land and minerals management .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last June appointed Sylvia V. Baca to the post , which did not require Senate confirmation .
The appointment follows eight years at BP .
From her MMS bio :
Baca had been general manager for Social Investment Programs and Strategic Partnerships at BP America Inc. in Houston , and had held several senior management positions with the company since 2001 , focusing on environmental initiatives , overseeing cooperative projects with private and public organizations , developing health , safety , and emergency response programs and working on climate change , biodiversity and sustainability objectives .
As Director of Global Health , Safety , Environment & Emergency Response for BP Shipping Ltd. in London , Baca led a worldwide team to develop innovative and proactive energy and the environment initiatives .
Among her accomplishments , she oversaw health , safety and environmental outcomes for an $ 8 billion ship building program , resulting in the youngest , greenest and most technically advanced fleet in the world .
The project has received numerous awards for its safety and environmental advancements .
Baca is also an excellent example of the revolving door between government and industry that MMS has been accused of facilitating .
From 1995 to 2001 , she was an assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Department of Interior before leaving to work for the oil giant .
The Sydney Morning Herald has a report about the Starwalker reality show and its suddenly press shy “ creator ” Jonathan Nolan :
Jonathan Nolan had plans for the world ’s most ambitious reality show – a global cross -continent space challenge pitting prospective astronauts against each other for the chance to win two tickets into space .
He told media , partners and contestants that he had already secured two seats on Russian Soyuz rockets , had a production partner in Britain and had already obtained from foreign investors the tens of millions of dollars required to get the project , dubbed “ Starwalker ” , off the ground .
Nolan , 42 , an Australian , even appeared on Channel Seven ’s Sunrise in a three - minute segment , inviting viewers to sign up as contestants on the show ’s website .
Today , the project appears to be in tatters , its website is offline and questions are being raised over the whole operation .
A former employee claims Nolan has failed to pay him a significant sum of money .
It ’s good to see the Australian media beginning to cover a fiasco that readers of Parabolic Arc already know all about .
Nolan has made all manner of false and misleading claims while charging contestants a $ 10 ( AUS ) feed for registering via text message .
He dragged poor Stephen Hawking into this mess , falsely claiming he would serve as a judge .
Nolan has raised a lot of false hopes around the world while doing real damage to the emerging commercial space industry .
I ’m hoping the authorities in Australia will look into this case and take an action that may be appropriate .

About this page
An explanation of the sea breeze , a complex feature that affects us all .
Preamble
A Yachtmaster instructor friend once told me that he thought that the RYA gave too much attention to the sea breeze in its course syllabus .
A strange remark because most of us sail , for preference , in the Summer months and near the coast .
I suspect that he was really thinking of the “ classical ” sea breeze described , usually incorrectly , in geography text books and yachting magazines .
Here I want to broaden the concept of the sea breeze mechanism and give some ideas on what to look out for and what to expect .

A Little Theory
Sea breezes , like all winds are caused by pressure differences – pressure gradients .
These arise from the way in which the air is heated and cooled .
This is true for winds on all scales from the global , monsoon , scale right down to what happens around Island Barn reservoir at Walton - on - Thames .
In a nutshell , warming the ground causes warming of the air above it and that leads to a decrease in the pressure at ground or sea level .
On the large scale , this is the cause of Monsoons , Trade Winds , jet streams and the low that sits over Spain for much of the Summer half of the year .
Conversely , cooling of the air leads to high pressure .
See my page on how pressure differences are formed .
The Winter Siberian high is one example ; the cooler water in mid-Atlantic compared to further south leading to the Azores high is another .
Of course , the atmosphere is far more complicated than the simple concept of highs in cold areas and lows in warm ones .
Pressure differences create air movement as gravity takes effect and air tries to move from high to low pressure .
As we are well aware , the earth is spinning and the Coriolis effect causes air to be deflected to the right ( in the northern hemisphere . )
Buys - Ballot told us that pressure is lower to the left when standing back to the wind .
A schematic Sea Breeze
These diagrams show how the sea breeze forms and how the sea breeze front creates convection .
NOTE -
The sea breeze is NOT caused by convection over the land .
The convective cloud is a result of the sea breeze dynamics .
At dawn , pressure is uniform over a wide area .
At a height of , around 100 m , the pressure will also be uniform .
The sun heats the ground which then heats the lowest levels of the air .
The air expands .
Above the 100 m level there is now a greater mass of air exerting a greater pressure
The pressure gradient created at 100 m leads to a flow of air at that level from land to sea .
This reduces the weight of air above the land and increases the weight of air over the sea .
The result is a flow of air at sea level from sea to land .
Continued heating of the land keeps the sea breeze going and spreading further and further inland .
The air coming off the sea is cooler and moister than the air over the land .
This difference is often referred to as a " sea breeze front " .
The ascent of air at this front creates a line of cumulus cloud .
This moves inland during the day .
Veering Sea Breezes and the “ Vent Solaire ”
With a fairly low lying coast , the sea breeze usually sets in straight onto the coast .
Shortly after setting in , it then veers ( due to Coriolis ) over a period of a couple of hours or so .
We had a very marked example of this along the east coast of Italy between Vieste and Brindisi , see below .
The “ Vent Solaire ” is a daily cycle of sea breeze and land breeze .
A good example occurs between the Vilaine river in Southern Brittany and the isles of Houat and Hoëdic .
In settled weather with a high pressure area to the north , the night wind is off the land .
During the morning , heating of the land starts up the sea breeze more or less in an opposite direction to the night time land breeze .
This causes a weakening of the offshore wind .
Maybe a reversal .
( NOTE .
The name Vent Solaire used by many sailors is , in fact , a misnomer .
It is the French term for the solar wind – a stream of particles in the stratosphere . )
The sea breeze then becomes northwest and strengthens .
But , as the land cools in the late afternoon and evening the sea breeze effect weakens and the wind reverts to the northwest around the high to the north .
During the night the cooling land and the channelling effect of the Vilaine valley funnel the offshore wind and increases it to a good force 4 or so .
See below .
Someone deterred by the sea breeze from anchoring to the west of Houat might seek shelter on the eastern side only to have a disturbed night in the land breeze .
The western side would have been better after the sea breeze died away !
When formed by a low lying coast , a sea breeze is likely to veer .
A night time wind can be weakened ore even reversed by the sea breeze .
In the “ Vent Solaire ” .
the sea breeze first veers then , in the late afternoon dies away .
The offshore wind strengthens due to the land breeze effect .
Topographic effects
A very well known example of the sea breeze being affected by topography is around the Isle of Wight .
Here the sea breeze can set in on to the mainland shore driven largely by the heating of Southampton and surrounding towns .
Because the sea breeze does not easily flow over the Isle , it will be deflected around the island and flow up the Solent from both ends .
This gives the well - known curiosity of two yachts running under spinnaker towards each other somewhere off Cowes , only to start beating as they pass each other .
See below .
Along the Devon coast my experience is that the sea breeze will set readily into Plymouth Sound and Tor Bay where the built - up areas heat up quickly .
The sea breeze will occur but less readily into Bigbury Bay and Start Bay with their fairly low coast lines but little built up areas .
The sea breeze will not blow directly onto the steep cliffs between Bolt Head and Bolt Tail , between Dartmouth and Berry Head nor onto the Babbacombe heights to the north of Torbay .
However , the strong heating of Torquay and Paignton pulls air from around Berry Head and , from the opposite direction , past Babbacombe .
Returning to the Dart from Tor Bay can be a stiff beat in such conditions .
The figure below shows this effect that , again , is clearly shown when two yachts approach each other from opposite directions across Tor Bay .
Somewhere towards the north side , nearer to the Ore Stone than to Berry Head , they drop spinnakers , start motoring before beating in opposite directions .
The same can happen off Plymouth Sound where a yacht running past the Yealm and the Great Mew Stone will meet one running from the direction of Rame Head .
The sea breeze can only flow around the Isle of Wight .
Schematic of sea breeze being sucked into Tor Bay around the cliffs of Babbacombe and Berry Head .
Between the Dart entrance and Berry Head the sea breeze can easily reach force 4 or 5 .
When does it occur and how far out ?
The NW European sea breeze season is generally agreed to be from late Spring until late Autumn , but the best sea breezes will be when there is the biggest difference between sea temperatures and those over land - probably June and July .
On those all too rare , sunny , Summer days , the sea breeze is very regular and used to be reputed to reach Itchenor clubhouse ( Chichestor harbour ) at opening time !
Careful study of wind observations do , in fact , show that the sea breeze can be detected , albeit very light , even in December and January at favoured locations .
How far out to sea the sea breeze extends depends on the amount of heating .
I have found the effect up to 12 or 15 miles off the coast in the Torbay area .
On very hot days , the sea breeze can extend as far as mid Channel .
Down the Red Sea , we used to see the effect on observations from ships at about 100 miles out .
Very detailed analysis of wind patterns has shown that , on hot days , the air in mid Channel flows toward France in the south and towards England in the north .
A very good picture of this effect can be seen on another page of this site .
The separation between the two flows is an area of very light winds .
Alan Watts calls this Channel Starvation .
Some Spanish oddities !
We found an example of Channel Starvation off the south coast of Spain .
On apparently good sea breeze days it was either non-existent or very feeble .
As this is a low lying coast with south facing hills a little way inland , this was surprising as it had all the appearances of a good sea breeze coast .
I put this down to the relatively near coast of north Africa and suspect that the African sea breeze sucks air away from the Costa del Sol and prevents marked sea breezes on that coast .
A similar effect occurs on the south coast of Jersey where the sea breeze forms but is then reversed by the sea breeze into the Bay of St Malo .
The mechanism was probably like that mentioned earlier .
Off the Costa del Sol , this separation must have been very near the Spanish coast .
Along the east coast of Spain , almost regardless of the morning wind , the sea breeze seems to set in rather late in the day , typically after about 1600 or 1700 local time .
However , in terms of " God 's " time ( i.e. UTC ) this is only about 1400 or 1500 hours , 2 or 3 hours after solar noon .
This may still seem late by UK standards , but the sea is very warm and the land has to get hot to create the required pressure gradient .
Sometimes the Spanish east coast sea breeze lasted for two or three hours and reached a good F 6 or even 7 .
The effect of significant headlands , such as Cabo San Antonio , can be quite important in strengthening the breeze locally .
At other times it died out fairly quickly and only just got to a F 4 .
It is not immediately obvious why this should occur , but if the pressure is high then the air will have been subsiding and this can kill or weaken the sea breeze .
Alan Watts has suggested that a clue can be had by looking at the western horizon around sunset .
Subsidence causes a temperature inversion ie a lid that inhibits convection and the sea breeze .
This can be evidenced by a light blue strip caused by dust and pollution trapped at the inversion .
This takes very good and careful observation - beyond my abilities !
And elsewhere - some random notes
Around the east of Sardinia , we found some very strong sea breeze effects .
despite Italian forecasts of Force 4 or 5 , we had winds of up to Force 7 in the late afternoon just when we were wanting to enter a harbour exposed to the south - the sea breeze direction !
To the east of Levkas Island , the island sea breeze can be sufficiently strong on the eastern side to counter the prevailing NW winds .
Down the east coast of Italy , see above , the sea breeze seemed to be a very regular occurrence .
To the south of the Messina Strait , between Italy and Sicily , there can be a southerly on the Sicilian side and a northerly on the Italian side of the Toe of Italy .
The transition can be quite sharp .
A very large scale sea breeze effect helps to maintain the strong northerly winds to the east of Iberia - the Portuguese Trades .
Down the coast of Croatia , the large scale night time katabatic gives predominately NE winds at night but the warming of the land gives a NW wind during the day .
This can be seen in GRIB code output .

California has now made the Top 10 list for governments with the highest probability of default — and the Golden State ’s 20 percent default probability makes it a worse credit risk than Iceland and Iraq .
For California muni bondholders , this number bears watching .
However , many analysts say comparisons between default risks in California and other countries are n’t valid .
" It 's wacky , " municipal debt analyst Jeffrey Cleveland at Payden & Rygel told Reuters .
" Just look at the ratio of debt to state gross domestic product .
It 's 10 percent for California and somewhere between 104 percent and 150 percent for Greece . "
California 's economy , at $ 1.845 trillion , dwarfs Greece 's and on a standalone basis and would be the world 's eighth - largest .
It is the biggest borrower in the U.S. municipal market , which states and local governments use to fund roads , sewers and other infrastructure , The Business Insider reports .
Munis , whose total returns have smartly outperformed U.S. Treasuries in the last half year , have also become increasingly attractive to foreign institutional investors since 2009 's roll - out of Build America Bonds and their fatter taxable yields .
And , unless Congress acts to keep the Bush tax cut on dividend income in place , dividend stock investors looking for a tax break may flood the muni market as well next year .
“ If Congress allows the 15 percent dividends tax expire , upper bracket taxpayers could see taxes on their dividend income go as high as 39.6 percent , ” Robert J. DiQuollo , CFP , CPA , President of Brinton Eaton Wealth Advisors tells Newsmax .

Now that the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility report on “ torture memos ” authors John Yoo and Jay Bybee is out , the Center for Constitutional Rights is calling for action .
Specifically , the human rights group wants Bybee , now a federal appeals court judge , to be impeached .
From the group ’s statement :
Among others , the lawyers John Yoo , Jay Bybee and Steven Bradbury have caused incalculable damage to our country and to thousands of victims as a result of the twisted legal advice they provided while at the Office of Legal Counsel .
The OLC opinions were intended to provide legal cover for what everyone knew was illegal conduct .
They advised the establishment of the prison at Guantanamo outside the law through the purposeful evasion of the Geneva Conventions and they advised the creation of a secret detention network for “ enhanced interrogations ” in flagrant violation of domestic and international law .
Once unthinkable , they authorized and justified torture , rendition and secret CIA detention , often in a hands - on manner so detailed that it gives the lie to the notion they were giving abstract legal advice rather than making policy decisions to use torture .
Ultimately Jay Bybee must be impeached , tried and removed from his seat as a federal judge on the 9th Circuit , but he should have the decency to resign immediately .

With Republicans controlling the Senate and the Trump Regime still in charge of the Executive , there remains an increasingly crumbling global economy imperiling the world , rising nationalism and deadly racism across Europe and Asia , a seemingly endless war against terror , a federal government nobody trusts or believes in , global climate change putting us on the brink of destruction and a Village media that barely does its job on even the best day .
Needless to say there 's a lot of Stupid out there when we need solutions .
Dangerous levels of Stupid .
Into the fray , dear Reader .
Tray tables , crash helmets , arms inside blog at all times .
I love Star Wars , the scenery , epic explosions , battles across a galaxy of stars , thousands of alien races , and in the middle of it all , the human element .
Millions of fans all over have watched how a farm boy from Tatooine became the savior of all sentient - kind .
This was the future face of sci - fi thirty years ago .
To this day it is the most recognizable sci- fi franchise .
If you study how close George Lucas was to going bankrupt during the making of Star Wars : A New Hope you ’d realize how it could have never come to be .
Can you imagine a world without Star Wars ?
As beloved as the series is , and as an aspiring sci - fi author myself , I wonder , what is the future of science fiction today ?
What is going to be the next Star Wars ?
All this depends upon what the world wants .
Do they want another story about a galaxy far far away ?
Do they want laser beams and explosions , corny stories and plots ?
Lucas based the look and feel of Star Wars on the old Flash Gordon stories of the 1930s , a sort of popcorn fiction .
Ming the Merciless , nemesis of Flash , was an absolute evil , much like the emperor Darth Sidious of Star Wars .
The pure good that was both Flash and Luke Skywalker , the outlandish , fantastical settings , all of this was as deep as Star Wars and Flash Gordon went .
Yet each was done in a new and vibrant way .
People wanted to watch Star Wars because it was well done .
In its time , it was something very unique , different even .
Rather than mimicking what people have already seen , authors should aspire to give the audience something that is both done well and different .
People want to experience a story not just read it .
James Cameron ’s 2009 movie , Avatar has done this so well , some have become depressed after watching it , even suicidal , as this article from CNN states .
One person who saw the movie said , “ When I woke up this morning after watching Avatar for the first time yesterday , the world seemed … gray ” .
Perhaps this man needs to get out more .
A little visit to our own great outdoors would cure him nicely .
We do n’t have floating islands but we do all right .
In any case , all those who doubted Avatar ’s ability to make any money have shut their mouths now .
It seems , two billion dollars later , the movie has done several things right .
Even with a story that is cliché and unoriginal , you have a very beautiful film in an original , unique setting .
What I find wrong with it is also what I find so right about it .
It is fantastic , as in full of fantastical ideas that look beautiful but are n’t really , real .
This is a good thing to have , something unique for the audience to experience , but it also tends to be a crutch to the film .
Call me a critic here because , yes it has grossed two billion dollars in only a few months , but I ask you this , will the franchise last or will it go the way of the one hit wonder Titanic ?
What could James Cameron do with a sequel ?
Edit : I may be eating my words here .
James Cameron is currently working on the sequel and it sounds rather cool .
I like to have my cake and eat it too .
A long - winded space opera that is both based on reality and yet still very beautiful to behold would achieve this .
Below is a list of 4 things I ’d like to see in the next sci - fi hit .
The word for the day is real .
1 ) A real setting
Telling a beautiful story in real space is not hard .
Take a look at this and other photos of Mars .
Compare this with a picture of Mars as seen in the 1990 movie TotalRecall .
Notice how red Mars looks , nothing like the real pictures at all .
As a kid I loved the sci-fi Schwarzenegger movie .
In its time it was some great popcorn action , but not nearly as compelling as the real thing .
The potential to set a vivid story around a real Mars is still a very open prospect .
And what about the other planets out there ?
Jupiter
Saturn
Neptune
Uranus
Venus
Mercury near the sun
Want a space opera set away from the planets and into deep space ?
Just close your eyes and touch your finger on these pictures of the many interesting and exotic nebulas in our galaxy .
There ’s your setting , beautiful , stunning , and awe inspiring .
Now granted there have been stories about real places in the galaxy , but there is always something lacking in these stories , beauty .
That would be the one word I would use to describe Avatar .
If you wanted an adjective before that I would add , unrealistic .
It ’s unrealistic beauty is based on a sort of hyper Earth .
As far as I know , there are no floating mountains in existence .
But in most films and stories I ’ve seen based on the real thing , 2001 Space Odyssey excluded , there is no poetic descriptions of these awe inspiring places .
In fact most sci - fi seems void of beauty in any real since of the word .
It is often to the brain that the author goes , missing the heart of the mater .
This is where many of the authors lose half of the public audience .
Let ’s face it , when Neal Armstrong first saw the blue and white Earth from the glowing gray face of the moon …
… science was very far from his mind .
Star Wars did a good job of hinting at this beauty , with a double sun rise in Episode IV to the rain forests in Episode VI .
It was all similar though , based upon our own planet .
There were no alien worlds that looked truly and utterly alien like in Avatar .
Yet with Avatar you have a hyper realism .
It was recognizable and yet very untouchable because none of those places actually exist .
I surmise that the biggest reason sci- fi authors would rather tell stories around imagined locations is because they want more control over how it looks and feels to the audience .
Perhaps they want it to be cool and exotic like Avatar , yet the real thing has something Avatar does n’t .
It is touchable .
All you need to do is study and learn the facts of real settings around our galaxy , then base your story around those facts .
Often times , better ideas will come through the study of reality then anything you could come up with on your own .
2 ) Realistic technology
Emphasis on the istic of realistic .
Do a bit of study in today ’s technology and you will find how close to science fiction we really are .
Sci - fi should be based on this upcoming tech .
I use the words based on loosely here .
Sf tech still needs to be outlandish and otherworldly , but by reading science articles you can get some wonderful ideas that have more of a realistic feel .
I , for one , am tired of ships that go faster than light .
First of all , in most cases , it is n’t convincingly explained .
Second of all , it completely ignores a very real fact of the heavens : objects in space are huge , and the distance between them , even more so !
You ca n’t go gallivanting from star to star in mere minutes without a considerable amount of power .
Think about it this way .
The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second .
The closest star to our sun is Alpha Centauri , a binary star system , that is 4.37 light years away .
How far is that ?
There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year .
Multiply that by the speed of light and you get about 9.5 trillion km away ( 9,454,254,955,488 kilometers ) that light travels during the time it takes for Earth to complete one circle around the sun .
Multiply that by 4.37 and you get 41.3 trillion km ( 41,315,094,155,482.56 kilometers ) away .
This is how far the closest star to our sun is .
In order to travel there in two minutes , you would have to travel 20 trillion km a minute .
How can we go that fast so quickly ?
What about slowing down ?
Your body would be plastered to the windshield if your ship suddenly stopped from that speed .
Base the travel time on a few hours , a few weeks , heck even a month and you still have an astronomical number to deal with .
There is nothing wrong with believing we will eventually be able to travel faster than light , but space is really vast .
I think a terrible opportunity to convey its vastness through story is being missed .
If you want to have ships that travel faster than light , then explain how it is done in at least a half convincing way .
But I say use our own backyard of nearby planets and asteroids , mere months away from each other .
As I ’ve mentioned before , our solar system is a beautiful place , a perfect setting for a space opera .
3 ) Realistic story
The next sci - fi space opera needs to have a realistic plot and story , something we believe could take place .
People want more realistic stories .
This is why reality TV took off when it did .
Remember when Survivor first came out ?
Everyone was at least curious of how the TV show set on an island paradise went .
It is n’t watched quite as much because people do n’t want reality , they want realistic stories .
LOST was the number one show in its hay day .
This is because they took what people were curious about in Survivor and made it into a scripted believable story .
The difference between real and realistic , one is of the here and now , one describes what could be here and now , or , in the case of SciFi , later .
One is the boring day to day life we all live , the other is the surprising life we all desire to have , closer at hand then anything outlandish or dreamy .
The more realistic something is , the closer the audience can be to actually grasping it with their minds , dreaming of it , actually touching it .
4 ) Realistic character development
Another thing we need in our next venture into space , proper character development .
Avatar did a fair job with the good guys ; not so much with the “ big bad military ” and the “ big bad corporation ” .
Instead of evil men being evil simply because they feel like it , we need complicated villains who think they are doing good .
Adolf Hitler did n’t wake up and say , “ I was evil yesterday and the day before .
I think I ’ll continue to be evil and take over the world . ”
He honestly believed in what he fought for .
This is a must for the next space opera .
The hero should n’t be pure like Luke Skywalker .
He needs to have character flaws to overcome , more human in nature and less of a saint , mostly good but also erring on some dubious decisions , even making mistakes that could prove costly ( Han Solo comes to mind ) .
Again , this story of a good guy with flaws and a bad guy that thinks he ’s good should n’t be a real one .
It should be realistic .
The audience does n’t want a Survivor the TV show set in space .
They want LOST in space …
Not …
But a show with the same character development seen in
While set in
Minus the lame ending .
So what would my dream sci - fi epic be like ?
Take the real setting of our solar system , set it about 500 years into the future , colonize it with humans , use the realistic depiction of space travel in 2001 : Space Odyssey , and combine it with a story and characters as compelling as the show LOST .
Add it all together ( carry the one ) and there it is !
NOTHING !
Coming in a close second would be Battlestar Galactic .
BSG is n’t perfect , but it is the new direction sci - fi needs to go in .
Deep characters with complicated backgrounds that drive the story and their desires , battle segments that are more than just fluff , and a real dread of the vacuum of space .
The only think lacking in my perfect story is that BSG is n’t set in our beloved solar system , nor do they explore the vastness of space by implementing sub - light speed engines …
Guess I ’ll just have to write one myself .
Introducing my serial fiction series Void Voyage .
It is a story set within our Solar System , in a time before faster than light travel has been discovered , limited technology , and no aliens .
Because humans are interesting enough .
I should have it out within the year , if it passes through the editing process .
Speaking of which , I think I ’ll go and finish the second episode now .
Boy , this just keeps keeping worse , does n't it ?
I would like to add this perspective :
In the first half of the last century , it was extremely common for Catholic parents to pledge their first - born son to the priesthood and the first - born daughter to the sisterhood .
That must have made for some very angry , repressed people who then took their rage out on children :
The child abuse scandal rocking the Catholic Church widened yesterday as a leading German bishop personally appointed by Pope Benedict was accused of ritually beating and punching children at a church - run home during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
Five former residents of the St Josef 's home in Bavaria submitted written statements to Germany 's Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper claiming the Bishop of Augsburg , Walter Mixa , a controversial conservative churchman appointed by the Pope in 2005 , used to hit and degrade them during punishment sessions at the home .
Bishop Mixa 's diocese yesterday rejected the allegations as " absurd , untrue and obviously invented in order to defame the bishop " .
The allegations emerged as the Vatican prepares a legal defence it hopes will shield the Pope from a lawsuit in the US seeking to have him answer questions under oath related to an abuse scandal .
Court documents obtained by the Associated Press show that Vatican lawyers plan to argue that the Pope has immunity as head of state and that American bishops who oversaw abusive priests were not employees of the Vatican .
The Vatican is trying to fend off the first US case to reach the stage of determining whether victims have a claim against the Vatican for allegedly failing to alert police or the public about Roman Catholic priests who molested children .
In Germany , Hildegard Sedlmayr , 48 , a former resident of the home in the Bavarian town of Schrobenhausen , where Bishop Mixa was a priest , told Süddeutsche Zeitung that at age 15 , the bishop dragged her from her bed and punched her repeatedly on the arm .
" He grabbed me by the nightshirt , pulled me up out of my bed and punched me repeatedly on the upper arm .
Afterwards it was covered in bruises , " she said .
" The two years at St Josef 's were the worst in my life . "
Another former St Josef 's resident , named as Thomas Huber , said he was in pain for " several days " after Bishop Mixa flogged him .
" I was made to bend over a bench , then Mixa hit me 35 times with a carpet beater , " he said .
Three other former residents said Bishop Mixa habitually punished children with slaps to the face , punches to the arms , and beatings .
The former residents claimed that Catholic nuns who ran the home also hit children with brooms and wooden shoes .
When physicists puzzle out the workings of some new part of nature , that knowledge can be used to build devices that do amazing things -- airplanes that fly , radios that reach millions of listeners .
When we come to understand how brains function , we should become able to build amazing devices with cognitive abilities -- such as cognitive cars that are better at driving than we are because they communicate with other cars and share knowledge on road conditions .
In 2008 , the National Academy of Engineering chose as one of its grand challenges to reverse - engineer the human brain .
When will this happen ?
Some are predicting that the first wave of results will arrive within the decade , propelled by rapid advances in both brain science and computer science .
This sounds astonishing , but it ’s becoming increasingly plausible .
So plausible , in fact , that the great race to reverse - engineer the brain is already triggering a dispute over historic “ firsts . ”
The backdrop for the debate is one of dramatic progress .
Neuroscientists are disassembling brains into their component parts , down to the last molecule , and trying to understand how they work from the bottom up .
Researchers are racing to work out the wiring diagrams of big brains , starting with mice , cats and eventually humans , a new field called connectomics .
New techniques are making it possible to record from many neurons simultaneously , and to selectively stimulate or silence specific neurons .
There is an excitement in the air and a sense that we are beginning to understand how the brain works at the circuit level .
Brain modelers have so far been limited to modeling small networks with only a few thousand neurons , but this is rapidly changing .
Meanwhile , digital computers are increasing exponentially in processing power , memory storage and communications bandwidth .
Up until recently , this was accomplished by accelerating the clock speed , which has leaped from kilohertz to gigahertz in my lifetime .
But computer clocks have plateaued and now , advances in computing power are coming from increases in the number of processors and improved abilities to distribute a problem across them .
The fastest supercomputers have hundreds of thousands of processors , and graphics processing units ( GPUs ) give desktop personal computers the same speed that supercomputers had ten years ago .
If Moore ’s Law of exponential growth in computing power does not break down first , at some point computers should become powerful enough , and our knowledge of the brain should be complete enough , to build devices based on the principles of neural computation .
Like brains , these devices will be based on probabilistic rather than deterministic logic and will reason inductively rather than deductively .
Now , to the dispute , widely known as the “ catfight . ”
Last November , IBM researcher Dharmendra Modha announced at a supercomputing conference that his team had written a program that simulated a cat brain .
This news took many by surprise , since he had leapfrogged over the mouse brain and beaten other groups to this milestone .
For this work , Modha won the prestigious ACM Gordon Bell prize , which is awarded to recognize outstanding achievement in high - performance computing applications .
However , his audacious claim was challenged by Henry Markram , a neuroscientist at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the leader of the Blue Brain project , who announced in 2009 that : " It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years . " .
In an open letter to IBM Chief Technical Officer Bernard Meyerson , Markram accused Modha of “ mass deception ” and called his paper a “ hoax ” and a “ scam . ”
This has become a cause célèbre in the blogosphere and remains a hot topic among those of us who inhabit the intersection of brain and computer science .
The crux of the dispute is :
What does it mean to model the cat brain ?
Both groups are simulating a large number of model neurons and connections between them .
Both models run much , much slower than real time .
The neurons in Modha ’s model only have a soma -- the cell body containing the cell nucleus -- and simplified spikes .
In contrast , Markram ’s model has detailed reconstructions of neurons , with complex systems of branching connections called dendrites and even a full range of gating and communication mechanisms such as ion channels .
The synapses and connections between the neurons in Modha ’s model are simplified compared to the detailed biophysical synapses in Markram ’s model .
These two models are at the extremes of simplicity and complex realism .
This controversy puts into perspective a tension between wanting to use simplified models of neurons , in order to run simulations faster , versus including the biological details of neurons in order to understand them .
Looking at the same neuron , physicists and engineers tend to see the simplicity whereas biologists tend to see the complexity .
The problem with simplified models is that they may be throwing away the baby with the bathwater .
The problem with biophysical models is that the number of details is nearly infinite and much of it is unknown .
How much brain function is lost by using simplified neurons and circuits ?
This is one of the questions we might be able to answer if we could get Modha and Markram to directly compare their models .
Unfortunately , the large - scale simulations from both groups at present resemble sleep rhythms or epilepsy far more closely than they resemble cat behavior , since neither has sensory inputs or motor outputs .
They are also missing essential subcortical structures , – such as the cerebellum that organizes movements , the amygdala that creates emotional states and the spinal cord that runs the musculature .
Nonetheless , from Modha ’s model we are learning how to program large - scale parallel architectures to perform simulations that scale up to the large numbers of neurons and synapses in real brains .
From Markram ’s models , we are learning how to integrate many levels of detail into these models .
In his paper , Modha predicts that the largest supercomputer will be able to simulate the basic elements of a human brain in real time by 2019 , so apparently he and Markram agree on this date ; however , at best these simulations will resemble a baby brain , or perhaps a psychotic one .
There is much more to a human brain than the sum of its parts .
Of course , it may not be necessary or desirable to build a cat or a human brain , since we already have fully functional cats and humans .
This technology could , however , enable other applications .
In 2005 , Simon Haykin , director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at McMaster University , wrote an influential article called “ Cognitive radio : Brain - empowered wireless communications ” which laid the groundwork for a new generation of wireless networks that use computational principles from brains to predictively model the use of the electromagnetic spectrum , and are more efficient at using the bandwidth than current standards .
This is not pie in the sky .
Plans to deploy early versions of these intelligent communications systems in the next federal auction of the electromagnetic spectrum were discussed at a recent meeting of the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology with President Obama .
Soon to come are similar ways to enhance other utilities , such as the “ cognitive power grid , ” and other devices , such as the cognitive car .
The sensorium and motorium of these cognitive systems will be the infrastructure of the world .
Sensors will stream information -- on the use of electricity , road conditions , weather patterns , the spread of diseases -- and use this information to optimize goals , such as reducing power usage and travel time , by regulating the flow of resources .
Parts of this system are already in place but there is as yet no central nervous system to integrate this torrent of information and take appropriate actions .
Someday soon , it appears , there will be .
And gradually , as it increasingly mimics the workings of our brains , the world around us will become smarter and more efficient .
As this cognitive infrastructure evolves , it may someday even reach a point where it will rival our brains in power and sophistication .
Intelligence will inherit the earth .

There 's something deeply unsettling about Twitter 's new crackdown on publishers who run ads through Twitter .
Actually there are many things that are unsettling about it .
1. First , it 's not at all clear what the new policy is .
They 've said you have to share revenue with them if you run ads through Twitter .
But is it an ad if I pass through a link to a page with an ad on it ?
2 . They said , in a phone interview , they 'll only ask for money from people who do a lot of this .
What about Huffington Post ?
We love them , they say .
But they do n't say they wo n't ask for a cut .
3 . This new policy totally contradicts everything they 've been saying about developers and publishers over the years .
Okay they do n't have to be consistent .
What will they change next ?
4 . Twitter is gradually encroaching on the roles of its developers , publishers , even plain old users .
Where does this end ?
My prediction :
It ends with us all being couch potatoes .
Watching the Britney Spears Channel or the Barack Obama Channel or the Comcast Cares Channel , and going elsewhere for the free - for - all that Twitter used to be .
5 . Very ironic that Dick Costolo is the guy implementing this .
His Feedburner company could have chipped in a percent of revenue to help RSS , because without our work to create an open format for him to build on , he would n't have had a business .
His pitch sounds like the one I would have made if we had talked before he launched Feedburner .
6 . The biggest difference between an open platform and a corporate - owned platform -- he can change the rules after we 've all invested .
With an open platform , you know the rules when you start , and they can't be changed later .
7. Tomorrow I 'm giving a talk at the NY Times about platforms for publishing .
We will talk about this .
Publishers can not depend on Twitter to be a steady platform that will be fair to them .
Twitter might claim the right to charge the Times to push links to its stories through Twitter because they all have ads on them .
If not today , sometime down the road .
The Times owns its own printing press , for good reason .
It should own its own digital press as well .
A few questions came up during the webinar this afternoon that we did n't have a chance to get to .
1. I talked about a poll of Texans about evolution .
Someone asked for the source of the chart I showed .
Here it is .
I used this poll mainly to illustrate the fact that being a journalist who writes about evolution in the United States is an inherently interesting job .
( You get really interesting comments , for example . )
But I do n't think that Texas warrants singling out , judging by nationwide polls .
I also get annoyed when pollsters ask questions that demonstrate that they do n't understand evolution very well .
Walk into a museum with a good dinosaur exhibit , and you 'll discover that birds are dinosaurs .
And so , if someone changed that statement to " Humans and dinosaurs live at the same time , " and asked me if I agreed with it , I 'd say , " You betcha ! "
2 . Another person asked how much space in The Tangled Bank I spend on the mechanisms of evolution , such as epistasis , fitness landscapes , evolvability , modularity , and genotype - phenotype maps .
The answer is that I lay out some of the fundamental mechanisms , such as selection and drift , and try to delve into mechanisms that have been investigated more recently -- without turning the book into a textbook for biology majors , instead of the non-majors book that it is .
So , rather than deriving theorems , I tend to use illustrations , metaphors , and specific biological examples to get the concepts across .
3 . A third person mentioned that she does research on the teaching and learning of evolution , and wondered if I would consider writing a book specifically for teachers to help them teach evolution .
I 'm no expert on pedagogy ( which is why I had a board of advisers for The Tangled Bank made up of scientists who not only do important research on evolution but also teach non-majors ) .
Fortunately , there are already lots of resources out there intended specifically for teachers , such as Understanding Evolution .
( Full disclosure : I wrote the history sections on the site , and my chapter on evolutionary medicine can be downloaded for free there . )
Thanks again to AIBS , Chris Mooney , and all the people who joined us .
It was my first webinar experience , and it was not only painless , but downright enjoyable .
And congratulations to the people who won copies of our books !
Update : 8:15 pm. Jamie Vernon left a comment worth replying to at length :
Hi Carl , I truly respect what you have done for science communication , however I must take exception to your implication that humans walk with dinosaurs .
Dinosaurs ?
Really ?
“ Terrible lizards ? ”
You see , I live and teach in Texas so I see on a regular basis the problems of improper science education .
Now , I can appreciate the humor in that statement and the provocative nature of it , but for those who clearly do n’t understand evolution , it can be confusing and misleading .
I assume when you agree that “ humans walk with dinosaurs ” meaning birds , you intend to provoke the question , “ Really ?
How ?
Where ? ”
Unfortunately , not everyone is as inquisitive as you might think .
This leaves us , teachers , to clean up the mess .
The statement is n’t anymore true than someone who says , “ humans descended from chimpanzees . ”
So , the least you could do is clarify by stating that “ humans walk with the descendants of dinosaurs . ”
Eh ?
No , humans walk with dinosaurs .
It would not be true to say that humans walk with other species of dinosaurs , such as Tyrannosaurus rex or Velociraptor .
But birds are dinosaurs , too .
That is , they belong to the group of species defined as dinosaursbypaleontologists , based on their shared common ancestry .
The statement " humans walk with dinosaurs " is not analogous to " humans descended from chimpanzees . "
That would be like saying " birds descended from Tyrannosaurus rex . "
Birds are dinosaurs in the same way humans are mammals .
This statement is not misleading , nor is it intended merely to provoke .
It 's just an accurate depiction of the state of the science today .
It problably comes as a surprise to many students , but that makes it -- as they say - - a teachable moment .
The link to the American Museum of Natural History web site I provided above offers some good information to help students understand this statement .
It 's also something I discuss in The Tangled Bank .
Here 's an evolutionary tree I put together with the help of paleontologists to get this across ...
Enterprising hobbyists Tim Heath and Ryan Hickman have created cellbots — with names like Tankbot and Truckbot — that are simply robots powered by Android devices .
With just $ 30 , an Android device , and a little creativity the pair were able to create the cellbots that process commands via telnet on PCs .
The bots can move around in specified directions thanks to the built - in compass functionally on certain Android phones .
While actual robot activity is minimal , the focus of the project was to utilize Android phones as the brains of the robots .
The pair hope to expand robot functionality and make the most of Android 's software .
Wired speculates that :
" This means they could utilize every hardware and software component of an Android phone , programming the bot to avoid obstacles , recognize faces and voices , pinpoint its location and go places . "
Heath and Hickman have documented the entire project on their cellbots website , which means that with the right know - how you too could create your own Android - powered robot .

Woman banned from every bar and pub in the country appears in court AGAIN for drunken behaviour
Drink ban : Laura
Hall was told she could drink herself to death if she did n't address her alcohol problem , as she appeared in court yesterday
The first person banned from buying or drinking alcohol anywhere in England was branded ' all that is despicable and rotten in society ' by a judge as she appeared in court yet again on drinking charges .
Laura Hall , 20 , appeared in court yesterday for drunk and disorderly behaviour days after she was banned from every pub , club and bar in in the country .
She pleaded guilty to the charge , which related to an incident on April 11 - several days before the ban was handed down .
District judge Bruce Morgan , at Redditch Magistrates Court , warned Hall she would end up dead if she continued with her behaviour .
Revealing her 26 convictions , which included assault , attacking police officer , criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly , he said : ' I do n't think I have seen a more deplorable record for a member of the public . '
' A female with a record like this - it 's absolutely despicable and represents all that is rotten in society nowadays .
' What are you , 20 or thereabouts , and you have 12 convictions for drunk and disorderly , let alone convictions for violence and criminal damage .
' If you behave like this you are going to drink yourself to death before long .
' You ca n't go on behaving like this in public - it must be a frightening sight to say you in full sail behaving in a violent and aggressive manner .
He fined her £ 75 for the offence and £ 100 in costs .
Hall had been drunk in the town centre when police spotted her acting up outside a club .
Prosecutor Claire Linehan said : ' At 1.30 am on April 11 was intoxicated in was in the town centre of Redditch .
' Police were watching disorder when they saw her and that she had been ejected from a nightclub .
' There had clearly been an incident with her and a member of staff .
' She was trying to grab the person so the police intervened and that aggression was then turned on them . '
' This hearing comes of course within a matter of days of the imposition of a community order with a requirement of supervision and alcohol treatment . '
Hall 's ban was issued by Kidderminster Magistrates last Thursday and stops her buying alcohol anywhere in the country .
Police applied to magistrates after Hall was convicted of breaching an Asbo imposed for drink - related anti-social behaviour .
She has been convicted of a series of public order offences , and had flouted bans from pubs and clubs through local Pub - Watch schemes in her home town of Bromsgrove , Worcestershire .
She faces a £ 2,500 fine if she breaks the conditions of the order .
It could be lifted after one year as long as she completes an alcohol - misuse course and has not breached any conditions .
Richard Hull said his client had now been enrolled in alcohol treatment problem .
' Whilst the court recognises she does have a deplorable I would suggest there is real cause for optimism .
' Laura Hall recognises there has to be a change in her attitude and behaviour in light of the events of the last few weeks .
' She is no longer welcome at her parents ' address because of her behaviour , but she is staying with a variety of friends who will accommodate her . '
Outside court
Hall refused to talk about the sentence or the ban .
OAKLAND , Calif . —
A San Francisco woman who says she was molested by the Oakland priest at the center of a case that has raised questions about Pope Benedict XVI ’s handling of sexually abusive clergy members described in vivid terms on Sunday how she was sexually abused and intimidated by her attacker .
The woman , Melinda Costello , said she had been abused for several years , beginning at age 7 , as a parishioner in nearby Fremont , Calif. , where the Rev. Stephen Kiesle was working at a church as a seminarian in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Ms. Costello , now 48 and on disability because of arthritis , says that Mr. Kiesle — who was ordained as a priest in 1972 — first playfully invited her to sit on his lap , part of a youthful demeanor that he fostered , she said , including wearing purple tennis shoes in church .
“ He was considered to be the Pied Piper , ” Ms. Costello recalled in an interview .
“ He was a kid .
And who does n’t like a big kid ? ”

It is n't enough to choose the best angle from which to take a photograph , it 's also essential to know how to capture a precise moment .
In that , Cartier - Bresson had a point .
And , even though , at times , the photographer is extremely lucky and all he has to do is press a button to capture an unrepeatable occurence , most often , the patience and the preparation to obtain a photo of a given predictable moment are due to the photographer 's own personal achievement .
And so , nearly surreal images are created ...
There are even those who dedicate themselves , with a bit of sadism , to capturing people in awkward or ridiculous situations , and not even animals escape these photographers ' sharp sense of humour .
Alas , let us believe most of these images are sheer coincidence and the result of a random shot . ;)
These excelent photographs are from Matt Stuart .
The best part is not , curiously , the adorable Gator or his walk ... but rather knowing the look my friends will get when I share this with them .
You have not only made my day but likely my next two or three depending on how quickly I can find my friends .
If this is your analytical frame , and you ask how any other individual might have done in his position , then Obama 's foreign policy looks pretty good .
First , some negatives .
Obama was overly ambitious in his first year , launching a number of initiatives that have come to nought .
He has very little to show , for example , for his efforts at Middle East peacemaking .
Henry Kissinger said the President " reminds me of a chess grandmaster who has played his opening in six simultaneous games .
But he has n't completed a single game and I 'd like to see him finish one . "
Obama 's signature note - engagement with America 's competitors and adversaries - has been held a little too long .
Reaching out to China and Russia has produced mixed results ; reaching out to trumped - up tinpot dictators has produced nothing .
Indeed , Hugo Chavez , of Venezuela , who only months ago told Obama '' I want to be your friend ' ' , now refers to the satanic smell of sulphur when Obama is in the room .
Let us be clear : careful , even cautious , diplomacy is much to be preferred over swaggering rhetoric and impulsive wars .
But not all international problems are susceptible to rational agreement in the absence of leverage and pressure .
We have not yet seen Obama put the weights on his foreign interlocutors in the way that he must .
Finally , the President has struggled to strike the right balance between counter - terrorist imperatives on the one hand and his liberal instincts on the other , as demonstrated by his failure to close the Guantanamo Bay facility within a year .
This dilemma is not going away .
It is profoundly worrying that , eight years after September 11 , 2001 , al - Qaeda could get as close to detonating an inbound aircraft as it did on Christmas Day .
This is not Obama 's fault , but it is now his responsibility .
On the other side of the ledger , a welcome pragmatism was evident in several of Obama 's big foreign policy decisions , starting with him appointing his defeated opponent , Hillary Clinton , as his Secretary of State .
Clinton is not just smart and hard - working ; she is one of the most significant political figures of our time , who won millions of votes for president .
Her appointment brought significant prestige to the State Department .
Obama 's Iraq exit strategy ( which built on progress in the last years of the Bush administration ) looks , so far , to have been prudent and well - executed .
His record on trade has been reasonable , certainly compared with the prevailing sentiment among his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill .
He has demonstrated an early and strong commitment to Asia .
Australia is remarkably fortunate that the US has a president who spent his formative years in Indonesia , and a Secretary of State who cares enough to want to visit Papua New Guinea .
The President 's preparedness to use force - for example , his expansion of drone strikes against militants in Pakistan - has been one of the less predictable elements of his foreign policy given the strong signals he sent during the campaign about the need to rebalance US policies away from a reliance on force .
The decision to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan - the second major deployment to that country since he assumed office - demonstrated real courage .
Before his West Point speech , polls indicated that Democrats disagreed by more than two - to - one that the Afghanistan war was worth fighting .
This war will be devilishly hard to win , but Obama 's brave decision gives the US military a chance to do so .
Finally , Obama has shown a steady temperament under fire , and he has achieved a new tone in US diplomacy .
He has helped to shift global perceptions of America .
Here in Australia , the Lowy Institute Poll last year found that 85 per cent of the adult population believes the Australia - US alliance is very or fairly important for Australia 's security - a surge of 22 points since 2007 .
This is the highest level of support recorded for the alliance since polling began five years ago and the first time that a majority of Australians have said that the alliance with the US is " very important " .
Does America 's improved standing translate automatically into increased influence ?
No , but you 'd prefer to have it than not .
It is much too early to see the fruits of Obama 's foreign policy approach .
He has yet to be fully tested by a full - blown crisis , and he faces enormous challenges in the two countries in which the US is fighting nasty wars ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) and a third where it may still have to do so ( Iran ) .
The Administration will also find it increasingly difficult to square the circle of human rights and national interests .
Yet Obama has established a promising foreign policy template .
At the same time in his presidency , by contrast , the seeds of George Bush 's foreign policy failures had already been sown .
From the first , his presidency displayed a unilateral cast .
Coalition forces won early victories in Afghanistan but Osama bin Laden slipped through their grasp at Tora Bora .
The problems that would curse the Afghanistan effort - insufficient forces , funding and focus - were already becoming apparent , as Bush began to turn his attention to the misbegotten Iraq adventure .
Obama has made mistakes in the past year , but nothing to compare with his predecessor's .
Perhaps Obama 's biggest concern as he kicks off 2010 is domestic politics , and in particular his recent run of negative opinion polls .
He will be cheered , however , by the underwhelming list of potential Republican candidates for his job in three years ' time .
When he was asked recently to grade his own performance in the White House , Obama gave himself a ' ' solid B- plus ' ' .
It seems that this former law professor is a fair marker .

Daniel Craig made his Bond debut in Casino Royale in 2006
The production of the next James Bond film has been suspended " indefinitely " because of uncertainty over the future of film company MGM , producers say .
Producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they did not know when work on the 23rd Bond film would resume and there was no date for its release .
The latest Bond , due to star Daniel Craig as 007 for the third time , had been due out in 2011 or 2012 .
James
Bond is one of the longest running franchises in film history .
Wilson and Broccoli , of EON Productions , said : " Due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the future of MGM and the failure to close a sale of the studio , we have suspended development on Bond 23 indefinitely . "
Daniel Craig , who made his Bond debut in Casino Royale in 2006 , said : " I have every confidence in Barbara and Michael 's decision and look forward to production resuming as quickly as possible . "
WILL WE SEE BOND 23 ?
Work started on the film almost immediately after Quantum Of Solace hit cinemas
The script is by Frost / Nixon writer Peter Morgan and 007 regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade
It was due for release in 2012 - the 50th anniversary of Dr No No director was hired , but Sam Mendes was in talks Film studio MGM put itself up for sale in November 2009 With debts of $ 3.7bn ( £ 2.4 bn ) the studio may be unable to fund a new Bond film until it finds a buyer MGM could also sell the Bond franchise to raise capital Industry experts say " nobody doubts " Daniel Craig will eventually return as the super - spy Craig is the sixth actor to play the British secret agent on the big screen , after Sean Connery , George Lazenby , Roger Moore , Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan .
His first outing , in Casino Royale , was the most successful instalment in the franchise 's 48 - year history , taking $ 594 m ( £ 385 m ) at the global box office .
There is little doubt he will eventually return to the role , said Helen O'Hara from film magazine Empire - either with the backing of MGM or another film company .
" The last two films have done phenomenally well , and the series is a very reliable performer , " she told the BBC .
" If the Bond franchise went up for sale I do n't think there 'd be any problem at all . "
Work on the latest film was still in the early stages , Ms O'Hara added .
" I 'm not sure they were very far on , " she said .
" The Bond machine is always in motion and it felt like it was just beginning to heat up .
" You were beginning to have the inevitable and endless casting rumours - Rachel Weisz had been mentioned - because the British press goes nuts for it . "

EON productions holds the rights to Ian Fleming 's works - including the Bond series and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - while film studio MGM owns the rights to the Bond film franchise .
The studio is also home to the Pink Panther and has a stake in the forthcoming Hobbit movie .
It is saddled with $ 3.7 bn ( £ 2.4 bn ) debt , and has been trying to find a buyer since last year .
Several companies have expressed an interest - but offers are thought to be significantly below the $ 2bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) sought by MGM and its debt holders .

Greens Senator Bob Brown says it is horrendous that a New Zealand anti-whaling activist is facing the prospect of a lengthy jail term in Japan .
Sea Shepherd activist Peter Bethune jumped on board a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters about a month after his ship was destroyed in a clash with the whalers .
A series of recommendations by the Japanese coastguard , obtained by the ABC , urges prosecutors to charge Mr Bethune with damaging property , obstructing the business of the whaling fleet , carrying a knife and causing bodily injury .
The charge of causing bodily injury could incur a maximum prison sentence of 15 years .
Senator Brown says it seems to have been forgotten that the Japanese whalers ran down Mr Bethune 's ship , the Ady Gil , endangering the lives of the six people on board .
He says Mr Bethune and his crew were almost killed when the Shonan Maru II rammed their ship .
" It 's time that Canberra and Wellington took up that matter with the Japanese government and with great vigour prosecute the Shonan Maru 's captain and his crew , who took part in that illegal act in destroying the Ady Gil , " he said .
Senator Brown is urging Australia take retaliatory legal action .
" The Australian Federal Police and the New Zealand police are investigating that sinking of the Ady Gil and the Australian and New Zealand governments should be pursuing with great vigour that investigation and charges against the whaling fleet , " he said .
The Japanese coastguard alleges Mr Bethune used a knife to cut through a net and board the whaling ship .
It also claims he threw containers of butyric acid , or rancid butter , against the side of the ship , splattering a crewman and injuring his face .
Mr Bethune has defended his actions , claiming his intent was to make a citizen 's arrest of captain Hiroyuki Komiya for what he says was the attempted murder of his six crew .
After boarding the whaling ship , Mr Bethune also presented the Japanese whalers with a $ US3 million ( $ 3.27 million ) bill for the futuristic carbon - and - kevlar trimaran , which sank in the icy waters a day after the collision on January 6 .
Avondale police arrested Agua Fria High School 's special education department chairman Monday on suspicion of raping a 15 - year - old female student , authorities said .
Brian Willner , 35 , was booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail on one count each of sexual assault and sexual abuse of a minor .
He was arrested at his Litchfield Park home at 1:15 p.m. , Avondale police spokesman Rueben Gonzales said .
The girl , a special education student , told her mom on April 16 that Willner raped her at the Avondale school a few weeks earlier , according to an Avondale police report .
The report gives the following account :
Willner excused the girl from class and brought her into his office .
He grabbed her by the arms and took her to the ground .
She told officers " she was unable to defend herself because she was not strong enough " and " she felt a lot of pain . "
The girl confronted Willner about the alleged rape .
He threatened to " kill " her mother if she told anyone what happened .
Once her mom found out , she brought her daughter to Banner Boswell Medical Center in Sun City and called police .
A nurse examined the girl and found evidence of rape through internal bruising and cuts .
She also tested positive for Chlamydia .
Interviewed at the police station , Willner denied raping the girl .
He volunteered to a " computer voice stress analysis test , " which showed " deception with answers pertaining to " the rape accusations , the report states .
Investigators obtained a court order to test Willner for Chlamydia , which came back positive Monday .
The girl " suffers " from bipolar disorder , psychosis and ADHD , according to the police report .
Police believe the alleged rape was a one - time occurrence , but are looking into the possibility of additional victims .
Dennis Runyan , superintendent of the Agua Fria Union High School District , told The Arizona Republic on Monday afternoon that Willner had been on paid leave from the school , 530 E. Riley Drive , since police " requested an opportunity to speak with him " Friday .
District and school officials said they 'll cooperate fully with police during the investigation .
Runyan said a letter will be sent home to parents Tuesday .
" The school has made appropriate arrangements to cover the teacher 's classes and other professional responsibilities , " Runyan wrote in a statement Monday .
" Our Number One priority is always the safety of all of our students . "
Willner started his career in the Litchfield Elementary School District in 2002 and worked in special education programs at Verrado Elementary School in Buckeye and White Tanks Learning Center near Buckeye .
" I thought he always made decisions in the best interests of our kids .
He was a good employee , " said Heather Cruz , Litchfield 's assistant superintendent , who was Verrado Elementary School 's principal while Willner worked there .
Willner left Litchfield in 2008 because of " other opportunities , " according to his resignation letter obtained by The Republic .
Agua Fria High School Principal Matt Smith hired Willner in 2008 .
Again over the last few days , we 've been reminded that opponents of reform will say and do anything , no matter how outrageous the charge , to cast doubt on health reform legislation that will reduce costs for American families and small businesses , expand coverage to millions of Americans and end the worst practices of insurance companies .
In the latest example from an ever - growing list of willful distortions , the American people are being warned that because of health care reform , the federal government will hire over 16,000 new IRS agents to enforce the new law .
Indeed , in a March 22 interview with Fox Business News , Rep. Ron Paul declared that the bill would mean “ 16,500 armed bureaucrats . ”
This is a thoroughly debunked charge that has absolutely no basis in reality .
In fact , earlier this week the widely - respected FactCheck.org looked into this charge and concluded that it was a “ wildly inaccurate … partisan assertion ” that is “ based on guesswork and false assumptions , and compounded by outright misrepresentation . ”
FactCheck concluded : the “ claim of 16,500 new agents simply lacks any foundation in fact . ”
What makes this whole attempt at fear mongering even more ridiculous is that this legislation represents the largest middle class tax cut for health care in our nation ’s history .
The major task of IRS employees that will work on implementing this legislation will be to inform the American people of the different aspects of reform that they stand to benefit from and to make sure the historic health care tax relief is administered smoothly and efficiently .
Indeed their first task is to inform millions of small business owners that they are eligible this year for tax credits that will cover up to 35 percent of their premium contributions for their employees and to start planning for delivering $ 400 billion in affordability tax credits the IRS will work with the health exchanges to deliver starting in 2014 .
Getting the word out about these tax credits and delivering them smoothly and accurately will require relatively modest investments in technology and staff – even if that is less interesting to some than their fantasies about 16,000 gun-toting bureaucrats .
What ’s clear from all of this is that there are people who refuse to have a debate on the merits of health care reform .
Maybe that ’s because these ardent defenders of the status quo are worried about the consequences of stopping at nothing to deny the American people quality and affordable health insurance .

There is an element of irony in the crisis of relations between the Obama administration and Israel .
On the one hand , although President Barack Obama and his advisers deny there is anything wrong with US - Israel relations today , it is easy to understand why no one believes them .
On the other hand , on most issues , there is substantive continuity between Obama ’s Middle East policies and those his immediate predecessor , George W. Bush , adopted during his second term in office .
Yet , whereas Israelis viewed Bush as Israel ’s greatest friend in the White House , they view Obama as the most anti-Israel US president ever .
This contradiction requires us to consider two issues .
First , why are relations with the US now steeped in crisis ?
And second , taking a page out of Obama ’s White House chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel ’s playbook , how can Israel make sure not to let this crisis go to waste ?
The reason relations are so bad , of course , is that Obama has opted to attack Israel and its supporters .
In the space of the past 10 days alone , Israel has been subject to three malicious blows courtesy of Obama and his advisers .
First , during his visit to the White House last Tuesday , Obama treated Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu like a two - bit potentate .
Rather than respectfully disagree with the elected leader of a key US ally , Obama walked out in the middle of their meeting to dine with his family and left the unfed Netanyahu to meditate on his grave offense of not agreeing to give up Israel ’s capital city as a precondition for indirect , US - orchestrated negotiations with an unelected , unpopular Palestinian leadership that supports terrorism and denies Israel ’s right to exist .
Next , there was the somewhat anodyne – if substantively incorrect – written testimony by US Army Gen.
David Petraeus to the Senate about the impact of the Arab world ’s refusal to accept Israel ’s right to exist on US - Arab relations .
In the event , the administration deliberately distorted Petraeus ’s testimony to lend the impression that the most respected serving US military commander blames Israel for the deaths of US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan .
After Petraeus rejected that impression , his boss Defense Secretary Robert Gates repeated the false and insulting allegation against Israel in his own name .
Finally , there is the report this week inin which nameless administration sources accused National Security Council member Dennis Ross of “ dual loyalties .
” Ross , of course , has won fame for his career of pressuring successive Israeli governments into giving unreciprocated concessions to Palestinian terrorists .
Still , in the view of his indignant opponents in the Obama White House , due to his insufficient hostility to the Israeli government , Ross is a traitor .
If Ross wants to be treated like a real American , he needs to join Obama in his open bid to overthrow the elected government of Israel .
These moves would be sufficient to throw US - Israel relations into a tailspin .
When combined with the administration ’s ultimatum demanding a moratorium on Jewish construction in Jerusalem and its threat to coerce Israel into accepting an Obama plan for Palestinian statehood that will imperil Israel ’s security , it becomes abundantly clear that there is no way to make this crisis go away .
There is a crisis in US relations with Israel today because the president of the United States has very publicly taken a torch to those relations and he responds to any sign that the flames are waning by dousing fresh kerosene on the fire .
AND YET , when Obama ’s personal animus is set aside and one examines the substance of his actual policies , ironically , there is little difference between the current administration ’s policies and those of its immediate predecessor .
In his second term in office , Bush ignored the significance of Hamas ’s electoral victory in January 2006 and its takeover of Gaza in June 2007 .
The US expanded its training program for the Palestinian armed forces and pushed Israel to accept a framework for Palestinian statehood that would more or less push it back to the indefensible 1949 armistice lines .
From 2004 , the Bush administration sought to appease Iran into giving up its nuclear program – first indirectly through the negotiations that France , Britain and Germany conducted with Teheran .
Then , in 2006 , the administration began direct negotiations with the mullahs .
Bush personally rejected repeated Israeli requests to purchase refueling aircraft and bunker buster bombs necessary for attacking Iran ’s hardened nuclear facilities .
And he refused to back Israeli plans to attack Iran ’s nuclear installations .
So , too , Bush stopped calling for regime change in Iran .
After the November 2007 publication of the falsified National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’s nuclear program , Bush discarded the possibility of a US military strike against Iran ’s nuclear facilities altogether .
In the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian - and Syrian - proxy force Hizbullah , ignoring Hizbullah ’s membership in the Lebanese government and the Lebanese military ’s active support for Hizbullah ’s war effort , Bush forbade Israel from attacking Lebanese government targets .
In so doing , he forced Israel to fight a regional foe as if it were a local street gang and so rendered the ultimate result of that war – Israel ’s first strategic military defeat – a foregone conclusion .
Despite Syria ’s open sponsorship of the insurgency in Iraq , its strategic alliance with Iran , as well as its sponsorship of Hizbullah , Hamas and al - Qaida in Iraq and Lebanon , the Bush administration sought to prevent Israel from destroying Syria ’s Iranian - financed , North Korean - built nuclear installation .
After Israel destroyed the installation in September 2007 , the Bush administration demanded that Israel keep silent about the significance of the Iranian - North Korean - Syrian nuclear alliance .
Finally , the Bush administration denied the inherent hostility of the Islamist government in Turkey .
Instead it cultivated the fantasy that this anti-American , anti-Israel , Hamas - , Syria - and Iran - supporting regime is a trustworthy ally .
Israel went along with all of these US policies despite their strategic madness because Israel wanted to be a team player .
The Sharon and Olmert governments and the Israeli public as a whole believed that Israel had an ally in the Bush administration and that when push came to shove , the massive risks Israel took supporting the US ’s policies on Iran , Syria , Lebanon , Turkey and the Palestinians would be rewarded .
With Obama , of course , things are different .
Probably if Obama treated Israel with the same friendliness his predecessor showered on its leaders , Netanyahu would have been willing to walk the plank just as Ehud Olmert and Ariel Sharon did , in the interests of helping the team .
But what Obama has made clear in his mistreatment of Israel is that he does n’t want Netanyahu to walk the plank for the team .
He wants Israel off the team .
ALTHOUGH UNSETTLING , this dismal state of affairs has a bright side .
It provides Israel with a rare opportunity to stop acceding to US policies that are bad for Israel and the US alike .
After all , if the US is willing to instigate a crisis in its relations with Israel over plans to zone for housing units in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Ramat Shlomo and French Hill , then clearly Israel can do no right .
And if Israel can do no right in the eyes of the administration , then there is no point in bending to its will .
Instead , Israel must simply do what it must to secure its interests .
In the hope of winning over the Obama administration , Israel has kept the Iranian opposition at arm ’s length .
This should end .
Israel should employ covert and overt means to help Iran ’s Green Movement destabilize the Iranian regime with the aim of toppling it .
At the same time , Israel should employ covert and overt means to destroy Iran ’s nuclear installations .
This week , Sen. John Kerry travelled to Lebanon and Syria to raise the prospects of peace talks between Israel and both countries .
Rather than applaud his efforts , Israel should point out that Hizbullah controls the Lebanese government and that US support for the Lebanese military and government strengthens Hizbullah .
So , too , Israel should make clear that since Syrian dictator Bashar Assad is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s Arab water boy , it is preposterous to call for Israel to surrender the Golan Heights to his regime .
Instead of rehashing the same nonsense , Israel should actively support Syria ’s Kurds in their bid for autonomy and champion the cause of political prisoners languishing in Syrian jails .
Turkey ’s announcement this week that it supports Iran ’s nuclear ambitions should be recognized for what it was :
An announcement that the NATO member state has joined the Iranian axis with Syria , Lebanon , Hamas and Hizbullah .
Israel should respond to Turkey ’s announcement by announcing a moratorium on weapons sales to Turkey , and so end its counterproductive attempts to paper over the fact that its former strategic ally has become its enemy .
As for the Palestinians , rather than succumb to US demands in the interest of starting doomed - to - fail negotiations with Fatah , Israel should tell the truth .
It has nothing to negotiate about and no one to negotiate with .
Fatah ’s leaders Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad reject Israel ’s right to exist .
They support terrorism .
They already rejected a “ two - state solution ” less than two years ago .
Aside from that , they lack the support of their own electorate , which prefers Hamas ’s more direct approach to destroying Israel .
Instead of pretending that begging these impotent adversaries for peace serves its interests , Israel should get off its knees and adopt policies that will enhance its interests .
For instance , given that the Obama administration views Ramat Shlomo as the equivalent of Eli and E - 1 , Israel should build up the neighborhood in Eli that was home to fallen IDF commanders Majors Roi Klein and Eliraz Peretz and implement its construction plans for E - 1.
Ironically , all of these policies are consonant not only with Israel ’sstrategic needs , but with the US ’s own strategic interests .
And sinceObama ’s hostility to Israel is not subject to change , rather than focuson winning over the White House , the Netanyahu government should devoteits energies to selling its policies to the American people .
Repeatedpolls have shown that the American public supports an Israeli strikeagainst Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
By the same token , commonsensepolicies towards the likes of Fatah , Hamas , Hizbullah , Syria and Turkey , combined with the unapologetic assertion of Israel ’s rights inJerusalem , Judea and Samaria , will find a strong core of support in theUS that can offset some of the damage Obama is doing to US ties with Israel .
Although much maligned , Emmanuel ’s call not to let agood crisis go to waste can be taken as a crass way of saying thatevery cloud has a silver lining .
Israel did not ask for this fight withObama .
It would have been willing to keep up the fantasy that Bush ’ ssecond - term policies made sense .
But since a fight is what it got , Israel has no choice but to strike out on its own .
As it happens , ifIsrael does so , not only will it protect itself , it will protect the USfrom the dangerous policies its leader has opted to pursue .

HEALTH -CARE STOCKS WERE mostly up in midday trading Monday in the wake of the House of Representatives ' passage of historic health - care reform legislation
The S&P Health Care Index was up 0.45 % , in midday trading , led by big gains from hospitals stocks .
But drug makers and medical device makers were also up in midday trading .
All three health - care sectors have been viewed as winners under legislation which should add about 32 million Americans to the health - insurance rolls .
" Most of the industry wins from this legislation , " says Les Funtleyder , a health - care strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. , " But circumspect investors realize that it will take time for the legislation 's provisions to kick in .
Individual company fundamentals are what will drive share performance . "
Among the hospital companies , shares of Tenet Healthcare ( THC ) rose 7 % to $ 6.15 a share , while Health Management Associates ( HMA ) rose 7.5 % to $ 8.74 a share .
Medical device giant Medtronic ( MDT ) gained 2.9 % , while St. Jude Medical ( STJ ) , a competitor , rose 2.3 % to $ 40.25 a share .
Health - insurance stocks , however , were mixed in trading due to worries about Medicare cuts that are part of the health - care reform legislation and increased regulations facing the industry .
Humana ( HUM ) , one of the nation 's largest providers of private Medicare health plans , fell about 1 % to $ 49.45 a share while UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) and WellPoint ( WLP ) also lost a bit of ground .
Aetna ( AET ) and Cigna ( CI ) rose slightly in morning market action .
Aetna 's share price climbed 26 cents a share to $ 34.72 a share , while Cigna 's shares rose 12 cents to $ 37.20 .
On Sunday night , the House adopted the Senate 's health legislation on a dramatic 219 - to - 212 vote .
A short while later , the House narrowly approved a companion bill making changes to the Senate legislation .
Those changes now head to the Senate , where action is expected this week .
The legislation will extend health coverage to millions of Americans now without insurance , making it possible for them to pay their hospital bills , buy medications and pay for laboratory tests and medical devices .
It will mandate that almost every American carry health insurance , expanding the health insurance market .
To help people get covered , the legislation provides subsidies to some families to buy insurance and expands Medicaid , the federal - state health program for the poor .
A popular provision requires insurance companies to accept all comers , even people who are already sick .
And insurers will be required to sell their policies for individuals and small business in state - supervised marketplaces called exchanges .
The final legislation is far kinder to the health - care industry than many initially feared , a fact that fueled a rally in health - care stocks last week .
But the bill will actually have little impact on industry fundamentals anytime soon .
The bulk of the bill 's provisions will be implemented in 2014 .
And Republicans have vowed to repeal the legislation if they regain control of Congress during the mid-term elections in November .
Meanwhile , unemployment remains a big concern for health - care companies , especially hospitals laboring to reduce bad debt .
Still , health - care stocks remain cheap , trading at just over 12 times forward earnings .
And Legg Mason fund manager Bill Miller told Reuters that he sees cheap health - care stocks performing well in the coming months .
Shares of Merck & Co. ( MRK ) rose 2.1 % to $ 38.90 a share , while drug giant Pfizer ( PFE ) climbed 1.8 % .

The victory of Republican Charles Djou in a special election in Hawaii ’s First Congressional District – the heavily Democratic district where President Obama grew up – is a welcome political reversal for the GOP .
In 2008 , Mr. Obama took the district with 70 percent of the vote , and no Hawaiian congressional district had returned a Republican for 20 years .
Moreover , the victory stopped a surprising winning streak for Democrats , who had won the past seven consecutive special elections for Congress , including three prominent races – two in upstate New York and one in Pennsylvania – in areas that tilt conservative .
Taking his cues from another Republican who won in firmly Democratic territory – Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts – Djou saw the election as a repudiation of one - party rule .
" The congressional seat is not owned by one political party .
This congressional seat is owned by the people , " he said .
Djou , a member of the Honolulu City Council , will be only the third Republican to represent Hawaii in Washington since Hawaii became a state in 1959 .
But the Republicans will likely be careful not to tout the victory too loudly .
Mr. Djou won with less than 40 percent of the vote , with two Democratic challengers taking 58 percent .
The rules change for the November election , and only one Democrat will be able to challenge Djou for the seat .
Without two Democrats to split the vote between them , Djou knows that the math is against him .
" The voters gave us a short - term lease with an option to buy in November , " Djou said , according to the Honolulu Advertiser .
The race was to replace Democratic Rep. Neil Abercrombie , who resigned to run for governor .
Democratic state Senate President Colleen Hanabusa took 30.8 percent of the vote , and former US Rep. Ed Case took 27.6 percent .
Hawaii ’s most prominent Republican , Gov. Linda Lingle , said Djou must continue to put his state above his party if he wants to be reelected in November .
" What I did , and what he has done , is told people in a very sincere way , ' I 'll do what 's best for everybody , I 'm not going to go with any special interest , even if it 's my own party sometimes that might want me to do a certain thing , ' " Governor Lingle told the Advertiser .
Meanwhile , national Republicans sought to claim some measure of credit for their agenda .
" Charles ' victory is evidence his conservative message of lowering the tax burden , job creation , and government accountability knows no party lines , " said Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele in a statement .

UNITED NATIONS , New York ( WOMENSENEWS )
–At the start of Women ’s History Month in March , Margot Wallström began her two - year assignment to stop sexual violence from being used as a tactic in war–as a matter of global security .
Her job calls on her to implement U.N. Resolution 1888 , passed by the Security Council in September , one of the major milestones in women ’s history that her appointment culminates .
Before the late 1990s , sexual violence was n’t generally considered any kind of issue , says Anne- Marie Goetz , chief advisor of governance , peace and security for UNIFEM .
Rape camps in Bosnia were " horrifying " and systematic sexual violence in Rwanda was " on a level never seen before , " but indictments did n’t occur until years later , she said .
Neither peace agreement mentioned sexual violence .
Those charges brought public attention to convictions of three Bosnian Serbs for wartime sexual enslavement as a crime against humanity–a first for the International Criminal Tribunal–and led to Resolution 1325 .
Passed 10 years ago by the Security Council , the document articulated war ’s impact on women .
Though 1325 " lacked accountability measures to encourage progress , " said Letitia Anderson , it opened doors to a watershed 2008 conference about women in armed conflict , held in Wilton Park , England .
Anderson is an advocacy and women ’s rights specialist for U.N. Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict , a coalition of 13 U.N. entities .
The talks included " the unusual suspects –force commanders , military and police peacekeepers , " Anderson added .
Missing Link at Policy Level
Anderson presented a paper on the need for a " systematic framework to respond to these crimes , " which she called the missing link at the policy level .
Her message resonated and in August 2008 the Security Council passed Resolution 1820 , recognizing sexual violence as a war crime and a major impediment to peace .
In September 2009 , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presided over the Security Council ’s passing of 1888 , the agreement that Wallström is now charged with implementing .
Anderson likens 1820 to a " blueprint " of sexual violence ’s link to security ; 1888 provides the " building blocks " for its implementation .
Wallström , the former vice president of the European Council , says she knows that " beautiful language " in a number of " historic and groundbreaking " women , peace and security resolutions , including 1888 , does n’t immediately help the thousands of women who remain targets of sexual violence in armed conflict and post - conflict zones .
" We must create political ownership of this issue , where both men and women everywhere can say , ‘ Enough is enough .
We have to end this , ’" Wallström said in a recent telephone interview with Women ’s eNews .
" I am a person who knows how to cooperate , how to fully utilize the resources of everyone around me and to mobilize that .
That is what I can promise to bring . "
Wallström has said she will focus immediately on conflict and post - conflict situations in three African countries : the Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia and Sierra Leone .
Sexual violence in conflict zones , however , is n’t an " African issue , " Wallström is quick to point out , describing gender - based violence as a global " human rights issue , a security issue . "
Elisabeth Roesch , gender - based violence advocacy officer for the International Refugee Committee , based in New York , expressed confidence in the 55 - year - old Swedish politician .
" We ’ve never really had a champion , advocate or leader within the U.N. before to mobilize people and address sexual violence in conflict zones , " Roesch said in a telephone interview .
" It ’s a powerful , very real , position . "
Wish List for Wallström
Roesch ticked off some of the objectives she hopes Wallström will pursue : ending legal impunity of those who perpetrate sexual violence ; conducting an independent , external analysis of the U.N. ’s systematic response to sexual violence ; improving documentation of sexual violence ; and strengthening health services for survivors of abuse .
Inala Fathimath , a special funds consultant for the UNIFEM - Afghanistan program , based in Kabul , says better documentation is important in Afghanistan , where sexual violence in conflict zones is not yet well quantified .
" We do n’t have any statistics , but we certainly do have the accounts that sexual violence against women is widespread in conflict zones , " Fathimath said .
" It makes a huge difference just to have someone out there , solely dedicated to talking about these issues , and potentially bringing these concerns to the Security Council . "
Corinne Dufka , a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch , now based in Dakar , Senegal , emphasizes the need to end sex violators ’ legal impunity .
" We need more naming and shaming , " she said .
" In the Democratic Republic of Congo , we ’ve tried everything : public education , reports , humanizing the problem .
But what we need to do is engage more with men , at all levels , to really understand this problem from the perpetrators ’ narrative . "
Wallström herself stresses the importance of assembling a strong , diverse six - person staff to help her navigate the U.N. system .
Resolution 1888 does not address U.N. peacekeepers abusing the very women they are supposed to aid , says Goetz .
" That remains an enormous and serious issue . "
The U.N. has a zero- tolerance policy on peacekeepers inflicting sexual violence on others and handles allegations of exploitation and abuse in its Conduct and Discipline Unit .
After making its assessment , the unit defers to its member nations , which handle convicted peacekeepers in their own fashion , said Genevieve Butler , the Conduct and Discipline Unit ’s external affairs officer .
Amy Lieberman is a journalist based in New York City who writes primarily for a Brazilian newswire out of the U.N. Secretariat .

I know you ’ve heard of a woolly mammoth , but did you know there ’s actually such a thing as a woolly pig ?
Well , there is , and it ’s called Mangalitsa .
Seen from a distance , these pigs look like sheep , and it ’s only when you spot their snouts and hear their growl , that you realize they ’re actually pigs .
Commonly referred to as “ sheep - pigs ” these strange breed is called Mangalitsa , and it ’s on the brink of extinction .
That ’s right , even though their wool makes them very resistant , both in summer and winter time , it does n’t do a damn thing against man ’s appetite .
Mangalitsa pigs originated from Austria and Hungary , and they come in three color varieties : blond , brunette and redhead .
Apart from their bizarre appearance , these pigs have another trait that made them even more popular : their meat , apparently , tastes delicious and is considered a delicacy .

I literally do n’t know what to say about the Devils performance tonight .
At first , I was enraged by the lack of aggression and the Devils ’ lack of patience .
But now , after taking a break from hockey , I ’ve come to realize I ’m just shocked that the team can look this bad right now .
They ’ve scored the first goal in each of the past three games , but after that they ’ve failed to play a sixty - minute game .
After Ilya Kovalchuk lit the lamp , the Flyers scored four unanswered goals to sweep the two home games .
The Devils now head home with a 3 - 1 series deficit .
Key Moments :
1. Kovalchuk ’s 5 - on - 3 Powerplay Goal
The Devils wanted to come out in game four and be more aggressive in the Flyers ’ zone .
Two early penalty calls helped their cause , as the Devils received an early 5 - on - 3 powerplay opportunity .
With both Braydon Coburn and Chris Pronger in the box , the Devils took advantage of their opportunity .
Zach Parise sent a pass up the ice , springing the Devils on a 4 - on - 2 . Kovalchuk moved into the zone , and used a fake shot to freeze Blair Betts .
Kovalchuk cut to the right circle and fired a shot on net that beat Brian Boucher for Kovalchuk ’s second goal of the series .
2. Jeff Carter ’s Powerplay Goal
Down 1 - 0 , the Flyers began to press the Devils ’ defense and get quality scoring chances .
But Martin Brodeur was sharp , and it looked like he might steal the game .
But luck turned the Flyers ’ way with an interference penalty to Rob Niedermayer at 8:51 of the second period .
With Niedermayer in the box , Daniel Briere held the puck in the Devils zone .
He passed the puck to Carter , who was coming out from behind the net .
Carter skated the puck through the right circle , and released a shot that beat Brodeur for his first goal of the series .
3. Briere ’s Four - On-Four Goal
After their first goal , the Flyers ’ continued to pressure the Devils .
That effort would pay off , as the Flyers ’ would strike for their second goal of the period .
With Matt Carle and Travis Zajac in the box , Briere came down the ice with Coburn on a 2 - on - 2 . Coburn sent a pass to Briere on the left side .
Briere shot the puck from the side boards that beat Brodeur over the glove for his first goal of the series .
4 . The Flyers Kill of James van Riemsdyk ’s Penalty
James van Riemsdyk opened the door for the Devils at the end of the second period , taking a roughing minor with 4.6 seconds left .
The Devils would get nearly a full powerplay to start the third period .
But the Flyers did n’t allow the Devils to set up their powerplay .
They played aggressive defense , and in the end took the Devils chance away .
5. Daniel Carcillo Puts The Nail In The Coffin
It seemed like the penalty kill put the Flyers right back on track .
Carcillo scored the goal to figuratively end
the game , netting his second of the series at 4:10 of the period .
Carcillo began the play , hitting Colin White behind the net to jar the puck loose .
Carcillo curled to the side boards , and put a shot on net that beat Brodeur through the pads .
Where Has The Aggression Gone ?
The Devils began this game a desperate team .
They looked like they wanted a win .
They were buzzing , creating their own chances and making Boucher work for every save .
But , in the end , that play would disappear near the end of the first period .
After that , the Devils were badly outplayed .
Philadelphia received the better scoring chances and played a great game .
The Devils went back to putting easy shots on net and not pressuring Boucher .
They broke down defensively , allowing the Flyers to continually get quality scoring chances .
And while Brodeur was good , he was n’t the same Brodeur as Sunday night .
Philadelphia pounced on their opportunities , burying the Devils in the final two periods .
Wanted : An Effective Powerplay
Once again , the Devils teased us with their powerplay .
It looked so good at first , creating great chances and making the Flyers work to clear the puck .
But , by the end of the game , the Devils reverted back to their old form .
No more creativity , no more crisp passes .
The team just dumped the puck in , held on to it for too long , and made the Flyers ’ job easy on the penalty kill .
With the Flyers giving the Devils eight chances tonight , they once again let an opportunity pass .
The Devils are now 4 - 24 ( 16.7 % ) with the man advantage in the series .

Things I Liked :
1. Kovalchuk ’s First Period
Kovalchuk ’s first period was a great one .
The left - winger led all scorers with five shots on net , and he almost had two goals on the powerplay .
But he settled back into his disappearing role in the second and third periods .
When the Devils took a bench minor in the third period , Devils ’ coach Jacques Lemaire sent Kovalchuk to serve it .
If Kovalchuk had played the entire game like he did the first period , maybe he could have affected the outcome of the game .
But his first period was a solid period .
2. Brodeur ’s Play
Even though he was n’t as sharp as Sunday , Brodeur was the only one keeping the Devils in this game .
There ’s only so much you can ask the goalie to do , and Brodeur tried to do it all .
But when he receives no goal support and even less defensive help , you ’ve got to expect him to give up a few .
Things That Annoyed Me :
1. No Hustle , Aggression , Etc .
I do n’t want to beat a dead horse , but this team played like they had a 10 - goal lead and led the series , 3 - 1 , near the end of the first period .
I do n’t know what happens , but it seems like the Devils have motivation issues .
I do n’t know if this is a Lemaire issue , a Langenbrunner issue , or just something that ’s nagged this team the entire year , but it ’s been the main reason for their terrible two games in Philadelphia .
The Flyers ’ outhustled the Devils , beating them to every loose puck .
They made adjustments , they played solid defense , they ’ve done everything correct .
But the Devils have n’t been able to do any of those things , and now they face a 3 - 1 series deficit .
2. The Lack of Discipline
With the Devils down , 2 - 1 , in the third period , they decided to take a new approach to the comeback .
Instead of putting shots on net or pressuring the Flyers ’ defense , they took three minor penalties in the first half of the period , including giving the Flyers a 5 - on - 3 advantage .
As you might assume , it did n’t help matters at all .
Philadelphia went on to score twice more in the period , and the Devils would n’t come back .
The Devils would collect 28 – no , that ’s not a typo – penalty minutes , including two game misconduct penalties .
It ’s that lack of discipline which helped lose this game for the Devils tonight .
3. The Defensive Play
Where was the defense tonight ?
After the first period , it seemed the Devils ’ defense crumbled .
The Flyers received great scoring chances all night tonight .
Brodeur made up for their mistakes in Sunday night ’s game , but he could n’t do it two night in a row .
The defense was exposed tonight , and the group looked slow and unorganized .
Stat Pack :
The Devils are now 10 - 15 in their last 25 road playoff games .
With the loss , Brodeur drops to 0 - 5 in his last five playoff starts in Philadelphia .
The Flyers have defeated the Devils in eight of ten meetings this season , including the playoffs .
Next Game :
The Flyers and Devils will play game five at the Prudential Center Thursday at 7 p.m .
Indian police use truth serum to find clues in cases
India 's Supreme Court has said that the use of a " truth drug " by police in questioning suspects is illegal and a violation of their fundamental rights .
The court said a suspect 's consent was required to do the test and even then it could not be treated as evidence .
" Truth drug " test results have never been admissible in Indian courts but police say they have provided leads .
Correspondents say the ruling effectively means the police will no longer be able to do such tests .
" Narco , brain mapping and polygraph tests are illegal and a violation of personal liberty , " a three - judge bench headed by Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan ruled .
The court 's order came in response to petitions filed by several accused questioning the validity of such tests .
In the tests , a suspect is injected with sodium penthanol , a chemical that numbs powers of perception and supposedly makes it difficult for a person to lie during questioning .
The test results were never admissible in court as evidence , but police often made suspects take the tests in order to get " vital clues " in a case , correspondents say .
Such tests were conducted on Maoist leader Kobad Ghandy who was arrested last year .
They were also performed on two men accused of killing 17 young women and children in Noida , a suburb of the Indian capital , Delhi .

Battery farms are the mass warehouses where hens are kept in small cages laying eggs .
Just how bad the conditions are for these birds varies widely , however it is generally accepted that the battery cages are cruel .
In fact Switzerland banned them in 1992 .
A few other nations have followed suit , Germany , Belgium , Austria , Sweden , and the Netherlands .
Hens do not need roosters to lay eggs , they start laying at about five months of age and continue for several years , although laying production declines with age , and slows in the winter ( under normal lighting conditions ) and when moulting ( shedding feathers to grow new ones ) .
Battery hens are kept under unnatural light conditions and often killed at the end of their first laying season when they begin to moult ( hens normally live over 10 years ) .
photo source - " 95 % of egg laying hens in the United States spend their entire lives in a battery cage like this one .
6 - 8 birds are confined to a cage this size ; each bird having less room than a standard sheet of notebook paper to live her entire life .
In these crowded conditions , they are unable even to spread their wings .
In a battery situation the birds are kept many to a small cage .
In the European Union the cage standards call for at least 550 cm² , roughly 82 in² , or a space slightly larger than 12 inch x 12 inch .
In the USA , however , this minimum shrinks , allowing no less than 67 in² per bird , or 430 cm² , an area about 8 inches x 8 inches .
To understand how small this is , a sheet of regular paper is larger .
At one day old the birds are sexed , the females are kept , their beaks cut , and they are vaccinated .
The day old males become pet food .
The females are crowded through their growing stage and as they near maturity , are moved into the aforementioned battery cages .
It is a boring life , indeed the birds peck at each other because of lack of other stimulation .
Besides , pecking is natural .
This is why their beaks are cut .
If not , they will literally peck out the insides of other birds in their cage .
In the wild ( yes there are wild chickens ) the birds are not in such extreme confinement and only peck at each other to establish dominance .
Lesser birds can get away , and a healthy bird would not be killed in such a way .
The beaks are cut to avoid this from happening in battery farms .
photo source
The cages work in such a way that an egg , when laid , rolls into an opening at the bottom of the cage and is carried away on a conveyor belt .
The breed of chicken used in battery farms is not one of the breeds known as “ Broody ” birds .
They would normally not sit on an egg for much longer than an hour or two , however in this system a hen is not even allowed that luxury .
Battery hens are fed diets that are unnatural , and the birds muscles soon atrophy from a lack of exercise .
Due to the physical stress of egg laying they often develop a problem known as cage - layer osteoporosis , and may easily suffer from broken bones .
The reason small cages are used is simply so more hens can be kept in a smaller space .
This also saves money and time on clean up .
Sadly the welfare of the birds is of least consideration .

How to Make Life Better for Chickens
You have the power to change it with your purchasing dollar .
You can refuse to buy battery hen eggs .
You can lobby the policy makers in your area to change laws .
You can buy free range eggs ( there are different interpretations of what this means but all are better than conditions in battery cages ) .
You can keep your own free range hens ( check your local laws ) .
You can educate others by sharing links like this one that bring these issues to the forefront .
©photo by author .
I keep my own free range hens , I sell their eggs for $ 1 a dozen , I keep prices low because I want to encourage people not to buy battery hen eggs .
* NOTE : Egg shell color has nothing to do with if a hen is free range or battery , it only indicates the type of chicken that may have laid it .

OAKLAND — When his grandmother and grandfather died , Wayne Presley deeply wished to attend their funerals .
But Presley could n’t bring himself to walk through the church doors .
Inside , at the lectern , was the man who Presley said had sexually molested him as a child .
Presley on Sunday joined the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , a support organization of self - help groups , at a demonstration outside the Cathedral of Christ the Light , mother church to the 84 Catholic parishes that make up the Diocese of Oakland .
Members of SNAP expressed outrage , citing recent news stories exploring the extent of sexual and child abuse in Bay Area parishes .
The news stories have prompted a heated discussion of Pope Benedict XVI ’s role in a growing crisis facing the Catholic Church .
Presley , now a 51 - year - old Fremont resident , said he was in sixth grade when Monsignor Patrick O’Shea began abusing him .
“ He took me to ‘ The Exorcist ’ opening day — in his collar , ” Presley said .
“ I obviously never forgot that .
I could never watch that movie now . ”
Criminal charges were filed against O’Shea in 1994 , dropped and refiled , then dropped again , owing to a statute of limitations on abuses that O’Shea was accused of committing in the 1960s and 1970s .
Although O’Shea was never convicted , the Archdiocese of San Francisco in 2005 agreed to pay two brothers $ 2.6 million to settle their claims that O’Shea molested them in 1972 .
O’Shea could not be reached for comment on Sunday .
Also speaking at Sunday ’s news conference was a San Francisco woman who says she was molested by an Oakland priest .
She described in vivid terms how she was sexually abused and later intimidated by her attacker .
The woman , Melinda Costello , said she had been abused for several years , beginning at age 7 , as a parishioner in Fremont , where the Rev. Stephen Kiesle was working at a church as a seminarian in the late 1960s and early ’ 70s .
Costello , now 48 and on disability because of arthritis , says that Kiesle — who was ordained as a priest in 1972 — first playfully invited her to sit on his lap , part of a youthful demeanor that he fostered , she said , including wearing purple tennis shoes in church .
“ He was considered to be the Pied Piper , ” Costello recalled .
“ He was a kid .
And who does n’t like a big kid ? ”
But Costello says Kiesle ’s touching and tickling soon progressed to fondling her chest and genitals .
“ He told me the devil was inside me , ” she said , adding that Kiesle sometimes cast his actions as an exorcism .
“ I always knew that I was uncomfortable and that it was n’t right . ”
Kiesle was convicted in 1978 of tying up and molesting two boys in another California church rectory .
But he was not defrocked until 1987 — despite concerns voiced to the Vatican over several years by Bishop John S. Cummins of Oakland .
Kiesle now lives in Walnut Creek , where he is registered as a sex offender .
Questions about the slow pace by which Kiesle was removed from the clergy have intensified since it was learned that Pope Benedict — then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and serving as a top Vatican official — had signed a 1985 letter telling Bishop Cummins that Kiesle ’s case needed more time and that the “ good of the Universal Church ” should be considered in coming to a decision .
A Vatican lawyer has defended the church ’s handling of Kiesle ’s case , saying that it had acted “ expeditiously ” by its own standards and that the onus was on Bishop Cummins to make sure the priest did not abuse again .
Kiesle , who could not be reached for comment , served three years ’ probation for his 1978 conviction and underwent treatment .
In 2004 , he was convicted of a second sex offense — molesting a girl in 1995 in Truckee — and sentenced to six years in prison .
Mike Brown , a spokesman for the Diocese of Oakland , said Kiesle was removed from active ministry in 1978 .
“ For all purposes , his life in the diocese was over , ” Brown said , adding that his continued membership in priesthood between 1978 and 1987 had been mischaracterized .
“ It ’s been implied that the diocese just let him roam about as an employee , but that ’s not the case . ”
Tim Stier , who was a pastor at Corpus Christi Church in Fremont for more than a decade , said Sunday he went into “ voluntary exile ” five years ago when he told then - Bishop Allen Vigneron that he would not take any assignments unless he could “ publicly dialogue about the crisis in the church . ”
Stier said he did n’t get the answer he wanted and left his parish .
He now works at the YMCA and aids SNAP in its efforts to stir reform among Catholic leaders .
“ The time for apologizing is in the past , ” he said .
“ It ’s time the church started assigning women to positions of leadership .
We need to end mandatory celibacy , and also begin welcoming gay people into our worship without them having to jettison their sexuality .
We need to tell the truth about priests who were molesters , and we need to launch and maintain a proactive campaign of outreach to victims who survived this abuse . ”
But Brown said the diocese already has such a program .
“ I am very confident in the local diocese and in our ability in Oakland to continue to minister to the victims of clergy sexual abuse , ” Brown said .
“ The reason I ’m confident and feel positive about that is because Oakland , in the mid-’90s , was one of the first dioceses in the United States to set up a very active ministry to the victims .
Ours is called No More Secrets , and it ’s active today . ”
Brown said diocese officials were not given a chance to respond to recent Associated Press and Bay Area News Group stories , contending that the allegations essentially “ fell out of the sky . ”
“ What they did was guerrilla journalism , ” he said .
“ And that ’s their right , but we ’re digging up 30 - year - old files and ca n’t respond to everything right away until we can go through the records . ”

Funeral for a ( Floppy ) Friend
Earlier this week , Sony announced that they were , in fact , not going to produce new 3.5 ″ disks .
The venerable format began in the early 80’s and reached the height of its popularity in the mid-90’s .
I ca n’t recall the last time I actually used a floppy disk – it ’s been so long …
Back in those days , users would dance the “ floppy shuffle ” , which referred to the frequent swapping of floppy disks during a typical software install from that period .
It was not uncommon in some cases to swap between 10 to 15 discs for some of the larger apps of that era .
I do remember buying a ton of 3.5 ″ disks ( 800 k variety ) for my Apple IIGS .
When I moved to a PC , I bought 1.44 MB floppies .
The last machine I purchased that came with a floppy disk drive was my first desktop Mac , a PowerComputing PowerTower 180e , back in 1996 .
Technology marches on , but I ’ll always have my memories .
What was your first machine with the floppy disk ?
What was your last ?

You 're an open book now as EU warns of ' unacceptable ' privacy risk
Facebook is under fire from security experts after making it more difficult for its users to keep personal details private .
A European watchdog said it was unacceptable that 400 million members had no option but to share some personal details after the site changed security settings .
Potentially sensitive information that users were previously able to hide - such as their profile photographs - is now automatically on display to everyone else on Facebook , from potential bosses to fraudsters and sex pests .
Facebook requires users to opt - out rather than opt-in to services that share their personal information
Even those who do not use the site can see these details by typing a name into search engines .
Default settings introduced in December mean other sensitive information - such as updates on where members are going , what they are doing and their list of friends - is now also automatically made public unless otherwise specified .
Facebook users can also see information written about users ' family , relationships and home town .
The company , which has long been criticised for disregarding the fundamental right to privacy , says it has simply made its settings easier to use .
But critics claim that the reverse is true and that millions of members actually have less control of their personal information .
An influential group of data protection experts advising the EU , known as the Article 29 Working Party , has issued Facebook with a strongly - worded reprimand .
Their letter states :
' It is unacceptable that the company fundamentally changed the default settings on its social - networking platform to the detriment of a user . '
Founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg , the website was initially limited to students but its user base has grown to include anyone over 12 .
But the ease of use also opens the door to abuse .
With no checks that the information posted on the site is true , there is nothing to stop paedophiles posing as children in order to groom victims .
Facebook says it is at the ' forefront ' of social networking privacy controls - and that if people are uncomfortable with the idea of others viewing their information , they can choose not to enter it in the first place .
Staff at Facebook 's California headquarters were today due to discuss the privacy concerns .

The film , called “ Someday Melissa ” and now in the editing stages , has become for Ms. Avrin salve , distraction and cause — a way to get the word out to other families grappling with eating disorders that they are not alone ; to sound the alarm that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness ; to help make sense of the senseless event that was losing her teenage daughter .
Image FAMILY Above , Melissa Avrin with her brother , Andrew , at Thanksgiving time in Utah in 2007 .
“ I kept saying , ‘ This is an amazing way for me to channel my grief , ’ ” Ms. Avrin said .
“ But it also allowed me to put off grieving . ”
Ms. Avrin , 56 , got the idea for the film from one of Melissa ’s therapists , Danna Markson , who introduced her to Jeffrey Cobelli , 27 , a filmmaker .
Over the last several months of working on the project , Ms. Avrin has come to know more than she ever intended to about eating disorders — how their seriousness has been underestimated , their treatment underinsured , their deaths underreported .
The process has n’t been easy , and some , like her ex-husband , initially questioned the impulse to do it at all .
Melissa ’s best friend since first grade , Nicole Kendrick , who also suffers from an eating disorder , said she was incredulous when she first learned that Ms. Avrin was making the film .
“ I thought she was crazy , ” Ms. Kendrick said .
“ I guess I did n’t realize how deep a mother ’s love can run . ”
But Ms. Avrin said that making the film has been easier than doing nothing at all .
“ I ’ve never once thought this was more than I could bear , ” she said , in an interview at her home in Totowa , N.J. “ If anything , the more I continue , the more I know it ’s the right thing to do . ”
The difficulty of reliving her daughter ’s decline has been mitigated by the public response .
“ Sometimes I think : ‘ I ’m a suburban mom .
Who am I to think I could make a difference in the world ? ’ ” Ms. Avrin said .
“ But then I read the messages that keep coming in from people I know and people I do n’t know who say Melissa ’s story has motivated them to fight one more day . ”
The Pope has been under pressure to refer directly to the crisis Pope Benedict XVI has promised that the Roman Catholic Church will take " action " over child abuse by priests .
The comments are the most explicit he has made in public about a series of recent allegations against the Church .
Speaking in Rome at his weekly general audience , he referred to his weekend meeting with abuse victims in Malta .
" I shared with them their suffering and , with emotion , I prayed with them , promising them action on the part of the Church , " he said .
Direct reference
The Pope met eight men , during his visit to Malta on Sunday , who have complained of abuse during their childhood at an orphanage .
" I wanted to meet some people who were victims of abuse by members of the clergy , " he said .
One of the men , Lawrence Grech , said the meeting was " very emotional " and that " everybody cried " , and that it had given him huge spiritual courage .
The Vatican said afterwards that the Pope had had tears in his eyes .
It said he had " prayed with them and assured them that the Church is doing , and will continue to do , all in its power to investigate allegations , to bring to justice those responsible for abuse and to implement effective measures designed to safeguard young people in the future " .
However , Wednesday was the first time in recent weeks that the Pope has made his own public comments referring directly to the issue .
Previously he has called on Roman Catholics to " do penance " for their sins , and made other allusions to the crisis , but he has been criticised for making no direct verbal reference to the storm engulfing the Church .
Resignations accepted
There has been a wave of allegations that Church authorities in Europe and North and South America failed to deal properly with priests accused of paedophilia , sometimes just moving them to new parishes where more children were put at risk .
The Pope himself has been accused of not taking strong enough steps against paedophiles when he had that responsibility as a cardinal in Rome .
However , his supporters say he has been the most pro-active pope yet in confronting abuse .
On Tuesday he accepted the resignation of the bishop of Miami , US , who has been accused of covering up abuse cases , and it is thought he will do the same with an Irish bishop on Thursday .
Last week the Vatican made it clear that the policy of zero tolerance of sexual abuse of minors by clergy , adopted by Catholic bishops conferences in the US and in England and Wales , is now applicable worldwide .

What is easy to forget is that behind that wise old man is just a hack Hollywood screenwriter , and that those ancient words of wisdom were thrown in on the third draft , at four in the morning , after half a pound of cocaine .
Sometimes you 'll be watching a movie and an old wise man will appear on the screen .
He will say little , but those few words will be full of sage advice that will guide the hero on his journey .
You may even find yourself quoting him later .

Hollywood loves it when wisdom comes from unexpected places .
There is always a homeless man around to teach an uppity grad student about love or janitor or limo driver to offer some folksy homespun wisdom .
More often than not , Morgan Freeman is involved .

That 's why The Empire Strikes Back introduces Yoda as a rubbery little nuisance , seeming at first to be the comic relief , until we realize this wacky little gremlin is the spiritual and philosophical heart of the trilogy .
The wisdom that comes from this troll sets the foundation for a creed which is more adored and revered today than many religions .
And it 's pretty much all shit .
Take Yoda 's chilling warning to Luke about the consequences of his decision to go to Cloud City :
" If you go now , help them you could , but you would destroy ALL for which they have fought and suffered ... "
Set aside that this is vague to the point of incoherence , it consists of two separate clauses which are both proven completely untrue within minutes of Yoda saying them .
You 're full of shit , old man !

The marginal " help " Luke provides to his friends consists in absorbing a Washington Generals - level beatdown from Vader , thus creating a painful and humiliating diversion to distract the Sith Lord from his friends ' escape .
Luke showing up at Cloud City has NO negative consequences for anything the Rebellion was fighting for or anything else we can see for that matter .
And let 's not forget that Luke also " helped " them pick up Lando Calrissian , the guy who eventually joined the Rebellion and BLEW UP THE SPACE STATION CARRYING THE EMPEROR .
In other words , the guy who ended up winning them the war .
My current play group , wherein I ’m playing and not GMing , is doing an old school World of Darkness game .
Its fun .
Its enjoyable .
It has 2 major problems .
Most of the players are all old school World of Darkness experts .
Two of us ( myself included ) are not , but are full of interesting ideas .
This dichotomy of purpose causes our group to constantly come across instances of “ It does n’t work that way ” or “ According to this thing in this sidebook , they would n’t do that ” .
This causes our games to run less like a group playing a game , and more like a library study - group .
Most of the players have their noses buried in one splatbook or another , trying to figure out if their character action would be relevant to their group , or trying to find out where the nearest Cairn or Chantry would be .
The rest of us wonder if its going to be important in an hour , and question whether the name or exact location will even be remembered or matter .
Issues are also encountered when a player tries to do something in a unique way , or has a really good idea , but gets shot down because of some piece of flavor text .
I watched this happen to both the inexperienced players and the W.o.D. experts alike .
In essence , the ultra detailed nature of the setting prevented the players , even the ones embracing the ultra- detail , from laying their own interpretation onto the game being played at the table .
The desire to game in a detailed and realistic world prevented the players from doing cool things with their characters .
The Company Owned Setting
Ultra -detail is n’t a problem that is limited to old school World of Darkness .
It ’s present in almost any setting that is popular enough to generate splatbooks .
Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance were also fairly large offenders in my role - playing youth .
Eberron can be particularly bad as well .
I dare say that Monte Cook ’s excellent Ptolus is the epitome of ultra-detail .
I ’m sure you can name many more settings that have as much detail .
Thing is , I love all of these settings and games .
Any game company with a popular setting is going to try to build on it and produce as much material as they can .
Designers usually can’t wait to get the first book out the door so that they can start producing supplements .
The first book has to be fairly generic by its nature .
The rest are where the designer can lovingly craft the detail that they really want to bring out of the world .
And splatbooks make money .
Moreso than the initial book in a setting or the rulebook .
They ’re usually slimmer , need less design time and are more in the hands of the developers than at the whims of the game system .
Every splatbook , unless its billed as just flavor , has to offer something mechanical for the players .
New rules , new classes , new powers and new shiny items to give people a reason to buy it .
Official options for a necromancer knight are written into the new classes .
New items that have great powers are posited .
Game balance goes a little wonky , but new fun things are provided .
Little dark corners of the world are filled in and more than the paragraph in the main book is devoted to specific groups or options .
The GM’s Home - Brew Setting
Issues of ultra-detail are n’t limited to official supplements and company settings .
Home brewed settings can be as detailed and restrictive .
Many Game Masters work on their lovingly crafted worlds , developing the smallest details of the symbols of a particular group , the economic factors of a particular land or the mechanical complexities of a newly created class .
Lord knows I ’ve created a few of these worlds myself .
These floods of detail in a home - made world setting can create an incredibly immersive sandbox for the players to run around in , or turn players into the puppets of a control fiend Game Master .
That ’s a worst case - scenario .
The big issue with ultra-detail in home - brew settings is whether the players have access to all the necessary information or not .
If the social mores of a Game Master created culture are only written down on a piece of notebook paper that is buried in a folder somewhere , but fresh in the Game Masters mind , then the players are going to have some trouble understanding why shaking the hand of the elven ambassador landed them in jail .
Even when they all have ranks in Culture ( Elven ) .
Thankfully , the wonders of technology provide ways to give all players access to a Game Master ’s lovingly crafted and detailed world .
Wikis , the ease of creating and sharing electronic documents and online services like Obsidian Portal and Epic Words can all provide players with the necessary information that splatbooks and supplements provide for published settings .
In Reality , It ’s About The Group And The Play - style
It seems to me like I ’ve talked about ultra-detail and never really said that its bad .
That ’s because it is n’t .
IT ISN ’T ABOUT HOW DEFINED OR DETAILED THE SETTING IS .
Its about how the group interprets it and plays it out .
If the group sticks to the canon without deviation , it can kill creativity .
If the group uses the detail of the canon to support or flesh out character choices and provide a lush background , it enhances creativity .
White wolf has been incredibly good about telling players to break the mold of their world and do whatever you want with it .
This is written somewhere in every WW book , but I like the way that Will Hindmarch says it : “ ‘ Here ’s your guide to the game world , ’ he says , ‘ and here ’s your box of matches . ’ ” And I ’ve seen something similar in almost every other roleplaying book I ’ve read in - depth .
Somewhere , someone says “ Hey , do what you want at your table . ”
In the end its about what your group wants .
I know my group when it comes to World of Darkness .
I know before getting into the game that they love them some canon .
I resign myself to having long periods of time while people look things up in books .
I bring my laptop .
I also enjoy it when we get to take out the big bad , or the uber - organization and get to look in the book and see the exact impact we had on the well - defined world .
There is something incredibly satisfying about saying you took out Pentax , as opposed to taking out that evil corporation that you did n’t really know that much about , except that they were evil and the Game Master said they were really powerful .
In a previous Eberron game that I ran , it was really satisfying for my group to take out the Lord of Blades and wage civil war in house Cannith , even though I ran the Lord of Blades and house Cannith nothing like the written supplements said .
I incorporated elements from the books , and then molded them to fit the game that my players were playing .
Having the supplements and information around was what made the game epic to them .
Knowing they were affecting a world that was ultra detailed was what gave it that extra flavor .
Ultra -detail has its pros and it has its cons .
Its all in how you use it at the table .
So , what experiences have you had with ultra - detailed settings ?
Have they helped or hindered your play ?
Have they done both ?
The punishments for being openly gay in Egypt mean that increasingly men are using the internet to meet up
By Yolande Knell
BBC News , Cairo
In Egypt , the very existence of homosexuality is rarely openly acknowledged .
Laws on public morality are used to crack down on gay people and mean they live under continual threat of harassment and imprisonment .
" Tito " is a good - looking man in his late twenties with a successful career and an infectious laugh .
Yet he tells me that most of the time he hides a secret : he is gay .
In the majority we see the same pattern : arrests without probable cause , forced medical examinations and mandatory HIV tests , physical abuse and coercion to give confessions
Hossam Bahgat
Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights
" As far as my family is concerned , this topic is completely out of bounds .
It 's a huge taboo , " he explains .
" In Egypt you still have these closed minds .
I am only " out " to my friends . "
When Tito first tried to meet other men as a teenager he found it difficult .
He smiles as he recounts anecdotes of his failed attempts .
" Once I was out driving in Cairo and saw an attractive guy .
I stopped because I wanted to talk to him but could n't think of anything to say so I just asked : ' Where is the nearest petrol station ? '
He looked at me like I was crazy , then pointed out that I 'd pulled up next to one ! "
Like many other gay Egyptians he has also had his share of sinister experiences .
" After I had sex with one man he asked for a lift home but when we reached the area it was dark and deserted , " Tito recalls .
" He pulled out a knife and said : ' Hand over all your money and your mobile phone . '
Without thinking I gave him everything I had and left . "
Forced HIV tests
As well as muggings and harassment gay men face the danger of prosecution under public morality laws .
Twenty - one gay men were jailed in 2001 , some with hard labour " We still document cases where gay individuals , couples or groups are reported by their neighbours , arrested for public indecency or have gone to report crimes and found themselves turned into the accused , " says Hossam Bahgat , director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights .
" In the majority we see the same pattern : arrests without probable cause , forced medical examinations and mandatory HIV tests , physical abuse and coercion to give confessions . "
The most notorious crackdown was in 2001 when 52 men were detained on the Queen Boat , a floating nightclub in central Cairo .
Twenty - one of them were jailed for three years for " habitual debauchery . "
While certain shopping malls and cinemas are still known as gay hang - outs , websites are seen as a safer way to meet new people .
" In Cairo , Alexandria and other cities in Egypt there have been literally thousands of postings on our message boards , " remarks Ali , who set up GayEgypt.com 10 years ago .
" Initially it was about recording news events and history , " he says " but there are no gay bars or clubs and no gay newspapers so the internet quickly became the only way to communicate . "
Safe sex Tito has often gone online to find out information and set up dates .
" I think the sites are useful , " he comments .
" You know I have met really good people online .
They work in good jobs and are very respectable . "
It was time for unapologetic gay characters to appear on the Arabic - speaking screen
Maher Sabry
Film maker
As the gay community is forced underground , issues affecting it like the spread of sexually - transmitted diseases do not get openly discussed .
In a recent informal survey of eight countries by GayMiddleEast.com , based in Lebanon , only 62 % of Egyptian respondents said they practised safe sex .
" It was the lowest , " comments site manager , Assaf Gatenio .
" There is no possibility to have any advocacy except on the internet in Egypt and that 's the result . "
Free thinking Many gay rights campaigners have left the country but not all have given up the cause .
Representations of gay people in Egyptian films are overwhelmingly homophobic " I left to avoid persecution , " says Maher Sabry , who moved to the United States after speaking out against the Queen Boat case .
" I 'm physically in exile but mentally I 've never left . "
Mr Sabry has made a film " All My Life " which tells the story of an Egyptian man whose lover of many years leaves him to marry a woman - sending his life into a downward spiral .
He hopes that sympathetic cultural representations can change public attitudes .
" It was time for unapologetic gay characters to appear on the Arabic - speaking screen , " he says .
" Homophobic presentations of homosexuals have been in the Egyptian cinema for a long time . "
Like many activists , Mr Sabry sees violations of gay rights as part of a bigger picture of violations of human rights .
" My dream is to return permanently to Egypt but the low acceptance of gay lifestyles is not the only reason that I live away , " he reflects .
" It 's the lack of freedom of speech , free - thinking and civil rights . "

Greek trade unions line up behind government austerity measures
By Robert Stevens
31 March 2010
The General Confederation of Greek Workers ( GSEE ) and the public - sector Civil Servants ’ Confederation ( ADEDY ) are working to stifle opposition to the 16 billion euro austerity package being imposed by the Pan- Hellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) government .
On Sunday , Greek newspapers led with headlines declaring that 300,000 public sector workers will lose their jobs , and 4,000 municipal enterprises will close as a result of last week ’s European Union / International Monetary Fund agreement on the Greek debt crisis .
Official unemployment has already risen to 10.3 percent , with 514,000 counted as unemployed .
Unemployment among women in the fourth quarter of 2009 was almost double the rate for males .
Young people aged 15 to 29 were the worst affected , with a jobless rate of 25.8 percent .
According to other estimates , including that of the GSEE , the real jobless rate is much higher , standing at about 16 percent , and is likely to hit 20 percent this year .
Since the government ’s enactment March 5 of its latest package of cuts , estimated at € 4.8 billion , the unions have halted even the limited 24 - hour strikes they previously sanctioned .
The trade union federations , representing more than half of the five million - strong Greek working class , have held no further joint strikes or even a single one - day stoppage since March 11 .
On March 15 some of the severest attacks in the austerity programme came into effect , including a hike in the Value Added Tax on many everyday items .
The GSSE marked the day by declaring a “ Consumer Day ” and calling for a nationalist “ Buy Greek ” campaign .
Since then , workers in several sectors have struck in isolated , sporadic strikes .
On March 19 , civil engineers , geo-technical engineers and academics at Greece ’s engineering and agricultural science universities staged a four - hour strike to protest the tax increases announced by PASOK .
Doctors employed at state hospitals joined the protests to demand unpaid wages .
On March 23 , lawyers staged a 48 - hour strike , and public employees in several sectors held a three - hour stoppage .
The limited public sector workers strikes were held to protest pension cuts and other austerity measures and were not called by ADEDY .
Involved in the action were postal employees , railway workers , fire fighters and employees of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization .
Such has been the impact of the union ’s efforts to demobilise the working class that an evening demonstration in Athens that day was attended by just a few thousand people .
These were in the main trade union bureaucrats and members of the various pseudo - left coalitions .
This comes a few weeks after over two million workers took part in widely supported one - day general strikes and demonstrations and protests were held in every major town and city .
The trade union bureaucracy has played the key role in enabling the government to introduce its austerity programme despite the opposition of millions of workers .
The leadership of both union federations is staffed by high - ranking members of PASOK .
They called the one - day general strikes in February and March in order to provide a harmless safety valve for the mounting opposition of the working class to the government .
The aim was not to build up a movement of working class opposition , but to pre-empt any such movement and dissipate the anger of workers and youth .
The trade unions ’ support for PASOK was highlighted at the 34th congress of the GSEE , held March 18 - 21 .
On March 19 , Prime Minister George Papandreou addressed the congress and announced that there would be no let - up in PASOK ’s austerity measures .
Calling for support for his government ’s plan , the prime minister said , “ Saving the economy and regaining credibility is a necessary precondition to create the country we deserve . ”
He told the GSEE , “ We were forced to take the most difficult decisions ever taken by any government in this country .
We are making efforts to reverse this course … .
If we do not make sacrifices today , the problem will spiral out of control . ”
The assembled delegates applauded the speech , whose clear content was a declaration of war by the Greek bourgeoisie on the working class .
PASOK members made up the majority bloc within the GSEE in the elections held at the congress .
The PASOK - affiliated PASKE grouping received 230 votes ( 48.2 percent ) out of 478 votes .
DAKE — the trade union body of the right - wing opposition New Democracy Party — received 118 votes ( 24.69 percent ) , and the All Workers Militant Front ( PAME ) , affiliated with the Stalinist Communist Party of Greece , received 100 votes ( 20.92 percent ) .
Despite routinely describing the GSEE as a “ yellow ” union and denouncing its “ strike - breaking , ” the Stalinists have no compunction in taking seats in the same union ’s leadership .
The only differences the union bureaucracies have with PASOK concern the best tactical means to impose the cuts without provoking a backlash .
The unions have never raised the demand for a repudiation of the debt owed to the international banks .
This year alone , the government will have to raise € 53 billion ( $ 72.4 billion ) .
Some € 20 billion of the total , for refinancing old loans , falls due between April 20 and the end of May .
Instead , Yannis Panagopoulos , the president of the GSEE , simply echoes the government ’s demand that Greece be able to borrow at lower interest rates .
“ What we ask is that Greece be able to take loans at the same interest rates as others , ” he said .
Last week , GSEE spokesman and executive member Stathis Anestis told the Associated Press , “ We have an appreciation of the situation the country is in … .
We maintain a realistic and responsible position of readiness . ”
In the name of being “ realistic , ” the union leaders are pledging to do nothing that will impede the implementation of the most drastic attacks on the working class .
In his speech to the GSEE Congress , ADEDY President Spyros Papaspyros presented PASOK as the helpless victim of the global economic crisis .
The government “ has been trapped in a path that unilaterally lays the burden on those who are not responsible for the crisis , ” he said .
Whilst the unions sabotage anti-austerity struggles , the ruling elite in Greece is making plans to escalate its attacks .
As the GSEE conference was underway , representatives of big business and the main political parties attended an investment conference in Athens entitled , “ Greece at the Crossroads : Will Reforms Bring Competitiveness and Investment ? ”
The conference was sponsored by the International Herald Tribune , the sister paper of the Greek daily Kathimerini .
It included keynote speeches from Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou , Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas , and the leader of the New Democracy , Antonis Samaras .
Explaining how the economic crisis should be used to permanently restructure social relations at the expense of the living standards of the working class , Minister of State Haris Pamboukis told the conference , “ The economic crisis can be seen as a major opportunity for Greece and Europe to move forward . ”
On March 22 , Kathimerini published a comment imploring the trade unions to come forward as the policemen of the working class .
It began by stating , “ We are entering a period in which every institution , every group and every individual will have to redefine itself with regard to society as a whole .
The economic crisis is the greatest catalyst for change since the military dictatorship of 1967 - 74 took right - wing authoritarianism to extremes , discrediting it totally as a political and social option . ”
Implying that strikes and protests against austerity are similarly “ extreme , ” Kathimerini concluded , “ The unions must now take a hard look at themselves and decide whether they will contribute toward Greece 's reformation , with all that this will cost employees , or whether they will keep shouting and marching into irrelevance — at far greater cost to workers . ”
Kathimerini is frankly somewhat behind the times .
As is already abundantly clear , the trade unions are working to paralyze the working class and stand four - square behind Greece ’s ruling elite .
And there 's plenty more on the way .
By 2030 , the city of Gold Coast will be home to some 900,000 residents .
With this sort of expansion comes growing pains , and mounting public concern over the rate of change - which convinced the Queensland government to host this week 's Growth Management Summit .
Whether it was an idle talkfest or a meaningful contribution to the future , only time will tell .
But the growth summit at least brought the population debate to the fore .
Or did it ?
The debate was not primarily about population .
But , as the name suggests , it was about how to provide catch - up infrastructure for the past influx of people , manage the 2100 a week arriving in Queensland currently , and the million more on their way in the next two decades .
What the community wants answered is :
When are we going to move to a sustainable , stabilised population .
Naturally enough , population is going to intrude on any debate about growth .
But the question many in southeast Queensland , and the nation more broadly , want answered - whether or not population increase should be limited - was largely buried .
The question the growth summit was asked was not whether Queensland , and the state 's southeast in particular , should be swamped in people it can't accommodate , but how to fit in the vast number who will inevitably arrive .
Already , there are two certainties to come out of the summit - densification and regionalisation .
Our cities are bound to go upwards and more people will be living in high - rise apartment blocks and in hubs based along rail and bus routes .
Such closely - populated suburban hubs would satisfy Premier Anna Bligh 's concept of the 15 - minute neighbourhood .
" We could be thinking locally of 15 - minute neighbourhoods - where everything you need to live , work and play is within 15 minutes ' walking distance , '' Ms Bligh said .
" Before the car , it 's how communities evolved , and in an era of climate change we should do it again . ''
Regionalisation will occur on two levels .
Firstly , by creating what demographer Bernard Salt calls the " mosaic city ' ' , and secondly by efforts to attract people to regional Queensland rather than just the crowded southeast corner .
Mr Salt sees the mosaic city as an alternative to urban sprawl and a growing population .
This would include a densely populated inner-city , but decentralised jobs in outer suburbs for families and others who do n't want to live in apartments .
" We are a suburban people , '' Mr Salt said .
" Live , work , play , recreate , go to university , go to hospital - all within a containerised region .
" It 's like a mosaic , a series of cells . ''
He said higher fuel prices will force regionalisation and lead to as many as one - in - five city residents working from home as people reduce their travel .
" One thing that you can be confident about in the next 40 years is that , in real terms , petrol will be $ 5 a litre , '' he said .
This will force regionalism at the fringes of existing cities .
As to inducing newcomers to settle in Townsville , Kingaroy or Cunnamulla - that 's not such an easy proposition .
Ms Bligh admitted as much when she said that no government had the power to tell people where to live .
" Even if we did stabilise population , as some people are calling for , what we can't do is stop people moving around , '' she told the 200 summit delegates .
The premier even floated the idea of a " second capital ' ' to ease population pressure in the southeast , specifically mentioning Townsville as a likely candidate .
It may be a good idea , but it 's decades from fruition and it would certainly require more than the measly $ 3000 she has considered as a first home owners ' grant to tempt people to the regions .
What is more likely is that the population will follow jobs and money to regional Queensland as it develops .
Ms Bligh recognised this when she said the recent signing of $ 80 billion worth of LNG contracts with China and Japan would attract people to the southwest , where the coal seam gas is , and to Gladstone , the central Queensland industrial city where the raw material will be converted to LNG and shipped overseas .
This resource boom - led population boost raises the major challenge of providing both the social and concrete - steel - and - bitumen infrastructure to meet the increased population , a field where Queensland has not excelled in the past .
The population debate in the southeast can be summed up in the different attitudes of two local governments in the region .
Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale has led the turn - around in the city 's fortunes and is one of Australia 's strongest pro-growth advocates .
Ipswich is the epicentre of the South East Queensland Regional Plan which seeks to provide for the influx of a million newcomers and , on the latest ABS figures , is experiencing a five per cent a year growth in population .
Masterplanned cities are under construction on greenfield sites around Ipswich and there is huge investment coming to the region .
" Growth is not a dirty word , '' Mr Pisasale said .
" The key is managing it properly .
" People are blaming growth for everything .
They 're blaming growth for the lack of koalas .
They 're blaming growth for the lack of quality of lifestyle . ''
He blames poor planning for the angst felt by many in southeast Queensland .
Mr Pisasale has the support of his community , having gained 85 per cent of the primary vote at the last local government elections .
Sunshine Coast mayor Bob Abbot also has the go - ahead from the community he leads , with 70 per cent support in the primary vote for his policy of curbing population and growth on the tourist strip north of Brisbane .
Protesters travelled from the Sunshine Coast for a noisy demonstration outside the growth summit .
A poll in the local newspaper on the day following the summit showed that 60 per cent were in favour of a population cap for the region .
Mr Abbot said that if the summit merely promoted a new view on how to maximise the population of southeast Queensland , then it had failed .
" But if we come out of this with a new view about how to spread the population growth of Queensland right across the state , with some real values for southeast Queensland , then it will be successful , '' he said .
Ian Christesen , a Sunshine Coast resident and member of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council advisory panel , said the question asked at the summit is not the one people want answered .
" What the community wants answered is :
When are we going to move to a sustainable , stabilised population , '' he said .
" What they 're talking about here is : How are we going to cram them in .
Are we going to stack them on top of each other or are we going to keep bulldozing .
" That 's not the sort of debate we need to be having . ''
Perhaps , but the population debate is now out there , and better focused than it was before the summit .
Loading
It 's a debate that will continue , even as 2100 new people arrive in Queensland each week , and more than two - thirds of them lob into the southeast corner .
LDS Inc. is at it again – fighting porn .
Apparently they have set up a new website for porn addiction : http://combatingpornography.org/cp/eng/
So , the only reference I can find that actually says anything about pornography being unhealthy on the page for individuals is to the work of Victor Cline , who appears to be a crusader against pornography .
When you check the references on Cline ’s site , the most recent are from the 1980s and most are from the 1970s and 1960s .
If you ’re looking for the latest scientific information , selectively cited , from the 1960s on pornography , Victor Cline is the guy to talk to .
As far as all of the other references on the “ individuals page ” on combatingpornography.com , not a single reference says anything about sex addiction .
They are all references to other types of addiction or to brain functioning and things like obesity .
My interpretation , as a scientist , there is no evidence that there is such a thing as “ sex addiction ” or “ porn addiction . ”
Apparently the APA agrees with me as they are not including sex addiction in the DSM - 5 .
There is also no such thing as porn addiction according to the APA .
There is one reference in Cline ’s list of references that actually seemed relevant and fairly recent ( 1988 ) : Pornography ’s Impact on Sexual Satisfaction .
According to this article , frequent viewing of porn – soft core porn mind you – reduces satisfaction with sexual partners , but otherwise has no effects on mental health .
So , even the little evidence mustered suggests the only potentially negative affect of porn viewing is decreased satisfaction with sex ( though apparently a lot of studies have cited this one and I ’m guessing some of them take issue with it – anyone want to dig around and see what you can find ? ) .
So , my question : Given the fact that LDS Inc. can’t muster any real scientific evidence suggesting there is such a thing as porn or sex addiction , why do they keep harping on this ?
What is the REAL issue ?

[ Originally published April 2010 . ]
One hundred years ago today , on April 16 , 1910 , Henry Pritchett , president of the Carnegie Foundation , put the finishing touches on the Flexner Report .
No other document would have such a profound effect on American medicine , starting it on its path to destruction up to and beyond the recently passed ( and laughably titled ) Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ( PPACA ) , a.k.a. , " Obamacare . "
Flexner can only be accurately understood in the context of what led up to it .
Free market medicine did not begin in the United States in 1776 with the Revolution .
From 1830 to about 1850 , licensing laws and regulations imposed during the colonial period and early America were generally repealed or ignored .
This was brought about by the increasing acceptance of eclecticism ( 1813 ) and homeopathy ( 1825 ) , against the mainstream medicine ( allopathy ) of the day that included bloodletting and high - dose injections of metal and metalloid compounds containing mercury or antimony .
Eclectics emphasized plant remedies , bed rest , and steam baths , while homeopaths emphasized a different set of medicines in small doses ( letting the body heal itself as much as possible ) , improved diet and hygiene , and stress reduction .
The worst results these treatments produced were allergic reactions to no improvement .
Hence it 's not surprising they began to be preferred over the ghastly bleeding and metal injections of allopathy , which killed large numbers of patients .
By 1860 , there were more than 55,000 physicians practicing in the United States , one of the highest per capita numbers of doctors in the world ( about 175 per 100,000 ) .
By 1870 , approximately 62,000 physicians were in practice in the United States , roughly about 5,300 of which were homeopathic and about 2,700 eclectic .
Schooling was plentiful and inexpensive , and entry to the most acclaimed schools was not exceedingly difficult .
Most schools were privately owned .
Licenses to practice were not required or enforced , and anyone could establish a practice .
Like the mythical Hollywood portrayal of the American " Wild West " as a place in which the denizens of every town were killing each other in gunfights every minute of the day , the free market period in American medicine has also been distorted as one in which towns were mobbed by traveling quacks prescribing dangerous treatments that killed the townspeople in droves .
Organized mainstream medicine concocted this myth , and as previously noted , it was they and not the homeopaths and eclectics who were killing large numbers of people via bloodletting and metal poisoning .
This is why it took time and effort for any caregiver to win the widespread trust of a typical community in nineteenth - century America .
The public en masse blindly lapping up snake oil dispensed from the dirty travel trunks of carnival - tent quacks is wild legend .
Even though they were only about 13 percent of physicians in practice , eclectics and homeopaths did damage to the incomes of the allopaths .
The allopaths began organizing at the state level to use the coercive power of government to not only severely restrict ( if not outright ban ) eclectics and homeopaths , and the schools that trained them , but also restrict the number of allopaths in practice to dramatically increase their incomes and prestige .
The American Medical Association ( AMA ) had already been formed in 1847 by Nathan Smith Davis .
Davis had been working at the Medical Society of New York with issues of licensing and education .
While the pretense was always more rigorous standards toward the supposed end of effective treatments , exclusion was the reality .
Hence it was no surprise that in 1870 , Davis worked successfully to prohibit female and black physicians from becoming members of the AMA .
The AMA formed its Council on Medical Education in 1904 as a tool to artificially restrict education .
However , the AMA 's conflict of interest was too obvious .
This is where Abraham Flexner and the Carnegie Foundation entered the picture .
Flexner 's older brother Simon was the director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and he recommended his brother Abraham for the Carnegie job .
Abraham 's acceptance of the role was the perfect special - interest symbiosis .
Carnegie 's desire was to advance secularism through higher education , thus it saw the AMA 's agenda as favorable toward that end .
Rockefeller 's benefactors were allied with allopathic drug companies and hated for - profit schools that could n't be controlled by the big - business , state - influenced foundations .
Last of all , the AMA got an objective - appearing front in Carnegie .
Not only was Abraham Flexner not even an allopathic physician ; he was not a widely known authority on education , never mind medical education , as he had never even seen the inside of a medical school before joining Carnegie .
His report was already effectively written , since it was essentially the AMA 's unpublished 1906 report on US medical schools .
Furthermore , Flexner was accompanied on his inspection by the AMA's N.P. Colwell to insure the inspection would arrive at the preordained conclusions .
Flexner then spent time at the AMA 's Chicago headquarters preparing what portion of the final product was his actual work .
Regardless of these scandalous circumstances , state medical boards and legislatures used the report as a basis for closing medical schools .
Around the time of Flexner , there was a high of 166 medical schools ; by the 1940s there were just 77 — a 54 percent reduction .
Most small rural schools were closed , and only two African American schools were allowed to remain open .
By 1963 , despite advances in technology and a huge growth in demand , one effect of the report was to keep the number of doctors per 100,000 people in the United States — 146 — at the same level it was at in 1910 .
Of the approximately 375,000 physicians in practice in 1977 , only about 6,300 or 1.7 percent were African American .
While physician incomes and prestige dramatically increased , so did the caregiving workload .
Wolinsky and Brune ( 1994 ) report that doctors were firmly in the lower middle class at the time of the AMA 's founding and made about $ 600 per year .
This rose to about $ 1,000 around 1900 .
After Flexner , incomes began to skyrocket such that a 1928 AMA study found average annual incomes had reached a whopping ( for the time ) $ 6,354 .
Even during the Great Depression , physicians earned four times what average workers did .
A 2009 survey put family practice doctors ( on the low end of the physician income range ) at a median of $ 197,655 and spine surgeons ( at the high end ) at a median of $ 641,728 .
These figures are mind - boggling to ordinary Americans , even in good economic times .
In addition , the cyclical unemployment that throws workers out of jobs in almost all other industries with the arrival of recessions or depressions became nonexistent among physicians after Flexner .
However , not even Flexner could repeal the laws of economics : the physician workload in certain areas became backbreaking to impossible , such that some physicians no longer accept new patients .
Some primary - care physicians today are booked solid for at least two months , and unless you have some sort of connection to get in before that or pay for concierge care , your alternative for urgent care is the same as everyone else 's on a weekend : the emergency room , where you 'll wait for hours , or a walk - in where you 'll see one or two MD names posted on the building , but wait for hours for a nurse practitioner .
Hospitals
Of course it would n't make sense to restrict physician services without restricting hospitals .
For -profits were the first to go , and where they were not outright prohibited , they faced a number of regulatory burdens that nonprofits escaped — such as income and property taxes .
Nonprofits received generous government subsidies , tax - deductible contributions , and local planning agencies working in their favor to keep for - profit competitors from expanding .
This state - sponsored discrimination against for - profit hospitals took its toll : at the time of Flexner , almost 60 percent of all US hospitals were for - profit institutions .
By 1968 , only 11 percent were for - profit institutions , with about an 8 percent share of hospital admissions .
Eliminating most for - profit medical schools and hospitals made sense for the AMA and the rest of organized mainstream medicine , since they were controlled by owners or shareholders who had the incentive to control costs in order to maximize profits .
Nonprofits were free to pursue the political goals that organized mainstream medicine favored , especially the goal of a much more lengthy and costly education , which served as another barrier of entry to the profession .
( Especially amusing was a 2004 article by two Dartmouth physicians arguing for maintaining restricted entry because of high costs . )
The Rise of Health " Insurance "
In the early 1900s , prepaid health plans were created for the timber and mining workers of Oregon and Washington to help offset the inherent risks of those industries .
Within a free - market , for - profit insurance system , claims were closely monitored by adjusters .
Fees , procedures , and exceptionally long hospital stays were monitored and subject to challenge .
A physicians ' group in Oregon that resented this type of scrutiny created a plan where procedures were reimbursed and fees paid with few questions asked .
Plans with similar structures began dominating the market in other locations because of government - provided advantages .
By 1939 these loose cost containment plans began to be marketed under the Blue Shield name .
That same year , Blue Cross was endorsed by the American Hospital Association .
Already in existence for ten years , Blue Cross had begun as a hospital insurance plan for Dallas school teachers that allowed them to pay for up to three weeks of hospital care with low monthly payments .
After this , organized mainstream medicine waged an intense war on non-Blue plans .
Goodman ( 1980 ) contends that some physicians lost hospital privileges and even their licenses for accepting non-Blue plans .
The Blues also gained government - supplied advantages not available to non-Blue plans .
In many states , they paid no or low premium taxes and sometimes no real estate taxes .
They also were n't required to maintain minimum benefit / premium ratios and could have no or low required reserves .
With government advantages , the Blues steadily came to dominate the industry .
By 1950 , Blue Cross held 49 percent of the hospital insurance market , while Blue Shield held 52 percent of the market for standard medical insurance .
They merged in 1982 and today cover one of every three Americans .
Blues - created " insurance " was anything but true insurance .
Hospitals were paid on a cost - plus basis .
Insurers paid not a sum of prices charged to patients for services but artificial " costs " that bore no necessary relationship to the prices of services performed .
Insurance of routine procedures .
This converted insurance to prepaid consumption that encouraged overuse of services .
Insurance premiums based on " community rating . "
The word " community " meant that every person in a specific geographic area regardless of age , habits , occupation , race , or sex was charged the same premium .
For example , the average 60 - year - old incurs four times the medical expense of the average 25 - year - old , but under community rating both pay the same premium ( i.e. , young people are overcharged and the elderly undercharged ) .
A " pay - as - you - go " system .
Unlike genuine catastrophic hospital insurance that placed premiums in growing reserves to pay claims , the new Blues ' " insurance " collected premiums that only covered expected costs over the following year .
If a large group of policyholders became ill over several years , the premiums of all policyholders had to be raised to cover the increase in costs .
These traits spell cost - explosion disaster , so naturally they were incorporated into the federal government 's Medicare and Medicaid programs when they were created in the mid-1960s to address the problem of healthcare being unaffordable for the poor and elderly — a problem the state and federal governments created !
This only leaves the mystery of how health insurance became attached to employment .
The answer is found two decades before Medicare and Medicaid .
Wage and price controls the federal government enacted during World War II prevented large employers from competing for labor based on wage rates , so they competed based on the quality of benefits .
The most effective benefit for luring labor to large employers was generous health insurance policies .
The decision by the federal government to allow large - employer benefits to be obtained tax - free while effectively taxing plans purchased by small businesses and the self - employed created a system where medical insurance became not only perversely tied to the size of a worker 's employer but to employment itself .
The price of health insurance for many self - employed workers and small businesses became unaffordable .
Health Maintenance Organizations ( HMOs )
Health Maintenance Organizations ( HMOs ) were prepaid practices that began mainly on the US west coast in the early 1900s .
Western Clinic in Tacoma ( 1910 ) and Ross - Loos in Los Angeles ( 1929 ) were among the earliest .
( Ross - Loos eventually became part of Insurance Company of North America [ INA ] , which merged into CIGNA in 1982 . )
Kaiser Permanente began with a clientele of shipyard workers during World War II .
After the war , it had hospitals and physicians , but no more worker clientele , so it started marketing to the wider public and by the 1970s had more than 3 million enrollees in five states .
Still , HMOs had limited appeal .
By 1970 , Kaiser was the only major HMO in the United States , with most of its enrollees forced to join through their labor unions .
Much more about HMOs will be covered in a forthcoming review in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics .
The purpose here is to emphasize that , despite some assertions to the contrary , HMOs are anything but free market firms .
The Health Maintenance Organization
Act of 1973 made federal grants and loans available to HMOs , removed certain state restrictions if HMOs became federally certified , and required employers with 25 or more employees who offered standard health insurance benefits to offer federally approved HMO plans .
" Obamacare , " or More Accurately , ConservativeRepublicanCare
When you actually look at the bill itself , it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas …a lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange , just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market , originated from the Heritage Foundation .
( Barack Obama , NBC's Today Show , March 30 , 2010 )
The latest chapter in US healthcare is one of the most surreal .
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 was signed into law by Barack Obama on March 23 , 2010 .
Among many provisions , the act includes expanded Medicaid eligibility , prohibiting denials of coverage for preexisting conditions , and a requirement to purchase federally approved health insurance or pay a fine .
While the content of the act is summarized in myriad places , much more interesting are its conservative Republican origins .
The Heritage Foundation 's Stuart Butler , the intellectual behind urban enterprise zones , in Senate testimony in 2003 proposed a plan for universal healthcare coverage .
Here 's one surprising portion of the testimony that sounds like it was uttered by a European socialist :
In a civilized and rich country like the United States , it is reasonable for society to accept an obligation to ensure that all residents have affordable access to at least basic health care — much as we accept the same obligation to assure a reasonable level of housing , education and nutrition .
Keep in mind that Butler is the conservative Heritage 's current vice president of domestic and economic policy .
No wonder Butler seems to have found a new admirer in New York Times columnist Paul Krugman .
Butler again :
The obligations on individuals do not have to be a " hard " mandate , in the sense that failure to obtain coverage would be illegal .
It could be a " soft " mandate , meaning that failure to obtain coverage could result in the loss of tax benefits and other government entitlements .
In addition , if federal tax benefits or other assistance accompanied the requirement , states and localities could receive the value of the assistance forgone by the person failing to obtain coverage , in order to compensate providers who deliver services to the uninsured family .
Now " Obamacare " is certainly more than just a mandate , but the mandate is certainly what has conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , both of whom have connections to , if not sponsorship from , the Heritage Foundation , screaming bloody murder the most .
There 's no doubt that these ideas influenced Mitt Romney 's healthcare plan in Massachusetts .
Romney subjected himself to a recent interview by Fox News 's Bill O'Reilly that can only be described as a disaster .
O'Reilly dwelled on the fact that outside tax dollars funded half of the plan , and Romney agreed , adding that the funding was approved by two conservative Republican Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) secretaries , Tommy Thompson and Mike Leavitt .
In response to a question , Romney admitted that he did n't know that emergency room costs in Massachusetts had increased 17 percent over the last two years .
He repeatedly asserted that the plan solved a problem , but he could n't specify what it was since Massachusetts had the highest per capita costs both before the plan and after .
As far as other conservative Republicans go , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has repeatedly stated that he sees " some good things " in Obamacare , especially the expanded use of Medicaid .
Voters naïve enough to think they will get a complete repeal from the Republican Party appear to be in for a major disappointment .
" Obamacare , " with its continuance of socialized costs for private gains in American medicine , was the treatment that the conservative Republican doctor had in mind for some time .
The problem is that the Democrats were the first to implement it .
Berlusconi -Fini , pranzo sulle riforme .
Certo che se la potrebbero permettere una tovaglia .
Il clima si preannuncia teso : Fini si è presentato con l’assaggiatore .
Il presidente della Camera ha chiesto a Berlusconi “ Un Pdl più moderno , democratico , civile e legalitario ” .
In pratica , senza Berlusconi .
Il pranzo si è concluso senza sorprese : con l’amaro .
Il premier si è limitato a dire : “ Ho mangiato benissimo ” .
Riferendosi agli ultimi dieci anni .
( Dopo Veronica , altro divorzio in vista per Berlusconi .
Se se ne va anche Leonardo si puo’ pensare a una class action )
In un comunicato stampa , Fini dichiara di attendere serenamente le valutazioni del premier .
E di non voler essere bendato .
Fini ha comunque riconosciuto alcuni meriti a Berlusconi : da quando è al governo nessun asteroide si è schiantato sull ’ Italia .
Pare che Fini abbia chiesto a Berlusconi la testa di Gasparri .
Si accontenta di poco .
Berlusconi convoca i vertici del Pdl .
Vuole starsene un po ’ da solo .
Riunione straordinaria del Pdl. Sbuffa Berlusconi .
Sono quel tipo di riunioni senza figa .
Il premier incontra La Russa , Verdini e Bondi .
Vuole sentirsi dire quanto ha ragione .
La Russa , Verdini e Bondi scrivono una nota congiunta sulla vicenda : uno teneva ferma la penna e gli altri due muovevano il foglio .
Il Secolo d’Italia parla di “ generico sloganismo ” .
Non sono d’accordo , l’amore vince sempre sull ’invidia e sull ’odio .
Fini sarebbe pronto a costituire un gruppo autonomo .
Si chiamerà “ Il presidente della Camera avrà più fan di quello del Consiglio ” .
Fini : “ Berlusconi scatenerà i cani per sbranarmi .
Già mi aspetto Feltri ” .
Ecco perché da un po ’ di tempo lo tenevano a digiuno .
Secondo Bersani “ il Pdl ha un grosso problema ” .
E non è certo lui .
Il segretario del Pd : “ Non mi sembra che la presidenza della Camera sia nella disponibilità di Berlusconi ” .
Controlla meglio .
Bersani teme le elezioni anticipate .
Gli elettori potrebbero votare .
Secondo Bersani “ parlare di elezioni anticipate è una pazzia ” .
Dategli un po ’ di tempo per godersi la recente vittoria .
( Il problema del centrosinistra è che non ha un suo Berlusconi .
Per questo appoggia quello che c’è già )
Bossi : “ Temo che la cosa non si rimetta a posto ” .
Eh sì , è dura , dopo un ictus .

Commenti
According to the Tax Policy Center , a Washington , D.C. , research organization , nearly half of U.S. households will pay no federal income taxes for 2009 .
That 's up from the Tax Foundation 's 2006 estimate that 41 percent of the American population , or 121 million Americans , were completely outside the federal income tax system .
These Americans pay no federal income tax either because their incomes are too low or they have higher income but credits , deductions and exemptions that relieve them of tax liability .
This lack of income tax liability stands in stark contrast to the top 10 percent of earners , those households earning an average of $ 366,400 in 2006 , who paid about 73 percent of federal income taxes .
The top 25 percent paid 86 percent .
The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers paid less than 4 percent of federal income taxes collected .
Let 's not dwell on the fairness of such an arrangement for financing the activities of the federal government .
Instead , let 's ask what kind of incentives and results such an arrangement produces and ask ourselves whether these results are good for our country .
That 's a question to be asked whether or not one has federal income tax liabilities .
Having 121 million Americans completely outside the federal income tax system , it 's like throwing chum to political sharks .
These Americans become a natural spending constituency for big-spending politicians .
After all , if you have no income tax liability , how much do you care about deficits , how much Congress spends and the level of taxation ?
Political calls for tax cuts and spending restraints have little appeal .
Survey polls revealed this .
According to The Harris Poll taken in June 2003 , 51 percent of Democrats thought the tax cuts enacted by Congress were a bad thing while 16 percent of Republicans thought so .
Among Democrats , 67 percent thought the tax cuts were unfair while 32 percent of Republicans thought so .
When asked whether the $ 350 - billion tax cut package will help your family finances , 59 percent of those surveyed said no and 35 percent said yes .
Tax cuts to many Americans mean just one thing :
They pose a threat to the federal handouts they receive .
Here 's my perhaps politically incorrect question :
If one has no financial stake in our country , how much of a say - so should he have in its management ?
Let 's put it another way : I do not own stock , and hence have no financial stake , in Ford Motor Company .
Do you think I should have voting rights or any say - so in the management of the company ?
I 'm guessing that the average sane person 's answer is no .
You say , " Williams , just where are you heading with this ? "
I 'm not proposing that we take voting rights away from those who do not pay taxes .
What I 'm suggesting is that every American gets one vote in every federal election , plus another vote for each $ 20,000 he pays in federal taxes .
With such a system , there 'd be a modicum of linkage between one 's financial stake in our country and his decision - making right .
Of course , unequal voting power could be reduced by legislating lower taxes .
This is not a far - out idea .
The founders worried about it .
James Madison 's concern about class warfare between the rich and the poor led him to favor the House of Representatives being elected by the people at large and the Senate elected by property owners .
He said , " It is nevertheless certain , that there are various ways in which the rich may oppress the poor ; in which property may oppress liberty ; and that the world is filled with examples .
It is necessary that the poor should have a defense against the danger .
On the other hand , the danger to the holders of property cannot be disguised , if they be undefended against a majority without property . "
Matteo Garbelotto , a forest pathologist at UC Berkeley , is one of the nation 's foremost experts on the tree - killing pathogen known as Sudden Oak Death .
The specialist in molecular cell biology tracked the disease , known scientifically as Phytophthora ramorum , as it killed tens of thousands of oak trees and spread throughout California .
He spoke recently to Chronicle reporter Peter Fimrite about his background and work .
Q : How did you become a forest pathologist and what does that mean ?
A : I have always loved trees .
My honeymoon three years ago was hiking in the Dolomite Alps of Italy and sleeping on cots in mountain huts along the way .
I became a forester because I wanted to dedicate my life to keeping our forests healthy and alive for future generations .
A forest pathologist is not merely a tree doctor , but somebody who studies the complex ecology and delicate balance of forests .
The distinguishing trait of a forest pathologist is that he has to have knowledge of multiple fields from ecology to microbiology , botany , plant physiology , chemistry and genetics .
Q : How serious a problem is Sudden Oak Death and will it eventually be fatal to our oak trees ?
A : Sudden Oak Death is the poster child of a huge environmental crisis linking an industry - ornamental plants that inadvertently brought the disease into our state - and the natural forest ecosystems where the disease is spreading rapidly and causing oak and tanoak mortality the likes of which has never been seen .
There is no easy fix .
The pathogen is not going away no matter what we do .
I do not think it will completely eliminate oaks , but it will kill entire populations of oaks and especially tanoaks .
The coastal forests our grandchildren will see will be very different from the ones we know , and if you have seen " Avatar , " well , that concept of all plants being interconnected is actually true .
So we can expect some effect on trees other than oaks , like redwoods .
This is why we need to keep the pressure on the government .
By involving entire communities , we may have a shot at slowing this epidemic down and saving significant numbers of oaks .
Q : What about the Bay Area is so attractive to Italian scientists ?
A : My relationship with the Bay Area has been love - hate .
It is excessively congested , too cold , far away from any other major cultural hub , but I love the cultural and natural diversity .
When I am away , I really miss its complexity .
Other places , including my native Italy , appear quite homogeneous in comparison .
Plus , I love the vibrant life of San Francisco .
I arrived before the gentrification brought on by the dot - com boom , and that will always be the image I keep in my heart .
I am also proud and humbled to be on the faculty at UC Berkeley , which I believe is the greatest public university in the world .
And did I mention I am gay ?
It is wonderful to be in such an open and accepting environment .
I travel a lot , and in so many places I really have to hide who I am , and my husband and partner of almost 20 years suddenly has to become a " friend . "
So I say , Viva San Francisco .
No .
But regulators looking at pornography , doing illegal drugs and other bad behavior explains part of the reason why the government failed to do its part to prevent the disaster .
A new report ( .pdf ) from the Interior Department 's Inspector General details how the Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) employees who were supposed to be watching over the Louisiana region acted more like criminals than public servants .
The report has some pretty awful findings .
Conflicts of interest existed between many MMS employees and the industry they regulated .
The companies sponsored MMS sporting events , provided employees meals , and gave them lavish gifts , according to the report .
It says was widespread throughout the culture of the office .
Some examples of the gifts include : a trip to the 2005 Peach Bowl college football tournament , skeet - shooting contests , hunting and fishing trips , golf tournaments , crawfish boils , etc .
What did they get for these gifts ?
MMS inspectors allowed oil and gas production company personnel to fill out their own inspection forms , says the report .
It 's pretty easy to pass an inspection when you do it yourself .
And that 's not all .
Two employees admitted using illegal drugs -- crystal meth and cocaine .
“ Seattle Erotic Art Festival encourages the creation , enjoyment , and purchase of erotic art–sparking conversations to ignite personal and cultural evolutions . ”
- Seattle Erotic Art Festival Mission Statement
It began with a desire to showcase stunning erotic art .
To create a place to celebrate , discuss and support pieces that were rarely seen in mainstream galleries and museums .
We dreamed of sexy people in a lush environment devouring amazing art ; of an event that joyfully encouraged people to be as open and expressive as they wanted to be .
And we brought it to life .
Our Rise to the Top
The first Seattle Erotic Art Festival was produced in 2003 by the Pan Eros Foundation and held at Town Hall in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle .
A jury of local artists selected hundreds of pieces of art that were enjoyed by more than 1,000 art patrons .
In 2004 , we moved to the Consolidated Works .
This larger space allowed us to add erotic films , curated by Festival Director Anna Hurwitz , and performances to the Festival ’s offerings , as well as a Festival Store .
By 2005 , our audience had tripled , art sales have become phenomenal , and our Festival Store became a vital marketplace .
This year ’s films were curated by Kathryn Albright / Sex on Screen .
In many ways , 2008 was the year we came of age .
We moved to the historic Seattle Center Exhibition Hall , beside the famous Space Needle , and hosted a lavish one - night gala .
In 2009 , we produced four full days of “ Indulging the Senses ” , with 300 works of exhibition art , thousands of pieces in the popular Festival Store , the premiere of our Literary Art Showcase , dazzling performance and installation art , and our first wildly successful ( and free ) Sunday Open House .

In 2010 , we returned to the Seattle Center .
We proudly presented our first - ever stage show production , sharing the glittering story of the Cabinet of Curiosities .
Perhaps most exciting of all ?
Tickets sold out on Saturday night to thousands of excited guests .

This news actually hit my email this morning via the Star Wars website ’s newsletter as well as a small feature on the main site , but nonetheless its exciting news ( especially for huge Star Wars nerds like me ) .
While it ’s not the live action TV show announcement we ’ve all been waiting for , it ’s nice to see more Star Wars things coming up in the future , especially one that turns the saga on it ’s ear .
This series is looking to flip the script and pull the saga away from the dour life - or - death situations that involve consequences on a galactic scale .
Instead it will blend wry comedy with irrevent humor , almost poking fun at itself , as they look to focus on other members of the galaxy and their lives when they are n’t overthrowing an empire , and how the “ small ” guys are effected by such dramatic events .
As if to prove they ’re serious about the change in direction , Lucasfilm has made a genius move , in bringing on Seth Green and Matthew Senreich ( executive producers for Robot Chicken ) for creative involvement , with writing from The Daily Show ’s Brendan Hay .
Todd Grimes ( Back at the Barnyard ) is taking up the director ’s seat on this one and had this to say :
“ There are so many stories taking place in the Star Wars universe , and they do n’t all have to focus on the fate of the galaxy …
We ’re looking at Star Wars from a new perspective ; this will be a glimpse at how the rest of the galaxy is affected by the events of the Saga .
There ’s a lot of humor to be mined from that . ”
With a galaxy as vast as Star Wars , it ’s easy to take a whole new approach to the saga without messing anything up .
It ’s safe to say though , with the success of the Robot Chicken and Family Guy parodies , the new show should have enough for both fans and non-fans to enjoy .
No word on a release date ( my guess it wo n’t be at least until 2011 , if then ) , and no actually confirmation on any particular time period this will take place .
Based on the quotes I ’m willing to bet it will span the entire saga just from someone elses point of view .
As more news comes out we ’ll be sure to keep you informed , but at the very least this will keep you sated until the long awaited live action show arrives .

Despite the drubbing in the media , the threatened boycotts and the planned marches and protests , there is a segment of xenophobic Republican lawmakers empowered by Arizona 's anti-immigration law enough to try to emulate it in their home state .
ThinkProgress has a breakdown of the states ( Utah , Georgia , Colorado , Maryland , Ohio , North Carolina , Texas , Missouri , Oklahoma , and Nebraska ) and the actions being contemplated .
Not content with letting others take the xenophobe crown alone , Texas Sen.
John Cornyn has also introduced legislation to strengthen the border .
“ For many in Washington , border violence is merely a talking point , but for those who live along our southern border it has become a fact of life .
Talk is cheap , but talk means nothing until we follow through and deliver the tangible resources our law enforcement needs to keep border residents safe , ” said Senator Cornyn .
“ Our government has abdicated its responsibility when it comes to border security for far too long , leaving state and local taxpayers no choice but to pick up the slack to protect communities from cartel , gang violence , and cross - border trafficking .
This bill will require the federal government to do its job . ”
“ For communities along the border with Mexico , the threat of violence is becoming all too real , but the federal government has yet to fully step up and do what is necessary to take on these challenges , ” said Senator Hutchison .
“ This failure costs our state and local governments millions every year and puts lives in danger . ”
Based largely on input from local law enforcement officers near the Texas border , Sen. Cornyn introduced The Southern Border Security Assistance
Act to create a $ 300 million border grant program for state and local law enforcement within 100 miles of the U.S. - Mexico border , which will help quickly provide resources to purchase equipment , upgrade critical information systems , and hire additional officers .
The bill also requires additional federal judges to handle the caseload from increased criminal prosecutions along the U.S. - Mexico border .
Not too pick too fine a nit , but I would mention that Cornyn , complaining that the federal government is not doing enough , is actually a MEMBER of the federal government .

A range of stone flakes were found ( scale- bar : 10 mm )
Long before a ' hobbit ' species of human lived on Indonesia 's Flores island , other human - like creatures colonised the area .
That much was clear .
But scientists have now been able to date their presence to at least one million years ago - some 120,000 years earlier than previously recognised .
The team reports the discovery of these humans ' tools in the journal Nature .
The group says the finds bring a new dimension to our understanding of the history of Flores .
Lead author Adam Brumm told BBC News that the location and circumstances of the tools ' preservation meant human occupation of the island could extend deep into the past .
" What 's really exciting about this is that we effectively have no idea how long hominids have been on Flores , " the University of Wollongong , Australia , said .
The hobbit ( left ) pictured next to the skull of a modern human
The remains of the hobbit , known to science as Homo floresiensis , were discovered five years ago at Liang Bua cave .
The diminutive creature 's unearthing was a sensation because it indicated a separate human species was living alongside us just 18,000 years ago .
Flores has witnessed intensive paleontological investigation ever since .
The famous H. floresiensis cave is located in the west of the island .
The new discoveries come from the Soa Basin , an area in central - west Flores .
A dig site there , known as Mata Menge , had already revealed tools dated to 880,000 years ago .
Now , just 500 m away but much deeper in the sediments , an international team has identified even older artefacts .
The site , referred to as Wolo Sege , has yielded more than 40 stone flakes .
These were hand tools , probably used to butcher meat among other tasks .
The dig site at Wolo Sege is in central - west Flores
Many show evidence of being swept along in a stream before being laid down .
Critically , however , their burial is capped by a layer of volcanic ash that has been accurately dated to just over one million years ago .
The scientists can say nothing about who used these tools .
There is an insufficient number at this stage to assess which culture produced them .
But their mere discovery raises some interesting issues .
For example , the Mata Menge discoveries are associated with the disappearance in the deposition record of a number of animal species , such as a pygmy elephant and a giant tortoise .
The conclusion that had been drawn from their extinction was that human hunters arriving on the island had hunted them out of existence .
But the Wolo Sege findings put a new perspective on this story because they show humans must have been living side by side with the animals for at least 120,000 years .
Brumm and colleagues tell Nature that it may be difficult to find artefacts in the Soa Basin that are older than the Wolo Sege flakes .
The reason is that the tools were lying just on top of what is the rock base in the area ( the flank of a volcano ) .
" Anything inside that bedrock , or within any layers we identify in the bedrock , if they contain stone tools they must be at least 1.86 million years old , " said Dr Brumm .
" So , a priority for further research this year is to do a more intensive survey throughout the basin and follow up these bedrock outcrops . "
The notion that Flores may have a very deep history of occupation will feed into the debate over H. floresiensis ' origins .
Many scientists believe the creature evolved from a much larger - bodied species , Homo erectus , that became isolated and shrunk over time .
Others point to features in the hobbit 's body - such as the length its feet to the shape of its shoulder girdle - that are very primitive and not what one would expect in dwarfed H. erectus .
These researchers have put forward the idea that H. floresiensis may have evolved from more archaic creatures that left Africa to colonise Asia even before erectus .
" Our discovery at Wolo Sege will certainly open the door to this contentious theory , " said Dr Brumm .

Holier - than - thou , an adjective , meaning “ marked by an air of superior piety or morality ” .
Everybody has moments in their life where they get into a “ holier - than - thou ” attitude , and I think Steve Jobs ’ open letter regarding Adobe , and Flash in particular , really fits the bill .
There are three specific points I want to address to illustrate just how holier - than - thou , hypocritical , and misleading this letter really is .
Jobs ’ letter contains a lot of good points .
Flash is indeed a very problematic piece of software ; its performance is terrible ( although 10.1 improves this ) , it ’s riddled with security issues , and it ’s highly unstable .
It crashes a lot , eats CPU , and to boot , opens up your machine to all sorts of security nastiness .
To make matters worse , it ’s proprietary and not a web standard in the true sense of the word .
That being said , Jobs ’ letter is incredibly two - faced , hypocritical , and very misleading .
It ’s clearly a marketing trick to pull the wool over the eyes of consumers , and while that ’s okay ( they ’re in it to make money , after all ) , it ’s our job to remove that wool from our eyes .
Just as we geeks immediately understand Microsoft ’s ulterior motive in licensing patents to Linux / Android vendors , we should not just accept Jobs ’ words either .
There are three points I wish to address specifically to illustrate just how hypercritical the letter is : Carbon , H264 , and iTunes on Windows ( or iTunes ’ non-existence on Linux ) .
The order is entirely random , and there ’s no deeper meaning behind it .
Carbon
In his letter , Jobs derided Adobe for not adopting new technologies quick enough , pointing specifically towards how long it has taken Adobe to leave Carbon behind .
It was n’t until the recently released Creative Suite version 5.0 that Adobe switched its applications over to Cocoa .
Considering how old Cocoa is , it ’s indeed about time .
But then , why did it take Apple so many years to transition the prime Mac OS X application , the Finder , to Cocoa ?
The Cocoa variant of the Finder shipped with Snow Leopard , which was released August 28 , 2009 .
To make matters worse – iTunes still has n’t been re-written in Cocoa , and is still shipping in all its 32 bit Carbon goodness .
You could argue that surely , iTunes has no benefit from switching to Carbon and 64bit , and I ’ll grant you that one .
However , Apple has one massive application that is still fully Carbon and 32bit , an application that is very similar in scope to Adobe ’s product offerings : Final Cut Pro is still written in Carbon , and is still 32 bit .
In other words , it ’s okay for Apple to neglect Cocoa for Final Cut Pro , but it ’s not okay for Adobe to take their time .
I think the prime reason it is taking / has taken both Adobe and Apple so long to transition these massively complex applications over to Cocoa is quite a simple one : it ’s really hard .
These are n’t Chess or TextEdit we ’re talking about , people – we ’re looking at what is probably a massive amount of complicated code .
It ’s not just Adobe that has taken its sweet time to transition to Cocoa .
Microsoft Office : Mac 2008 is also written in Carbon , and heck , even Apple itself is still in the middle of transitioning to Cocoa .
H264
We ’ve talked about this on OSNews in quite some detail already .
H264 is no better than Flash .
This video codec is proprietary and patented up the wazzoo , and therefore , wholly incompatible with the very concept of an open standard .
To make matters much , much worse , the licensing body that oversees H264 , the MPEG - LA , has stated in no uncertain terms that they will not hesitate to sue ordinary users for using the video codec .
Why , then , is Apple , in a letter full of talk of openness and standards , promoting this closed codec , a codec that will once again shackle the web to a proprietary technology , just as we ’re busy breaking free from Flash ?
The answer is easy : follow the money .
Apple is part of the MPEG - LA , as is Microsoft .
This means that the more people license H264 , the more money Apple and Microsoft get , since their patents are in the patent pool .
Steve Jobs might go all starry - eyed and gush about how much Apple believes in open standards and the open web , but just as with any other company – Adobe , Microsoft – this support ends where Apple ’s wallet begins .
That is the sole reason why they ’re promoting H264 , disguising it as a web standard .
As you can see , I can get very worked up over this .
At least when Microsoft is talking about standards , everybody knows it ’s out of self - interest ; we geeks know Microsoft , and none of us will fall for that trap any longer .
This , however , is not yet the case with Apple – people still have this 1984 - esque perception of Apple being the rebel , and this leads to people accepting H264 without question .
This is dangerous , and will cripple the web once again .
And yes , I will hammer on this subject on OSNews for as long as it takes .
I have no problems whatsoever with proprietary software or technologies ( heck , my media centres both run Windows 7 , and I love my iPhone ) , but when it comes to the web , I am nearly militant about keeping it open .
I still remember the days when not having Flash was a major problem on many alternative operating systems , and just as we are starting to break free from it , Apple and Microsoft come in , pull the wool over everybody ’s eyes , and shackle the web to yet another proprietary technology .
I do n’t want to boot up Haiku R1 only to not be able to watch video content on the web .
It brings back too many unpleasant memories of yore .
iTunes
This one is strongly related to the Carbon aspect .
Jobs ’ letter talks about how it ’s bad for a platform if developers use cross- platform technologies , and more specifically , that Adobe has been slow in adopting new technologies in Mac OS X , with Carbon of course being the prime example .
And yet , without any sense of shame , Apple ships iTunes for Windows .
iTunes for Windows is by far one of the worst pieces of ( major ) Windows software you can possibly think of .
It does not integrate with Windows in any way , does not use any of the advanced technologies present since Windows Vista ( refined in Windows 7 ) , it ’s incredibly slow , it crashes a lot , it still has n’t been ported to 64bit ( despite consumer 64 bit versions of Windows existing since 2005 ) and in general , sucks harder than a … No , I ’m not going to finish that analogy .
Oh , and of course , it installs a whole boatload of services that run in the background without actually asking you for permission .
Install iTunes on Windows , and watch WinPatrol spaz out .
Remind you of anything ?
Yes , iTunes ( and all other Windows software Apple ships ) is the Flash of the Windows platform ( other than , uh , Flash itself , obviously ) .
The hypocrisy is so thick here you could cut it with a knife .
What makes it worse is the situation is n’t getting any better – quite the opposite .
Every new version of iTunes for Windows only seems to make it worse instead of better .
I have an iPhone and I love it .
However , I will not install iTunes for Windows .
I installed it to first set up my iPhone and transfer my CD collection , and then removed it as quickly as I could .
I ’ll install it again on a Windows machine once iPhone OS 4.0 is released .
Point releases be damned .
This actually brings up the last point I wanted to make , yet another point to illustrate the hypocrisy .
My main desktop , which I use for everything , has always had Linux installed alongside Windows , but somewhere late last year I realised I did n’t really use Windows any longer , so I decided to just remove it altogether .
This , of course , has cut me off from iTunes ( yay ! ) , while also cutting me off from access to my iPhone ( boo ! ) .
It would be incredibly trivial for Apple to allow people to manage their iPhone ’s and iPod ’s contents manually through the file manager , but illustrating its love for double standards , Apple refuses to .
They want to tie you to iTunes , world ’s worst piece of Windows software .
Conclusion
I really dreaded writing this article , since it will surely be construed as me somehow being pro-Microsoft .
The issue , however , is that pointing out that Microsoft is two - faced about open standards is about as useful as pointing out that humans need oxygen to live .
Stating the obvious is not interesting .
Apple is continuously putting itself out there as the hero of open standards , which is okay .
That ’s called marketing and there ’s nothing wrong with it .
Every company does it ( Google comes to mind ) , but the scary thing with Apple is that so many people actually eat this marketing up as fact .
Now , if you do n’t mind , I ’m going to watch Twin Peaks on one of my Windows 7 - powered media centres , while checking my iPhone for messages .
I ’m nothing if not totally aware of my own hypocrisy .
SCIENTISTS are studying an 82 - year - old man who claims he has not had any food or drink for 70 years .
Prahlad Jani ’s claims are being put to the test at a hospital in Ahmedabad , where he is being closely monitored and studied by India ’s Defence Research Development Organisation , which believes he may have a quality which could help save lives , The Telegraph reports .
He has so far spent six days without food or water under the strict observation of doctors who say his body is yet to show any signs of hunger or dehydration .
Mr Jani is regarded as a " breatharian " who can live a " spiritual life - force " alone .
He believes he is sustained by the " elixir " of a goddess .
The research organisation believes Mr Jani could hold the key to helping soldiers or disaster victims survive without food for longer periods in times of crisis .
" If his claims are verified , it will be a breakthrough in medical science , " said Dr G Ilavazhagan , director of the Defence Institute of Physiology & Allied Sciences .
" We will be able to help save human lives during natural disasters , high altitude , sea journeys and other natural and human extremities .
We can educate people about the survival techniques in adverse conditions with little food and water or nothing at all . "
However , others have dismissed Mr Jani as a " village fraud " .
Leading Australian nutritionist , Dr Joanna McMillan Price , said the study was a dangerous and pointless exercise .
" What ’s the point ?
To show spiritual strength ?
You would struggle to go for more than a week without water and without food , your body starts to break down muscle , eventually attacking the heart muscles needed to provide energy to the brain until ultimately you have a heart attack and you die , " she said .
Dr McMillan Price says
Mr Jani's beliefs probably helped him overcome basic survival instincts but would not physically sustain him .
" Your spiritual beliefs can give mental strength but the idea that spirituality can replace food and water is ludicrous , " she said .
" He would certainly be fighting strong physiological responses .
Your body starts getting pretty strong hunger pangs after a few days because your brain is telling you that you need to eat or you ’ll die . "
Dr McMillan Price said she could n't see Mr Jani lasting any more than a few extra days without water and she said his fasting gave the wrong message .
" The determination he ’s showing is certainly a nice message but I really think it could be put to better use than to go without food and water , " she said .
This guest post is written by Mark Bahnisch from Lavartus Prodeo for our series of blog posts on the importance of online civil liberties as part of EFA ’s 2010 Fundraising Campaign …
There are a range of good arguments against the Rudd government 's internet filter , some emphasised for persuasive or tactical reasons , some reflective of deeply held political and political positions .
Among the latter , liberal and libertarian arguments tend to dominate .
This is not necessarily to say that those advancing such arguments ( which we might usefully summarise under the slogan ' information wants to be free ' ) are liberals or libertarians in a consistently ideological sense , or on the political right .
It 's more that the deep logic of the internet 's history produces an argument in terms of freedom , and that view seems natural to those who are passionate about the online world .
In this article , I want to present a somewhat more sociological argument , and one that seeks to build on an alternative ( though , in part , complementary ) set of assumptions drawn from left and progressive thought and tradition .
In so doing , the target at which I want to aim is not the internet filter itself , or Stephen Conroy himself .
To my mind , the personalisation of the debate has not been a helpful aspect of the campaign against the filter proposal .
What I think is useful and important to understand is the underlying cause of the government 's move , which casts the argument around freedom in something of a different light .
What is at issue here is the desire to govern the private choices of individuals , a desire which has had its apogee in the communitarian aspects of New Labour governance in the United Kingdom .
To adapt a judgement made by The Economist , thirteen years of New Labour government has seen the state grow , personal freedom greatly diminish , but the underlying social patterns of inequality little disturbed .
The urge to shape and dictate private choices has been growing among Labor governments in Australia , with the long lived Bob Carr style state regimes leading the vanguard .
Mark Latham tempered the communitarian rhetoric to a high flame during his leadership , and despite his repudiation by the ALP , the Rudd government has seemingly adopted a similar governing mentality , albeit at more of a simmer .
The causes of the desire to govern the soul are multiple , though interconnected and interwoven .
It 's no coincidence that an increasing drive to interfere with private decisions and choices accompanied the election of the first generation of centre - left governments after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Francis Fukuyama 's proclamation of the End of History .
The ideological climate where social democrats lost any sense of the capacity to transform , and the desirability of transforming economic and social relations lent itself to a statism without long term purpose , a statism that manifests itself in interventions to transform private lives rather than to transform national and global society .
Stripped of the power , and the will , to restructure economic life so as to negate deeply structural inequalities in a globalised world , purpose and the will to do good manifests itself into a micro-level of intervention ; what Michel Foucault called ' biopolitics ' - a politics of governing the individual body and soul .
Reflected through the prism of the constant campaign , the spectacle of the symbol in politics , and the 24/7 media cycle , ' bite - sized ' policies have the capacity to substitute for social change over the long term and to feed the drumbeat of moral panic sounded on a repetitive and moment by moment time scale .
Secondly , in a risk society , individuals are less trusted to make choices for themselves , governed by their desires , their use of private reason , and their consciences .
The sub-politics of risk , to invoke the German sociologist Ulrich Beck , concerns itself with the downside of modernity and complexity - the costs of the aggregation of private decisions to public finances and purposes .
In areas like health , child development , and many others , the costs of perceived negative choices are transferred to a public purse unable to deal with them , and in a neo-liberal culture , the production of a docile and compliant workforce is key both to the legitimation of governance in a chaotic environment and to the reproduction of late capitalist patterns of work , consumption and distribution .
Thirdly , the micro-government of the individual is a key point of contestation at the site where democratisation and authority clash .
An increasing climate of openness from the 1960s onwards , and the democratisation of culture among whose effects is a resistance to assertions of authority , later supplemented by the growth of populisms both right and left combined to render the notion that policy is an effect of expertise shaky .
' Evidence - based policy ' is something of a backlash .
With politics denuded of big picture ideological conflicts , the void is filled with hordes of experts , who with the best will in the world , think that they know what 's good for us .
Labor governments , stripped of any real transformational purpose , obsessed with symbolic campaigning and feeding the media beast , and concerned about the governance of risk , seize upon ( and cherry pick ) crumbs from the table of thinktank , private and public research expertise .
So , then , the internet filter is part of a bigger picture .
It 's one more item , among the alcopops tax , the national testing regime in schools , and many others , of a form of governmental mentality which seeks to shape , or to dictate , choices to citizens , who are presumed to be unable to discern their own best interests .
Evidence , research and policy step in , and electoral advantage is sought through the intertwined machine of political communication and media dissemination .
Yet , there is another left tradition .
That is the tradition embodied in movements for popular education from the 19th century onwards , in the habits of auto - didacticism of early trade unionists and activists , of the respect for reason and informed conscience and judgement imparted to English speaking socialisms and Labourism from the dissent of chapel and the world of workplace dispute and argument .
This tradition is one of the cultivation of the capacities of all citizens to apply reason to human affairs , to make conscientiously good decisions in their private lives through collective learning and civic conversation , for opportunity to be opened up rather than to be circumscribed .
This fundamentally progressive attitude and set of dispositions seeks to expand the capabilities of ordinary folk and to enable and facilitate citizens ' desires for autonomy , self - government and collective government of communal and state institutions .
It 's part of a sweeping movement of democratisation , which popped up in another context at the height of the administered society in the 1950s and 1960s , in a desire for participatory decision - making and for individuals together to question the force of ingrained social norms .
It 's part of an activist culture manifested in social movements such as feminism and other liberatory and transformational currents .
At its heart , it represents a fundamental optimism , a philosophical anthropology foundational to left politics ( and to liberalism , too ) which holds that humans are thinking beings able to be trusted with choice , and whose choices deserve a basic level of respect .
The internet , as I alluded to at the outset , is part of that secular movement towards the democratisation of social relations ; and of knowledge .
It 's precisely because the internet affords so much promise for those who wish to decide their destinies in common , to learn , to form an informed judgement and habit of thought that its freedom from state interference is so important at the level of principle .
I 'm not so interested in the particulars of the reasons advanced by the Rudd government for this latest instance of the desire to micro-manage individual choices .
I 'm much more interested in opposing , in principle , anything that partakes in the disrespect for the capacities of individual citizens to decide severally and collectively how best to regulate their own lives .
That 's a principle , in my view , that from a left and progressive position , is well worth fighting for .
In response to a South Park episode in which the Prophet Muhammad appears in a bear costume , the radical Muslim website Revolutionmuslim.com hinted that the TV show ’s creators would end up like murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh .

Indian style preserved lemons , commonly referred to just as “ lemon pickle , ” come in probably not hundreds , but thousands of varieties .
Here ’s how to make just one of these amazing creations : Gujarati Lemon Pickle .
Sweet , salty and easy to make , it takes a few spices , a few minutes and about a month .
We started with this recipe for its simplicity .
It fills about a half - gallon initially , and reduces to about a quart later .
Wide mouth mason jars are best , unless your lemons are small enough to fit through a narrower opening .
You can make it in a couple of quart jars at first and consolidate later , or use a larger jar if you have one .
For the first part , you ’ll need about 2 pounds of lemons , 3/ 4 cup of salt , and 2 teaspoons of turmeric .
Wash the lemons well and dry them thoroughly .
Mix the turmeric with the salt .
Slit the lemons most of the way through , and pour a big spoonful of the salt mixture in the middle and close the lemon .
Stuff the stuffed lemons into your jars .
Pour any remaining salt mixture over the lemons and seal up the jars .
Make a note in your calendar to check on them in a month , and write the start date on the top of the jar .
Many pickle recipes call for the jars to be left in the sun , but this one did n’t specify , so we stuck it in a pantry cupboard , where it was out of the way at room temperature .
The recipe says , “ The lemons will leave some water . ”
A fascinating liquid will gradually accumulate at the bottom of the jar , but it is clearly not just water .
After a while , strands of disintegrating lemon pulp and particles of turmeric are visible in the viscous fluid .
Once your month is up , pour out and reserve the liquid , and take out the lemon pieces to cut them up .
The liquid is syrupy and has an intense salty scent , and the as the turmeric that settled on the bottom wafts out , you ’ll remember that this is an Indian recipe .
I like my lemon pieces on the smaller side , so I cut them into eighths rather than the quarters the recipe suggested .
You can optionally remove the seeds at this point as well .
Once your lemons are cut into pieces , you ’ll need two cups of sugar , four teaspoons of red chili pepper powder ( e.g. cayenne ) , and one teaspoon of asafoetida
Mix the sugar and spices in with the reserved liquid .
Pour the sugar mixture over the cut lemon pieces .
It will take a little while or a little stirring to get most of the air bubbles out so that you can put as much of the mixture as possible in with the lemons .
Many of these pickles seem to last forever if they ’re well sealed , but you can start eating it right away .
It should gradually improve as the flavors merge over time , and according to the recipe , it should keep for a couple of years .
I ’m not sure ours will last long enough for us to find out !
It ’s a fine condiment to go with different types of Indian fare .
We like the guilty pleasure of just spreading it on our naan .
If you liked this recipe , you might also like our simple marmalade walk through .
It ’s slightly more complicated , though –that one involves cooking .
A flotilla of eight boats carrying thousands of tonnes of construction materials , medical equipment and other aid is preparing to sail to Gaza in the next few days , setting the scene for a confrontation with Israel which has vowed to prevent the ships breaking the blockade on the Palestinian territory .
Three cargo ships and five passenger vessels plan to meet up in international waters between Cyprus and Gaza Strip before heading towards Gaza City .
The Israeli military is expected to stop the flotilla and divert it to the Israeli port of Ashdod .
One of the organisers of the flotilla , which includes three vessels from Turkey , is IHH , a humanitarian aid group supported by Ankara .
Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since the Israelis launched a three - week war on Gaza in 2008 - 09 .
An attempt to block the flotilla is likely to increase tensions between the two countries .
The Turkish prime minister , Racep Tayyip Erdogan , has called on Israel to avoid this be allowing the boats through .
" This could make relations between Israel and Turkey more complicated , " said Yigal Palmor , an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman .
On board the ships are 10,000 tonnes of cargo and about 700 - 800 activists and politicians from more than 40 countries .
The cargo includes building materials , medical supplies and paper for schools .
One boat is carrying a complete dental surgery including drills .
Crayons and chocolate are also on board for Gazan children .
The cargo has been paid for by donations .
" We 're trying to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip and tell the world that Israel has no right to starve 1.5 million Palestinians , " said Greta Berlin , of the Free Gaza Movement , another organiser of the flotilla .
" We are bringing in vitally needed supplies so the people of Gaza can rebuild their infrastructure . "
Israel has imposed an economic blockade on Gaza since the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas seized control almost three years ago .
Nearly all exports and imports are banned and only a limited supply of food and medical aid is allowed in .
Free Gaza has organised six previous aid boats to the Palestinian territory , the last three of which were blocked from reaching their destination by the Israeli military .
This is the biggest attempt to take aid to Gaza .
" The previous boats were making a statement ‑ these boats will be making a real impact , " said Berlin .
The Israeli navy enforces a 20 - nautical mile ( 23 - mile ) closure of the sea off Gaza , which has had a devastating impact on its fishing industry .
" The boats will not be allowed to enter Gaza territorial waters , " said Palmor .
" This is a territory in a self - declared state of war with Israel .
There can be no uncontrolled transportation in or out of Gaza . "
Berlin accused Israel of " sabre - rattling " in the hope that the flotilla plan will be abandoned .
" They have no right to control Gaza waters unless they want to admit they are occupying Gaza , " she said .
" They are the illegal entity , not us . "
Israel claims it is acting within international law .
The Turkish ferry Mavi Marmara was today docked in Antalya , Turkey , along with two cargo ships , waiting to be joined by boats from Greece .
" We will all go together in the next couple of days , " said Hosain Orut , of the IHH .
John Ging , head of the main UN agency in Gaza , urged more ships carrying aid to be sent : " We believe that Israel would not stop these vessels because the sea is open , and many human rights organisations have been successful in previous similar steps , and proved that breaking the siege on Gaza is possible . "
Earlier this week , a UN report said that three - quarters of the damage caused to Gaza 's infrastructure during the three - week military conflict has not been repaired because of the blockade .
Mark Regev , the Israeli prime minister 's spokesman , said : " It is strange that human rights activists are acting as apologists for a regime that is brutally repressing human rights .
Hamas oppresses women , gays and Christians , has crushed independent media and destroyed all political opposition . "
He added that 15,000 tonnes of aid was allowed into Gaza every week .
Dozens of boats manned by Israeli citizens took the water at the weekend in protest at the aid flotilla .
The boats
• Four cargo ships
• Four passenger ships
• Coming from Turkey , Greece , Ireland
On board
• 700 to 800 peace activists and MPs from more than 40 countries
• 10,000 tonnes of supplies , including :
• Cement
• Generators
• Water purification equipment
• 20 tonnes of paper for schools
• Prefabricated homes
• $ 1 m ( £ 700,000 ) of medical equipment , including : CAT scanners ' wheelchairs , crutches
• A complete dental surgery , including drills and a chair
• Sports equipment , including footballs and basketballs
• Crayons and pens
• Chocolate
Paid for
• By donations , ranging from $ 1.39 from an individual in Brunei to € 300,000 ( £ 256,000 ) collected in Malaysia

Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost # 2
By Leroy Douresseaux
Radical Comics ’ re-imaging of “ Aladdin and the Magic Lamp ” from Arabian Nights continues .
Written by Ian Edginton and drawn by Patrick Reilly ( all of issue # 1 and part of # 2 ) and Stjepan Sejic ( part of # 2 and all of # 3 ) , Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost transports readers to the mystical city of Shambhalla and focuses on Aladdin , an orphaned thief and liar , and Qassim , a powerful and devious sorcerer .
Qassim has discovered that Aladdin carries a mystical ability within his blood that makes the young thief the perfect person to steal a legendary lost lamp .
As Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost # 2 begins , Aladdin is wowing the denizens of Shambhalla with his ostentatious displays of wealth , especially by throwing around gold coins .
This rankles King Rhokari , but the King would n’t mind having Aladdin , now known as the Golden Prince , wed his daughter , the feisty Princess Soraya .
The double dealing Qassim , however , returns with a plot so dark that Aladdin will need the help of the legendary Sinbad the Sailor and the devious Mantis Queen to save Soraya and himself .
THE LOWDOWN : The second issue of Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost is even better than the first .
All the things that made the first issue a fun read are also in the second issue , and Aladdin is a far more engaging and interesting character than he was previously .
He has a goal and a lot to lose , and he ’s looking for a shot at redemption , so now he ’s more than just another clever wastrel and thief at the center of a fantastic scenario .
The reason that Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost is such fun to read is that the creators are n’t afraid to present something big .
Much has been made of Radical Publishing ’s Hollywood connection , and Hollywood is n’t afraid of being big .
Like a Jerry Bruckheimer fantasy film , Legacy of the Lost transports the reader to exotic locales and mysterious , impossible places .
These settings are populated by preposterous creatures and grand adversaries with a penchant for casting reality - warping spells or wielding robust dark magic .
Plucky heroes leap from danger ( often out of windows many stories above the ground ) , and their resourcefulness and a sword are their only weapons against magic .
Like Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , Radical Publishing delivers big fantasy and epic storytelling .
POSSIBLE AUDIENCE : Readers looking for epic in their comic books will choose Aladdin : Legacy of the Lost .

While California universities have faced round after round of crippling budget cuts and protests against increased fees have flared on campuses , administrators have tapped funds meant for classrooms and students to cover some extraordinary costs : losses on ill - timed real estate deals , loans to high - ranking officials and an ambitious construction project .
Experts say the moves , made without wide student knowledge or public oversight , show that administrators have put aggressive business plans ahead of the teaching mission .
When things go wrong , they ’re dipping into student fees , scholarship funds and money meant for classes to pick up the tab .
FOR THE RECORD :
University spending :
An article in Sunday ’s Section A about California universities ’ use of money meant for classrooms and student services said a building purchased by a foundation affiliated with Cal State Sacramento was empty .
According to a school spokeswoman , about a dozen events including lectures and a faculty retreat have been held in the 188,000 - square - foot building since January .
The article also misstated Jesse Bernal ’s title .
He is the University of California student regent , not UCLA student regent .
In addition , former UCLA fundraiser Richard Bergman ’s name was misspelled as Berman in one reference , and Cal State Sacramento President Alexander Gonzalez ’s name was misspelled as Gonzales in one reference . —
“ It ’s almost like they kind of lose sight of the core purpose of what they ’re there to do , and get excited by the opportunity to speculate with other people ’s money , ” said Steve Boilard , director of higher education for the state ’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
At UCLA , student fees are being used to save a plan to renovate Pauley Pavilion , home of the school ’s legendary basketball team .
In 2006 , administrators launched a campaign to raise $ 100 million from private contributors to pay for the $ 185 - million upgrade , which includes cushier seats , a high - definition scoreboard and expanded locker rooms .
But when the fundraising effort fell victim to the recession , administrators changed the finance plan to include $ 25 million from student fees .
“ Students really were n’t involved in the process , beyond maybe some rubber - stamp committee , ” said UCLA Student Regent Jesse Bernal .
“ I do n’t think they know enough about it . ”
Most of the student money , $ 15 million , will come from fees approved by a student referendum in 2000 to maintain two older campus buildings that house gyms and student centers .
The remaining $ 10 million had been set aside for seismic repair of student facilities .
Using that money to renovate the arena “ seems like a strange priority , ” said long - time UCLA fundraiser Richard Bergman , who originally chaired the Pauley Pavilion campaign .
He said he was summarily dismissed last year after complaining about several aspects of the project , including the dip into student pockets .
UCLA Athletics Director Dan Guerrero told reporters last fall that Bergman “ was very committed to the project , but along the way we had some disagreements -- reasonable people have disagreements -- on how we should proceed , and it was just felt that it was better to part ways . ”
Bergman said that when money got tight , administrators should have scaled back their ambitions .
Steve Olsen , UCLA ’s chief operating officer , acknowledged that the referendum approving the fee included nothing about Pauley Pavilion .
But “ it was always clearly understood that as the revenues grew , additional projects could be appropriately funded by those fees , ” he said .
Cindy Mosqueda , who was a UCLA sophomore in 2000 and a leader of the campaign for the fee , said there was no such understanding .
“ We . . . thought we needed additional space and the asbestos out of the basement , ” said Mosqueda , now a PhD. candidate .
“ If we knew it would be used in the future for Pauley Pavilion , we would n’t have worked so hard . ”
Few students will be able to afford a good view at the renovated Pauley , where seats between the baskets are expected to cost more than Lakers tickets , Berman said .
Season tickets will require a one - time fee in the tens of thousands of dollars .
At Cal State Sacramento , administrators used general fund money to cover an investment that went bad .
University Enterprises Inc. , an independent foundation affiliated with the school , paid more than $ 35 million raised from private donors to buy a commercial office building near campus in 2007 .
Administrators said they planned to hold classes in half of the building ’s 188,000 square feet and lease the rest to generate revenue .
Then the real estate bubble burst .
The building is empty , and university President Alexander Gonzalez said he paid $ 5.6 million last year to prevent the foundation from falling into foreclosure on it .
The money came from the school ’s general fund -- a combination of student fees and tax dollars -- which is more commonly used to pay professors ’ salaries , utility bills and the other day - to - day costs of educating students .
“ It does kind of look like a gift of public money to the foundation , ” said Boilard in the Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
Patrick Murphy , an adjunct fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California , said the Sacramento situation is a prime example of why land deals are usually handled through separate capital accounts .
“ Maybe instead of coming up with clever deals like that , ” Murphy said , administrators “ should invest in the core courses that many CSU students say they ca n’t get . ”
The payment exacerbated an already severe budget shortfall that has forced the school to forgo most spring admissions this semester , university spokeswoman Gloria Moraga said .
And student fees rose 32 % last year while classes were being cut , leaving many unable to finish their degrees on time .
“ They said there ’s no money , and yet they come up with millions for that building , ” said Alma Lopez , 23 , a biology major from the Central Valley town of Tracy .
The bailout adds to campus frustration that began in 2007 when the foundation came under fire for giving Gonzalez , then newly hired , $ 233,000 in personal loans and paying $ 27,000 to put a new stove in his house .
Moraga said the foundation made the purchase after the university ’s head chef declared the existing stove inadequate for the large parties and fundraisers Gonzalez would be hosting .
“ There were health and safety issues , ” Moraga said .
The transactions are the subject of an ongoing audit by the state attorney general ’s office .
Last month , Gonzales said the new building wo n’t be a drain on school finances once the real estate market picks up .
“ This is just a stopgap , ” Gonzalez said of the $ 5.6 - million expenditure .
“ The purchase of the building is still a very , very good deal . ”
After it is renovated , the nursing department will move out of its current cramped quarters and into the modern building , where it will be able to offer public clinics , Moraga said .
But the use of general - fund money to save the foundation ’s privately funded investment has become a rallying point for the California State University faculty union , some of whose members have been laid off or furloughed as budgets have tightened .
The union is pushing a bill in the Capitol to force university foundations to share their financial documents under the California open - records law .
“ These organizations can make arrangements that end up costing the campus money , ” said Cal State Sacramento math professor Scott Farrand , who sits on the school ’s budget panel .
The attorney general ’s office is also auditing a foundation at Sonoma State University following revelations that the organization , which provides student scholarships , lent millions of dollars to a former board member for private deals involving undeveloped land , home building ventures and a vineyard .
Clem Carinalli , a large area landowner , began receiving loans worth more than $ 8 million from the foundation days after resigning from the board , said university spokeswoman Susan Kashack .
One of his business associates sat on the board while the loans were approved but was forced to resign in December over the apparent conflict of interests .
The foundation hoped to profit from interest on the loans , but Carinalli filed for bankruptcy protection last year .
He still owed $ 1.25 million to the foundation , said Kashack .
There ’s less money available for scholarships this year .
Kashack blamed the weak economy , not troubled investments with an ex-foundation board member .
“ We do not make these kinds of investments anymore , ” she added .

Straphangers on their way to and from work Wednesday were surprised to see Transportation Security Administration officials , who usually screen luggage in airports , checking bags at local subway stations .
The TSA launched a pilot partnership with the NYPD Wednesday morning to enhance security on city trains , a spokeswoman for the TSA said .
About a dozen stations are covered daily , according to the NYPD .
“ While there is no specific threat to mass transit in the United States at this time , TSA and NYPD continuously work together to strengthen overall security efforts and keep the American people safe , ” the Administration said in a statement .
At the 40th Street and 8th Avenue entrance to the Port Authority 42nd Street station , TSA staffers began randomly searching passengers at 4 p.m .
The searches were expected to last through the evening rush .
Screeners said that passengers are generally happy to comply .

President Barack Obama has taken the United States one more giant step towards socialism by ramming through the Senate his financial regulation bill .
The bill authorizes the secretary of the Treasury — a political appointee — to seize any financial company ( bank or nonbank ) simply because , in his opinion , it is too big to fail and in danger of insolvency .
This power can be used for political retribution , pressure for campaign funding , or any other abuse bureaucratic whim or partisan politics can conceive .
It is a power Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez would love to have !
The legislation also requires that any business that extends credit , in any form , to clear the loan instrument in advance with the new consumer protection agency .
The backlog of pending applications will strangle consumer credit .
And the bill fails to do the one thing it must do — regulate derivatives and make them transparent .
Senator Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , bowed to pressure from his sponsors on Wall Street and deleted the regulatory provision and set up a commission to study the situation for two years !
Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , protested the cop -out with a no vote against the legislation .
So how did it pass ?
Four Republicans sold out , that ´s how !
Among the RINOs were , of course , Susan Collins and Olympia Snow of Maine .
But , surprisingly , Scott Brown , R Mass. , the newly elected Massachusetts miracle defected as did the normally stalwart Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa .
Now the federal government has effectively taken over about one - third of our national economy by passing Obamacare and regulatory reform in almost the same breath .
Repealing this regulatory travesty must be high on our 2011 agenda !
The U.S. government 's Information Security Oversight Office ( ISOO ) released important new information about government secrecy today .
In particular , the report reveals that most government classification decisions are made by people with little training and no accountability .
Our government has a real problem of excessive secrecy .
You can't have a real democracy when the operation of the government is hidden from the people .
Secrecy kills public accountability and cripples the government 's system of checks and balances — both essential elements of our constitutional democracy .
For 50 years the problem has been growing , and study commission after study commission has come to the same conclusions : a ) the government classifies way too much information , and b ) that hurts government accountability , our democracy , and even our national security .
The ISOO ( a part of the National Archives and Records Administration ) puts out a report every year on the government 's security classification programs .
This year 's report includes data that sheds some interesting new light on the secrecy problem :
Only one - third of one percent ( 0.33 percent ) of classification decisions in 2009 were made by officials who are trained to do so — people known as " original classification authorities , " who are specifically designated by the president or agency heads and trained to judge what information absolutely must be safeguarded to protect national security .
The rest of last year 's 54 million classification decisions ( 99.66 percent ) were what is known as " derivative classification . "
This happens when , for example , a CIA analyst writes a report that includes information from another document that is already marked secret , or just references a secret program or operation .
The new report will be marked secret — sometimes the whole thing — even though the vast majority of the information in it is not based on secret sources .
Derivative classification can be performed by anyone with a security clearance — that 's at least 3 million people , from entry - level soldiers to contractors in private industry to high - ranking government officials .
The result , not surprisingly , is a vast sea of confused overclassification and disarray that gums up the flow of information within the government and blocks a lot of information the American people should have access to .
As the Moynihan Commission ( one of the most prominent and thorough studies of the secrecy problem ) found in 1997 , " many of the individuals who classify derivatively remain unfamiliar with the proper procedures . "
Sure enough , the new ISOO report finds an enormously high error rate ( 65 percent ) in the supposedly secret documents it examined .
Today , my ACLU colleague Mike German — himself a former FBI agent who knows a thing or two about the ways of our security agencies — has published a fascinating analysis of the government ’s new secrecy report ( some of which I have summarized above ) .
Included in that paper is an analysis of an FBI memo providing instructions on classification obtained by the ACLU that perfectly illustrates the often incoherent operation of the government ’s secrecy machinery .
The Obama administration has taken some positive steps toward addressing this problem , such as requiring every person who derivatively classifies information to identify themselves on each document they classify , to receive training , and to segregate classified information where possible .
At the same time , it is clear that more drastic measures are needed .
In particular , Congress needs to step up to the plate and address the problem of runaway secrecy head - on , beginning with comprehensive oversight hearings and ending with smart , realistic legislative solutions to this problem that threatens the very core of our democracy more than any act of terrorism we have ever seen .
In The Conversation , David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday .
The Associated Press
Gail Collins : David , I apologize in advance for giving you a toughie when you ’re on book deadline .
But there ’s a question that ’s been going around a lot these days that I ’d like to hear your take on .
Who leads the Republican Party ?
I ’ll either take the next presidential - nominee or just the visionary / architect / wiseperson who is going to be the power behind the scenes over the next couple of years .
I am not part of the suicidally depressed left that is sure Sarah Palin is going to be the next presidential nominee .
The Democrats are in an interesting and not unusual position right now .
Even though they ’re horrified by the Tea Party folks , they rub their hands with glee when any of them appears to be in striking distance of a serious nomination .
Great news !
A sure seat for the Republicans is now in play because they ’ve got a crazy person on their ticket .
I see their point , but I still feel more comfortable in a country where the elections are between two sane people .
So I have a little bit of a stake in your finding us somebody semi-reasonable to root for .
I am not part of the suicidally depressed left that is sure Sarah Palin is going to be the next presidential nominee .
I think she ’s too smart to even try — she is very smart , in an uncurious , intellectually lazy way .
Sort of what George Bush would be like if he ’d been sent to Wasilla High instead of prep school .
In fact , let ’s give Sarah some credit here .
If George W. had her background , he’d be serving fast food and cursing the day he got fired from the overnight shift at the canning factory .
Anyhow , Palin is having a great time right now .
I do n’t think she ’s ever going to want to trade it in for a hard , unremunerative , grinding political competition .
If she gets the chance , her canny side will tell her to punt .
David Brooks :
This is no toughie .
This is a subject on which I have pent up opinions , so it ’s a pleasure to lift my head up from early childhood attachment patterns ( the part of my book I ’m working on today ) to blow off a little steam .
The Palin phenomenon is a media psychodrama and nothing more .
First , let ’s all stop paying attention to Sarah Palin for a little while .
I understand why liberals want to talk about her .
She allows them to feel intellectually superior to their opponents .
And members of the conservative counterculture want to talk about her simply because she drives liberals insane .
But she is a half - term former governor with a TV show .
She is not going to be the leader of any party and does n’t seem to be inclined in that direction .
The Sarah Palin phenomenon is a media psychodrama and nothing more .
It gives people on each side an excuse to vent about personality traits they despise , but it has nothing to do with government .
She is in 2010 what Jerry Falwell was from the mid-1990s until his death — a conservative cartoon inflated by media .
Evangelicals used to say that Falwell had three main constituency groups — ABC , CBS and NBC .
Gail Collins :
Hey , I ’m happy to see that I ’ve brought a little sunshine to the basement cell where I presume you ’re chained until the book is finished .
I think we are in accord about Sarah .
What about the rest of the would - be- presidential pack ?
Mitt Romney has all the intellectual equipment for the job .
Except that everybody , including the members of his party , thinks he ’s a smooth panderer who would trade his political principles for a pack of Chiclets .
( I am not mentioning what he did to his dog today .
Even Seamus needs a break . )
If Palin is n’t going to be the leader / nominee , you would think that the leader / nominee would have to be somebody who could stand on the stage with her and not completely fade into the background .
I know you ’re a fan of Gov. Tim Pawlenty , but I watched him at the rally with Palin and Representative Michele Bachmann , and he looked as if he was one of the ushers who ’d accidentally wandered onstage .
David Brooks : I guess if I were to name some future and current leaders of the G.O.P. , it would be people who wield a lot of power in Republican circles .
I ’d list , say , Jon Kyl , Lamar Alexander , Jeff Sessions and Lindsey Graham in the Senate .
In the states , clearly Gov. Mitch Daniels is the one most likely to become the 2012 presidential nominee .
I like him because he ’s about 5 feet 7 inches or so .
He ’s low to the ground .
His fan club should be called the Mitchets .
I like a presidential aspirant who is roughly my height .
Plus he happens to be a very successful governor — a pragmatic manager with an impeccable record of fiscal responsibility .
If I were to name some future and current leaders of the G.O.P. , it would be people who wield a lot of power in Republican circles .
Last week , everybody was talking about Palin and Newt Gingrich , the two television personalities , but real live Republicans are mounting serious challenges for office in real states .
Representative Mark Kirk is running for Senate in Illinois , one of the smartest members of Congress today .
Rob Portman , a former director of the Office of Management and Budget , is mounting a serious challenge for Senate in Ohio .
There are few people as decent and well informed as he is .
In California , business leaders Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina are running pretty well in the polls .
But nobody seems to cover them much because the Sarah Palin circus is perpetually in town .
Meanwhile , Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey has embarked on a brave effort to actually balance a budget .
Gail Collins :
You ’re digging pretty deep .
I guess Governor Christie is being brave , but he ’s doing it in the most irritating manner possible .
And I have to make a confession — when you mentioned Mitch Daniels , I had to remind myself which state he was governing .
( Knew it was someplace in the middle .
Indiana . Indiana . )
And while I am totally on your side on the height issue , is n’t it true that the tallest candidate always gets elected president ?
Let ’s face it , all the Republicans you really like are people who could never get the presidential nomination .
Except John McCain , and then when he actually won , he turned into somebody else .
You ’re too good for them , David .
David Brooks : I guess my bottom line is this .
According to Gallup , the Democratic Party now has its lowest favorability rating ever , or at least since they started formally asking the question 20 or so years ago .
Fifty - eight percent of Americans want to repeal the health care bill .
It is more unpopular now than when it passed .
Republicans lead on the generic Congressional ballot , which is unusual even in years when they do well .
In a few months , people will pay attention to the real political leaders … the ones running and winning office .
We can all stop paying attention to the reality TV icons .
Sony is expected to unveil this new wearable Walkman here at CES according to SonyInsider .
The W - series device is said to feature 2GB of memory with a price in the range of $ 50 to $ 75 .
Magnetic connectors keep the 13.5 mm EX earphones with built - in MP3 , AAC , DRM'd WMA and PCM player tidy and heart - shaped when not in use .
The Walkman charges to 90 minutes playback after just 3 minutes on the mains -- 30 minutes will give you 12 hours .
Sounds good , but we 'll have to check these out in person to measure the dork - factor .
Piracy is hurting the bottom line of the adult entertainment industry , according to a new public - address video starring porn stars .
The Adult Entertainment Trade Association , a branch of the Free Speech Coalition , says DVD sales are down at least a third because of DVD counterfeiting and so - called internet " tube " porn sites that sometimes infect viewers ' computers with malware and spyware .
Credible piracy figures are not available , as the porn business is run largely by private companies , the coalition says .
" What we 're trying to communicate in these new videos , is that this is not just hurting the big companies like Larry Flynt , but the people who work in production , the performers , the sideline businesses like makeup artists , " says Joanne Cachapero , the coalition 's membership coordinator , in a telephone interview Thursday .
" Piracy is really a problem for our industry in terms of dropping revenues .
This is what we 're trying to communicate to the consumer . "
Cachapero says the porn industry is years behind the anti-piracy efforts of the recording industry and the mainstream motion - picture industry .
Those efforts include lobbying , digital rights management and even litigation .
That 's about to change .
Many adult - film producers within the last month have begun employing fingerprinting technology to track online copyright infringement , Cachapero says .
A bounty of copyright infringement lawsuits might follow , Cachapero said .

Last weekend , Rockstar Games provided ten fan site administrators with the opportunity to visit New York City and play Grand Theft Auto : Episodes from Liberty City on PC and PlayStation 3 .
In addition , we were given the chance to play Rockstar 's upcoming western game , Red Dead Redemption , which is scheduled for release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 18 , 2010 .
The impressions below are based on our experience of the Xbox 360 version .
In total , representatives of six GTA fan sites attended the event .
Myself ( adamcs ) , Andy , illspirit and Jevon represented The GTA Network .
We spent the first half of Saturday playing Episodes from Liberty City at Rockstar�s headquarters in Manhattan .
If you�ve yet to try EFLC then it�s something we strongly recommend .
The episodes offer an entirely fresh way of exploring Liberty City with new missions , new vehicles , additional music and more .
The episodes offer something different , so if there was a particular aspect of GTA IV you did n't like , be sure to give the episodes a try .
In the evening we headed out to Brooklyn to play Red Dead Redemption , which is being developed by Rockstar San Diego .
If you 've been living under a rock for the past few months , then check out the official Red Dead Redemption website to see what it 's about .
We spent the first couple of hours playing single player and the remainder of the event playing multiplayer .
Read our individual impressions below ...
Andy's Impressions
For those who aren�t already familiar with the storyline , it goes a little something like this :
John Marston , the protagonist of the game , is a former outlaw who has cleaned himself up and settled down with a family .
The federal government wants Marston to track down and kill his former gang members and their leader .
To ensure that he complies with their �request� , Marston�s family is being used as collateral .
This �family being held for ransom� situation acts as the trigger that fires Marston through the scattered towns of New Austin and beyond .
As the game progresses , further story development and character progression is dependent entirely on the player .
Beyond John Marston , the world of Red Dead Redemption is still very much alive .
Random �pedestrians � don�t exist in this game - everyone has a name , and your interactions with them will always have a consequence .
As with all Rockstar titles , insanely meticulous perfectionism is modus operandi for Redemption .
During the early stages of development , Rockstar�s research wing investigated documents ranging from the American national history archives to old Sears catalogues .
The intent was to learn more about the life and times of early settlers in the west ) , all in order to recreate the atmosphere and culture of the era as accurately as possible .
A large amount of research was also done to add realism to wildlife aesthetics , behaviour and movement - all of which are readily apparent in the game .
When the West was Lost
In most media , the old west has traditionally been portrayed as a romantic sort of fantasy land with antihero outlaws , daring cowboys and stylish showdowns between skilled gunmen .
As one Rockstar employee described it to me , Redemption is intended to provide a different perspective - a look into how the west was lost , rather than how it was �won� .
Red Dead takes place in a time when the Wild West was starting to fade away , and while it does preserve some of the classic spaghetti western moments , it puts more focus on realistically portraying the people who coped with the overwhelming changes of the early 1900�s .
Final Thoughts
Let me say this right now : Red Dead Redemption is not Grand Theft Auto in the old west .
They �re both great games that are a hell of a lot of fun to play , and yes , there are distinct similarities .
But much of that can be attributed to the signature styles of Rockstar Games .
Once you get past those initial observations , you�ll realize just how unique each title is .
In any case , one point needs to be understood : Red Dead Redemption is absolutely , undeniably amazing in every sense of the word .
Fans of Mass Effect , Zelda , GUN , Red Dead Revolver , Shadow of the Colossus and ( of course ) Grand Theft Auto will all find something in this game to enjoy - there truly is something for everyone .
Major thanks to the team at Rockstar NYC for inviting us down for the weekend !
It was an absolute blast , and this small - town Canadian certainly enjoyed the experience .
Adam�s Impressions
Red Dead Redemption is the first non-GTA title that 's captured my interest for as long as I can remember .
I do n't try new games very often , and once I find a series I like I tend to stick to it .
What draws me to Red Dead is the same thing that drew me to Grand Theft Auto in 1997 � the massive open - ended world .
A lot of comparisons have been made to Grand Theft Auto , but that �s not to suggest the game is unoriginal .
It �s a Rockstar game , and many of Grand Theft Auto�s key developers are involved with Red Dead Redemption , so naturally there are some basic similarities .
As far as the gameplay goes , Grand Theft Auto is the most famous example of what an open - world game can offer , so with Red Dead Rockstar is simply building on what they do best .
The comparisons with GTA are complimentary , and should not be interpreted as a criticism .
The most obvious similarity between Red Dead and GTA is the controls .
If you are familiar with GTA then there is virtually no learning curve with Red Dead .
The only thing it took us a while to get used to was the horse�s stamina meter , which appears next to the radar on the bottom left of the screen .
The stamina meter is simple to control , but the hard part is remembering it�s there !
When we started off , we got carried away on one or two occasions , the meter ran down and the horse threw us off .
Red Dead Redemption offers an astonishing level of freedom .
The map is enormous , and although it�s difficult to provide an accurate comparison ( due mainly to the fact that horses are slower than cars ! ) we reckon it�s at least the same size as San Andreas .
Red Dead Redemption�s rural setting means that � unlike Grand Theft Auto � there are very few obstacles and exclusionary spaces .
As a result , it feels less constrained than the dense urban environments provided by GTA .
The only constraints which exist are those presented by the shape of the landscape .
It strikes a nice balance between open plains and canyons , with plains being open and free and the canyons giving structure to missions ( while still enabling a sense of discovery and exploration ) .
In many ways , therefore , it feels more open and inviting than Grand Theft Auto .
We got the impression that Rockstar see Red Dead as the first game with a serious potential to challenge GTA , and based on what we 've seen that appears like a realistic possibility .
illspirit's Impressions
Technically speaking , Red Dead Redemption is quite impressive .
As mentioned above , the frontier setting is much more open than GTA , and the engine , RAGE , has obviously had lots of upgrades to handle the large environments .
Whether riding across flat plains or looking out from atop a rocky plateau , the draw distance seems to go on forever .
Another upgrade which adds to the rural setting is some sort of new procedural foliage system which provides a large variety of trees , grass and such .
The new plants have physics now , so as in , say , Crysis , grass and leaves move and react as you walk through them .
This should come in quite handy for finding armadillos and other small varmints scurrying around in the underbrush .
The most interesting piece of tech in the game though has to be the horses .
If you 've seen screens and videos of them on the internet , you already know they look great ; but it 's not until you actually pick up the controls that you really appreciate them .
On top of the well done motion capture , it seems that they 're also running a euphoria simulation which allows the horses to react realistically to riders and their surroundings .
Horses have AI too , which means not only will they throw you if ridden too hard as Adam mentioned above , they 're also smart enough to jump over small obstacles and stop themselves if you ride carelessly towards a cliff or into the side of a building .
When you have your hands full shooting from horseback , the AI kicks up a notch to help avoid collisions and keep you on course while following ( or running from ) something .
And on a less technical note , I found it quite interesting that the game even lets you shoot the horses pulling a stagecoach that you 're riding in .
While one would have to be a really bad shot to do this on accident , it 's probably something to keep in mind if you do n't want to end up stopping abruptly during a wild chase .
Luckily you can summon your own horse from just about anywhere , otherwise Andy and I would have had a very long walk back to town .
Further impressions can be found on each of the following GTA fan sites :
Overall , it was a tremendous event and we are immensely grateful to Rockstar for making it happen .
We enjoyed meeting the other GTA webmasters and look forward to hopefully meeting them again in future !

Plate Tectonics
a map of the most important plates of the world .
The seven large plates are named in the picture .
The smaller ones are : 1 Nazca Plate , 2 Carribbean Plate , 3 Cocos Plate , 4 Juan de Fuca Plate , 5 Arabian Plate , 6 Indian Plate , 7 Philippine Plate , 8 Scotia Plate
Plate Tectonics is a geologic theory explaining the movements and forces in the crust of Earth .
It was developed during the mid 20th century , but the basic ideas were first published by the German geographer Alfred Wegener during the 1920s .
He published the first version of his theory in 1915 , and he called it Theorie der Kontinentalverschiebung ( continental drift ) .
His theories were based on the form of the continents , similarities in fossils and contemporary life on different continents , and much more .
However , the theory lacked two basic parts : an explanation for the motor of the drift , and a single impressive circumstantial evidence .
The bunch of little pieces he had , were to inconclusive to convince the authorities of geology .
But over decades more and more facts were discovered , most important probably the so called sea floor spreading , and so in the fifties a new theory was developed which met all those new discoveries .
This is the theory of plate tectonics as we know it today , and although it was adapted to new discoveries in details , the basic idea of the continental drift - the movement of whole continents - was supported by any new find .
Plate Tectonics is the " World Theory " of geology , as it explains most of the important geologic processes , which were enigmatic before .
Some say , it has the same importance for geology as has Darwins ' evolution theory for biology .
However , in science , especially if it is a descriptive science which tries to explore nature , it is a good idea to be careful and keep in mind the difference between facts and theories .
Still , plate tectonics is the most important theory in geology and - after half a century of scientific research in this field - a very well supported one .
The basic point in plate tectonic is , that earth 's surface is broken into seven large and many small moving plates , hence the name .
These plates move relative to one another an average of a few centimeters per year .
Three types of movement are recognised at the boundaries between plates : convergent , divergent and transform - fault .
This is a rather simple result of the the fact that earth is a sphere with more or less constant diameter .
So if two plates move in different direction , they either collide or move away from each other .
A special case is when they both move parallel to their boundary , but with different speed .
There are only two types of plates , continental plate , which is higher than sea level and oceanic plate , which is below sea level .
The reason is simple : they are composed of different materials .
Continetal plate is thick and composed of sediments and volcanic rocks , oceanic crust is thinner and consist only of a certain kind of volcanic rocks .
You can throw wood and polystyrol foam into water and you will see : the foam is lighter , so it swims higher .
The same is with the plates , they swim in the ( more or less ) " liquid " upper mantle .
Oceanic crust is thinner and heavier , so it swims deeper , continental crust is lighter because of the sedimentary rocks , and that is why it is higher .
Convergent boundaries :
Plates move toward each other and collide .
As we have two kinds of plates , oceanic and continental , there are three theoretically possible combinations : oceanic plate collides with a continental plate : the oceanic plate tips down and slides beneath the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench .
This is called subduction .
This happens all along the western coast of South America , at the boundary between the oceanic Nazca Plate and the continental South American Plate .
continental plates collide : the collision presses the rocks from two sides , the easiest way to escape is up and down .
This forms major mountain systems which go up several kilometers , but also go down rather deep .
The plate becomes twice as thick as normal .
Many mountain ranges on earth were formed by this , fo example the Himalaya and the Alps.
oceanic plate collides with a oceanic plate : one of the plates will be subducted below the other , similar to the ocean - continent collision .
But on top of the rim of the upper plate the accumulation of sediments from the lower plate and the volcanism caused by the subduction forms a chain of islands .
There are only small examples on earth but they are very impressive though , for example the chain of islands of the Philippines is located on such a rim .
Divergent boundaries :
Plates move away from each other , the gap is filled from below by volcanic material .
It often starts inside a continental plate , for example in the Great Rift Valley in Africa , the Dead Sea or the Rheingraben ( Rhine Rift System ) in Germany .
The material on top of the boundary goes down , because the parts of the plate move away , and so it forms a Graben .
Later the graben gets deeper and wider and sea water enters .
This stage may be seen at the Red Sea , which is such a young ocean .
On the boundary volcanic lava from below forms oceanic plate , a process known as sea - floor spreading .
And as oceanic plate is always below the sea level , this rims are always below the sea .
A typical example for this stage is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
Transform - fault boundaries :
Plates move horizontally past each other .
There is neither production nor consumption of plate material , but numerous earth quakes and probably some volcanism .
A typical example is the San Andreas Fault zone where the Pacific Plate is moving slowly northwestward along the North American Plate .
After all those results of plate tectonics , the cause , or better the motor of the movement , is also very interesting .
The upper mantle of earth is formed of molten rocks , called magma , which is not really liquid , but it flows extremely slow .
Because of the temperature difference between inside and outside , convection currencies formed .
Hot material is expanding and thus lighter and so it ascends , here it cools down , shrinks , becomes heavier and goes down again .
While flowing horizontally below the crust , these flows introduce a force and thus a movement into the plate .
This is the force behind all tectonics in the crust .

Ceara Sturgis ’ High School Refused to Run Her Tuxedo Picture in the Yearbook .
Or Even Mention Her Name
Not only did Wesson Attendance Center , the Mississippi high school , refuse to run Ceara Sturgis ’ photo in the annual yearbook , it refused to even mention the fact that she was part of this year ’s graduating class .
Indeed , the lesbian teen who wanted to wear a tux in her yearbook photo has been scrapped from the book entirely .
After reaffirming its decision not to include Sturgis ’ picture , Wesson administrators went ahead with publishing the yearbook .
It was released to students on Friday .
Sturgis ’ name is nowhere to be found .
“ They did n’t even put her name in it , ” Sturgis ’ mother Veronica Rodriguez said .
“ I was so furious when she told me about it .
Ceara started crying and I told her to suck it up .
Is that not pathetic for them to do that ?
Yet again , they have crapped on her and made her feel alienated . ”
Sturgis and her mother commissioned the Mississippi ACLU to protest officials ’
October 2009 decision not to allow Sturgis ’ photo to appear in the senior yearbook because she chose to wear a tuxedo instead of a dress .
The ACLU wrote an October letter demanding officials use Sturgis ’ submitted photo in the yearbook , but Copiah County School District officials refused .
Rodriguez said she expected the yearbook to at least contain a reference to her daughter on the senior page .
What she discovered on Friday , when the yearbook came in , was that the school had refused to acknowledge her entirely .
“ It ’s like she ’s nobody there , even though she ’s gone to school there for 12 years , ” Rodriguez said .
“ They mentioned none of her accolades , even though she ’s one of the smartest students there with wonderful grades .
They ’ve got kids in the book that have been busted for drugs .
There ’s even a picture of one of the seniors who dropped out of school .
“ I do n’t get it .
Ceara is a top student .
Why would they do this to her ? ”
The school wo n’t comment .
The ACLU has yet to indicate whether it ’ll pursue further legal action .
This just makes me sick .
If you ’re interested , Ronald Greer ( Attendance Center Principal ) can be reached here ; Oscar Hawkins ( High School Principal ) can be reached here ; and the school ’s phone number is ( 601 ) 643-2221 .

This is funny :
The world has been placed on a heightened security alert following reports that New Age terrorists have harnessed the power of homeopathy for evil .
“ Homeopathic weapons represent a major threat to world peace , ” said President Barack Obama , “ they might not cause any actual damage but the placebo effect could be quite devastating . ”
[…]
Homeopathic bombs are comprised of 99.9 % water but contain the merest trace element of explosive .
The solution is then repeatedly diluted so as to leave only the memory of the explosive in the water molecules .
According to the laws of homeopathy , the more that the water is diluted , the more powerful the bomb becomes .
[…]
“ A homeopathic attack could bring entire cities to a standstill , ” said BBC Security Correspondent , Frank Gardner .
“ Large numbers of people could easily become convinced that they have been killed and hospitals would be unable to cope with the massive influx of the ‘ walking suggestible . ' ”
Kudos to the government for moving on the FIRB changes .
But what does all this activity on housing mean ?
It means that Labor has figured out what many already know — that there is a voter groundswell of anger over housing in Australia .
But it ’s not the sort of transitory anger that one might have over many issues of the day — it ’s a deep anger , a bitter anger that extends not only to those trying to buy their first house but also the parent who sees his children potentially locked out of the market forever , a fear his children share .
A widely quoted survey by the Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia and Bankwest Retail claimed that the majority of the Generation Y polled thought they would never own a home and were doomed to a life of renting .
‘‘ We have never seen such pessimism among prospective first - time buyers throughout the past five indexes , ’’ said Victoria Shortt , chief executive of Bankwest Retail .
It is an anger that grows as prices continue to spiral upward , rising to higher , ridiculous multiples of average yearly wages .
It is an anger that festers over the outrage of negative gearing .
It is an anger that grows as mortgage stress sweeps the land .
It is the impotent anger of letters to the editor and calls to late - night radio programs , desperately searching for answers and reassurance .
It is the resentment towards endless weekends spent futilely searching for an affordable place .
It is a fury upon hearing interest rates are rising while overexposed banks are cutting back on home loans , creating a perfect storm for first - home owners .
It is an outrage that burns over the scandal of ‘‘ land banking ’’ by companies , drip - feeding bits of real estate into a market with acute housing shortages .
It is , one might say , an electorally significant anger .
Upon such angers are elections won and lost .
The majority of votes may be home owners , but it only takes a small swing to unseat a government .
And the army of the angry and dispossessed is growing by the day , seeing no solution in sight and paralysis at a state and federal level .
And parties of both sides take heed – that army is n’t going anywhere .
Not until you fix the problem .
GPs will no longer sign sick notes Workers who are off sick for longer than seven days will from now on receive so - called fit notes instead of sick notes from their GPs .
Doctors will still be able to say someone is not fit for work , but they will also be able to spell out aspects of jobs workers can still perform .
The onus will be on employers to help staff return to work in some capacity .
But the British Medical Association says more needs to be done so firms understand their responsibilities .
The overhaul of the sick note system was announced a year ago by government adviser Dame Carol Black , the national director for health and work .
She calculated that ill - health was costing the economy £ 100 bn a year .
' Fit for work ' The Statement of Fitness for Work , or ' fit note ' , is a new medical statement that doctors will now be issuing .
It is relevant to all employers in England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales .
With the fit note the doctor will be able to advise their patient if they are " not fit for work " or a new option - " may be fit for work taking account of the following advice " .
Patients will then be encouraged to discuss this advice with their employer to see if they can return to work .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Dr Laurence Buckman , chairman of the BMA's GPs committee , said : " The responsibility will be on employers to act .
" If a GP decides their patient is capable of some form of work , for example if they 've got back pain and they should temporarily avoid elements of their normal job , then it will be down to the employer to be flexible enough to accommodate them .
" However , we think much more needs to be done to ensure employers , in particular local line managers , have enough information about the changes . "
The launch of fit notes is going to be revolutionary
Professor Steve Field , RCGP
And he said GPs would have to ensure they were not " drawn in to making comments they are not qualified to make " because they would be unaware of the details of a patient 's working conditions .
Dr Buckman added : " Employers have a responsibility to provide adequate occupational health services and the government must encourage them to provide that if the overall plan to help more people back to work is to be truly effective .
" But , unfortunately , only one worker in eight has access to an occupational health doctor . "
Wellbeing A thousand GPs have been trained by the Royal College of General Practitioners ( RCGP ) in how to complete the new forms .
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH FACTS 172 million working days lost through sickness in 2007
This cost more than £ 100bn in lost productivity 2.6 million people were on incapacity benefits in May Absences of four days or more account for 40 % of days lost Nearly six million people in the UK say they have a long - standing health condition Sources : CBI ; Black report Professor Steve Field , of the RCGP , said : " There has been a lot of preparation for GPs , for employers , and employees but inevitably there will be some that are not up to speed .
" The launch of fit notes is going to be revolutionary because it will change the whole culture and we know that keeping people in work helps their physical and mental wellbeing . "
Katja Hall , director of employment policy at the Confederation of British Industry , said : " This is a change that employers will welcome .
" All too often a person is signed off sick when they are able to manage some forms of their work . "
However , unions have warned that handing someone a list of tasks they could perform while ill would not help them get back to full fitness .
Early intervention Some GPs have been frustrated with the current system because they are unable to assess what work an employee can do if they do not know what their workplace responsibilities are .
Under the current system , a GP has the power to sign someone off work for six months before the case is passed onto a benefits administrator .
About 350,000 people a year transfer from sick notes to benefits , a figure which experts believe could be cut significantly with earlier and more effective intervention .

This is an April Fool , right ?
You could n't be this naive .
There is no scientifically varifiable proof for human caused global warming .
The only data that existed , upon which most predictions were made , was lost .
Therefore , the scientific process was compromised .
Regarding acorn ...
Well ...
As I said , this must be an April Fool .

No Brad Fregger , this is not an April Fools joke .
And it 's very clear who the uninformed / misinformed is .
Come , Mr Fregger , peruse the multitude of documentation and evidence which overwhelmingly proves the decades long persecution of a truly honorable organization known as ACORN .
What could be more conservative , after all , than utilizing private investment to rehabilitate blighted neighborhoods ?
After all , this was ACORN 's primary mission .
Trust this Navy Vet and former Reagan voter , Mr Fregger , you have been ( severely ) misinformed .

Are that incredibly , embarrassingly disinformed about both Global Warming and ACORN ?
Or have you , yourself , posted an April Fools Joke here ?
( Yes , thousands of scientists simply " lost " their peer - reviewed data on Global Warming .
All at once .

But by all means , do entertain us with some links to the actual " evidence " you are basing your amusing assessment on , cuz we 'd like to be still more amused by you here !

Larry O'Connor continued his whining with : I ask what was in the Maddow report and you point me to the CA AG report .
Now , I understand these questions can be confusing , but please point me to what was shown IN THE MADDOW REPORT .
I KNOW what is in the CA AG report .
Apparently you do n't , because you completely misrepresented it completely to your readers at Andrew Breitbart 's website .
If you do know what 's in it , but put out your deceptive , misleading garbage at Breitbart 's propaganda site anyway , then that would be what your friend the accused criminal James O'Keefe calls " journalistic malpractice " .
I would argue the latter is the case since your deceptive , but not stupid .
But feel free to correct the record .
Beyond that , you are welcome to contact Maddow and ask her anything you wish .
I 'm neither her agent nor producer and do not speak for her in any way , shape or form .
Finally with regard to you calling me a liar ( which is , again , contemptible and not at all in keeping with the more civilized tone I continue to attempt to maintain with you ) .
Do you think nobody reads the words you write and Twitter , Larry ?
If that 's your definition of " civilized tone " , then no wonder you people foster the hatred and vitriol that you do .
Good luck with your partisan political agenda , Larry .
I 'm not particularly interested in it , as I hope you 'd understand .
I 'm more concerned about the good of the country .
And you ?
( But while you 're acting as if you give a damn about " truth " , please feel free to apologize to Media Matters for having alleged they charged O'Keefe as a racist in your article here , but without offering a single example of same , or having bothered to either correct the record , or answer my direct privately emailed questions about it as you had promised .
As I have noted previously , you are not a serious person , you demonstrate that with just about every thing you do , and therefore do not merit the respect and decency you are pretending to request .
Sorry , Larry .
I suspect " Andrew Breitbart Presents Big Journalism " readers are that gullible .
I am not . )

Sacramento was always at low altitude .
Although I see out there claims of an elevation of 47 feet and 24 feet .
So you can cut the crap about being at SEA LEVEL .
Utter nonsense .
Sacramento was a flood zone from the beginning .
Sacramento indeed has flooded ( go look at the hills in land park ( near Sutterville Road ) , it 's HOW THOSE HILLS GOT THERE FROM A BROKEN LEVEE .
There was no AWG then and there is n't now .
But it 's the fact we are on two rivers , not the ocean which is the problem .
It 's the fact farmers built levies out of substandard materials ( RE : PEAT SOILS . )
The Army Corps of Engineers has drilled down and filled these levies with slurry and cement to strengthen them .
However all that work has _nothing_ to do with AGW .
It has to do with flood control .
100 year 500 year I forget which now ...
These are facts you can look up .
while my details might not be perfect .
It is what happened .
If there is any language about Climate , it 's because it got tossed in as PORK with a crafty name .
So do n't give me no nonsense about treading water in Sacramento .
Nor does Arnold care .

So while I appreciate that clearly you 've got a strong opinion --- which seems to be largely based on a whole lot of disinformation put at no small price by the global warming deniers of the fossil fuel industry and Koch Foundation --- please do n't confuse your disinformation with the actual information that we 've covered here ( via Green News Report etc . )
Also , while I 'm delighted to see from you again and that you 're doing well , and feisty as ever , I 'd ask you not to jump down the throats of other commenters who do n't deserve it .
Want to jump down mine ?
So be it .
But please do so with accurate --- and specific --- information in regards to what we 've actually covered here and have n't .

The head of the NYPD ’s Mounted Unit had three retired police horses put down at a Pennsylvania farm — as shocked veterinarians and animal - cruelty officials watched in disbelief .
Capt .
Barry Gelbman gave the highly questionable order to fatally inject three of the Finest ’s former workhorses while personally supervising the move of 30 police horses from the Abbottstown stable to two other farms , sources said .
The steeds — Danny , Willis and Richie Rich — were 15 to 20 years old but had life expectancies of up to 30 .
They were being treated for various leg ailments , which meant they could not endure standing in a cramped , 15 - horse transporter for the 12 - hour ride to their new homes in either upstate New York or New Hampshire .
Two of the horses were being treated for abscessed legs , while the third had a swollen hind leg .
The stable owner had informed Gelbman in advance that several of the horses would have problems traveling , sources said .
But instead of leaving the horses behind to heal or even putting them up for adoption , Gelbman made it clear the animals were department property that he controlled — and he ordered the otherwise healthy animals put to death , sources said .
“ They did not need to be euthanized , ” one source insisted .
“ They just could not travel cramped for 16 hours .
They only needed special accommodations to move them . ”
Another source quoted Gelbman as saying , “ Well , if they ca n’t be moved , then they are not going to be taken care of . . .
Put them down . ”
Attempts to reach Gelbman were unsuccessful .
NYPD spokesman Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said , “ The commanding officer of the Mounted Unit conferred with a private veterinarian at the scene who stated that based on the age and current health of the horses , it would be inhumane to transport them .
“ Additionally , the doctor expressed concern of the stress placed on the horses being integrated into a new herd , given their existing medical conditions . ”
In late 2005 , the NYPD learned that 58 retired steeds were malnourished at a farm in upstate Otisville that was falling into bankruptcy .
The department found adoptive homes for most of them .
It then solicited bids for the remaining ones in a process later unmasked by The Post as corrupt .
The largest portion of the contracts — worth $ 2.5 million over 10 years — was awarded to Victoria Nanninga , who was the then - secret girlfriend of the Mounted Unit ’s quartermaster , Detective Richard DePamphilis .
Nanninga and DePamphilis pleaded guilty a few weeks ago to criminal charges for rigging the bid , and her contract was terminated .
Gelbman set April 1 for the transfer of the 30 retired horses from Nanninga ’s Abbottstown stables .
On the day of the move , Nanninga was alarmed over what she feared was the fate of some of the horses and called in the local SPCA to monitor the events .
She broke down in tears when the three horses were killed .
Officials at the SPCA in York County declined comment .
Calls to the vets at the scene , at Mason - Dixon Equine , were not returned .
Terry Smullen , owner of Smullen Farms in upstate Cobleskill , said she had been supposed to receive 15 horses but got only 13 .
Cara Cargill , owner of Willoughby Ridge Farms in Holderness , NH , said she also was supposed to receive 15 but got at least one fewer .
Both said their new arrivals were doing well .

Gym members could face higher fees for working out to original music after a court ruled that musicians have not been paid enough for the copyright of their songs .
The decision , handed down by the Copyright Tribunal today , means that fitness centres will be slugged $ 15 each class or $ 1 per attendee of each class for the use of the music .
Gyms had previously been charged 96.8 cents a class , with a cap of $ 2654 a year .
Fitness Australia said it was disappointed with the decision , which it said represented a 1500 per cent increase in music costs for an average - size fitness centre .
Chief executive Loretta Stace said the gym was now reviewing the decision to determine whether there were grounds for appeal .

US Vice President Joe Biden tried to put the furor over announcement of plans to build 1,600 units in Ramat Shlomo behind him , saying during a speech Thursday at Tel Aviv University that he condemned the move because as a friend he was compelled to " deliver the hardest truth , " but adding that he appreciated the clarifications he received on the matter from Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyhau .
He opened the speech by stressing the importance of US - Israel friendship and Washington 's commitment to the security of the Jewish state , saying that " US President Barack Obama and myself know that the US has no better friend in the community of nations than Israel .
" Biden said that he realized that construction in east Jerusalem " is a very touchy subject in Israel , " but because Israel 's decision to advance the housing project , in his view , " undermined the trust required to conduct the negotiations , I – at the request of President Obama – condemned it immediately .
" After pausing for a moment to listen to the applause that accompanied these words , Biden explained how he , " such a strong supporter of Israel , " could speak out so strongly .
" Quite frankly , folks , only a friend can deliver the hardest truth , " he said .
" I appreciate , by the way , the response given by the Prime Minister , who today is putting in place a process to prevent the recurrence that sort of event , and who clarified that the beginning of actual construction of this particular project would likely take several years .
That is significant , because it gives negotiations the time to resolve this as well as other issues .
" Biden said that the announcement of the plan was interpreted in the West Bank as meaning that the 1,600 units would be constructed immediately .
" Look , folks , as we move on , I promise you this , the US will continue to hold both sides accountable for any statements or any actions that will inflame tension or prejudice the actions of these talks , " the US vice president said .
Just prior to Biden 's speech , the Prime Minister 's Office , in what was apparently a move coordinated with the US , put out a statement saying that Netanyahu summoned " Interior Minister Eli Yishai and expressed his displeasure at the timing of the announcement of another stage in the planning process of a Jerusalem building project . "
" In light of the ongoing disagreement between Israel and the US on building in Jerusalem , " the statement read , Netanyahu " said there was no need to advance the planning process this week and instructed Interior Minister Yishai to adopt procedures to prevent such an incident from recurring .
" According to the statement , Netanyahu spoke to Biden and " expressed his regret over the unfortunate timing .
The Prime Minister informed the Vice President that this specific project had moved through various planning stages over several years .
The final approval process will in all likelihood take more than a year and the beginning of actual construction would likely take several years .
" Regarding the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , the US vice president called for a two - states solution , saying that peace with Palestinians is " profoundly " in Israel 's interest , and stressing that Washington is committed to Israel 's security .
" From my experience , the one precondition for progress is that the rest of the world knows this - there is no space between the US and Israel when it comes to security - none .
That 's the only time that progress has been made , " he said .
Biden went on to say that the " status - quo is not sustainable , " because Israel could not remain a Jewish state while the Arab population continues to grow and a Palestinian state has not been established .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad are both real partners for peace , Biden said , urging Israel to seize the opportunity to achieve real peace with the Palestinians .
Biden also shared some memories from his first visit to Israel as a young senator in 1973 , when he met with then - Prime Minister Golda Meir and with Yitzhak Rabin .
The US vice president said Meir told him that Israel 's secret weapon in its against the Arab states was that " we have nowhere else to go .
" Biden told the audience they must " make no mistake about America 's resolve " in its fight against terrorism and against the Iranian nuclear program .
He said that the Islamic republic has grown more dangerous in the lastdecade , with Iran funding and supporting Hizbullah and Hamas , and " intimidating both its neighbors and its own people .
" America was determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , Biden said .
" May God protect you and may God protect Israel , " the US vice president concluded .
LOS TEQUES , Venezuela —
When Judge María Lourdes Afiuni issued a ruling in December that irked President Hugo Chávez , he did little to contain his outrage .
The president , contending on national television that she would have been put before a firing squad in earlier times , sent his secret intelligence police to arrest her .
Then the agents took her to the overcrowded women ’s prison in this city of slums near Caracas .
They put her in a cell near more than 20 inmates whom Judge Afiuni had sentenced on charges like murder and drug smuggling .
“ I ’ve received threats from inmates telling me they will burn me alive because they see me as a symbol of the system that put them in prison , ” said Judge Afiuni , 46 , in her prison cell .
“ I ’m in this hell because I had the temerity to do my job as a judge in a way that did n’t please Chávez . ”
Since Judge Afiuni ’s imprisonment , a dizzying sequence of other high - profile arrests has taken place , pointing to Mr. Chávez ’s recent use of his security and intelligence apparatus to quash challenges to his grip on the country ’s political institutions .
The arrests come at a time of spreading public ire over an economy hobbled by electricity shortages and soaring inflation .
IN A UN camp in Nyala , in the southern part of the Sudanese region of Darfur , a fully equipped gym has been shipped in from Sierra Leone .
With the baking heat cooled only a bit by air - conditioning units , Sierra Leone 's once - reviled army is pumping iron as it takes on a surprising new role as a guardian of global peace .
The former British colony 's first international peacekeeping tour marks a remarkable turnaround for a country that only nine years ago had to submit to the world 's largest peacekeeping force , when 17,000 UN troops were sent in to hold the ring after a gruesome civil war that had gone for a whole decade .
But Sierra
Leone is now considered safe enough at home to send 160 of its soldiers to help the mixed force of nearly 22,000 soldiers and police from the African Union and the UN that are keeping the peace in Darfur .
This contribution is expected to earn Sierra Leone $ 2 m a year .
The Sierra Leonean peacekeepers are drawn from the same army that carried out two coups during Sierra Leone 's civil war .
Nicknamed “ sobels ” — soldiers by day , rebels by night — many of them were found by the country 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to have tortured , raped and even forced their victims to eat each other during the conflict .
Since then , a lot has changed .
A British - led training team arrived in 1999 and remains there today , five years after the UN peacekeepers withdrew .
The British have spent more than $ 30 m to revamp the army , reducing it from 20,000 men to 8,500 , including the former rebels .
“ That 's the only way you can heal these wounds , ” says the forces 's second - in - command .
“ We gave them all uniforms so nobody knows who you are , unless you say so .
No one is pointing fingers any more . ”
The Sierra Leoneans are sending some of their best troops to help out in Darfur .
“ It 's payback time to the international community , ” says Brigadier Alfred Nelson - Williams , chief of Sierra Leone 's defence staff .
Britain , Canada , the Netherlands and America have coughed up $ 6.5 m to equip and pay for the batch of peacekeepers .
Their equipment will dwarf that of their entire army back home .
“ There are some extremely capable officers who would survive very well in the British army , ” says Colonel Hugh Blackman , commander of the British - led training team .
If the Sierra Leoneans perform well , their peacekeeping force in Darfur could swell to 850 men .
The US has given private assurances to encourage the Palestinians to join indirect Middle East peace talks , including an offer to consider allowing UN security council condemnation of any significant new Israeli settlement activity , the Guardian has learned .
The assurances were given verbally in a meeting a week ago between a senior US diplomat and the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas .
Since then – and after months of US diplomacy – it appears Israeli and Palestinian leaders are close to starting indirect " proximity " talks , which would be the first resumption of the Middle East peace process since Israel 's war in Gaza began in late 2008 .
There was no official confirmation of the details of the meeting and Saeb Erekat , the chief Palestinian negotiator , denied assurances were given .
" It 's not true , " he said .
" We are still talking to the Americans . "
But a Palestinian source , who was given a detailed account of the meeting , said David Hale , the deputy of the US special envoy , George Mitchell , told Abbas that Barack Obama wanted to see the peace process move forward with the starting of indirect talks .
The diplomat said Washington understood there were obstacles and described Israeli settlement construction as " provocative " .
He told Abbas the Americans had received assurances from the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , that one particular settlement project in East Jerusalem , at Ramat Shlomo , would not go ahead , at least for now .
The site is important because last month an agreement on indirect talks collapsed within a day of being announced , after Israeli officials gave planning approval for 1,600 new homes in the settlement .
The US vice ‑president , Joe Biden , who was in Jerusalem at the time , condemned the Israeli announcement in unusually strong language .
Hale then told Abbas that if there was significantly provocative settlement activity , including in East Jerusalem , Washington may consider allowing the UN security council to censure Israel .
It was understood that meant the US would abstain from voting on a resolution rather than use its veto .
Any US decision not to veto a resolution critical of Israel would be very unusual and a rare sign of American anger towards its long - time ally .
However , it was not clear what may constitute significantly provocative activity .
Palestinian officials asked in the meeting , but were not given an explicit definition , the source said .
In a New York Times opinion piece this week it was suggested that a letter was given to Abbas offering an unprecedented US commitment to the Palestinians and saying Washington would not stand in the way of a UN resolution condemning Israeli actions .
But the Palestinian source told the Guardian that the assurances were only verbal and were not in letter form because the US wanted the details kept secret .
Erekat , the Palestinian negotiator , suggested they were close to agreeing to indirect talks .
" We want to give President Obama a chance , to give Senator Mitchell a chance and of course success to us means independence and freedom , " he said .
Last year , the Palestinians were refusing to enter talks without a full freeze on settlement building .
Israel has put a partial , 10 - month curb on construction in the West Bank , but Netanyahu has refused in public to freeze building in East Jerusalem .
Last week he said Palestinian calls for a halt to settlement building in the city were an " unacceptable demand " .
Yet reports suggest a tacit , temporary delay has been put on planning approvals for settlement projects in the city .
Israeli ministers have said they believe the indirect talks could start within weeks and , privately , Israeli officials say there has been transparency with both sides about understandings reached to allow the process to begin .
Asked about Israeli settlement building , Erekat said : " I do n't care about words .
I care about deeds .
I really want to see that nothing takes place on the ground .
That is what matters to me . "
Hani al - Masri , a political adviser to Abbas , said : " The Americans said they will blame the party that puts obstacles in the way of the peace process . "
But he added that it was very unlikely that the Americans would allow the UN to censure Israel .
" We are very far from that step .
They will never leave Israel to the mercy of the security council , " said Masri .
US and Israel at the UN
For decades the US has vetoed UN security council resolutions that are critical of its ally Israel .
However , occasionally the US either abstains from voting or votes in favour of sometimes strongly worded resolutions .
This last happened in October 2000 when the US abstained in a vote over a resolution about the outbreak of the second intifada , the Palestinian uprising , which strongly criticised Israeli " provocation " .
The last time this happened regularly was between 1990 and 1992 , when George Bush Sr was US president and when relations with Israel were particularly bad .
His administration voted in favour of six resolutions critical of Israel
Quaoar , a large object in the outer solar system , is mostly made of rock , unlike its icy neighbours ( Illustration : NASA / G. Bacon / STScI )
A giant rock is walking among the “ dirty iceballs ” in the outer solar system , a new study suggests .
Researchers say it may have journeyed there from the asteroid belt near Mars , or it may have been the victim of a cosmic crash that blasted away its once-icy exterior .
Quaoar was discovered in 2002 in the Kuiper belt , a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune .
At about 900 kilometres across , or 40 per cent as wide as Pluto , it is not the biggest denizen of the belt , but researchers now say it may be the densest .
Wesley Fraser and Michael Brown of Caltech confirmed its size by studying archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope .
They also used Hubble images to study the motion of its moon , Weywot , which allowed them to calculate Quaoar ’s mass .
Combining the size and mass revealed Quaoar ’s density to be between 2.9 and 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre .
That is much higher than that of other Kuiper belt residents like Pluto , which has a density of about 2.0 grams per cubic centimetre .

Quaoar ’s high density suggests it is made almost entirely of rock , unlike its neighbours , which are a mixture of ice and rock , the researchers conclude .
They say the rocky world may be a refugee from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , thrown outwards early in the solar system ’s history , when the orbits of the giant planets are thought to have shifted .
‘ Far - fetched ’ scenario
Previously , other researchers have suggested that the same upheaval threw some Kuiper belt objects into the asteroid belt , so the new study suggests the migration may have been a two - way street .
But Renu Malhotra of the University of Arizona in Tucson says that hurling Quaoar from the asteroid belt to the Kuiper belt would have left it with an elongated orbit , making it hard to explain why Quaoar is on a nearly circular orbit today .
“ I think that ’s pretty far - fetched , ” she says .
She favours the other possible explanation that Fraser and Brown suggest – that a collision with another Kuiper belt object blasted off most of Quaoar ’s ice , leaving behind only its dense , rocky core .
“ That kind of thing seems a lot more possible to me , ” she says , noting that there were probably far more objects in the early Kuiper belt than there are today , making collisions more common in the past .

Also : ACORN not dead yet !...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/6/2010 , 6:32 pm PT
Yesterday , Peter Hart , of the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) , flagged the New York Times ' latest ACORN - related report for us and notes " how far the Times is from where it started on this story . "
Yes , after a full six months of out - and - out misleading the public on the now - infamous ACORN " Pimp " Hoax by repeatedly misreporting that disgraced rightwing prankster and activist James O'Keefe had dressed as a 70 's - era blaxploitation pimp while scamming low - level workers in ACORN offices --- and even as the Times finally conceded it was wrong on at least that point just two weeks ago --- the paper has still been standing by the misleading assertion that O'Keefe " clearly presented himself as " a pimp in those offices .
But the NYTimes ' latest story is decidedly " pimp " - less and seems to tacitly serve as an admission that even that false narrative was previously misreported .
Of course , they 've yet to issue a public acknowledgment --- much less a correction , retraction , apology , or explanation --- for having gotten that point so wrong , for so long .
Last week 's finding by the CA Attorney General , that ACORN committed " no violations of criminal law " in any of the illicitly and likely - illegally taped videos that O'Keefe and his partner Hannah Giles created in CA offices , may finally have convinced the people running the paper they had it wrong .
At least if one notices the glaring absence of what was n't reported this time around by the Times in its most recent story ...
In his investigation , Attorney General Jerry Brown found --- as did the former MA AG [ PDF ] last December and the Brooklyn DA last month --- that O'Keefe 's videos , as deceptively published by rightwing con-artist Andrew Breitbart on his " Big Government " website , were " severely edited . "
Brown also expressly noted --- as we 've been trying to get across to the Times for months now --- that while in those offices , O'Keefe presented himself not as a pimp , but rather as the law school student boyfriend of the fake " prostitute " ( Giles ) who was trying to escape from an abusive pimp who had stalked her , thrown her down stairs , and had threatened to kill her .
The pair , according to the report , was also trying to " save the [ mythical , underage ] El Salvadoran girls from being preyed upon and raped " by that abusive pimp .
" He never claimed he was a pimp , " the CA AG pointed out after reviewing the unedited versions of the tapes , which O'Keefe and Giles finally agreed to released to Brown , only in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution .
" Contrary to the suggestion in the edited videos , " the AG observed , " O’Keefe never stated he was a pimp . "
In covering some potentially good news for ACORN following that news item last week --- and we 'll certainly ask ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis about all of this tomorrow night when she 'll be our guest on the Mike Malloy Show --- the Times '
Ian Urbina reports that while ACORN was recently forced to announce they'd be closing the doors on their local chapters in 75 cities , they intend to fight to stay alive as a national organization .
But note how Urbina finally reported on the ACORN " Pimp " Hoax videos this time out , with something that almost resembles accuracy in the nation 's " paper of record " [ emphasis added ] :
Acorn has faced a drastic drop in federal money and foundation support after a video sting was publicized last fall .
In at least one of the undercover videos , Acorn employees were shown advising a young conservative activist , who posed as a prostitute , how to conceal her criminal activities in the course of trying to buy a house .
Well , fancy that !
No mention of O'Keefe either dressed as , " posing as " or even " representing himself as " a pimp !
Go figure !
So does this mean the NYTimes is quietly , but finally conceding it had the story completely wrong in the first place ?!
If so , when will the paper be issuing their appropriate corrections , retractions , apologies , and explanations for how this all happened in the first place and what changes they intend to institute in order to ensure that something this damagingly inaccurate does n't occur again in the future ?
Would that be too much to ask ?
If not , how about some accountability along with it , for those senior staffers who went so far out of their way to cover up for the paper 's blatant failure ?
The BRAD BLOG has recently sought comment on these matters from Urbina and the other senior , managing and executive editors .
They have all failed to respond .
Urbina 's phrasing in the recent article , as FAIR details , certainly has come a long way since last September when he misreported on O'Keefe " posing as ... a pimp ... dressed so outlandishly that he might have been playing in a risque high school play , " " travel[ing ] in the gaudy guise of pimp " with " ACORN workers counseling a bogus prostitute and pimp on how to set up a brothel staffed by under - age girls , avoid detection and cheat on taxes . "
It 's a long way even from just late last month when the NYTimes Public Editor ( ombudsman ) Clark Hoyt misleadingly asserted in his Sunday column that " If O’Keefe did not dress as a pimp , he clearly presented himself as one . "
The column was published on the same day that Urbina compounded the misleading information yet again by reporting on O'Keefe " posing as a ... pimp . "
Yes , the Times has indeed come a long since their Senior Editor for Standards Greg Brock incredibly insisted in email in February that " there is nothing for us to correct " despite more than a dozen similar misreports , and when Hoyt helped to further cover up for the inaccurate reporting by asserting after a long chain of emails that he did not " see that a correction is in order " , and even since just two weeks ago when the paper finally issued its begrudging and partial correction .
Is n't it time the paper comes fully clean on this entire story once and for all ?
If the people there do n't , if they are allowed not to do so , you can bet your bottom dollar they will do it all again in the very near future !

Spaceshuttle Discovery , one of three remaining orbiters in NASA 's space shuttlefleet , landed Tuesday morning at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after a 15 - daymission to the International Space Station .
Themission was the penultimatemission for the aging Discovery , and one of the final four planned space shuttleflights before NASA retires all three shuttles at the end of September .
Discovery 's final mission is currently scheduled September , and will mark thefinal flight of the space agency 's space shuttle program .
Butretirement for the space shuttles simply means the start of their lives in thepublic eye .
All three orbiters ?
Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour ?
areexpected to be placed on public display at one of more than 20 museumscurrently vying for one of the iconic 76 - ton shuttles .
NASA 's two othershuttles , Challenger and Columbia , were tragically lost in accidents in 1986 and 2003 , respectively .
In all , 14 astronauts were killed in the two accidents .
Discovery , the oldest of NASA 's shuttles , has already been promised to the Smithsonian Airand Space Museum in Washington , D.C. , leaving Atlantis and Endeavour availablefor other institutions .
Discovery will replace the testshuttle Enterprise , which has been on exhibit in the Smithsonian 's StephenF .
Udvar - Hazy Center , in Chantilly , Va. , since 2003 .
So Enterprise , which wasbuilt between 1974 and 1976 and was used for NASA 's Approach and Landing Testprogram , will also be looking for a new home .
Someof the institutions trying to snag one of the other retired orbiters include : the Johnson Space Center in Houston ; the National Museum of the U.S. Air Forceat Wright - Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton , Ohio ; the Museum of Flight inSeattle ; and the Intrepid Air & Space Museum in New York City .
" Therivalry may be unprecedented in space artifact history .
In the past , the Smithsonian took ownership of all spacecraft and then loaned them to otherinstitutions , " explained Robert Pearlman , editor of collectSPACE.com , an onlinepublication and community for space history and artifact enthusiasts , and a SPACE.comcontributor .
" With the two shuttles ( and perhaps even with the unflownprototype Enterprise ) , NASA will decide who gets a shuttle ... for keeps .
Add tothat the limited availability as compared to Apollo for example , when therewere many more capsules to go around , and you have the makings of a space raceamong museums where the prize is no less than the world 's first and most famousreusable space plane , " he added .
Earlierthis year , NASAreduced the price of its museum - bound space shuttles from $ 42 million , setin December 2008 , to $ 28.2 million .
Chosen museums will , however , have to payfor ferrying the orbiters atop NASA 's modified Boeing 747 aircraft from KennedySpace Center in Florida to their destination .
" Understandably , with only two of the three remaining flown orbiters available to museums ?
thethird rightfully headed to the Smithsonian ?
the competition risen to match therarity of the ' prize , ' " Pearlman said .
" Museums have staged publicevents , collected thousands of signatures on petitions , sought endorsements , filmed commercials , and have even traveled to Washington to lobby theirpolitical representatives .
Some museums have even begun the construction ofdisplay enclosures , pledging millions of dollars , without even knowing if theywill receive a space shuttle . "
Theearliest that NASA is expected to announce the final homes for Atlantis , Endeavour and Enterprise is July 2010 , which would give the selected museumsapproximately one year to raise funds and build the required indoor housing forthe shuttles .
Animportant part of Discovery 's exhibit at the Smithsonian will be thepreservation of the historic shuttle , said Roger Launius , a senior curator atthe Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum .
? It 'sa big honor for a museum to get one of these objects to put on display , " Launius told Life 'sLittle Mysteries , a sister publication of SPACE.com .
" At the Smithsonian , we want to take Discovery and freeze it in time so that fivehundred ?
even a thousand ?
years from now , there will be this orbiter that ispristine from when it last flew .?
HARARE , Zimbabwe — Political tension has so deeply penetrated life in this southern African country that when Tendai Mahachi kneels down to receive communion he is making a partisan statement .
" I do not come here to indicate that I am hostile to President Robert Mugabe , ’’ said the regular of St. Mary ’s and All Saints Anglican Cathedral in downtown Harare , " but everything you do in Zimbabwe places you on one side or other of the political divide . ’’
Along with about 60 people , Mahachi , a 40 - year - old businessman , was attending a noon Sunday service in the car park of the capital ’s cathedral .
The altar was a fold - up table and the officiating priests fetched their vestments from the trunks of their cars , before producing chalices and wafers from a picnic basket .
The oak doors of the 76 - year - old stone cathedral remained locked , as they have been , intermittently , for nearly two years — ever since Bishop Nolbert Kunonga was sacked by the Anglican Church of the Province of Central Africa .
Acrimony is bitter between Kunonga and his replacement , Bishop Chad Gandiya .
Over Christmas , police acting for Kunonga threatened residents in townships near the capital , telling them they would be beaten if they attended churches loyal to Gandiya .
The threats prompted the Anglican Church ’s senior leaders to condemn the Zimbabwean authorities for siding with the excommunicated bishop .
In a statement in December , the Archbishops of Canterbury and York , Rowan Williams and John Sentamu , said : " The unprovoked intimidation of worshippers by the police is indicative of the continued and persistent oppression by state instruments of those perceived to be in the opposition . "
Kunonga is a fervent supporter of Mugabe and says those opposed to him are close to the Movement for Democratic Change .
In the wake of years of political strife and an election in 2008 which was marred by government - initiated violence , the MDC in February 2009 entered an " inclusive government ’ ’ with Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African Union–Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) .
But large parts of the power - sharing government still struggle to get off the ground , and many charge that it is a result of obstructionism from Zanu - PF .
Kunonga was sacked in February 2008 by the Anglican Church of the Province of Central Africa after he claimed that the Anglican church had not taken a strong enough stand against Anglican moves to ordain homosexuals .
Kunonga announced that he would create his own province and gained support from Manicaland , in eastern Zimbabwe , and from several parishes around Harare .
Kunonga has become a controversial and polarizing figure for his outspoken support of Mugabe and his antagonistic attacks against the MDC .
Also local press have reported that Kunonga has received a choice farm outside Harare from Mugabe 's seizures of white - owned farms .
For a time after being dismissed by the Anglican church , Kunonga locked himself in Harare ’s cathedral .
Now , every Sunday , he holds services there at 7.30 a.m. and 9 a.m. , which are attended by a smattering of regulars .
For the rest of the time , the cathedral , in the center of downtown Harare , remains padlocked to prevent rival Anglicans from trying to worship in the church .
Kunonga 's critics say he is simply power - hungry and is using the homosexuality issue as an excuse to ingratiate himself with Mugabe .
The Zimbabwean president , who is a Roman Catholic , is known for his virulent anti-homosexual views .
Car - park attendant Shadreck Nyatsuro attends Kunongo ’s services .
" He has always been good to me .
I have to stay neutral .
I went to Bishop Kunonga ’s service at 7.30 a.m. this morning so I do n’t need to attend this one , too , ’’ said Nyatsuro , 72 , as he maintained a studied distance from those taking Bishop Gandiya 's communion by the car park .
" We never know , from one Sunday to the next , whether we are going to gain access , ’’ said Father Farai Mutamiri , officiating at Bishop Gandiya ’s service .
Members of his congregation were tear - gassed last year by riot police loyal to Kunonga who burst into the cathedral during the service .
" That is when we took the issue to court , ’’ said Reverend Phineas Fundira .
The most recent court hearing , which ran into the evening of Saturday , Dec. 19 , ruled that services led by Bishop Gandiya ’s clergy should not be disrupted .
But a few hours later police arrested church wardens and officials at several churches around Harare .
" The police are constantly in contempt of court , ’’ said Fundira .
" We increasingly do not know what to do .
We have some Anglicans in the Zanu - PF Politburo so we are now going to turn to them for support . ’’
The locked - out Anglicans believe Kunonga ’s position is hardening and see no let - up in the support he is receiving from elements of the police .
Father Mutamiri said the congregation had remained united and that most regulars supported Bishop Gandiya .
" We are holding house services , and sticking together .
Our biggest problem is the cost of going to court , and we could do with support from other Anglicans . ’’
But he did not call for further intervention from the archbishops of Canterbury and York .
" We are accused of being pro-homosexual and pro-MDC , which we are not .
We are just a peace - loving congregation who wish to be able to carry on worshipping together .
" We would like the Church of the Province of Central Africa to solve this issue which is , after all , centered on their former employee , Kunonga , " said Mutamiri .
" But if the archbishop of Canterbury gets involved that could strengthen the perception that our agenda is for regime - change in Zimbabwe , which it is not . ’’
How the oil has spread
Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May US authorities have evacuated an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico near where another oil rig sank after an explosion last week .
Workers on the Ocean Endeavour were evacuated as an oil slick from the wrecked platform was coming dangerously close , officials say .
The Minerals Management Service said it was being cautious after the explosion , from which 11 people are still missing .
The sunken rig's ruptured pipeline is leaking oil despite efforts to seal it .
Robotic submersibles are being used to try to stop oil leaking from the damaged well , the Deepwater Horizon , which is almost a mile ( 1.5 km ) below the surface .
British oil company BP , which leased the rig , said the attempt would take 24 to 36 hours .
Meanwhile , engineers are creating a giant underwater dome to trap the escaping oil so that it can be funnelled into tanks on the surface .
Some 1,000 barrels ( 42,000 gallons ) of oil a day have been gushing from the well since the drilling rig exploded and burned for 36 hours before it sank off the Louisiana coast last Thursday .

Conservation experts say the oil has the potential to damage beaches , barrier islands , wetlands and wildlife reserves along hundreds of miles of coastline in four US states .
Whales have been spotted near the spill but they did not appear to be in distress .
For now , the weather conditions are keeping the oil away from the shore and it is hoped the waves will break up the heavy crude oil , allowing it to harden and sink back to the ocean floor .
The oil is not expected to reach land for at least another three days .
Officials are monitoring the environmental effects by boat and plane .
' Highly complex ' BP - which is responsible under US federal law for the clean - up - said it was using four submersible vehicles , equipped with cameras and remote - controlled arms , to try to activate a blow - out preventer - a series of pipes and valves that could stop the leak .
OIL SPILL DISASTERS 1991 : 520 m gallons were deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers during the first Gulf War to impede the US invasion 1979 : 140 m gallons were spilt over nine months after a well blow - out in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90 m gallons leaked from a Greek oil tanker after it collided with another ship off the coast of Trinidad 1983 : 80 m gallons leaked into the Gulf over several months after a tanker collided with a drilling platform 1989 : 11 m gallons were spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster
Richard Black 's blog However , this was a " highly complex task " and " it may not be successful " , said chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , Doug Suttles .
If the blow - out preventer does not seal off the well , the company intends to place a large dome directly over the leaks to catch the oil and send it up to the surface , where it could be collected by ships .
This has been done before , but only in shallow waters , Mr Suttles said .
Another alternative is to drill a " relief well " intersecting the original well , but he warned that this might take two to three months to stop the flow .
BP has brought in more than 30 clean - up vessels and several aircraft to spray dispersant on the oil - slick , which by Monday night was estimated to have grown to about 600 sq miles ( 1,550 sq km ) .
The US Coast Guard said 32 vessels were waiting for conditions to improve to resume the clean - up .
It has also deployed 23,000 ft ( 7 km ) of containment booms , with another 70,000 ft of booms ready to be deployed when conditions allow .
Presumed dead
The Deepwater Horizon had been carrying out exploratory drilling 52 miles south - east of Venice , Louisiana , when the blast occurred .
The search for 11 workers who are still missing has been called off .
Another 126 workers were rescued .
An investigation into the cause of last Tuesday 's explosion is continuing .
In 2009 , BP was fined a record $ 87 m ( £ 53 m ) for failing to improve safety conditions following a massive explosion that killed 15 people at its Texas City refinery .
The US Mineral Management Services found no violations on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it carried out routine inspections in February , March and April this year .
The current leak would have to continue for more than eight months to match the 11m - gallon spill from the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off Alaska in 1989 , the worst oil spill in US history .

“ Beautiful , is n’t it ? ” he said .
The scientists also found a profusion of animal fossils at the site — saber - toothed cats , mongooses , wild dogs , antelopes and hyenas , among others .
Dr. Berger and Paul Dirks , a geologist at James Cook University in Queensland , Australia , hypothesized that the animals might have been lured to the edge of a 100 - to 150 - foot funnel - shaped shaft into a deep cave , perhaps by the scent of water during a drought , then plunged to their deaths .
Image Matthew Berger , 11 , was nine when he stumbled into a major archeological discovery .

There is evidence that maggots and carrion beetles , but not carnivores , fed upon the rotting carcasses , leading the scientists to conclude that the carnivores , too , must have died from the fall .
The first downpours of the rainy season may have swept the bodies into a pool of water rich with lime and sand — the ingredients of cement — that essentially froze them in place .
Dr. Berger called the sediba fossils “ a time machine ” into evolutionary processes .
Researchers now think the split between apes and the hominid lineage occurred around seven million years ago in Africa .
The sparse fossil record shows early hominid species already walking upright , but still relatively apelike .
Small australopithecines , with bodies and brains not much bigger than those of modern chimpanzees , were widespread from 3.8 million to three million years ago , most famously Australopithecus afarensis like Lucy .
Just when changes leading to Homo were happening remains unclear in the fossil record .
Hominids started shaping stone tools about 2.6 million years ago .
Hominids identified as Homo appeared more than two million years ago , their direct ancestry anything but clear .
The species Australopithecus sediba thus shared a time with Homo habilis and Homo erectus .
Ian Tattersall , a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , supported the discovery team ’s interpretation of the fossils as a previously unclassified species of advanced Australopithecus “ with suggestions of Homo . ”
But it is often a toss - up whether a fossil discovery will bring order or confusion to the family tree .
William H. Kimbel , director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , said the fossil remains were instead a species of early Homo with some cranial and skeletal material “ seen otherwise only in Homo . ”
As the taxonomic debate continues , so , too , does fossil hunting at the Malapa site .
So far , the scientists exploring it have not even started digging , but have cleared it of rubble left by men mining for lime , probably about a century ago , and other debris .
They keep finding more hominid bones that click together like pieces of jigsaw puzzles .
Since submitting the paper to Science in November , they have found at least two more individuals , one an infant .
Mary Sauer : Pole Vaulter and Playboy
Mary Sauer , 34 - years - old , is an American Pole vaulter .
In June 2001 , Mary became the third American woman ever to break the 15 - foot barrier by vaulting 4.61 metres .
She is a five - time All - American in the triple jump and high jump at Azusa Pacific University .
It was n’t until after she graduated college that she began pole vaulting .
At the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials , she just missed making the U.S. Olympic team after vaulting 4.33 metres .
Mary was a beauty and appeared in Maxim ( pictured below ) and Playboy ( pictured above ) .
( Unfortunately , instead of amending their terms of service to work with the GNU GPL , Apple have decided to remove GNU Go from the App Store .

In most ways , this is a typical enforcement action for the FSF : we want to resolve this situation as amicably as possible .
We have not sued Apple , nor have we sent them any legal demand that they remove the programs from the App Store .
The upstream developers for this port are also violating the GPL , and we are discussing this with them too .
We are raising the issue with Apple as well since Apple is the one that distributes this software to the public ; legally , both parties have the responsibility to comply with the GPL .
The only thing we 're doing differently is making this announcement .
Apple has a proven track record of blocking or disappearing programs from the App Store without explanation .
So we want to provide everyone with these details about the case before that happens , and prevent any wild speculation .
GPLv2 gives every individual and company permission to modify and distribute the software ; but if they do that , they must follow terms of the license that are designed to ensure that people who receive the software from them have both the legal right and practical ability to share and change the software as well .
Apple is free to distribute our software through the App Store if they wish , but they cannot take advantage of the license 's permissions while turning a blind eye to the conditions .
If they want to continue distributing this software , they must not prohibit others from doing so through the iTunes Store Terms of Service .

Whether they stop you from doing certain tasks by banning VoIP apps , or limit people 's speech by selectively blocking political commentary , Apple sees to it that App Store apps serve Apple 's interests first , Apple 's business partners ' interests second , and yours a distant third .
We have a different idea .
We believe that people should be allowed to use their computers however they like , whether the devices are shaped like laptops , cell phones , or tablets .

There may be a reason Colorado has one of the nation 's lowest rate 's of diabetes .
Scientists who bred mice missing a gene -- which regulates response to low oxygen levels -- found they stay thin and healthy and avoid fatty livers and diabetes even when fed extremely high - fat diets .
The mice lack a gene that makes an enzyme called FIH , which affects the body 's physiological response to low oxygen levels .
At first , the researchers thought the lack of the gene might kill them in utero .
" In fact the mouse was quite happy and did n't seem to notice it all , " says Randall Johnson , a professor of biology at the University of California , San Diego , who directed the research .
But when scientists studied it , they realized it was significantly leaner than normal mice .
Not only that .
The mouse was constantly hyperventilating , taking in 20 to 40 % more air than normal , with a faster heart rate .
It also drank 30 to 40 % more than regular mice .
When researchers analyzed it , they found that the mouse was reacting as if it had been taken up to the top of Mount Rainier , about 14,000 feet .
Air at sea level contains about 22 % oxygen .
At the top of Washington State 's Mount Rainier , it 's about 15 % and at the top of Mount Everest , at the far edge of what humans can survive , it goes down to 11 to 12 % .
These mice react much as humans would at a 15 % oxygen level .
Except in humans , the body quickly reacts to altitude , increasing respiration and adding more red blood cells to compensate until it has adapted .
The mice never adapt .
Instead , they expend a huge amount of energy breathing .
It might be socially a little problematic to go around hyperventilating all the time , but Johnson says it 's possible a similar state might be induced by drugs .
" It 's intriguing that the least diabetic state is Colorado .
So there 's a possibility that there 's link between higher altitude and improved insulin sensitivity , " he says .
The study was published in this week 's issue of the journal Cell Metabolism .
Researchers in Australia and Sweden also took part .

We ’ve had quite a collection of both hearty thought - provoking articles and light funnies in Outer Blogness this week !!
I ’ll just mix them up and let you guess which is which !
First — in honor of Easter — a bunch of news from the Catholic Church .
The evidence of institutionally - endemic child abuse is getting to the point where it ’s no longer possible to just sweep it under the rug .
Naturally , Catholic leaders respond by accusing other people of being Nazis .
Yet , the real shocker is that the Catholic Church is covering up an even more surprising scandal !!
( And check out this other Easter cover - up ! )
Speaking of meat , Chandelle presents a fascinating three part review of The Vegetarian Myth — agreeing and disagreeing with the author in ways that may surprise you !
Neece offers a selection of seasonal LOL - cats for your Easter pleasure .
Jon James reports on the “ Climategate ” investigation results .
Austin Cline analyzes the tea - bagger movement , while Djinn completes the picture with a collection of images the teabaggers ’ signs — eloquently written in “ teabonics ” !
And do n’t let me forget about the Mormon - specific news of this week !
Here ’s the most hilarious piece I ’ve seen in some time :
In a recent press release , Church authorities announced that the forthcoming Priesthood / Relief Society manuals will be issued in the form of a board book entitled Goodnight , Brain .
In order to broaden their accessibility , lessons have been streamlined and simplified into telegraphic language , such as God good .
Devil bad .
Each lesson will take up a single page and will include not only questions for discussion recitation but also appropriate answers .
Andee also recommends a video about the Young Women ’s new pink ! books .
Andrew discusses the competing celebrations of Easter and General Conference .
( I do n’t know what he ’s talking about — I always though listening to old guys lecture on porn was an integral part of a traditional Easter celebration … )
Note that I ’m not bothering to link to any of the many General Conference photo spreads on the Bloggernacle .
Not only do they all look alike , but nobody even bothered to photograph the garment - waving counter - cult people .
( What happened — did those guys forget to show up this time ? )
Instead , we have first - hand reports from an even more interesting conference : Sunstone West !
Mike Reed describes the panel ( with Newell Bringhurst , Robert Rees , and D. Michael Quinn ) featuring his forthcoming book Banishing the Cross : The Emergence of a Mormon Taboo , and Chris Smith gives a whole series of highlights .
In other Mormon updates , our favorite reddit feed brings the news that the CoJCoL - dS is finally embracing the term “ Mormon ” ( instead of telling people to call them “ LDS ” or a bunch of other suggestions that never caught on ) .
And the newly - named “ Mormon Times ” is making a splash with interesting articles like this one Brad found about single men and their terrorist tendencies .
Runtu posts the latest installment in his series on Postmodernism and Mormonism .
And Leah tells what she does believe , while El Guapo reports on Mormons ’ “ Frequently Avoided Questions ” .
Whew !
I can hardly believe that I only got three things accomplished this whole sunny Sunday : this roundup , The Humanist Symposium ( which I ’m hosting this time : it ’s the Super - Humanist Edition ! ) , and a fabulous lunch - plus - afternoon - with - family - and - friends Easter party !!
So I ’ll close by wishing you all a very happy Holiday with two cartoons and a very funny video !!
The emirate of Dubai has named a British citizen as a 19th suspect of the killing of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , the Hamas official murdered in the emirate four months ago , apparently by a group that included holders of forged British passports .
According to a source in the United Arab Emirates , the suspect arrived in Dubai under his own name and carrying a genuine British passport .
The document , the details of which are known by The Independent on Sunday but which they have decided not to publish , shows that he holds a real British passport dated 24 October 2007 , valid for 11 years , and was born in 1948 .
It is believed that his father was a Jewish Palestinian who migrated to the UK just after the Second World War .
Dubai police have informed Interpol of the name and passport number of the suspect .
The man is believed to be hiding in Western Europe .
According to Dubai sources , the British man was identified parking a rental car close to the hotel where Mr Mabhouh was murdered and can be seen parking his car on a videotape that is in the possession of UEA authorities ; a copy of the tape has been given to the British police .
According to the UEA , the suspect has recently visited both Canada and France .
Mr Mabhouh was smothered to death in his hotel room and the Emirates have named 33 suspects .
Investigations revealed that up to 12 of them had used forged British passports .
Other suspects used similar counterfeit or stolen Irish , Australian , French and German passports .
Those involved are widely believed to be members of Mossad , the Israeli intelligence service .
British , Irish and French governments have asked Israeli ambassadors to explain the use of their national passports in the killing .
The involvement of a genuine British suspect will not improve diplomatic relations between London and Tel Aviv .
The former foreign secretary David Miliband condemned the counterfeiting of British passports as " intolerable " and demanded reassurances from Israel that it would not be repeated .
Britain also ordered an Israeli diplomat to leave the UK in March after an investigation by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency showed that there were " compelling reasons " why Israel was believed to be behind the misuse of the passports .
The inquiry determined that the documents were cloned when British citizens passed through airports on their way into Israel , with officials taking them away for " checks " that lasted around 20 minutes .
Britain 's decision was attacked by angry Israeli MPs who described it as the action of " anti-semitic dogs " .
The diplomat asked to leave the UK was understood to be an intelligence officer who was known to the UK authorities and worked as official liaison with Britain 's MI6 .
There was no suggestion the officer was personally involved in the passports affair .
Israel has never admitted any role in February 's Dubai assassination of Mr Mabhouh , who was described as a key figure in smuggling Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip on behalf of Hamas .
It has abstained from signing any material that might be construed as a confession .

In an apparent attempt to stop piracy from bankrupting the music industry , the UK Government passed the Digital Economy Bill last week .
Despite their good intentions , the lawmakers have come up with a legislative equivalent of DRM that will not have the slightest effect on seasoned file - sharers .
Last Wednesday the Digital Economy Bill was forced through by the UK Government .
Under the new law copyright holders have the power to spy on those who infringe their rights , which may ultimately lead to file - sharers being disconnected from the Internet .
In addition , copyright holders can urge the Government to close websites without the hassle of going through the courts .
Despite these new powers awarded to copyright holders , it is unlikely that they will stop heavy file - sharers from continuing what they ’ve been doing for so long .
The problem with using technology to fight technology is that it ’s only a matter of time before the latter catches up with the former .
It has already been shown numerous times that DRM has not prevented anyone from sharing files , and the Digital Economy Act – with all the extra powers it gives to copyright holders – wont be successful either .
For those who do n’t want to give up their habit of downloading copyrighted material , there are simply dozens of ways to download music and movies without being at risk .
Much like DRM , the Act will not stop tech savvy file - sharers , it will only change the rules of the game .
Listed below are a few ways how file - sharers will easily avoid the measures that have been introduced by the new legislation .
A Simple Trick
For those who use BitTorrent to share files , there is one really simple trick to avoid being tracked by many copyright holders .
Since all of the tracking software we ’re aware of today use BitTorrent trackers to gather data , one can simply remove the tracker (s ) before downloading and rely on DHT and PEX instead .
DHT and PEX are supported by all the major BitTorrent clients nowadays and users will be able to download just as quickly as they are used to .
Instead of going through a central tracker , DHT and PEX allow BitTorrent users to get all the information they need from the swarm , and avoid the prying eyes of many anti-piracy outfits by doing so .
Although monitoring DHT is harder than using the BitTorrent trackers to gather ‘ evidence ’ , it is not impossible .
But since the leading BitTorrent tracking organization Dtecnet has no clue about DHT , we assume that it might take a while before their evidence gathering techniques are updated .
Buying Anonymity
For a few pounds a month file - sharers can circumvent the Digital Economy Act entirely with a VPN .
These services offer an encrypted tunnel between your home connection and an external server and will exchange your IP - address for one in another country where UK laws do n’t apply .
Besides avoiding being tracked by anti-piracy outfits , a VPN will also allow access to all of the sites that may be blocked under the new legislation .
There are thousands of VPN services available on the Internet .
Itshidden is a popular one among BitTorrent users , but Hidemyass and Swiss VPN have received positive reviews as well .
The Pirate Bay folks offer one of the cheapest solutions , they launched their Ipredator VPN a year ago after Sweden passed their new anti-piracy law .
Ditch BitTorrent
What has n’t been mentioned too often is that the Digital Economy
Act only targets a select group of file - sharers – those who upload material .
It is expected that BitTorrent and Gnutella - based applications such as Limewire will be the main targets , simply because they are the easiest to monitor .
However , there are several other ways to download copyrighted content on the Internet .
Usenet providers offer premium download services that cannot be monitored easily , and as we mentioned in a previous article , there are also hundreds of MP3 search engines that allow users to download files directly on their computers without being tracked .
The bottom line is that no matter what legislation governments introduce , it is doubtful that it will have an effect on heavy file - sharers or those that can be bothered to spend 30 minutes using Google .
It might deter some novice file - sharers , but the question is at what expense ?
As The Guardian rightfully notes today , the Act might lead to hundreds or thousands of people losing their connection based on false evidence .
Is that worth it ?
It ’s not just the Archdiocese of Washington fuming over recognizing homosexuals as human beings .
The United Kingdom ’s Roman Catholic Church , which has 11 adoption agencies , is still in the fight against having to consider gay couples as fit parents for kids .
Only one of those agencies is still fighting the 2007 law that prohibited discrimination against gays in such matters .
Three Catholic bishops told worshippers that they were taking the case of the Catholic Care adoption agency to the High Court on Wednesday because they were fighting for the rights of vulnerable children to a loving family .
They said that the closure of the adoption agency , which finds new homes for about 20 ‘ difficult - to - place ’ children each year , would represent the loss of an ‘ effective and well - respected resource ’ .
The agency , which serves the dioceses of Leeds , Middlesbrough and Hallam in South Yorkshire , is the only one of 11 Catholic adoption agencies in the country to continue to fight the Sexual Orientation Regulations ( SORs ) .
The law outlawed discrimination against gay couples in the provision of goods and services and was pushed through Parliament in 2007 in spite of protests from leaders of all the mainstream religious faiths .
It meant that Catholics adoption agencies – which together found new homes for about 250 children in care each year – were obliged to assess same - sex couples as potential adopters or foster parents .
Naturally , you ’ve got the Church calling gay adoption “ gravely immoral ” and all those wonderful superlatives .
And you ’ve got British lawmakers reminding everyone that , hey , government is a secular institution , people .
The appeal to the High Court will be heard on the same day that the Catholic bishops of England and Wales publishes a pre-General Election document in which they say it is ‘ essential ’ for politicians to support marriage and the family .
While the main political parties disagree on the importance of heterosexual marriage , with Labour arguing that it was simply a lifestyle choice , they share support for civil partnerships and gay adoption .
[ Daily Mail ]
If Democrats are going to combat this sort of nonsense effectively .
If we are going to have any hope of making our programs into realities , if we are going to succeed in helping the very people most opposed to us , then we are going to have to overcome this pernicious stereotype .
The way to do that is not to sputter and look askance at the idiotic things being said by our Republican opponents .
It is not to try to out - just - plain - folks them .
It is to create our own counter narrative and to make people understand it .
Our narrative is simple .
We are competent and they are not .
Our policies work and theirs do n’t .
Most of all , you ca n’t trust anything a Republican says because all they ever do is lie .
Rebuttal has to be within the framework of a counter narrative , one that damages the enemy .
" That 's not true , " by itself is weak , regardless of the actual facts .
It must be placed in the context of a larger narrative and that narrative is " The GOP are damned liars . "
In order to do that , the debunking statements has to be preceded with a priming statement that establishes the counter - narrative .
For example :
" Well , you have to remember that these are the same people that told us that Iraq had WMDs and that they were going to bring in Osama bin Laden dead or alive .
You know I thought that after those disasters they would have learned something , but I have to give my Republican colleagues something .
They are nothing if not incorrigible .
I really thought that after all the lies on health care failed so miserably that they would change their ways , but I guess that was my own fault by now I ought to know better and I suppose we should only have expected them to double down on dishonesty .
Still , this latest lie is breathtaking in its chutzpah .
What is even more surprising is that figures in the media who ought to know better are even giving in any air time .
The truth of the matter is . . . "
or
" Well that may not be the stupidest lie the GOP has ever peddled , but I have to admit it's in the running .
You see the truth is . . . "
or
" You know these people repeat these lies with such apparent conviction that I wonder if they even know what the truth is anymore .
In a way I pity them .
They really seem to believe that holding power is more important than anything in the world and they are willing to quite literally say anything in an attempt to keep their seats .
This one , however , should have been out of bounds .
Most of the things Frank Luntz tells them to say at least have the virtue of being remotely plausible .
This one is clearly of the flat earth , sun rising in the West variety .
It would be funny if it were n't for the fact that so many in the media give these people a platform for their outrages on the truth . . . "
Our story is simple .
The GOP are a bunch of damned liars .
That must be the point that we seek to drive home every time we start with our debunking .
After thirty years we should have learned that debunking itself is not enough .
Without an overall framing narrative that we repeatedly seek to drive home we will forever be playing intellectual whack - a- mole with the lies these people dream up and all we will achieve is a he -said , she - said , stalemate , which will favor the status quo and thus favor the Republicans .

“ People everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news . ”
~ A. J. Liebling
Liebling had it right .
He died in 1963 .
He would have enjoyed what has taken place in journalism since the advent of the World Wide Web ’s Navigator browser in late 1994 .
The Web began to take off in 1995 .
I started my first site in 1996 .
Anyone with a Web connection can set up a blog for free on Blogger or WordPress .
He can then move on to a separately controlled , hosted Web site for a few dollars a month .
If he is really lucky , he can get a President impeached .
Matt Drudge did .
The gatekeepers stand at the gates , guarding who goes in and what goes out .
But the walls have gaping holes in them , if they still stand at all .
This has never happened before in world history .
As a result , the world ’s social order will change .
We can not see clearly what it will look like in 20 years or 50 years , but the changes inaugurated by the printing press in one century , 1450 — 1550 , offer good examples of what will happen .
The pace of change is much faster today .
OLDSPAPERS
Almost no one under age 35 subscribes to a daily newspaper in the United States .
This is a widely known fact .
It has been known for over a decade .
It is clear to all that newspapers must switch to the Web in order to survive .
They must also find a business model that enables them to show a profit .
So far , no major daily urban newspaper has made this transition .
The losses on the Web editions are so great that they must be sustained by the print editions .
It is highly unlikely that any of them will make the shift successfully .
The loss of paid subscribers is now too rapid .
In the fall of 2009 , Bloomberg published a report on the decline of paid subscriptions to print editions over the past year .
For 379 newspapers , the decline was 11 % .
If we apply the “ law of 70 ” — 70 divided by 11 — we find that these newspapers will have only half their paid subscribers in another 6.3 years .
Of course , they wo n’t all decline at the same rate .
Probably half of them will go bankrupt before then .
It may be more than half .
Here is the poster child of on - line paid subscription newspapers .
A family paid $ 650 million to buy Newsday , the Long Island newspaper .
The paper paid an additional $ 4 million to create an on - line edition in which readers would pay $ 5 a week .
Total number of subscribers who did this : 35 .
The New York Times has announced that it will begin charging frequent visitors to view its contents , beginning in 2011 .
It is aimed at visitors who are loyal to the Times .
Yes , the paper really said this .
This strategy will not work .
Loyalty is great , but it works in the newspaper industry only when it ’s free of charge .
As soon as there is a fee , loyalty ends .
The decision - makers at the Times are living in a fantasy world .
They are desperate , like mammoths in the La Brea tar pits .
They are thrashing around , trying to make a pay - to - read on - line model work .
It wo n’t work .
Printed daily newspapers are doomed .
On - line daily paid - subscription newspapers are also doomed .
Conclusion : the Establishment is about to lose one of its three major instruments for shaping public opinion : newspapers , the TV networks , and the tax - funded schools .
THE PUNCH AND JUDY SHOW
I have not subscribed to a print edition of a daily newspaper for a dozen years .
I used to subscribe to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times .
That was a long time ago .
Those two outlets are the mouthpieces for the two sides of the Punch & Judy show that we call politics .
Their editorial pages are where Left - wing Keynesians and Right - wing Keynesians debate about how large the Federal deficit should be .
You have never read an editorial in the WSJ on the need for reducing the Federal debt to zero , while simultaneously removing all legal authority of the Federal Reserve System to act as an enforcement agency of the U.S. government , i.e. , advocating the complete privatization of the FED .
That is what Andrew Jackson did : reduced the Federal debt to zero for the first and last time , and also privatized the Second Bank of the United States , which then went bankrupt .
So , it can be done .
But no agency of Establishment opinion thinks that the Federal debt should ever be zero , nor does it suggest that central banking is an enormous scam .
The Right and the Left are agreed on central banking .
This goes back to 1848 : the anonymously published Manifesto of the Communist Party , wherein Marx and Engels recommended the creation of a central bank as one of the ten steps to socialize a society .
In a puppet show , you never see the person or persons whose hands are inside the puppets , or whose hands control the strings of the marionettes .
That would spoil the show .
The children know the puppets are not real .
So do the parents .
But the show is entertaining .
The national puppet shows that entertain us politically are not widely perceived as puppet shows .
So , the entertainers who control the strings can charge a lot more to the public .
The public really does think that the show must go on .
The level of taxation borne by the victims , the level of national government indebtedness , and the rate of monetary expansion all point to the grand success of the illusion .
The threat to the entertainers is that the public will begin to perceive that there are hands inside the puppets and above the strings on the marionettes .
This process of realization has begun .
I realized less than a week ago that The Atlanta Journal - Constitution has been appearing on my driveway every morning .
I had thought it was one of those throwaway Thrifty Nickel - type papers .
My wife had subscribed temporarily .
I picked up Monday ’s issue .
The paper is an emaciated version of what I had known as a newspaper a dozen years ago .
It is not so wide .
It has 32 pages .
Yet it serves a metropolitan region of over 5 million people .
The paper is filled with day - old national and international stories , plus local stories of little interest to me .
The stories are written or re-written by local reporters .
There may be some good ones on the staff .
I do not intend to find out by reading the paper , front to back , for a month .
If I am going to read articles by unknown journalists , I will read the first or second stories on Google News .
Why ?
Because those are the stories that millions of people read .
I can get the Establishment ’s slant on the story .
I used to clip the NYT and the WSJ .
I had to tape each one to a sheet of paper .
I filed them in one of a dozen 4 - drawer filing cabinets .
I hoped I could recall the search terms .
( For years , I could .
Not now . )
These were newspapers of record .
But why physically clip a newspaper today ?
I can use Evernote to do this digitally .
I can clip a paragraph or an entire article .
I add search words .
They are now permanent additions to my files .
If my computer dies , so what ?
Evernote is on - line .
There is now no newspaper of record .
The Times had its crucial annual index .
Now there is Google .
I can find thousands of entries on a topic .
I am not limited to the slant provided by the Times .
The Times is steadily hemorrhaging financially .
It will eventually go under .
I figure that this will happen by 2020 .
All the news that ’s fit to print will no longer be printed by the Times .
THE THREE TASKS OF THE HISTORIAN
Recently , I completed Part 1 of a projected 2 - part DVD series on the history of the American conservative movement .
I introduced it by making a statement .
I said that the historian has three primary tasks :
1. Follow the confession .
2 . Follow the money .
3 . Follow the media .
The confession of any movement is its statement of faith .
What do its members believe to be true about five topics : God , man , law , causation , and the future ?
The money question is obvious .
How does the movement fund itself ?
The media question should be obvious :
How does a movement get its message to the public ?
Rarely in any textbook is there a detailed discussion about how members of a movement communicated .
A textbook in American history will discuss the Committees of Correspondence , 1773 — 76 , or the Abolitionist movement , 1830 — 60 .
That is because these movements won on the battlefield .
The winners write the textbooks .
But , even here , there is rarely any discussion of those successful operations that depended on a conspiracy to win .
The winners write a very different story , emphasizing the power of democracy to achieve good .
The losers find that their version of a story does not reach the general public .
It does not get into the textbooks .
Following the media is a huge task .
It means reading a few supposedly representative samples of hundreds of newspapers .
After 1820 , the number of papers got so large that the historical record ends .
You can not access all of them on microcard or on - line .
Within 50 years , this will no longer be true .
All of the world ’s newspapers will be on - line , from start to finish .
Then search engines will ferret out opinions and reports .
This will change the way the stories are presented .
This may take only 25 years .
Local newspapers will be scanned in .
Local high school students could do this as a project , year by year .
Or maybe Google will pay for it .
Once the papers are on - line , the ability of Establishment historians to prevent “ amateurs ” from telling new versions of old official stories will end .
Meanwhile , newspapers are dying .
Their ability to shape public opinion may be gone today .
This has happened in less than 15 years .
The magnitude of what this represents has not been faced by the Establishments .
PUNDITRY
Pundits are salaried opinion - makers who have shaped the opinions of intellectuals for a century .
They have readers because they are on the payrolls of newspapers .
The Times attempted to convert their pundits into an income stream in 2005 .
The paper began charging readers to read these pundits .
That experiment lasted for exactly two years .
Then the company abandoned it .
These experts — mostly Left - wing Keynesians — sit at their keyboards and crank out the daily quota of ideas .
I do the same myself .
But these people are salaried .
I am not .
These people are hired to communicate the latest opinions of the Establishment .
I am not .
They are supposed to influence the opinions of decision - makers and their advisors .
In the past , they have done this .
But the cozy little arrangement is being smashed by the Web .
There are too many opinions out there .
The voters can find out what they want to know through social media and Google searches .
There are now millions of well - informed voters who do not read the opinions of the pundits , except to ridicule them .
CONCLUSION
The oligopoly is breaking down because the media have opened up .
When the purchase price of a press is essentially the cost of a person ’s time , the competition increases .
There is no way to control the flow of information .
Think of the family that shelled out $ 650 million for Newsday .
Think of Rupert Murdoch , who bought the London Times , and now is planning to impose a subscription for the on - line version .
He did n’t get the memo .
It must have been sent digitally .
The era of Establishment control over the flow of ideas is ending .
That era rested on the high cost of entry .
Now anyone can enter .
The mammoths are in the tar pits , with their huge buildings , huge staffs , and huge debts .
One man in an apartment got a President impeached .
Rupert Murdoch should have seen what was coming .

Since the idea for this movie came to light I was interested .
I became far more interested when the casting details stared slipping out .
It features all of my favorite action heroes from my childhood ( including a one of a kind Arnold cameo , which I do n’t know how they pulled off ) , plus the new guys who quite simply rock .
If this new trailer for it does n’t get your blood pumping and excited for this film , then you might want to go to the hospital … you could very well be dead .

Stratasys Delivers First Shipment of HP - Branded 3D Printers
Event marks milestone in agreement to develop 3D printers for HP
MINNEAPOLIS , Apr 19 , 2010 ( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Additive fabrication system maker , Stratasys , Inc. , ( NASDAQ : SSYS ) , today announced it has delivered its first shipments of HP - branded 3D printers .
Stratasys and HP co-developed the exclusive 3D printer systems , which are being manufactured by Stratasys as part of a global manufacturing agreement with HP ( NYSE : HPQ ) , as announced in January .
HP launched its Designjet 3D products in Europe today , making it the only major manufacturer of 2D ( or paper ) printers in the 3D printer market .
The products will be available this May in five European markets : France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the UK .
" The agreement to develop and manufacture a product to HP 's specification is a milestone for us , " says Stratasys CEO Scott Crump .
" Today , we 're taking a big step in realizing the agreement 's potential by demonstrating we can deliver . "
" There are millions of 3D designers using 2D printers who are ready to bring their designs to life in 3D , " says Santiago Morera , HP 's vice president and general manager of its Large Format Printing Business .
" Stratasys FDM technology is the ideal platform for HP to enter the 3D MCAD printing market and begin to capitalize on this untapped opportunity . "
Technology & Use
Product designers , engineers , and architects who design with CAD ( computer aided design ) use 3D printers as peripheral devices to " print " or produce a tangible 3D model from plastic or other material to verify the form , fit , and function of designs prior to committing them to production or construction .
Designers often seek 3D printers that model with production - grade thermoplastic when they want to best - predict performance of their plastic end - product .
Stratasys manufactures 3D printers under the Dimensionbrand , and it makes 3D production systems under the Fortus brand .
Both product lines , as well as the HP - branded 3D printers employ Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) technology , which creates three - dimensional plastic models directly from a CAD file .
The patented process creates parts by extruding semi-molten plastic in thin layers to " grow " the part , layer by layer .
The process of producing a part layer - by - layer is known generically as " additive fabrication " or " additive manufacturing . "
Pioneer & Leader
The term " 3D printer " was coined by Stratasys when it introduced its first compact system co-developed with IBM in the mid 1990s .
3D printer is now widely used to describe a segment of additive fabrication machines that generally connotes a compact , low - price unit that is quick and easy to operate .
Stratasys was an early pioneer of the additive fabrication industry as well as its 3D printer segment .
The company has a seven - year track record as the industry 's unit sales leader , and it has an industry market share of 43 percent , as well as a market share of more than 50 percent for the 3D printer segment .
The company 's ongoing leadership demonstrates customers ' long - term satisfaction with its products and FDM technology .
The technology to produce 3D models directly from a digital design has been commercial for more than 20 years , but recent advances in 3D printers have dramatically reduced their cost and improved ease - of - use and reliability .
Stratasys introduced its Dimension 3D printer line in 2002 , with the first printer priced under $ 30,000 .
Early last year , Dimension broke the $ 15,000 ( USD ) barrier with its office - friendly uPrint , which fits on a desktop .
HP 's Graphic Solutions Business - part of the company 's $ 24 billion Imaging and Printing Group - executed the distribution agreement with Stratasys .
HP is a leading provider of Designjet and Scitex large - format printing solutions , Indigo digital solutions for commercial and industrial printing , inkjet high - speed production solutions and specialty printing systems .
Stratasys , Inc. , Minneapolis , manufactures additive fabrication machines for prototyping and manufacturing plastic parts under the brands Fortus 3D Production Systems and Dimension 3D Printers .
The company operates RedEye On Demand , an online service for part prototyping and production .
Stratasys also manufactures 3D printers for HP , sold under the brand Designjet 3D .
According to Wohlers Report 2009 , Stratasys supplied 43 percent of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide in 2008 , making it the unit market leader for the seventh consecutive year .
Stratasys patented and owns the process known as FDM .
The process creates functional prototypes and manufactured goods directly from any 3D CAD program , using high - performance industrial thermoplastics .
The company holds more than 280 granted or pending additive fabrication patents globally .
Stratasys products are used in the aerospace , defense , automotive , medical , business & industrial equipment , education , architecture , and consumer - product industries .

Dimension , a brand of 3D printers by Stratasys , offers computer - aided - design ( CAD ) users a low - cost , networked alternative for building functional 3D models from the desktop .
The printers build models layer - by - layer using ABS plastic , one of the most widely used thermoplastics in today 's injection - molded products .
Dimension 3D printers allow users to evaluate design concepts and test models for form , fit , and function .
Online at : www.DimensionPrinting.com
Fortus is a brand of Stratasys , Inc. , formerly known as the FDM Group .
Fortus offers a line of 3D production systems used for direct digital manufacturing and precision rapid prototyping .
Fortus systems create manufactured goods or prototypes from industrial thermoplastics , including ABS , polycarbonate , PPSF , blends , and ULTEM * 9085 .

Esa tasked two of its Earth - scanning satellites to monitor the oceans with their radar
Sailors often whisper of monster waves when ships sink mysteriously but , until now , no one quite believed them .
As part of a project called MaxWave - which was set up to test the rumours - two Esa satellites surveyed the oceans .
During a three week period they detected 10 giant waves , all of which were over 25 m ( 81 ft ) high .
Strange disappearances
Over the last two decades more than 200 super - carriers - cargo ships over 200 m long - have been lost at sea .
Eyewitness reports suggest many were sunk by high and violent walls of water that rose up out of calm seas .
But for years these tales of towering beasts were written off as fantasy ; and many marine scientists clung to statistical models stating monstrous deviations from the normal sea state occur once every 1,000 years .
The waves exist in higher numbers than anyone expected
Wolfgang Rosenthal , GKSS Research Centre , Germany
To prove the phenomenon or lay the rumours to rest , a consortium of 11 organisations from six EU countries founded MaxWave in December 2000 .
As part of the project , Esa tasked two of its Earth - scanning satellites , ERS - 1 and ERS - 2 , to monitor the oceans with their radar .
The radars sent back " imagettes " - pictures of the sea surface in a rectangle measuring 10 by 5 km ( 6 by 2.5 miles ) , which were taken every 200 km ( 120 miles ) .
Around 30,000 separate imagettes were produced by the two satellites during a three - week period in 2001 - and the data was mathematically analysed .
Esa says the survey revealed 10 massive waves - some nearly 30 m ( 100 ft ) high .
" The waves exist in higher numbers than anyone expected , " said Dr Rosenthal .
Wave map
Ironically , while the MaxWave research was going on , two tourist liners endured terrifying ordeals .
The Breman and the Caledonian Star cruisers had their bridge windows smashed by 30 m waves in the South Atlantic .
Sailors often whisper of monster waves when ships sink mysteriously
Now that their existence is no longer in dispute , it is time to gain a better understanding of these rogues .
In the next phase of the research , a project called WaveAtlas will use two years ' worth of imagettes to create a worldwide atlas of freak wave events .
The goal is to find out how these strange cataclysmic phenomena may be generated , and which regions of the seas are most at risk .
Dr Rosenthal concluded : " We know some of the reasons for the rogue waves , but we do not know them all . "
One of the winners was 10 - year - old Jake Feldman who won a few trophies .
His most talked - about sandwich was The Jakester : Potato bread , Tilamook cheese , queso fresco , grilled portabello mushrooms , sauteed onions , tomato , butter , ground spicy cheetos , sauteed chorizo .
While the Grilled Cheese Truck , Chef Eric Greenspan and The Oaks Gourmet took top honors in the food court , hundreds of grilled cheese zealots competed in three categories — missionary ( your normal grilled cheese ) , kama sutra ( a grilled cheese with other ingredients ) and honeypot ( dessert ! ) — hoping to win top honors .
Now in its 8th year , the Grilled Cheese Invitational last Saturday attracted thousands of people looking to munch on one of the world 's favorite comfort foods .
In previous years , attendees complained of the lines and large crowds , but the ever - changing festival made a huge step this year by moving its location to L.A. Center Studios and adding a grilled cheese food court .
Did it work ?
It seemed so as less complaints were aired , which means Los Angeles ' cheesiness can only get better from here on out .
Because LAist was asked to judge , we found a place in our heart for Wassim Elkary 's Canadian Maple Syrup Grilled : Bread , Muenster Cheese , Maple syrup cookies , Funions , Cheese pringles extreme hot ranch , Lychee juice , cinnamon .
He said he invented it when he was drunk .
But not all grilled cheeses sounded so whacky ( even if they tasted so good ) .
Mike Romano 's delicious My Creamy Classic was just that : bread and cheese in perfect proportions .
Some serious competitors traveled afar to compete .
A pair of New Yorkers came out and represented their city with a grilled cheese made 100 % from home - town ingredients .
A pair from Berkeley did the same .
One theme found throughout the competition area was the choice of butter as many touted their use of farmers market butter , mainly from California or Vermont farmers ( what about Wisconsin ? ! ) .
Many others also use special techniques like using bricks or double grilling each side of the bread ( it makes a big difference ) .
If anything , the Grilled Cheese Invitational is a living cookbook , full of passion , new ideas and amazing comfort food that makes Los Angeles sane , if only for just an afternoon .
The full list of winners can be seen here .
The champion of womens ' rights has accused it of losing its moral compass over its association with Moazzam Begg
It has been a strange , disorientating and upsetting few months for Gita Sahgal .
The former head of Amnesty International 's gender unit was suspended in February after a very public and acrimonious dispute with her bosses .
Two weeks ago she left it altogether .
Her departure was provoked , according to a statement by Amnesty , by " irreconcilable differences " .
The row – over Amnesty 's links with Islamist pressure groups – has led to a succession of negative headlines for a body unused to such bad publicity .
According to Sahgal , the affair was symptomatic of an organisation that has lost its moral bearings and risks alienating whole swathes of liberal sympathisers .
In her first newspaper interview since leaving the charity altogether , Sahgal delivers a withering critique of her former employers , describing the modern Amnesty 's leadership as suffering from " ideological bankruptcy " and " misogyny " .
Although Amnesty is still one of the best known advocates of women 's rights in the world , Sahgal told the Observer that an " atmosphere of terror " prevailed inside the organisation in which debate is suppressed and staff are cowed into accepting the prevailing line .
" I think the leadership is ideologically bankrupt , as has been shown in the handling of this , " said Sahgal .
" There have been systemic failures even before I went public .
Questions need to be asked of the political and senior leadership .
There is a deep misogyny in the human rights movement and the kinds of issues that women have to face tend to bring that out . "
Sahgal was born in Bombay and is the daughter of novelist Nayantara Sahgal and great - niece of former Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru .
She became part of a feminist network that fought against rape and dowry laws .
She moved to London to study , becoming heavily involved in Southall Black Sisters , the London - based group that campaigns against domestic violence , sexism and racism .
She became head of Amnesty 's gender unit in 2003 .
The explosive falling out in one of the world 's leading human rights organisations took place after the publication of an e-mail Sahgal sent to the leadership , complaining that Amnesty had become too closely linked to a " pro-jihadi group " .
The email appeared in a national newspaper in February .
Sahgal claimed the charity 's links with Moazzam Begg , a former inmate at Guantánamo Bay , and his group Cageprisoners were undermining its campaign for women 's rights .
Begg , she claimed in the leaked email , was " Britain 's most famous supporter of the Taliban " .
She believed it was legitimate to give a platform to Begg 's account of his experience of unlawful detention and torture , but his beliefs meant it was a " gross error " to associate Amnesty with his organisation .
" It 's something that undermines every aspect of the work we have done on discrimination against minorities .
I cannot underestimate the level of horror expressed throughout the global women 's movement , " she told the Observer .
The problem , for Sahgal , is Begg 's championing the rights of " hate " preachers and alleged defence of the notoriously misogynistic Taliban , which has used its power to systematically suppress the rights of women .
After seven years in Amnesty championing women 's rights , Sahgal felt deeply compromised by the platform afforded to Begg .
She says many UN specialists , lawyers , philosophers and influential figures in the global women 's rights movement have jumped to her defence since her suspension .
Some have threatened to cut their association with Amnesty , the world 's oldest human rights group .
Others are said to have withdrawn donations to the charity in support of Sahgal , who left the organisation two weeks ago .
Among the groups that have stepped forward to support her are the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , Women Human Rights Defenders Coalition , Women Living Under Muslim Law and Inform , a Sri Lankan human rights organisation .
Amnesty , which has 2.2 million members , has faced few stickier periods since it was was founded in London in 1961 to support prisoners of conscience .
" Women 's groups are watching events with some anxiety , " said Sahgal .
" They are particularly appalled by what is happening and are very scared that the good relationships they have built up with people on women 's rights issues with Amnesty all over the world are going to be under threat because of this " .
She added : " People are very disturbed but also extremely worried about going up against Amnesty . "
Sahgal first aired concerns over Amnesty 's alliance with Cageprisoners in 2008 .
" I was completely ignored , " she said .
" There has never been a debate on this issue , even in the middle of this global crisis , inside Amnesty International .
They , the leadership , were silencing and ignoring the issue . "
Her confrontation with the Amnesty leadership , which she says exhibits " multiple systemic failures " , has left her disillusioned and worried for its future , given a culture of quashing debate and a deliberate policy of " silence " towards contrary views .
" There is a fault - line running through [ Amnesty ] , " she says , " and this has been exposed on a range of issues wider than what Begg believes . "
Amnesty disagrees .
In a statement issued after Sahgal 's comments were put to it , the organisation said : " Begg speaks powerfully from personal experience about the abuses there .
He advocates effectively detainees ' rights to due process , and does so within the same framework of universal human rights standards that we are promoting . "
Amnesty does , though , concede that Begg holds other views , arguing that , for example , the jihadist ideology of the Taliban can be kept separate from defending human rights .
" On whether one should talk to the Taliban , or on the role of jihad in self - defence : are such views antithetical to human rights ?
Our answer is no , even if we may disagree with them . "
It added that if any evidence emerged that Begg or Cageprisoners have promoted views antithetical to human rights it would disown its advocacy .
Sahgal maintains that a number of experts recommend " caution " when dealing with Begg and that efforts should have been made to investigate him before working with him .
Begg , for his part , has dismissed Sahgal 's claims as " ludicrous " and says he champions women 's rights .
Amnesty also refutes Sahgal 's allegations that debate within the organisation is discouraged , stating : " We are an organisation of activists with strong and different views on how best to achieve our common goals ; dissent is inevitable , indeed welcome .
Decisions are reviewed . "
But there can be little doubt that Sahgal 's views have struck a chord with many who would normally consider themselves active backers of Amnesty .
Heavyweights supporters of her stance include author Salmon Rushdie and Yakin Erturk , a former United Nations expert on violence against women .
Hina Jilani , a UN representative on human rights and Asma Jahangir , another key UN figure , are also believed to be deeply concerned .
Nawal el - Saadawi , the Egyptian writer and activist , and the respected Bangladeshi barrister Sara Hossain have also backed her .
" Amnesty is trying to message this as my concern only , " she says .
" But a lot of people have been raising private questions , including those who have been involved with Amnesty for years .
They are wondering what the hell is going on . "

In Arizona , it 's now legal for ( most ) adults to carry a concealed weapon without a permit .
Republican Gov. Jan Brewer just signed the legislation , putting her state in the same camp as Alaska and Vermont .
The state had issued 154,000 permits under the old law , which required background checks and instruction .
Gun buyers still face federal background checks when purchasing weapons from a store .
Here 's more background about the legislation , which the state House passed last week .

After a hard day 's work on his Crystal Beach home , Everett Johnston just wanted a cold beer .
He grabbed a Tecate Light out of his fridge and began to sip .
But , Johnston said , something did n't taste quite right .
He said his wife looked in the bottle and noticed a rat 's head floating inside .
Johnston filed a lawsuit recently in Galveston County against FEMSA Cerveza ( CCM ) , the Mexican maker of Tecate , as well as Heineken , which distributes the beer in the United States , among other defendants .
He 's citing the severe psychological damage he says he has suffered .
The 59 - year - old retired firefighter said Thursday that all he wants is an acknowledgement of his intense suffering — how in the moments after drinking the beer two years ago he wondered whether he would live or die .
“ The first thing came to my mind was it was a rodent that had eaten rat poison , ” Johnston said .
He remembered a story about a man who drank something contaminated with rat urine and later died .
“ I can't explain it , ” he said .
“ That kind of fear was something I had never experienced before . ”
In a written statement , Heineken said : “ While we cannot discuss the specifics of these claims due to company policies surrounding active litigation , we stand behind the quality of our products and those we distribute .
CCM is a world renowned brewer with the highest standards for safety and quality . ”
A worker at FEMSA said no one was available to comment Thursday , and a company spokeswoman did n't return an e-mail message .
Johnston said he began vomiting after drinking the beer and went to a hospital where he had X - rays and blood tests .
He said he has since saved the contaminated beer in his freezer .
Johnston added that eating out of a can now is traumatizing to him and he has trouble eating when food is n't prepared directly in front of him .
He also said his suffering made him incapable of caring for his elderly father - in - law before his death .
Counselors have told Johnston there 's not much more they can do for him , yet he said the pain continues to gnaw at him .
He said he 'll donate anything he wins in the lawsuit to charity .
Johnston 's lawyer , Roy Elizondo III , said neither Heineken nor FEMSA has been responsive to his attempts to resolve the matter out of court .
“ Some day someone could die from stuff like this , ” Elizondo said .
It costs the federal government up to nine cents to mint a nickel and almost two cents to make a penny .
So , in addition to overhauling Big Finance , President Barack Obama wants to tinker with America 's small change .
The president 's plan to save money by making coins from cheaper stuff seems simple on its face .
But history shows it would rekindle an emotional debate among Americans who fear changing the composition of their currency will hurt its value .

The revelations , to air on The 7:30 Report tonight , come days after Sydney Archbishop Cardinal George Pell wrote a press release putting forward the Australian Church 's processes to deal with abuse as a model for the Church in other countries .
Sex abuse allegations have dogged the Catholic Church around the world , in countries including Ireland , Germany and Brazil .
In his release Cardinal Pell stated that under the Australian Church 's Towards Healing program , those found to be abusers are permanently removed from the ministry .
But the ABC has found that last August , weeks after one such investigation finished with a Sydney bishop apologising to victims of a priest in his diocese , the priest celebrated mass in a church across the road from the bishop 's office .
And Melbourne 's Archbishop Dennis Hart has conceded that a Yarraville priest , who was judged to be an abuser in a 2005 Church investigation , has continued to perform mass on numerous occasions , most recently two months ago .
In the Sydney case , the ABC has obtained the Church 's findings against Father Finian Egan , formerly of St Gerard 's Church at Carlingford .
Kellie - Anne
Roche is one of two women whose allegations were upheld .
She was abused as a teenager in the 1980s .
She says Father Egan 's continued association with the Church is outrageous .
" It 's called Towards Healing but nothing they did has helped me heal , " she told The 7:30 Report .
" If anything , it made me feel like they were protecting him .
" I would advise victims to go to the police , not Towards Healing .
I do n't trust them . "
The other victim , who does not wish to be identified , was abused while at St Gerard 's primary school .
She is equally scathing of the Towards Healing program .
" In my experience it has n't given me any justice or healing whatsoever , " she said .
Both women say their main motivation in making a complaint was to see Father Egan removed from any role in the Church or involvement with children .
They say they were told their cases would be dealt with in a few months .
Instead they have run more than two years .
Apology
Last July Bishop David Walker of the Broken Bay diocese wrote to each woman stating his intention : " ... to apologise to you for the way you have been treated by Finian Egan . "
" What happened to you is contrary to what is expected of a member of the clergy .
We proclaim a Gospel which sees this behaviour as totally unacceptable , and I regret that you have been exposed to it by a member of our clergy . "
But the following month Father Egan was the celebrant at an evening mass at St Agatha 's Church in Pennant Hills , across the road from Bishop Walker 's office .
That mass was advertised across the diocese as honouring Father Egan 's 50 years as a priest .
The involvement of Father Egan , with no mention of the Church 's findings against him , devastated both victims .
" It makes you feel like a victim again .
Even though the Church upheld my allegations and they tell me that they believe me , they do n't show it by taking away his robes as a priest , " Ms Roche said .
Father Egan remains listed as a retired priest in the diocese online directory , with a phone number , apparently available for supplementary duties or weddings .
After the Church 's initial findings against Father Egan , and with the Broken Bay bishop still to determine his future , he played golf in a Church tournament representing the Broken Bay Diocese Education Office .
And last October , three months after the Broken Bay bishop 's apology , he played again in the tournament representing Mary Mackillop Girls ' School , and partnered with that school 's principal .
Father Egan chose not to comment for the story but insisted on his innocence throughout the Church inquiry .
Distressing
In Melbourne , Archbishop Denis Hart has conceded the victims of Yarraville priest Father Paddy Maye will have suffered further because the priest continues to conduct mass .
In 2005 an investigation by the Church in Melbourne found Father Maye had sexually groped two sisters in their family home .
He was also found to have committed a serious sexual offence against another woman .
Father Maye refused to take part in the investigation but denied all the allegations of inappropriate conduct .
He was stood down from his duties in 2005 .
But since 2007 the Melbourne Archbishop has written on at least three occasions to Father Maye telling him to stop conducting masses .
So far the letters have made no difference .
In March , Father Maye conducted a mass for the Irish community in Clifton Hill .
A spokesman for Archbishop Hart replied to questions about Father Maye 's continued ministry , saying : " The Archbishop recognises that when Father Maye contravenes his explicit directions , this can be distressing to Father Maye 's victims .
He apologises to them and will take appropriate action against Father Maye . "
It is unclear how widely within the Church the findings against Father Maye are known .
But in February The Catholic Weekly reported on a party for the retired auxiliary Sydney Bishop David Cremin , for which one of the other noted guests flown up from Melbourne was Father Maye , an old friend of the retired bishop .
Senior Church figures attended , including Monsignor John Usher , the Chancellor of Cardinal Pell 's Archdiocese and a man who is closely involved in the Towards Healing process .
So far Cardinal Pell has made no comment about the evidence of the two priests having continued ministry and other associations within the Church .

The Bank of America Corporation and Merrill Lynch were accused of discriminating against women in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by three female financial advisers at the companies .
The suit , filed in United States District Court in Brooklyn , accused Bank of America and Merrill Lynch of giving male counterparts of the three employees bigger bonuses and better opportunities .
The women also said that the companies sought to punish them when they complained about perceived inequalities .
One claimed that after she protested , she was verbally reprimanded and ordered to seek preapproval when filing expense reports for business lunches , something men never had to do .
Telltale just held a small little meeting here in San Francisco where they revealed just what the hell this iPhone full of erasers was all about .
Telltale unveiled a new game , along with a new initiative called the Pilot Program .
Telltale is all about releasing quirky little titles that others wo n't touch , and the Pilot Program is their way of getting even weirder concepts out there .
Puzzle Agent is the first new title to be featured in the Pilot Program .
It 's an adventure puzzle game in the style of the Professor Layton series .
The art of the game is done by Graham Annable , and Telltale is working with Annable to bring gamers a fusion of their signature storytelling skills and Annable 's unique art style .
This collaboration has created Puzzle Agent , and it 's pretty freaking weird .
Puzzle Agent ( PC , Mac , iPhone , iPad , WiiWare )
Developer : Telltale Games
Publisher : Telltale Games
To be released : June 2010
Puzzle Agent follows Nelson Tether , the lone agent of the FBI 's Puzzle Investigation division .
Nelson is sent out to Scoggins , Minnesota , to investigate why the town 's eraser factory has been closed down .
Nelson soon discovers that the town is hiding some kind of secret and it's up to you to find out what 's going on .
You 'll go through the town talking to the locals as you try to gather clues and uncover the town 's mystery .
A big portion of the game will see you solving puzzles ; the one puzzle we were shown had Agent Tether needing to figure out who won the ladies ' arm wrestling match .
Each of the ladies will give a clue , and the player has to figure out who the winner really is .
You 'll have three hints that you can use to help you figure out the puzzles .
The hint system is tied to the pieces of gum you can find scattered throughout the game .
Nelson loves gum , and he thinks best when he 's chewing some .
Annable 's art style is pretty simplistic , yet something about it is extremely charming .
Above is a clip from the game where Nelson meets a red elf .
The elf looks like the elves from this video -- and these elves just might have some kind of connection to the closer of the eraser factory and the town 's little secret .
We only got to see a glimpse of Puzzle Agent , but from what I saw , this game has some promise .
Annable has a very dark sense of humor , and Telltale is well known for their humorous games .
Combine the two and it looks like a match made in heaven .
Check back next week as Telltale will have more on Puzzle Agent , including pricing info .

A 33 year - old man who was charged with the rape of a 17 year - old is to make a claim for damages , after no evidence was offered when the case came to court .
Jamie Patrick Fitzsimmons spent two months on remand after he was charged with the rape of a juvenile in April 2009 .
He was due to go on trial in June this year .
But the prosecution offered no evidence at the Court of General Gaol Delivery earlier this month and a not guilty verdict was recorded .
Mr Fitzsimmons has now instructed lawyers to pursue a civil action against the Attorney General 's office over the circumstances of his arrest , detention and prosecution .

The radical Islamic Web site Revolutionmuslim.com is going after the creators of the TV cartoon series “ South Park ” after an episode last week included an image of the Prophet Mohammed in disguise .
Revolutionmuslim.com , based in New York , was the subject of a CNN investigation last year for its radical rhetoric supporting “ jihad ” against the West and praising al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
Its organizers insist they act within the law and seek to protect Islam .
On Sunday , Revolutionmuslim.com posted an entry that included a warning to South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone that they risk violent retribution – after the 200th episode last week included a satirical discussion about whether an image of the prophet could be shown .
In the end , he is portrayed disguised in a bear suit .
The posting on Revolutionmuslim.com says : “ We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them . ”
The entry on Revolutionmuslim.com goes on to advise readers :
“ You can contact them [ the makers of South Park ] , or pay Comedy Central or their own company a visit at these addresses … ” before listing Comedy Central ’s New York address , and the Los Angeles , California , address of Parker and Sloane ’s production company .
Contacted by CNN , the author of the post , Abu Talhah al Amrikee , said that providing the addresses was not intended as a threat to the creators of South Park but to give people the opportunity to protest .
Over still photographs of Parker , Stone , van Gogh and others , the Web site runs audio of a sermon by the radical U.S. - born preacher Anwar al - Awlaki , who is now in hiding in Yemen .
The sermon , recorded some time ago , talks about assassinating those who have “ defamed ” the Prophet Mohammed – citing one religious authority as saying “ Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that . ”
U.S. officials say al - Awlaki is on a list of al Qaeda leaders targeted for capture or assassination .
The clip ends with a warning on a graphic directed at Parker and Stone , saying “ The Dust Will Never Settle Down . ”
A new cloud - focused Linux flavor launched recently ; known as Peppermint , the operating system is currently a small , private beta and will open up to more testers over the next two to four weeks .
The Peppermint OS is aimed at the cloud .
Indeed , the Peppermint homepage describes the OS as : " Cloud / Web application - centric , sleek , user friendly and insanely fast !
Peppermint was designed for enhanced mobility , efficiency and ease of use .
While other operating systems are taking 10 minutes to load , you are already connected , communicating and getting things done .
And , unlike other operating systems , Peppermint is ready to use out of the box . "
In an April 14 blog post , the Peppermint team announced the closed beta of the new operating system .
The Peppermint team said the OS is " designed specifically for mobility . "
According to a description of the technology on Launchpad , Peppermint is " a fork of Lubuntu with an emphasis on cloud apps and using many configuration files sourced from Linux Mint .
Peppermint uses Mozilla Prism to create single site browsers for easily accessing many popular Web applications outside of the primary browser .
Peppermint uses the LXDE desktop environment and focuses on being easy for new Linux users to find their way around in . "
The Lubuntu project homepage describes Lubuntu as a faster , more lightweight and energy - saving variant of Ubuntu using LXDE , the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment .
The core Peppermint team consists of two developers in North Carolina : Kendall Weaver and Shane Remington .
" Weaver is the maintainer for the Linux Mint Fluxbox and LXDE editions , the lead software developer for Astral IX Media in Asheville , N.C. , ... and the director of operations for Western Carolina Produce in Hendersonville , N.C. ... Remington is based in Asheville , N.C. ... and is the project manager and lead Web developer for Astral IX Media , " the Peppermint site said .
Remington " provides the Peppermint OS project support with Web development , marketing , social network integration and product development . "
The German appeal court has overturned a decision by the German Federal Patent Tribunal to declare Microsoft 's patent for the File Allocation Table ( FAT ) file system invalid .
In judgement number X ZR 27/07 , handed down on Tuesday , the tenth civil division of the Karlsruhe - based court confirmed the enforceability of the company 's commercial rights in Germany .
It has not yet published its reasoning , but has confirmed the decision in a short press release ( German language link ) .
The case revolves around patent rights for a " common namespace for long and short file names " conferred by European Patent Office patent number EP 0618540 , which is based on US patent number 5,758,352 .
The common namespace solved the problem of short file names made up of a maximum of 8 characters encountered in older operating systems such as MS_DOS .
The company applied for patent protection for the process of linking a second directory entry to the short file name allowing two - way access to the corresponding information .
In 2007 , the German Federal Patent Tribunal declared that the invention had no right to protection under European law , as it was not the result of an inventive step .
The court found that the patented method had in particular already been suggested by specifications for the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol ( RRIP ) for reading files on CD - ROMs , the first version of which dates from 24th July 1991 .
The group behind the protocol took it upon themselves to extend the ISO 9660 standard for directory entries so that it would also be possible to access CD - ROM content using POSIX file system semantics .
This , according to the court , involved determining the location in which a file is stored using the process described in the Microsoft patent .
The German appeal court has now stated that it is unable to understand the lower court 's interpretation .
It takes a different view of the patent 's meaning .
It notes that the method of the patent enabled Microsoft to introduce the VFAT file system ( in Windows 95 ) , which allows long file names , but remains compatible with the original FAT file system .
This solution is , according to the court , made possible by using the file attribute field when storing a long file name , causing the name entry to be ignored when processing data using this system .
According to the court , the method of the patent is to store two independent directory entries , one with a short name and one with a long name .
By contrast , in RRIP " both names are contained in the same directory entry " .
The patent 's inventor would have faced " other problems in overcoming " the eight character file name limit .
The appeal court 's decision brings it into line with the US patent office 's assessment of the FAT patent .
In early 2006 , after lengthy deliberations , the latter confirmed the rights to protection conferred by patent number 5,579,517 , claiming that the development was new and inventive .
Appeal court judgement X ZB 22/07 ( german language link ) of 20th January 2009 had previously reaffirmed the impression gained by critics of software patents that young judges at the Karlsruhe - based appeals court considered it a progressive move to fit in with European Patent Office case law and to interpret the non-patentability of computer programs " as such " accordingly .
In a practice which has proved highly controversial , the EPO has long granted patents for " computer - implemented inventions " .
Last year a German appeal court judgement concerned patent rights for a " control system for investigative modalities " ;
The judges found that the key issue for whether a patent should be granted was " whether the method seen as a whole serves to solve a specific technical problem which goes beyond data processing . "

If 93 per cent of single ' resident parents ' after marriage breakdown are women , what are the consequences for generations of children now growing up without a father ?
The third film in this unique series about the experience of parents in the Family Courts looks behind the statistic that half of all contact orders are broken .
If 93 per cent of single ' resident parents ' after marriage breakdown are women , what are the long - term consequences for generations of children now growing up without a father ?
The effects , particularly for boys , can be far - reaching , and the concluding film in this anniversary series on the working of the Children
Act follows the search of two young men to fill the gap .
With the courts ' current focus on mothers ' welfare , sometimes at the expense of fathers ' continued contact with their kids , are the parents to blame ?
Or is family law failing fathers , and the Children Act failing our children ?
As Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats negotiate with David Cameron 's Conservatives over the ramifications of the hung parliament , the question of proportional representation has come up - especially for the demonstrators from Take Back Parliament .
New figures from the Electoral Reform Society examine exactly how well each party would have done under different systems of PR : Alternative Vote ( AV ) , Alternative vote plus and Single Transferable Vote ( STV ) .
Interestingly they show that under AV - the system being negotiated and which Gordon Brown and Labour have already pledged a referendum over - the Lib Dems would only increase their seats to 79 .
UPDATE : AV plus figures have been added to the dataset and table below .
UPDATE : As several posters have noted below , this is hardly an exact science .
If it helps , here 's the methodology from the ERS summarised :
• Our simulations should be regarded as illustrative … the picture they give is necessarily a rough one .
• We have assumed that votes cast on 6 May would have been ' first preferences ' .
[ But ] there was a considerable amount of tactical voting … secondly many people would not have voted for their preferred party on the grounds they could not win ( for this reason the simulations probably underestimate support for the Green Party )
• AV and STV use preference voting ( i.e. voters can rank candidates in order of preference ) .
In our models we have used the second preference data of a ComRes poll of 26 April 2010 ( fieldwork on 24/25 April 2010 ) .
This data , however , has a number of shortcomings when it comes to estimating how votes for smaller parties might transfer , and has obvious difficulties in Scotland and Wales …
In the great majority of seats the simulated outcome is not particularly sensitive to the accuracy of the assumptions made on transfers .
• The polling data suggests that many voters would not wish to express a second preference , and consequently the impact of AV is not as great as other simulations have suggested .
• Our modelling of STV has used constituencies electing 3 , 4 or 5 MPs .
I 've pasted it in full in the comments field below - or you can get more info direct from the ERS .
The regional breakdown is below - and we should be able to get constituency - level breakdown later today .

I 've uploaded a package named heaps to Hackage that provides Brodal - Okasaki bootstrapped skew - binomial heaps in Haskell .
The main features of the library are that it provides a nice containers - like API with provably asymptotically optimal functional heap operations including O ( 1 ) insert and O ( 1 ) union , and that the library design jump through a number of hoops to provide implementations of common Haskell typeclasses such as Foldable , Data and Typeable .
As our telescopes grow more powerful , astronomers are uncovering objects that defy conventional wisdom .
The latest example is the discovery of a planet - like object circling a brown dwarf .
It 's the right size for a planet , estimated to be 5 - 10 times the mass of Jupiter .
But the object formed in less than 1 million years -- the approximate age of the brown dwarf -- and much faster than the predicted time it takes to build planets according to some theories .
Kamen Todorov of Penn State University and co-investigators used the keen eyesight of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gemini Observatory to directly image the companion of the brown dwarf , which was uncovered in a survey of 32 young brown dwarfs in the Taurus star - forming region .
Brown dwarfs are objects that typically are tens of times the mass of Jupiter and are too small to sustain nuclear fusion to shine as stars do .
The mystery object orbits the nearby brown dwarf at a separation of approximately 2.25 billion miles ( 3.6 billion kilometers -- which is between the distances of Saturn and Uranus from the Sun ) .
The team 's research is being published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
There has been a lot of discussion in the context of the Pluto debate over how small an object can be and still be called a planet .
This new observation addresses the question at the other end of the size spectrum :
How small can an object be and still be a brown dwarf rather than a planet ?
This new companion is within the range of masses observed for planets around stars -- less than 15 Jupiter masses .
But should it be called a planet ?
The answer is strongly connected to the mechanism by which the companion most likely formed .
There are three possible formation scenarios :
Dust in a circumstellar disk slowly agglomerates to form a rocky planet 10 times larger than Earth , which then accumulates a large gaseous envelope ; a lump of gas in the disk quickly collapses to form an object the size of a gas giant planet ; or , rather than forming in a disk , a companion forms directly from the collapse of the vast cloud of gas and dust in the same manner as a star ( or brown dwarf ) .
If the last scenario is correct , then this discovery demonstrates that planetary - mass bodies can be made through the same mechanism that builds stars .
This is the likely solution because the companion is too young to have formed by the first scenario , which is very slow .
The second mechanism occurs rapidly , but the disk around the central brown dwarf probably did not contain enough material to make an object with a mass of 5 - 10 Jupiter masses .
" The most interesting implication of this result is that it shows that the process that makes binary stars extends all the way down to planetary masses .
So it appears that nature is able to make planetary - mass companions through two very different mechanisms , " says team member Kevin Luhman of the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University .
If the mystery companion formed through cloud collapse and fragmentation , as stellar binary systems do , then it is not a planet by definition because planets build up inside disks .
The mass of the companion is estimated by comparing its brightness to the luminosities predicted by theoretical evolutionary models for objects at various masses for an age of 1 millon years .
Further supporting evidence comes from the presence of a very nearby binary system that contains a small red star and a brown dwarf .
Luhman thinks that all four objects may have formed in the same cloud collapse , making this in actuality a quadruple system .
" The configuration closely resembles quadruple star systems , suggesting that all of its components formed like stars , " says Luhman .
Smithsonian ’s Global Volcanism Program has been following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull .
Elizabeth Cottrell , a geologist at the National Museum of Natural History , spoke with Smithsonian magazine ’s Erica R. Hendry about the nature of the volcano and the possible consequences of its eruption .
Could you give us a sense of how big this volcano is ?
And how long could the eruption go on ?
I would say we do n’t know how long the eruption could go on .
The last eruption started in 1821 and went until 1823 .
This volcano is not one of the well - known volcanic centers of Iceland .
Its neighbors — Katla , Hekla , Krafla — those are what we think of as the major volcanic centers of Iceland .
It just happens to be that the ash from this volcano is going over a very populated area with a lot of heavy air travel .
That just goes to show that you can still cause a lot of havoc to humans even with a volcano like this .
The thing that makes this an interesting eruption is it ’s not " effusive , " meaning it ’s not strictly a runny lava coming out like we often see in Hawaii .
It ’s an explosive eruption .
An eight - point scale called the “ volcanic explosivity index “ ( VEI ) allows you to compare eruptions and volcanoes .
A firm number wo n't be assigned for some time , but so far , about 110 million cubic meters of tephra have been ejected during this eruption , and the plume has gone about nine kilometers into the air , so that ’s a VEI of 4 .
For reference , the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo in the Philippines had a VEI equal to 6 .
Could the eruption set off other volcanoes nearby ?
In the historical record , when Eyjafjallajökull has erupted , Katla has also erupted .
The nature of eruption triggering , though , is not well understood .
I do n’t think anyone is going to definitely predict right now that Katla will erupt .
The historical record would be the only reason to suspect that , but right now I do n’t think there are signs of unrest at Katla .
How is Smithsonian ’s Global Volcanism Program keeping track of the Icelandic volcano ?
The Global Volcanism Program documents eruptive histories for all known active volcanoes on the planet for which we can document physical information , such as the VEI , eruption durations and dates .
You can go to Eyjafjallajökull on the program ’s web page right now and get the history of this volcano .
It is the first place people go to find the basic information about a volcano .
We have a network of individuals around the world who send us information .
Our scientists here compile that information , and we have someone stationed here from the USGS Volcano Hazards Program who puts out a weekly report of eruptive activity all over the globe .
A subset of this information gets compiled into the volcano reference file , which is a database of all active volcanoes globally .
The Global Volcanism Program has been in operation since 1968 and we look back at least 10,000 years on a global scale — we call any volcano “ active ” if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years .
How many volcanoes erupt in a year , and how many of those cause problems for people ?
About 70 , is our standard answer .
In the last ten years , there was a low of 64 in 2001 and 2003 .
There was a high of 78 in 2008 .
There are 20 to 30 active at any given time .
That does not include seafloor volcanoes that are erupting all the time , because hundreds of volcanoes on the seafloor may be erupting at any given minute .
Locally , probably all volcanoes cause problems for people .
In Iceland , for example , the glacier that sits atop Eyjafjallajökull is melting , which is causing catastrophic flooding in Iceland .
The Soufrière Hills eruption in the Caribbean caused an evacuation of the entire island of Montserrat ; that ’s in the recent memory of the public .
You can look at Hawaii right now .
Ongoing eruptions there shut down roads all the time .
I think Eyjafjallajökull is unprecedented in terms of the scope of the air travel shutdown .
In other cases , there have been isolated incidents of planes going down or losing power due to a volcanic ash cloud , especially in Indonesia , but because of the location of the volcano , Eyjafjallajökull seems to be an unprecedented event in terms of global , far - reaching consequences .
Ed Roberts died today in Georgia at the age of 68 .
The development of the personal computer was too collaborative for any one person to deserve the honor of being the father of the indus try ... but as I think about it , I can't think of anyone with a better claim on the title than Roberts .
He may not have invented the PC , but he surely invented the PC industry .
Roberts cofounded MITS in Albuquerque in 1969 and served as its president .
The company made rocket kits at first , and then calculators , and was struggling when Roberts made the decision to launch the Altair 8800 , the first PC to gain any traction .
When it appeared on the front cover of Popular Electronics magazine 's January 1975 issue , a couple of young geeks got so excited by the issue they picked up at Harvard Square 's Out of Town News that they wrote a version of the BASIC programming language for it even though they did n't have an Altair .
They relocated to Albuquerque and ended up founding a company to write software for the system .
The geeks were Bill Gates and Paul Allen , and they called their company Micro - Soft .
The Altair also inspired the founding of Silicon Valley 's legendary Homebrew Computer Club , whose membership included numerous important PC - industry figures -- including Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , who started their own computer company to compete with MITS in 1976 .
MITS ' dominance of the PC business was brief ( by 1977 , when the Apple II , Radio Shack TRS - 80 , and Commodore PET came out , the Altair already felt like a machine from an earlier era ) .
But in many ways the business model that sprung up around MITS ' computers -- including clones , upgrades , peripherals , books and magazines , computer stores , Intel processors , and Microsoft software -- lives on to this day .
In 1977 , Roberts sold MITS and returned to his boyhood home state of Georgia , where he eventually fulfilled a longtime dream by earning a medical degree and becoming a country doctor .
I asked David Bunnell , who was VP of marketing at MITS and went on to found PC Magazine , PC World , and Macworld , among other businesses , to remember his friend and colleague :
In my mind , Ed Roberts will always be the Father of the Personal Computer Industry .
Whether the Altair was the first PC or not is n't that material , what really matters is Ed launched the most dynamic , fastest growing industry the world has ever seen .
There would be no Apple , no Google , no Facebook without his initial contribution .
And for me , personally , he taught me all about the excitement and rewards of being an entrepreneur .
And here 's a statement from Bill Gates and Paul Allen .

Eric
Walter , le secrétaire général de la Haute Autorité pour la diffusion des œuvres et la protection des droits sur Internet ( Hadopi ) , a confirmé , lundi 3 mai , lors d'une conférence de presse , que l'Hadopi serait opérationelle " fin juin " , sur au moins une partie de ses missions , notamment l'envoi de courriels aux internautes .
Le recrutement des premiers agents de la Haute Autorité – à terme , 50 à 70 personnes – est en cours .
L'interconnexion entre les systèmes informatiques des ayants droit et ceux des fournisseurs d'accès à Internet devrait être opérationnelle fin juin .
La CNIL ( Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ) devrait rendre son avis sur le projet à la même époque .
Et le gouvernement devait également publier à la fin du mois de juin les derniers décrets d'application nécessaires au fonctionnement de l'Hadopi , notamment celui qui définira l'infraction de " négligence caractérisée " .
L'Hadopi ne sanctionnera en effet pas directement le téléchargement illégal , mais plutôt la " négligence " du titulaire d'une connexion à Internet , qui aurait insuffisamment surveillé ou protégé sa connexion pour empêcher quelqu 'un de s'en servir pour télécharger illégalement .
Pourront donc être sanctionnés tout aussi bien un téléchargeur qu'une personne qui n'aurait pas verrouillé son accès à Internet sans fil , laissant ainsi la possibilité à un tiers d'utiliser la connexion de manière illégale .
" Le cœur d'Hadopi , ce ne sont pas les pirates , qui pourront toujours faire l'objet de poursuites en contrefaçon " , précise Mireille Imbert - Quaretta , la présidente de la Commission de la protection des droits .
C'est à cette commission - clé de la Haute Autorité – " le bras armé " , ironise sa présidente – qu'échoira la tâche de décider quels dossiers seront transmis à la justice , au terme de la procédure de riposte graduée .
RÉSEAUX DE P2P SURVEILLÉS EN PRIORITÉ
Dans un premier temps , l'internaute suspecté de télécharger illégalement recevra un simple courriel d'avertissement , suivi d'une lettre en recommandé en cas de récidive .
La troisième fois , son dossier pourra être transmis au parquet , qui décidera ou non de poursuivre , et pourra ordonner la coupure de la connexion Internet .
" A tout moment , l'internaute sera tenu informé , et pourra présenter des éléments pour sa défense .
Il pourra même demander à être auditionné , en compagnie de son avocat s'il le souhaite " , précise Jacques Toubon , membre du collège de l'Hadopi .
La commission de protection des droits tranchera ensuite .
Le " repérage " des internautes se fera par le biais d'agents assermentés , mandatés par les sociétés d'ayants droit , comme la société Trident Media Guard .
Ce sont eux qui repèreront les adresses IP ( Internet Protocol ) sur les réseaux d'échanges de fichiers , et qui les transmettront à l'Hadopi .
Si la Haute Autorité assure que les réseaux P2P ne seront pas les seuls surveillés , il semble pour l'heure techniquement impossible d'assurer la surveillance d'autres moyens de téléchargement illégal , notamment le téléchargement direct .
" Ce n'est pas à l'Hadopi qu'il faut poser cette question ; c'est aux ayants droit et à leurs prestataires techniques " , estime Jacques Toubon .
Outre la mise en place du volet répressif , la Haute Autorité devrait également lancer dans les semaines prochaines une série de missions de prospective .
Eric
Walter souhaite en effet que l'Hadopi soit " force de proposition et d'innovation " , avec six groupes de travail – baptisés " labs " – dédiés à des thématiques comme les usages en ligne ou l'économie numérique de la création , qui seront dirigés par des experts extérieurs à l'Hadopi .
La Haute Autorité mise aussi largement sur la communication pour faire passer un message qu'elle veut " essentiellement pédagogique " .
Des ateliers de sensibilisation en direction des professionnels sont prévus pour juin , ou encore un compte Twitter ( @InsidOpi ) ainsi qu'un nouveau logo , le précédent ayant été largement critiqué parce qu'il utilisait une police de caractères sans l'autorisation de ses créateurs .
" Nous sommes conscients d'être dans un monde en évolution permanente , juge Eric Walter .
Notre méthode sera faite de proximité et de recherche du contact avec les internautes . "
Avec un bémol toutefois :
" Nous serons toujours ouverts au dialogue , jamais à la polémique . "
Les polémiques autour de la Haute Autorité semblent pourtant loin d'être terminées .

Being killed in a peacekeeping mission apparently depends on your nationality , at least if you 're a soldier in the Spanish army .
On the 1st of February 2010 the Colombian soldier John Felipe Romero serving in the Spanish army was killed in a terrorist attack in Afghanistan .
It was then made public that so far 43 % of the Spanish troops killed in attacks by local forces in Afghanistan and Lebanon have been foreigners .
This is in striking contrast to the fact that foreign nationals make up only 7 % of the Spanish army as a whole .
The two figures 43 % and 7 % have been repeatedly highlighted in the Spanish newspapers since Romero 's death .
Assuming that the probability of being exposed to an attack is independent of nationality , the gap between the figures is surprising .
A possible explanation is that the proportion of foreigners in military missions abroad is far greater than in the army as a whole .
Perhaps foreign nationals like to sign up to risky operative units because they offer higher salaries , as has been suggested by the General Director of Recruitment of the Spanish army in an interview to El País .
Or maybe it is because military work in a conflict zone is an unpopular job preferably left to immigrants , as was suggested by the Spanish soldier Rubén López on the same page in the same newspaper .
But in the absence of further information , what can a foreign national about to enter the Spanish army infer from the published figures ?
What are the chances of dying on a mission in Afghanistan or Lebanon for a soldier from , say , Madrid , Colombia , compared to a soldier from Madrid , Spain ?
Recalling high - school mathematics lessons , the soldier could proceed as follows .
Write for the total number of soldiers in the Spanish army .
Since 7 out of 100 soldiers are foreigners , the total number of foreigners in the army is .
Now write for the number of soldiers that have been killed on a mission , irrespective of their origin .
Then is the number of foreigners among the dead - this corresponds to the disasterous 43 % .
Putting this together shows that the proportion of foreigners killed on a mission is
That is , the proportion of dead among the foreigners is over six times higher than the proportionof dead within the whole army .
To compare this with the proportion for the native population , notice that of the army are Spanish nationals , and that of the dead are Spanish .
By the same reasoning as above , we get
for the proportion of Spaniards killed on a mission .
That is , the proportion of Spaniards being killed is just 61 % of the overall proportion of dead soldiers .
How does the proportion of dead among foreigners compare to that for Spanish nationals ?
To find out , we take the quotient of the two :
So the proportion of dead among the foreigners is around ten times higher than the proportion of dead among Spaniards .
What does all this tell our prospective soldier about his or her prospects in the Spanish army ?
If these proportions , or frequencies , are interpreted as probabilities , that is if we take the current situation as a sign of things to come , then our result says that the probability of our foreign soldier dying on a mission is ten times the probability of his Spanish colleague dying on a mission .
In fact , our calculation above is an application of the celebrated Bayes ’ theorem ( published in 1764 ) .
Write for the ( unknown ) probability of a soldier dying , irrespective of nationality , and for the probability of a soldier picked at random being a foreign national .
Then the 43 % figure corresponds to the conditional probability of a soldier being foreign given that he or she has been killed - we have
In accordance with our calculation above , Bayes ' theorem says that
whereis the conditional probability of dying given that you are foreign .
Writingfor the probability of being Spanish and applying Bayes ' theorem again , we get the corresponding result
Our calculations are valid for any immigrant soldier , whether on a mission or not , comparing him or herself to any Spanish soldier .
But what about a foreign soldier already on a mission , comparing him or herself to fellow Spanish soldiers also on a mission ?
Our results remain valid if the troops that are sent abroad preserve the distribution of foreigners in the whole army — that is , if 7 % of troops abroad are foreigners .
In this case our immigrant soldier on the mission is ten times more likely to be killed than a Spaniard on a mission .
This enormous difference would have to be explained by local matters related to missions abroad .
However , it may be that the percentage is not preserved , and that the difference in odds is explained by a similar difference in the probabilities of being sent abroad .
Unfortunately , the percentage of immigrants in missions has not been published so far , so we cannot say which of the two it is .
A revolutionary contribution of mathematics to human culture was the recognition that logic can make reliable quantitative predictions about the unknown future .
In a very democratic sense , mathematics offers anyone a mathematical crystal ball to unveil the future from information generated in the past .
Our soldier 's analysis has revealed the distressing truth that his probability to die in a Spanish mission is ten times higher than that of a Spanish soldier .
It seems very unlikely that this fact is mentioned in his contract , or reflected in his salary .

Entrepreneurs are taking advantage of locust swarms sweeping northern Victoria , with one Mildura cafe offering a locust pizza to patrons .
Authorities say the swarms are among the biggest seen in northern Victoria in 30 years .
In the Mallee , the insects are plastered across the front of vehicles forced to drive through locust clouds .
The idea for the pizza was the brainchild of Mayor Glenn Milne , who rounded up the insects and trapped them in a garbage bag .
" You can't stop finding them when they get killed on your car , but it 's another story when you get out on the oval and try to catch them , " he said .
Mildura car wash operator Jeff Becker says his business has quadrupled as motorists try to keep their windscreens clean .
" The bugs do n't care , they 'll just get on your car , " he said .
" Does n't matter who you are , what you drive . "
The swarms are not such good news for farmers because the locusts are feasting on early - sown crops .
The pests are also causing problems for footballers , lawn bowlers and golfers who are having to play on through clouds of locusts attacking any grassed playing surface .
a ) installed the spying software
b ) never informed the students or parents about it
c ) never checked with any attorneys or legal authorities to see if it was legal to use such software
d ) the IT director took the 5th during their deposition , even though she had n't been directly charged with anything , and even when asked whether she had downloaded pics of the kids on her home computer
e ) activated it ( at least ) 42 times , in one case even sending the police to the wrong house :
As a prime example , we initially attempted to recover a stolen laptop that reported back to us it 's internet address and DNS name .
The police went to the house and were befuddled to find out the people we knew had the laptop was not the family that lived there ... well , we eventually found out that they were the neighboring house and were borrowing the unsecured WI - FI .
Well , guess what ?
Lower Merion report : Web cams snapped 56,000 images
Lower Merion School District employees activated the web cameras and tracking software on laptops they gave to high school students about 80 times in the past two school years , snapping nearly 56,000 images that included photos of students , pictures inside their homes and copies of the programs or files running on their screens , district investigators have concluded .
... in at least five instances , school employees let the Web cams keep clicking for days or weeks after students found their missing laptops , according to the review .
Those computers - programmed to snap a photo and capture a screen shot every 15 minutes when the machine was on - fired nearly 13,000 images back to the school district servers .
Of course , the school -- which initially denied that the system existed , then denied using it , and then claimed that it had " only " been used 42 times ( although , of course , they never said how long the surveillance was kept running after those activations ) now claims that :
" none [ of the photos ] appeared to show " salacious or inappropriate " images
Oh .
Well , I guess he must be telling the truth this time .
About 38,500 images ... came from six laptops that were reported missing from the Harriton High School gymnasium in September 2008 ...
The next biggest chunk of images stem from the five or so laptops where employees failed or forgot to turn off the tracking software even after the student recovered the computer .
In a few other cases , Hockeimer said , the team has been unable to recover images or photos stored by the tracking system ....
And in about 15 activations , investigators have been unable to identify exactly why a student 's laptop was being monitored .
Hockeimer said that the investigation found that administrators activated the tracking system for just one student this year who failed to pay the $ 55 insurance fee .
...
But the requests were loose and disorganized , he said , sometimes amounting to just an brief e-mail .
" The whole situation was riddled with the problem of not having any written policies and procedures in place , " Hockeimer said .
" And that impacted so much of what happened here . "
And this is just what the DISTRICT'S lawyer and investigation are admitting .
I can't begin to fathom what the objective investigation by the FBI and county prosecutors will reveal .
Update : I linked to this guys ' blog when I posted about the story back in February , and felt it a good idea to re-post it again ; he 's an IT security pro who 's done a stellar job of analyzing the dirty underbelly of this whole story .
A few choice cuts :
The Spy at Harriton High
The primary piece of evidence , already being reported on by a Fox affiliate , is this amazing promotional webcast for a remote monitoring product named LANRev .
In it , Mike Perbix identifies himself as a high school network tech , and then speaks at length about using the track - and - monitor features of LanRev to take surreptitious remote pictures through a high school laptop webcam .
A note of particular pride is evident in his voice when he talks about finding a way outside of LANRev to enable " curtain mode " , a special remote administration mode that makes remote control of a laptop invisible to the victim .
...
Perbix discusses methods for remotely resetting the firmware lockout used to prevent jailbreaking of student laptops .
A jailbreak would have allowed students to monitor their own webcam to determine if administrators were truly taking pictures or if , as the school administration claimed , the blinking webcams were just " a glitch . " ...
This script allows for the camera to appear shut down to user applications such as Photo Booth but still function via remote administration : " what this does is prevent internal use of the iSight , but some utilities might still work ( for instance an external application using it for Theft tracking "
What 's the purpose of shutting down a camera for the user of the laptop but still making it available to network administrators ?
Ask yourself : if you wanted to convince someone that a webcam blinking was a glitch , would disabling the cameras help make your case ?
...
In a strange twist , the makers of LANRev have come out with a statement saying that school network techs should never have used their software to engage in theft recovery : " We discourage any customer from taking theft recovery into their own hands , " said Stephen Midgley , the company 's head of marketing , in an interview Monday .
" That 's best left in the hands of professionals . "
Here 's the actual webcast that Mike Perbix , the Lower Merion IT guy who installed and administered the whole surveillance system , made in which he openly bragged about his capabilities :
And here 's an excerpt from PBS 's " Digital Nation " in which an unrelated school administrator does a live demonstration of how this sort of software works :
Two of Sunday ’s polls have already been released – a new poll by ComRes for the Sunday Mirror has topline figures of CON 31 % ( - 4 ) , LAB 27 % ( - 2 ) , LDEM 29 % ( +8 ) .
This was conducted yesterday and today , and is very much in line with the YouGov figures yesterday , showing a surge in support for the Liberal Democrats following the leaders ’ debate , pushing them ahead of Labour into second place .
There is also new ICM poll in the Sunday Telegraph which has topline figures of CON 34 % ( - 3 ) , LAB 29 % ( - 2 ) , LDEM 27 % ( +7 ) .
The fieldwork dates are very interesting here – Wednesday and Thursday .
The Sunday Telegraph article says the “ majority ” of the fieldwork was done before the debate , I can only assume it was a large majority , unless ICM do their fieldwork quite late at night !
Anyway , most of the shift in ICM ’s poll ca n’t be attributed to the effect of the debate , but rather the publicity around the Lib Dem manifesto launch ( remember YouGov ’s poll immediately before the debate also showed a 4 point jump for the Lib Dems on the back of their manifesto ) .
In both cases ( as well as You Gov yesterday ) both of the main parties have declined as the Lib Dems have surged , but in all cases the Conservatives have lost more support than Labour .

Where the Buffalo Roam and Bruce Robinson 's forthcoming The Rum Diary all feature lead characters based on the late Hunter S Thompson .
Now the original gonzo reporter looks set to get a fresh turn on the big screen after one of his final written works was optioned by Hollywood .
And this time he has a sidekick .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , Prisoner of Denver will be based on a Vanity Fair article from June 2004 , which was co-written by Thompson and the magazine 's contributing editor Mark Seal , a long - term fan who grabbed a late opportunity to work with his idol .
The piece highlighted the plight of 21 - year - old Lisl Auman , a Colorado woman who was convicted of murder despite being handcuffed in the back of a police car when one of her arresting officers was shot and killed by an accomplice .
Thompson became involved in the case through his Fourth Amendment Foundation , an organisation the writer helped set up to assist victims in defending themselves against unwarranted search and seizure .
Auman , who served seven years in jail before her conviction was overturned by the Colorado supreme court in 2005 , began writing to Thompson while behind bars .
Her new pen-pal enlisted celebrity friends such as Johnny Depp , Jack Nicholson , Benicio del Toro and Woody Harrelson to help bring her case to public attention .
Thompson committed suicide in February 2005 , just a month before Auman 's release .
Seal was contacted by Thompson after writing a piece about Aspen in Colorado .
He soon found himself entering his hero 's gonzo world of skinheads , speed freaks and angry cops .
" My first day I was in a female correctional institution , saying a line I had been waiting my entire life to say : ' Hunter Thompson sent me , ' " Seal told the Hollywood Reporter .
" He made being a reporter glamorous and exciting in the 1970s .
It was one of the best experiences in my whole journalistic career , and it was one of the best causes of his life . "
The paper reports that the Motion Picture Corporation of America has picked up the rights to Prisoner of Denver .
The plan is to commission a writer to develop a story centred on Thompson and Seal as a sort of " gonzo Woodward and Bernstein " .
No casting has yet been announced .
Depp played a version of Thompson named Raoul Duke in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , and will also appear as Thompson substitute Paul Kemp in The Rum Diary , based on the writer 's experiences at a Puerto Rican sports newspaper in the late 50s .
Bill Murray played Thompson in 1980's
Where the Buffalo Roam .
Six thousand deaths over the last decade could have been avoided if Americans drank less soda and sugary beverages , according to an analysis from the University of California , San Francisco .
The analysis found that America 's growing sweet drink addiction has taken a hefty toll through health outcomes such as heart disease and diabetes and via higher health care costs .
Diana Ray of Danville , Ky. , is familiar with the negative effects of soda addiction .
Since she retired from her job as a registered nurse , Ray 's consumption of soda steadily inched upward until she was drinking five to eight cans a day -- as much as an extra 1,200 extra calories and 328 grams of added sugar .
" I always have a Pepsi open on the table next to the bed , when I 'm in bed in the morning with my coffee , " Ray said .
" It 's an addiction . "
An expensive addiction , Ray added , as the household goes through a 24 - pack every other day , which adds up at $ 7 a pop .
But Ray 's biggest motivation for quitting is rescuing her health and well - being : Since she switched from diet to regular soda she has put on 30 pounds , which is " horrifying " to her , especially because diabetes runs in her family .
The new analysis , presented Friday at the American Heart Association 's 50th Annual Conference on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention , offers a picture of just how horrifying the damage done by excess consumption of sugary drinks can be .
Using a computer model and data from the Framingham Heart Study , the Nurses Health Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , researchers estimated that the escalating consumption between 1990 and 2000 of soda and sugar - sweetened beverages , which they abbreviated as " SSBs , " led to 75,000 new cases of diabetes and 14,000 new cases of coronary heart disease .
What 's more , the burden of the diseases translated into $ 300 million to $ 550 million increase in health care costs between 2000 and 2010 .
The model is " really important because it gives us a big picture that might serve as a more effective impetus for health policies to curb consumption , " said Dr. Litsa Lambrakos , lead author and internal medicine resident at the University of California , San Francisco .

No Logo : 10th Anniversary Edition , by Naomi Klein , Picador , 544 pages , $ 16
Reading old works of journalism is like looking at old photographs , serving as a useful reminder that politics has its own fads and fashions that years later seem as incomprehensible as muttonchops or leisure suits .
For the politically engaged , it can be embarrassing to be reminded of the forgotten fears that once loomed so large , the abandoned fights that at the time seemed so stridently important .
Recently , the 10 - year anniversary edition of Naomi Klein 's No Logo appeared in bookstores , complete with a new introduction by Klein herself .
Originally released in early 2000 , No Logo was an impeccably timed report on a growing youth movement that was rising up in response to the new - world - order agenda of liberalized trade , corporate outsourcing , and political deregulation that became known as " globalization . "
Klein's writing caught the wave of anti-globalization protests that swept across the planet a decade ago , beginning with the massive and violent demonstrations against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in November 1999 .
Almost immediately , wherever world leaders gathered — international economic conferences , G8 summits , trade negotiations — they would be met with street protests and a parallel meeting of the planet 's angry marginalia , including counterculturalists , environmentalists , socialists , labor organizations , and human rights activists .
No Logo was quickly adopted as the movement 's bible and , along with Nalgene water bottles and khaki cargo pants , became an essential part of the general - issue battle kit for campus lefties .
What are we to make of No Logo a decade on ?
It remains a passionate and ambitious snapshot of the newly globalized youth and consumer culture at the end of the 20th century .
It is also an often infuriating work of agitprop that marries old Marxist prejudices about the market economy to a paranoid and conspiratorial account of the business of advertising .
If that was all there was to the book , it would be enough to dismiss it as a period piece , the journalistic equivalent to a box of old Polaroids .
Sweatshops , the McLibel trial , Brent Spar …were n't those the days ?
But that would be a mistake , since it would miss the way in which , in its quest to undermine the branded economy and expose the capitalist propaganda that motivates all advertising , No Logo inadvertently served as the most influential marketing manual of the decade .
The organizing conceit of No Logo is the notion that the American economy has stopped making things and is now focused on managing brands .
Where once a corporation might have employed domestic workers to make its jeans or sneakers or computers , now companies such as Tommy Hilfiger or Nike or Dell simply market their brand images while outsourcing the manufacturing to low - cost factories overseas .
The power this gives to corporations is enormous , and we find ourselves at the whim of these brand bullies .
Why " bullies " ?
Klein 's case against brands comes at them from two angles .
The first is the way that brands — and commercial advertising in general — have come to dominate our mental environment .
Brands , she says , have co-opted popular culture and colonized our sense of self .
Forget about your education or your job , your church or your family ; what matters to your social status and personal identity in North America today is the brands you consume .
The second aspect has to do with the erosion of public space and the political sphere .
The financial power they get from their brands has given corporations a great deal of political leverage , Klein argues , which they use to bend national governments to their will , forcing them to drop trade barriers , lower taxes , deregulate markets , and eliminate environmental protections .
Take these two arguments together , and we are left with a world where corporations , not governments , rule , and where consumerism has almost entirely displaced citizenship .
We are modern - day serfs , nearly helpless in the face of the power of these feudal brand lords .
Nearly helpless , but not entirely .
The corporation 's greatest strength is also its biggest weakness , and much of No Logo is devoted to documenting the ways small groups of committed activists retaliated by turning the power of the brand back on itself .
But 10 years later , the rule of the brand is more entrenched than ever , largely thanks to lessons learned from a close reading of No Logo .
The book devotes a great deal of attention to the various strategies of anti-brand activism that were coming into play at the time .
Joining the old - school consumer boycott were newfangled techniques such as guerrilla marketing , culture jamming ( ad parodies , basically ) , and Reclaim the Streets initiatives aimed at reversing the " commodification and criminalization of street culture . "
However edgy or subversive these strategies once might have seemed , every single one is now a standard part of the tool kit of every advertising agency and brand manager .
You think culture jamming is subversive ?
Kenneth Cole has been jamming its own advertising for years , embroidering its campaigns with slogans and quotations addressing topics such as AIDS , homelessness , gun control , and same - sex marriage .
Guerrilla marketing might once have been a cool way of getting attention for your alternative band or performance - art installation , but today , thanks to the viral capabilities of Twitter and YouTube , the technique is used to sell everything from fried chicken to the latest Hollywood blockbuster .
And what of the Reclaim the Streets party that Klein held up as emblematic of all that was good and true about the movement ?
It 's still going strong , and it now involves such activities as pillow fights on Bay Street in Toronto , epic games of kick the can in Brooklyn , and mobile dance parties on London 's public transit .
It has been rebranded the Urban Playground Movement , and its incredible popularity has attracted the attention of corporate sponsors such as Red Bull and T - Mobile , which are dying to associate themselves with such a hip scene .
Klein certainly recognizes how much things have changed during the last decade .
She even opens her new introduction with two telling examples .
The first is Absolut Vodka , which in 2009 launched a bottle with no label or logo , to " manifest the idea , that no matter what 's on the outside , it 's the inside that really matters . "
Then there 's Starbucks , which has tried recently to return to its coffeehouse roots by opening a handful of unbranded stores .
As Klein wryly observes , " The techniques of branding have both thrived and adapted since I published No Logo . "
Yet while Klein is tempted to interpret these examples as cases of companies trying to escape their own brands , the truth is a bit more subtle .
What both Absolut and Starbucks are trying to do here is position themselves as brands that are delivering honesty , integrity , and self - fulfillment .
They are selling not just vodka or coffee but also authenticity , which is ironic , given that one of the things that No Logo found so unpleasant about the contemporary brandscape was how inauthentic it was .
All brands are built around a unique promise or selling proposition , but as Klein argued , whatever a brand is supposed to stand for , it has little to do with the material facts of how the product is manufactured .
Nike 's " Just Do It " pledge of individual achievement and Apple 's attitude of hip nonconformity could mask sweatshops , communities damaged by outsourcing , or an exploited environment .
The anti-corporate activism chronicled in No Logo used this gap between what a brand promised to consumers and how its corporate parent actually behaved to perform a bit of public relations jiu - jitsu .
When their bad faith was revealed to the world , the economic strength of the brand bullies became a major liability .
The need to preserve shareholder value forced companies such as Shell and Nike to get their act together and make sure their corporate deeds aligned with their marketing froth .
A decade on , there is no question who won that fight .
From eco- to organic , fair trade to locally sourced , sweatshop safe to dolphin friendly , sales pitches that 10 years ago would have reeked of patchouli oil and set the red baiters on full alert are now thoroughly mainstream .
Companies like Whole Foods ( and its quarterly " 5 Percent Day , " when each location donates 5 percent of its net sales to a nonprofit ) or the Vermont - based Seventh Generation ( a natural soap and detergent company devoted to all forms of sustainability , whose co-founder and executive chairman is known as the " inspired protagonist " of the firm ) are massively successful operations .
Virtually every marketing book published in the past few years , from Martin Lindstrom 's Buyology to James Gilmore and Joseph Pine 's Authenticity : What Consumers Really Want , has stressed the primacy of authenticity as a selling point .
Everyone agrees that the quest for authenticity is the contemporary advertising equivalent of the search for the Holy Grail , and being able to play the authenticity game is now a fundamental requirement of marketing , the standard against which all brand strategies are judged .
At this point you might expect Naomi Klein to raise her arms and declare victory .
The days when Shell , McDonald 's , Nike , and others could bigfoot around the planet while ignoring their public responsibilities are gone , their behavior transformed , thanks to the efforts of a relatively small but highly vocal , motivated , and intelligent group of connected activists .
The taming of the brand bullies is all the proof you need that corporations do n't own brands ; consumers do .
Yet Klein is not happy .
In a remarkably self - aware passage toward the end of No Logo , she points out that there has to be more to environmentalism than an Energy Saver sticker on your computer monitor and more to social justice than a Fair Trade logo on your coffee mug .
If all politics becomes absorbed into consumer politics , she warns , you end up with the wholesale privatization of what was once the democratic responsibility of the public sphere .
That is why Klein is so unappreciative of what would appear to be a great triumph for her side .
Her goal was never merely to change corporate behavior .
It was to change the entire economic system .
As she sees it , the newfound emphasis on selling authenticity is just further evidence of capitalism 's ability to co-opt dissent and exploit seemingly subversive niches .
Reform is always the enemy of revolution , and any change that maintains the overall status quo is to be viewed with suspicion .
Writing about branding was only an excuse to talk about politics , and what led Klein to re-engage with the discourse of marketing after 10 years was the emergence of Barack Obama , the first U.S. president who is also a " superbrand . "
In the new introduction to No Logo , Klein denounces Obama as little more than a neocon who has wrapped himself in the branding of truly transformative political movements .
Shamelessly helping itself to the iconography of Che Guevara , the rhetorical cadences of Martin Luther King , and the " Yes We Can " slogan of Latin American migrant workers , the Obama brand is just as hollow and inauthentic , as far as Klein is concerned , as the corporate brands she X - rayed a decade before .
Whenever possible , she alleges , Obama " favors the grand symbolic gesture over deep structural change . "
He was happy to play the role of the " anti-war , anti–Wall Street party crasher " when running for the Democratic nomination , but promptly cut bipartisan deals " with crazed Republicans once in the White House . "
You can see where Klein is going with this .
In No Logo , she argued that it is simply not enough for anti-brand activists to persuade Nike to improve its production methods or for McDonald 's to fix its environmental problems .
Similarly , today it is not good enough for the most liberal president in ages to settle for half a loaf when the alternative is going hungry .
In both cases , she argues , a profoundly corrupt system is left intact .
Any suggestion that things might have changed , if marginally , for the better is dismissed as just more marketing spin .
Still , Klein claims to spy an ironic sort of hope in Obama 's victory .
Just as the success of socially conscious branding is a sign that there is a longing out there for equality , diversity , and public space , she writes , the well of hope and expectation that Obama was able to plumb is decisive proof that there is still a tremendous appetite for social justice .
That he has failed to deliver is almost beside the point :
The market research is done , and all that is left is for genuine transformative social movements to exploit the niche .
This gets the order of exploitation exactly backward .
A more likely consequence is something roughly parallel to what happened during the last decade in the consumer realm , where the very brand - driven corporate hegemony that No Logo so forcefully critiqued came back stronger than ever .
For all its faith in a transformative grassroots political movement , the principal legacy of No Logo was that it served as a research manual for corporations looking to sell their products to consumers looking for meaning , integrity , and purpose in their shopping cart .
Ten years on , still waiting for the revolution , Naomi Klein scarcely seems to notice that she 's providing invaluable marketing advice to her opponents .

Abdul Rahman , 13 , is comforted by hospital staff while nurses change the dressings on his burn wounds March 18 , 2010 at Kandahar Regional Military Hospital in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
Six months ago , Abdul Rahman 's clothes were soaked with gasoline after a long day working in a fuel station to make extra money in rural Afghanistan , and they caught fire , burning him so badly his skin melted and his chin fused to his chest when it scarred over .
Abdul Rahman 's father had no money for doctors for his son and treated him at home , spreading butter on his burns every night .
Several weeks ago he trekked with his son to Kandahar looking for treatment , and eventually ended up at the American - funded Afghan Army military hospital in Kandahar .
Afghan medics under supervision of American Army doctor Lt. Col.

Greetings eggstravagant Fold !
Seriously .
Am I the only one that these English dumpster rats bothers so much ?
Replacing “ K ” with words that should have “ C ” is stupid .
Alliteration is n’t that important .
And “ Eggstravaganza ” ?
Ugh .
It ’s like someone puking on the English language and putting a birthday candle in it because it ’s a celebration .
What other travesties have you seen ?

Voting in Iraq began early Sunday , and turnout appeared to be heavy .
The BBC analysis is that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s State of Law coalition will do well enough at the polls to again form the government , partnering with other religious Shiite parties .
According to the Iraqi constitution , the party or coalition list with the largest number of seats , even if it is not a majority , will be given the first opportunity to form a government .
Al - Maliki , however , may well have to pay a price for remaining prime minister , if he can manage to do so , since that outcome would certainly require that he make a post-election coalition with the Shiite religious parties of the National Iraqi Alliance .
The latter include the Sadr Movement and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq .
Muqtada al - Sadr , leader of the Sadr movement , said Saturday on the Iran - based al - Alam satellite channel that he would only support a prime ministerial candidate who agreed to accelerate the departure of the US from Iraq .
Based on its performance in last year ’s provincial elections , the Sadr Movement could well get half of the seats gained by the National Iraqi Alliance ; if Sadrists did that well , they could be essential to putting together the 51 percent al - Maliki ( or any other prime minister ) would need to govern .
Scroll down to see a translation of Sadr ’s remarks , which are the first entry for Sunday below .
Moreover , it is not just al - Sadr .
I detect a change in the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , now led by Ammar al - Hakim after the death from lung cancer of his father , Abd al - Aziz .
The father had been sanguine about the presence of US troops in Iraq , and called for them to stay in the country , seeing them as a guarantor against the return of the Baathists ( the secular Arab nationalists led by Saddam Hussein before his overthrow in 2003 ) .
Ammar al - Hakim was brought up in Iran and is close to Iranian hard liners .
The US military once arrested him as he was sneaking across the border from Iran after a secret visit to Tehran that appears not to have involved any visas or border stations .
In Ankara last winter , he referred to the US military as “ occupation forces ” and gave partial credit to ISCI for forcing them to withdraw on a timetable .
But as late as January , even he was saying that the US presence in Iraq is not a major issue , since it has departed and the bases are being closed ( he probably meant that it has decided to depart ) .
He also , however , praised armed resistance to Israeli occupation and , on a trip to Beirut , laid a wreat at the tomb of Imad Mughniya , a radical Shiite whom the US and Israeli categorized as a terrorist .
Ammar has a say in who serves as the Friday Prayer leader and sermonizer at the mosque of the shrine of Ali in the holy city of Najaf , a position of great influence .
It is now held by Sayyid Yasin al - Musawi .
Al - Musawi ’s sermon on last Friday in Najaf contained a number of themes that suggest that ISCI may be returning to its Khomeinist roots .
Al - Musawi praised political obedience to the Shiite grand ayatollahs , not just spiritual obedience .
That sounded close to the Khomeinist principle of the guardianship of the jurisprudent , or rule of the ayatollahs , which prevails in Iran .
And he warned of conspiracies against Iraqi independence , saying that these conspiracies were launched by ‘ global arrogance and the secularists . ’
Now , ‘ global arrogance ’ is a technical term in political discourse among hard liners in Iran , and refers to the United States .
I never heard an ISCI preacher use this phrase while Abd al - Aziz al - Hakim was leading the movement .
Al - Musawi was warning of a US alliance with the secular National Iraqi List of Iyad Allawi aimed at keeping Iraq a colony of Washington .
( In fact , Karen DeYoung of WaPo reports that the Obama administration came to the conclusion that Washington had little chance of influencing the outcome of the election . )
That was the other change in terminology .
Al - Musawi urged voters in Najaf to cast their ballots for those who will work for Iraqi independence and against ‘ colonialism ’ ( al - isti`mar ) .
Again , this term was not publicly foregrounded among leaders of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , since they had a rough alliance of convenience with Washington in overthrowing and marginalizing the Baath Party .
But now the Friday prayers preacher of Najaf is denouncing global arrogance and openly calling Iraq a colonized country that must regain its independence .
This point of view had more commonly been found among Iraqi Sunni Arabs or in the Sadr Movement , as well as among hard liners across the border in Iran .
So if ISCI has decided that it is now in its interest to push the US out on a shorter timetable , and is allied with Sadrists who think the same way , then they could make that acceleration of the withdrawal a precondition for joining al - Maliki ’s coalition .
Al - Maliki would not have many alternatives .
He is unlikely to pair himself with Allawi , whom he sees as a dusted - off Baathist ( al - Maliki campaigned against what he warned was resurgent Baathist influence in Iraq , though by that he seems to have meant simple Arab nationalism that threatened the dominance of the Shiite religious parties , including his Islamic Mission ( Da`wa ) Party ) .
That stance will make it hard for him to get cooperation from the National Iraqi List .
Al - Maliki is also too much of an Iraqi nationalist to have really warm and close relations with the Kurdistan Alliance , which wants to add Kirkuk to its holdings , a step that al - Maliki has generally opposed .
Moreover , al - Maliki may not need much pressure to call for a quicker US departure .
He has for some time insisted that the Iraqi military is perfectly capable of keeping order in the country , and he clearly chafed when Vice President Joe Biden attempted to intervene to reverse the disqualification of over 500 allegedly Baath - linked candidates .
Although some observers are hailing the possibility that ex-Baathist secularist Iyad Allawi could become prime minister , in part based on Sunni support , that scenario seems unlikely to me .
In the early 2009 provincial elections , Allawi ’s list only got 3 percent in the major southern Shiite province of Basra , and in most of the other 8 provinces with heavy Shiite populations it did equally poorly or was almost invisible in the returns ; Qadisiya Province was the outlier , where Allawi gained about 8 percent of the vote , as he did in Baghdad .
( For the provincial election returns , see my analysis of a little over a year ago . )
While it is true that Allawi has a bigger coalition this time , having been joined by secular Sunni Arabs , that wo n’t help him in the Shiite south .
In December , 2005 , his list got 9 percent of the vote , in part because of popularity in Basra , which seems to have substantially declined .
His list only got 14 percent in the provincial elections in the Sunni province of Salahuddin , and 8 percent in al - Anbar , though admittedly he has more Sunni partners this time .
The only way his list will be the largest in parliament is if virtually all the Sunni Arabs swing behind it and there has been a sea change in Basra , Baghdad and Diwaniya so that he does unexpectedly well among the urban Shiite middle classes ( his major likely constituents in the Shiite south ) .
Since there is a ban on driving vehicles , guerrillas will not be able to use car bombs to disrupt the voting .
They have therefore fallen back on firing mortar shells , as they did in January 2005 .
By 10:30 am Iraq time , some 24 dead were being reported in these attacks in north Baghdad and in Salahuddin Province , and the Green Zone that houses the US embassy and the Iraqi parliament had also been targeted .
Journalist Nir Rosen , who has spent a lot of time on the ground in the Red Zone in Iraq talking to real people , warns against the meme that the elections could bring a return of civil war or very major violence .
I concur .
My interviews with Sunni Arab Iraqis in Jordan suggest to me that that community is dejected and feels defeated , and is not looking foward to more violence .

Forget Viagra , scientists develop what women REALLY want ... a spray to make their men cuddle more
What women want :
The hormone oxytocin stimulates affectionate feelings in humans ( file picture )
Wish your husband or boyfriend would show his caring side more often ?
Scientists could have the answer to your prayers - and it's a lot simpler than you might think .
They have come up with a spray that makes men more affectionate and in tune with others ' feelings .
Just a puff or two of the so - called ' cuddle chemical ' and even the most macho of males is as sensitive as a woman , they
claim .
The spray is based on oxytocin - a hormone naturally made in the body and involved in sex , sexual attraction , trust and confidence .
It is released into the blood during labour - triggering the production of breast milk - and floods the brain during breastfeeding , helping mother and baby bond .
In spray form , it seems the chemical can make a man ' feel ' like a woman .
The Cambridge and German scientists gave 24 healthy men nasal sprays containing oxytocin while 24 others received a placebo .
Afterwards the men were shown heart - wrenching photographs including a little girl in tears , a child embracing a cat and a man in mourning , and asked them to describe the level of empathy they felt with those in the pictures .
' The oxytocin group showed significantly higher emotional empathy levels than those men who had taken the placebo , ' said Dr Rene Hurlemann , of the Friedrich - Wilhelms University of Bonn .
SO JUST WHAT IS THE 'CUDDLE CHEMICAL '?
Oxytocin is a mammalian hormone which evokes feelings of contentment and reduces anxiety .
It is best know for its roles in female reproduction and is released in large amounts during labour and breastfeeding .
It also helps mothers to bond with their offspring .
The same hormone is even reported to help alleviate some symptoms of autism by encouraging sufferers to initiate social encounters .
In fact , he added , they reached the ' levels of sensitivity usually found in females ' .
The finding raises the tantalising possibility that women could use oxytocin sprays to help macho boyfriends and husbands get in touch with their feminine side .
Chauvinists could be turned into sensitive souls happy to watch weepy films and critique outfits on shopping trips .
On the other hand , it is unclear how long the effects of the spray last - meaning men might no longer be relied on to put up shelves , remove spiders and change fuses in times of need .
Dr Kendrick , of the Babraham Institute in Cambridge , said : ' It is a big effect .
' It gets men up to the levels shown by women - it could be a good thing or bad thing , depending on which way you look at it .
For many women , you could say it would almost be a godsend to make a man more empathetic and more like them .
' On the other hand , I am not sure they are used to having men that empathetic . '
In another experiment , also reported in the Journal of Neuroscience , the men had to answer simple questions on a computer .
If they got the right answer , a smiling face popped up on the screen but if they it wrong , they were given a frown .
Those given the cuddle drug scored much higher as they responded better to the ' praise ' of the happy faces .
Although oxytocin has been much researched , this is the first time it has been shown beyond doubt to make men more sensitive .
It is thought that the hormone could prove valuable in the treatment of autism , schizophrenia and other conditions characterised by difficulty in reading emotions .
Oxytocin sprays can be bought over the internet for a variety of uses , but experts question whether all brands are equally effective .
In addition , the use of oxytocin in hospitals to induce labour means the sprays should not be used by pregnant women .
The Terrafugia Transition is a roadable aircraft that was tested last year .
DARPA 's plans for the Transformer X call for the vehicle to be capable of flying on autopilot and driving off - road , among other features .
Credit : Terrafugia .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Last week , DARPA announced that it is inviting proposals to tackle its latest project : " a vertical takeoff and landing roadable air vehicle . "
The ground - to - sky vehicle , called Transformer X ( TX ) , should have a maximum payload capacity of 1,000 pounds so that it can carry four passengers and their gear .
It should also be capable of flying itself automatically , achieving an altitude of 1,000 feet , and traveling 250 miles on a single tank of fuel .
And it should be built and ready for testing by 2015 .
To date , as an article at The Register notes , the closest thing to a flying car that has been built and tested is the Terrafugia Transition .
With the press of a button , the wings on this “ roadable aircraft ” can be folded up in 30 seconds , enabling it to switch from flying to driving on roads .
But the proposed TX would have some significant differences , such that it would be a robust off - road vehicle with road performance similar to an SUV , and that it would have the option to fly on autopilot .
The robustness and ease of operation would be essential for various military missions that DARPA has in mind for the TX .
For instance , this “ sky jeep ” could fly over the minefields and roadside bombs that typically surround US bases in Afghanistan or other war territories , and then land to carry out a ground patrol , which requires stopping to set up checkpoints and other ground - based tasks .
The TX could also be used to stealthily carry supplies or passengers between ships at sea and a mainland area .
DARPA ’s plans require that the TX be no larger than 30 feet long , 8.5 feet wide , and 9 feet high in ground configuration ( about the size of two Hummers ) .
The TX should lift off the ground without forward motion , and then climb upward at least one foot for every six feet forward .
DARPA also specifies that the TX should be as quiet as a conventional automobile in ground mode and make no more noise than a single engine helicopter when flying , while achieving similar speeds .
The final major advantage of the TX would be that , since its robotic autopilot mode makes it capable of completely unmanned flight , it would n’t require extensive training to operate .
Currently , every Marine aircraft is piloted by a trained pilot , as The Register notes .
With the TX , passengers could operate the vehicle simply by selecting a destination or typing in some coordinates .
However , the vehicle would still have an operating range between fully autonomous to allowing a human operator to make flight steering commands in real time .
DARPA wants a prototype that will be ready for ground and flight tests by 2015 , and that will cost no more than $ 43 million to develop .
Although the TX is currently just a lofty goal , it has the potential to transform military transportation - and possibly even civilian transportation , if everything goes as planned .

People are going off a cliff and we 're not really doing anything about it .
That 's not great public policy .
- Andrew Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project
This " 99ers " unemployment crisis is a giant iceberg lurking under the political water line , and the Democrats in Congress do n't seem to understand they 're dancing on the Titanic .
Since Wall Street is happy , and corporate America is happy , they assume everything 's fine .
Many Americans still think the last extension vote was intended to add additional benefits , and thus are n't swamping their representatives with calls and emails , so our political leaders happily doze at the wheel , assuming everything 's fine .
It is n't .
You know when they 'll figure it out ?
The day after the November midterms .
Well , do n't say I did n't warn you .
In the meantime , if you 're one of the lucky duckies whose unemployment ran out , please take part in today 's Mayday SOS and fax or email your resume to your Congressional representatives :
Karl Schafer says he has tried for hundreds of jobs since he was laid off from a truck factory more than two years ago .
Still waiting to get hired , the 52 - year - old Ohio man has suffered the indignity of applying for food stamps and asking his elderly mother for help .
Weary of her own job search , former customer service representative Wagma Omar , 40 , of Mission Viejo is thinking about applying for a dangerous civilian job in Afghanistan .
And in California 's wine country , Kay Stephens , 56 , is frantically looking to cut her living expenses so her unemployment does n't become a burden to her 30 - year - old daughter .
Schafer , Omar and Stephens are among the increasing number of unemployed Americans whose burdens just got heavier :
They 've exhausted their 99 weeks of jobless benefits and must now figure out how to get by on ever more meager resources .
In California , state officials estimate there are nearly 100,000 people who are still looking for work but can no longer draw an unemployment check .
Federal labor officials could not provide a number nationally , but private - sector experts say it could easily top 1 million .
What is certain is that , as the jobless rate remains stubbornly high , more Americans will have to face the challenge of making ends meet without a monthly check .
" People are going off a cliff and we 're not really doing anything about it , " said Andrew Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project .
" That 's not great public policy . "
Once unemployment benefits run out , people are eligible for general relief — but that pays a maximum of $ 221 a month in Los Angeles County , compared with as much as nearly $ 2,000 a month for unemployment .
Only workers with dependent children are eligible for welfare .
Worried that they could lose their homes and get put out on the street , thousands of " 99ers , " as they call themselves , are banding together to agitate for another extension .
On Friday they 're kicking off a " Mayday SOS " campaign , faxing and e-mailing Congress their resumes , along with pleas for more benefits . [...]
People who know they 'll keep receiving benefits " do n't rush to find new employment , " said Alan Reynolds , a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute .
Data show that the long - term unemployed often find a job just as their benefits run out , he said .
Talk about " receiving benefits " !
All this Cato fellow has to do is keep parroting the conservative dogma , and he 's set for life .
And really , is n't that how it should be ?
Some projects and ideas I 've been working on .
Braking -- Front , Rear or Both ?
Since your bike has two brakes , one for each hand , if you want to stop as safely as possible , you need to pay attention to how you use each of them .
Conventional Wisdom
Conventional wisdom says to use both brakes at the same time .
This is probably good advice for beginners , who have not yet learned to use their brakes skillfully , but if you do n't graduate past this stage , you will never be able to stop as short safely as a cyclist who has learned to use the front brake by itself .
Maximum Deceleration -- Emergency Stops
The fastest that you can stop any bike of normal wheelbase is to apply the front brake so hard that the rear wheel is just about to lift off the ground .
In this situation , the rear wheel cannot contribute to stopping power , since it has no traction .
Wo n't I Go Over The Bars ?
The rear brake is O.K. for situations where traction is poor , or for when your front tire blows , but for stopping on dry pavement , the front brake alone provides the maximum stopping power , both in theory and in practice .
If you take the time to learn to use the front brake correctly , you will be a safer cyclist .
Many cyclists shy away from using the front brake , due to fear of flying over the handlebars .
This does happen , but mainly to people who have not learned to modulate the front brake .
The cyclist who relies on the rear brake for general stopping can get by until an emergency arises , and , in a panic , he or she grabs the unfamiliar front brake as well as the rear , for extra stopping power .
This can cause the classic " over the bars " crash .
Jobst Brandt has a quite plausible theory that the typical " over - the - bars " crash is caused , not so much by braking too hard , but by braking hard without using the rider 's arms to brace against the deceleration :
The bike stops , the rider keeps going until the rider 's thighs bump into the handlebars , and the bike , which is no longer supporting the weight of the rider , flips .
This cannot happen when you are using only the rear brake , because as soon as the rear wheel starts to lift , the rear wheel skids , limiting its braking force .
Unfortunately , though , it takes twice as long to stop with the rear brake alone as with the front brake alone , so reliance on the rear brake is unsafe for cyclists who ever go fast .
It is important to use your arms to brace yourself securely during hard braking , to prevent this .
Indeed , good technique involves moving back on your saddle as far as you can comfortably go , to keep the center of gravity as far back as possible .
This applies whether you are using the front , rear or both brakes .
Using both brakes together can cause " fishtailing . "
If the rear wheel skids while braking force is also being applied to the front , the rear of the bike will tend to swing past the front , since the front is applying a greater decelerating force than the rear .
Once the rear tire starts to skid , it can move sideways as easily as forward .
If you do n't believe me , perhaps John Forester can convince you ... see his Entry in the rec.bicycles FAQ on Front Brake Usage ( Subject : 9.17 ) .
( Unfortunately , the maintainer of that site has a habit of breaking links , so you may need to go to the rec.bicycles FAQ index to find the article . )
Or read John Allen 's advice .
Skidding the rear wheel also wears the rear tire very quickly .
A single rear - brake - only stop from 50 km/h ( 30 mph ) with a locked rear wheel can wear the tread of a road tire right down to the fabric !
Learning to Use The Front Brake
Maximum braking occurs when the front brake is applied so hard that the rear wheel is just about to lift off .
At that point , the slightest amount of rear brake will cause the rear wheel to skid .
If you ride a conventional bike , the best way to master the use of your front brake is to practice in a parking lot or other safe space , applying both brakes at once , but putting most of the effort into the front brake .
Keep pedaling as you brake , so that your legs will tell you immediately when the rear wheel starts to skid .
Squeeze , do n't grab , the brake levers , so you can sense when this happens .
Practice harder and harder stops , so that you will learn the feel of stopping fast , on the edge of rear - wheel liftoff .
Test the brakes in this way whenever you are about to ride an unfamiliar bike .
Some brakes are more sensitive than others , and you need to know the " feel " of the brakes .
Once you are comfortable with the front brake , also practice releasing the brakes to recover control , until this is an automatic , reflex action .
At a very low speed , apply the brakes hard enough that the rear wheel skids , or just begins to lift .
When it does , immediately release the brakes .
Wear your helmet .
Some cyclists like to ride a fixed - gear bicycle , that is , a bicycle that does not permit coasting .
When you brake hard with the front brake on a fixed gear , the drivetrain gives you excellent feedback about the traction at the rear wheel .
( This is one of the reasons that fixed gears are favored for winter riding . )
If you ride a fixed gear with only a front brake , your legs will tell you exactly when you are at the maximum brake capacity of the front brake .
Once your fixed gear has taught you this , you will be able to stop any bicycle better , using the front brake alone .
If you find the fixed - gear concept intriguing , I have a major article on Fixed Gears for Road Use on this site , and also a page of Fixed - Gear Testimonials from happy converts .
When to Use The Rear Brake
Slippery surfaces .
On good , dry pavement , unless leaning in a turn , it is impossible to skid the front wheel by braking .
On slippery surfaces , however , it is possible .
A front wheel skid almost always leads to a fall , so if there is a high risk of skidding , you 're better off controlling your speed with the rear brake .
Bumpy surfaces .
On rough surfaces , your wheels may actually bounce up into the air .
If there is a chance of this , do n't use the front brake .
If you ride into a bump while applying the front brake , the bicycle will have a harder time mounting the bump .
If you apply the front brake while the wheel is airborne , it will stop , and coming down on a stopped front wheel is a Very Bad Thing .
Front flat .
If you have tire blowout or a sudden flat on the front wheel , you should use the rear brake alone to bring yourself to a safe stop .
Braking a wheel that has a deflated tire can cause the tire to come off the rim , and is likely to cause a crash .
Broken cable ... or other failure of the front brake .
Skilled cyclists use the front brake alone probably 95 % of the time , but there are instances when the rear brake is preferred :
When to Use Both Brakes Together
If the front brake is not sufficiently powerful to lift the rear wheel , the rear brake can help , but the best thing to do is to repair the front brake .
Typical rim brakes lose a great deal of their effectiveness when the rims are wet , so using them both together can reduce stopping distances .
If the front brake grabs or chatters so you can not modulate it smoothly , you must only use it lightly .
Again , repair is in order .
On long , straight mountain descents , your front brake hand may get tired , or you may be at risk of overheating a tire and blowing it out , so it is best to spread the work between both brakes .
Pumping the brakes , alternating between one and the other , will briefly heat the surface of each rim more and dissipate more heat before it spreads inwards to the tires .
When sharp deceleration is needed , the front brake is more effective , as usual .
When leaning in a turn , traction is shared between braking and turning .
Using both brakes together reduces the likelihood that one wheel or the other will skid and dump you .
The steeper you lean , the less you can brake , so moderate your speed before a curve .
When you are leaning deeply , you need to release the brakes entirely .
Long or low bicycles , such as tandems and long - wheelbase recumbents , have their front braking limited by the possibility of skidding the front wheel , since their geometry prevents lifting the rear wheel .
Such bikes can stop shortest when both brakes are applied .
Tandem caution : when riding a tandem solo ( no stoker on board ) the rear brake becomes virtually useless due to lack of traction .
The risk of fishtailing is particularly high if a solo tandem rider uses both brakes at once .
This also applies to a lesser extent if the stoker is a small child .
Generally I advise against using both brakes at the same time .
There are exceptions , however :
Which Brake Which Side ?
Some cyclists say it is best to have the stronger right hand ( presuming a right - handed cyclist ) operate the rear brake .
Motorcycles always have the right hand control the front brake , so cyclists who are also motorcyclists often prefer this setup .
A moment of confusion in an emergency situation can be deadly .
The left lever on a motorcycle operates the clutch , which will not stop you !
There are also observable national trends :
In countries where vehicles drive on the right , it is common to set the brakes up so that the front brake is operated by the left lever .
In countries where vehicles drive on the left , it is common to set the brakes up so that the front brake is operated by the right lever .
The European Union has adopted this as a standard , even though only the United Kingdom and Ireland are left - side driving countries .
The standard is not universally observed ; a reader has written in to say that the left lever usually controls the front brake in Denmark .
The theory that seems most probable to me is that the national standards arose from a concern that the cyclist be able to make hand signals , and still be able to reach the primary brake .
This logical idea is , unfortunately , accompanied by the incorrect premise that the rear brake is the primary brake .
There is considerable disagreement as to which brake should be connected to which lever :
There are also observable national trends :
The theory that seems most probable to me is that the national standards arose from a concern that the cyclist be able to make hand signals , and still be able to reach the primary brake .
This logical idea is , unfortunately , accompanied by the incorrect premise that the rear brake is the primary brake .
For this reason , I set my own bikes up so that the right hand controls the front brake , which is not the norm in the U.S.
I also do this because I 'm right - handed , and wish to have my more skillful hand operate the more critical brake .
On the other hand , if you have already developed a preference , it is usually best to stick with it -- or at least , choose a few weeks of riding under undemanding conditions to retrain your reflexes .
In an emergency , you must act faster than you can think .
If you switch between a Mac and a Windows PC , where the same keys do n't make the same characters , or between a clarinet and a saxophone where they do n't make the same musical notes , you know how reflexes can trip you up .
If you are used to skidding the rear wheel with the rear brake , switching the brake cables can result a flight over the handlebars .
If you mostly use the front brake , switching the cables can result in rear - wheel skidding and increased stopping distance .
These problems are most likely when first riding an unfamiliar bike , so , again , always test the brakes with a light brake application when you first start out .

Leaning in Turns
must be moved sideways a particular amount or the bicycle will not balance .
To turn a bicycle , you must lean inward toward the direction of the turn .
The faster you are going , and the sharper the turn , the more you must lean .
You have no choice about this , for a given speed and turn radius , the center of gravity of the bike / riderbe moved sideways a particular amount or the bicycle will not balance .
What you do have control over is whether you lean the bicycle more than , less than , or the same amount that you lean your body , to get the overall center of gravity to the place that it has to go .
Leaning the bicycle sharply while keeping your upper body more upright
This approach is popular with beginners who are scared to lean over sideways , and who feel less disoriented by keeping their bodies more upright .
-- though actually , they do n't .
The cyclist is much heavier than the bicycle , which leans over farther , instead .
Captaining a tandem with a stoker who does n't know about leaning in turns can be a very unsettling experience , because you must lean farther to compensate .
Keeping the upper body more upright is recommended by some racers and coaches as offering the possibility of recovering from a skid , but I do n't believe it .
[ I think there might be something to this .
If you start to skid out , you might be able to yank the bicycle up and momentarily press the wheels harder into the road surface to gain more traction -- though the side force also might potato - chip a wheel , or roll a tubular off the rim .
Racers also sometimes drop the knee that is to the inside of the turn .
Yanking the knee inward may also help ro recover from a skid .
Also see Jobst Brandt 's comments , below -- John Allen . ]
Leaning the upper body sharply while keeping the bicycle more upright
This approach is popular with riders who are afraid of striking a pedal on the road .
This is a particular concern for riders of fixed - gear bicycles , since they cannot coast through corners .
This technique is also recommended by some racers and coaches as offering the possibility of recovering from a skid , but I do n't believe it .
[ Neither do I -- but , as Sheldon says , this may be necessary to avoid a pedal strike with a fixed - gear bicycle -- John Allen . ]
Leaning the upper body and the bicycle together , keeping them in line as when riding straight .
This technique has the advantage of keeping the steering axis , tire contact patches and center of gravity all in the same plane .
This preserves the proper handling characteristics of the bicycle , and makes a skid less likely .
You can verify this yourself by performing an experiment suggested by Jobst Brandt : " Some riders believe that sticking out their knee or leaning their body away from the bike , improves cornering .
Sticking out a knee is the same thing that riders without cleats do when they stick out a foot in dirt track motorcycle fashion .
It is a useless but reassuring gesture that , on uneven roads , actually works against you .
Any body weight that is not centered over the bicycle ( leaning the bike or sticking out a knee ) puts a side load on the bicycle , and side loads cause steering motions if the road is not smooth .
Getting weight off the saddle is also made more difficult by such maneuvers .
" To verify this , ride down a straight but rough road standing on one pedal with the bike slanted , and note how the bike follows an erratic line .
In contrast , if you ride centered on the bike you can ride no -hands perfectly straight over rough road .
When you lean off the bike you cannot ride a smooth line over road irregularities , especially in curves .
For best control , stay centered over your bike . "
A letter to Bike Culture :
The following is a letter I wrote to Bike Culture magazine in 1995 , addressing some of the points covered above :
In Bike Culture # 6 , Marek Utkin decries " Stupid Standards " in the bicycle industry .
He begins with a wonderful exercise in guilt by association " Throughout history , despots have tried to regulate every aspect of their society ... "
He goes on to link Hitler to the D.I.N. and Stalin to G.O.S.T. standards .
Unaccountably , he forgets to mention the strong linkage between Napoleon and the Metric system -- perhaps he likes metrics , and does n't want to bring up its despotic antecedents .
He is specifically exercised by new E.U. regulations that specify that the front brake should be controlled by the right hand .
" The trouble begins when a bike with right lever to front brake is ridden ... in any country where traffic keeps to the right .
The left hand signal , across traffic , is much more hazardous than the right hand signal .
With the right hand ... front brake the potential danger increases .
Stopping the front wheel only , with one hand on the handlebars , can cause front - wheel instability .
Also the upper part of the cyclist 's body moves forward as the bicycle abruptly decelerates , causing further pressure on the right side of the handlebars . "
I have to attribute his attitude to a common misunderstanding about brakes .
With bicycles , as with virtually all wheeled vehicles , the front brake is the more important and effective brake .
The front brake by itself will stop a standard bicycle twice as fast as a rear brake by itself .
The front brake by itself will stop a standard bicycle as fast as both brakes used together , except on very slippery surfaces .
Unfortunately , many casual cyclists and non-cyclists have the mistaken idea that using the front brake is dangerous , and that you are likely to lock up the front wheel , pitch over the handlebars and crack you skull .
This type of accident is extremely rare , and unlikely on a bicycle that is in good repair , ridden by a cyclist who has learned to use the front brake sensitively .
The danger is more real for bicycles with damaged rims , or mis-adjusted brakes .
The danger is even greater for the cyclist who habitually relies on the rear brake alone when suddenly faced with the need for a panic stop .
A panicky rider who is unused to the front brake may indeed grab it full - force as a last resort , and may take a header .
If you will forgive an automotive analogy in these green pages , a driver who has never driven a car with power brakes is likely to skid a few times the first time he or she tries driving a car that has them .
This does not mean that there is something wrong with power brakes , however , it means that the driver needs to learn how to use them .
I frequently ride a fixed - gear bike with a front brake only .
This is an excellent way to learn subtle control of the front brake , as the fixed gear gives very good feedback of the traction available at the rear wheel .
In the early ' 80s , I became infatuated with mountain bike riding in the woods , and completely re-adapted my braking style to cope with the loose surfaces common on woods trails .
In 1988 , I moved to France for a year , and got back into road riding .
Near my house was a wonderful bit of road down the side of a valley , called La Route des Sept Tournants .
It is a series of sweeping switch backs , beautifully paved , very well engineered .
I used to descend it regularly on one of my favorite loops .
The problem was , I could never really go fast down it , I always felt that I was on the verge of losing traction with my rear wheel and spinning out .
After a few months of this , I was beginning to conclude that I had just become a coward as I reached middle age .
I remembered I used to go faster around similar bends on my old fixed gear with no rear brake ---- wait a minute , maybe that 's it !
The next time I went that way , I decided not to use my rear brake unless I felt I really needed it -- I would just go slowly at first , only as fast as I felt comfortable with using the front brake alone .
Mirable dictu , I found that I was my old self again !
It had indeed been the rear wheel that was on the verge of slipping , and only because I was using its brake .
Without the drag of the rear brake , the rear wheel was in no danger of slipping .
The front wheel , thanks to the weight shift caused by the braking I still had to use , had plenty of traction as well .
Many people will tell you that it is dangerous to use your front brake in a turn ; I would respond that this is so if your turning / banking technique is incorrect .
The center of gravity of a bicycle / rider must lean into a turn ; this is required by the laws of physics .
There are three ways you can do this .
One way is to keep the bike more - or - less upright , but to lean your upper body into the turn .
Another is to keep your body more - or - less upright , and lean the bicycle under you .
The third , and usually correct technique is to keep your body in line with the bicycle frame , lean the bicycle and rider together as a unit .
Leaning the bicycle and rider differently messes up the handling of the bike , by moving the center of gravity sideways from the plane of the wheels .
If you apply the front brake while doing this , the braking force exerts a steering force through the now off - center headset .
Jobst Brandt has an excellent way of proving this to yourself : try riding down a straight , but bumpy stretch of road while leaning the bike to one side and your body to the other .
If you are brave , try applying the front brake very gently .
I must admit to a bit of ambivalence as to whether a government body should tell people how to set up their bicycles .
In the U.S.A. , de - facto government regulation has made left - front all but compulsory for new bikes to be sold .
I strongly object to this .
I once had a near - accident as a result : I was riding an unfamiliar bike that was set up left - front , even though I am used to right - front .
I came to an intersection , a car cut me off , I instinctively grabbed with my right hand .
Since this was the rear brake , I was only barely able to stop in time !
I will add one further reason for preferring the right - front setup :
Most people are right handed .
I think we can all agree that the front brake requires more skill than the rear ; therefore , it should be assigned to the more skillful hand .

LOS ANGELES — Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa once organized for a teacher 's union here , and later ran a branch of the American Federation of Government Employees .
That makes him an unlikely advocate for cutting the benefits of the city 's workers .
But with the city facing a budget deficit that could drain its reserves by summer , Mayor Villaraigosa wants to re-open contract talks with 45,000 cops , firefighters , librarians and other city employees in hopes of persuading them to contribute ...
Pioneering a novel microscopy method , neuroscientist Arthur Konnerth and colleagues from the Technische Universitaet Muenchen ( TUM ) have shown that individual neurons carry out significant aspects of sensory processing : specifically , in this case , determining which direction an object in the field of view is moving .
Their method makes it possible for the first time to observe individual synapses , nerve contact sites that are just one micrometer in size , on a single neuron in a living mammalian brain .
Focusing on neurons known to play a role in processing visual signals related to movement , Konnerth 's team discovered that an individual neuron integrates inputs it receives via many synapses at once into a single output signal -- a decision , in essence , made by a single nerve cell .
The scientists report these results in the latest issue of the journal Nature .
Looking ahead , they say their method opens a new avenue for exploration of how learning functions at the level of the individual neuron .
When light falls on the retina of the human eye , it hits 126 million sensory cells , which transform it into electrical signals .
Even the smallest unit of light , a photon , can stimulate one of these sensory cells .
As a result , enormous amounts of data have to be processed for us to be able to see .
While the processing of visual data starts in the retina , the finished image only arises in the brain or , to be more precise , in the visual cortex at the back of the cerebrum .
Scientists working with Arthur Konnerth -- professor of neurophysiology at TUM and Carl von Linde Senior Fellow at the TUM Institute for Advanced Study -- are interested in a certain kind of neuron in the visual cortex that fires electrical signals when an object moves in front of our eyes -- or the eyes of a mouse .
When a mouse is shown a horizontal bar pattern in motion , specific neurons in its visual cortex consistently respond , depending on whether the movement is from bottom to top or from right to left .
The impulse response pattern of these " orientation " neurons is already well known .
What was not previously known , however , is what the input signal looks like in detail .
This was not easy to establish , as each of the neurons has a whole tree of tiny , branched antennae , known as dendrites , at which hundreds of other neurons " dock " with their synapses .
To find out more about the input signal , Konnerth and his colleagues observed a mouse in the act of seeing , with resolution that goes beyond a single nerve cell to a single synapse .
They refined a method called two - photon fluorescence microscopy , which makes it possible to look up to half a millimeter into brain tissue and view not only an individual cell , but even its fine dendrites .
Together with this microscopic probe , they conducted electrical signals to individual dendrites of the same neuron using tiny glass pipettes ( patch - clamp technique ) .
" Up to now , similar experiments have only been carried out on cultured neurons in Petri dishes , " Konnerth says .
" The intact brain is far more complex .
Because it moves slightly all the time , resolving individual synaptic input sites on dendrites was extremely difficult . "
The effort has already rewarded the team with a discovery .
They found that in response to differently oriented motions of a bar pattern in the mouse 's field of vision , an individual orientation neuron receives input signals from a number of differently oriented nerve cells in its network of connections but sends only one kind of output signal .
" And this , " Konnerth says , " is where things get really exciting . "
The orientation neuron only sends output signals when , for example , the bar pattern moves from bottom to top .
Evidently the neuron weighs the various input signals against each other and thus reduces the glut of incoming data to the most essential information needed for clear perception of motion .
In the future , Konnerth would like to extend this research approach to observation of the learning process in an individual neuron .
Neuroscientists speculate that a neuron might be caught in the act of learning a new orientation .
Many nerve endings practically never send signals to the dendritic tree of an orientation neuron .
Presented with visual input signals that represent an unfamiliar kind of movement , formerly silent nerve endings may become active .
This might alter the way the neuron weighs and processes inputs , in such a way that it would change its preferred orientation ; and the mouse might learn to discern certain movements better or more rapidly .
" Because our method enables us to observe , down to the level of a single synapse , how an individual neuron in the living brain is networked with others and how it behaves , we should be able to make a fundamental contribution to understanding the learning process , " Konnerth asserts .
" Furthermore , because here at TUM we work closely with physicists and engineers , we have the best possible prospects for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of the images . "

In a previous post , I shared a teaching from Thich Nhat Hanh titled “ Healing the Body with Mindfulness of Breathing . ”
This post has proven helpful and inspiring to many people , so I wanted to share something from Thây ’s Theravadan brother - in - the - dharma , Thanissaro Bhikkhu .
( Thây , by the way , is Thich Nhat Hanh ’s students ’ affectionate name for him )
Thanissaro Bhikkhu ’s talk is called “ Bathed in the Breath ” and I think it ’s a wonderful co-partner for Thây ’s “ Healing the Body with Mindfulness of Breathing . ”
One of the things I ’ve always loved about Thây is how he not only draws from his own Mahayana tradition , but also studies and works with Theravadan sutta ( sutras ) , such as the Anapanasati Sutta .
In fact , it was Thây ’s obvious familiarity with the Pali canon that inspired me to learn about it for myself .
If you are looking for further insight into working with the breath to bring healing to your body , I think you will find “ Bathed in Breath ” a very skillful teaching .
This particular breathing practice is something I do regularly , and I can personally attest that it does brings about physical as well as mental healing .
Bathed in the Breath
Thanissaro Bhikkhu
When there ’s a Dharma talk , you do n’t have to listen to the Dharma talk .
The important thing is to stay with your breath .
When the breath comes in , you know it ’s coming in ; when it goes out , you know it ’s going out .
Try to make that knowledge of the breath fill your awareness as much as possible .
The Dharma talk here is meant to be a fence to keep you with the breath .
When the mind wanders off , here ’s the sound of the Dharma to remind you to go back to the breath , but when you ’re with the breath you do n’t need reminding .
You do your own reminding .
That ’s what the mindfulness does in the meditation .
Each time you breathe in , each time you breathe out , remind yourself to stay with the breath .
Make just a little mental note : “ This is where you want to stay ; this is where you want to stay . ”
And try not to think of yourself as inhabiting one part of the body watching the breath in another part of the body .
Think of the breath as all around you .
It ’s coming in and out the front , coming in and out the back , down from the top , all the way out to your fingers , all the way out to your toes .
There ’s a subtle breath energy coming in and out of the body all the time .
If you ’re in one part of the body watching the breath in the other part , there tends to be a habit of blocking the breath energy to make space for that sense of “ you ” in the part of the body that ’s watching .
So think of yourself as totally surrounded by the breath , bathed in the breath , and then survey the whole body to see where there are still sections of the body that are tense or tight , that are preventing the breath from coming in and going out .
Allow them to loosen up .
This way you allow for the fullness of the breath to come in , go out , each time there ’s an in - breath , each time there ’s an out - breath .
Actually the fullness does n’t go in and out .
There ’s just a quality of fullness that ’s bathed by the breath coming in , bathed by the breath going out .
It ’s not squeezed out by the breath .
It ’s not forced out by the breath .
Each nerve in the body is allowed to relax and have a sense of fullness , right here , right now .
Then simply try to maintain that sense of fullness by the way you breathe .
Your focus is on the breath , but you ca n’t help but notice the fullness .
If you ca n’t get that sense of fullness going throughout the whole body , find at least some part of the body that does n’t feel squeezed out , that feels open and expansive , and then see if you can copy that same feeling tone in other parts of the body .
You might notice that there are different parts of the body where it feels open like that and allow them to connect .
At first , nothing much will happen from that sense of connection , but allow it to stay open , stay open .
Each time you breathe in , each time you breathe out , have that sense of openness , openness , and the sense of connection will get stronger .
This is why the ability to stay with these sensations is so important , because your staying with them is what allows them to grow .
If you move off to someplace else , if you ’re thinking of something else , there will have to be a tensing up in the body to allow that thought to happen .
And so whatever sense of fullness might have developed — say , in your arms or your legs , in different parts of the body , down your back — does n’t have a chance to develop .
It gets squeezed off because you ’re not paying attention to it any more .
Make Your Awareness 360 degrees , Not One Little Spot
This is why the Buddha talks about concentration as an enlarged type of awareness .
If your awareness is limited just to one little spot , everything else gets squeezed out , everything else gets blocked out — and what is that if not ignorance ?
You ’re trying to make your awareness 360 degrees , all around , and all around in all directions , because the habit of the mind is to focus its awareness in one spot here , then one spot there , moving around , but there ’s always the one spot , one spot , one spot .
It opens up a little bit and then squeezes off again , opens up a little bit , squeezes off again , and nothing has a chance to grow .
But if you allow things to open up throughout the whole body , then you realize that if you think about anything at all you destroy that openness .
So you ’ve got to be very , very careful , very , very still , to allow this fullness to develop .
So these qualities of consistency , care , heedfulness — these are important in allowing this state of concentration to develop .
Without them , nothing much seems to happen .
You have a little bit of concentration , then you step on it , a little bit of concentration , then you squeeze it off as you go looking at something else , thinking about something else .
And so whatever little bits and pieces of concentration you do have , do n’t seem very remarkable .
They do n’t get a chance to be remarkable .
They take time — and our society ’s one of the more remarkable societies in giving us expectations that things should happen quickly .
If anything ’s going to be good , it has to happen quickly , it has to be instant .
And so , by and large , we ’ve lost the ability to stay with things as they develop slowly .
We ’ve lost the ability to keep chipping away , chipping away , chipping away at a large task that ’s going to take time and ca n’t be speeded up .
Developing the Skills of Concentration
When the Buddha gives images for practicing concentration , he often relates them to skills .
Skills take time , and he was teaching people who had taken the time to work on whatever skills they had .
In Thailand , they still sharpen knives against stones .
There are particular kinds of stones that are good for sharpening the knives , and it ’s a skill you have to learn : how not to ruin the knife as you ’re sharpening it , because if you get impatient , try to speed things up , you ’ll ruin the sharpness of the blade .
So you have to be very still .
The mind has to be still , and you have to maintain just the right amount of pressure constantly as you sharpen the blade .
And it may seem like nothing is happening , but over time the blade does get sharper and sharper .
The consistency of your pressure is what guarantees that the blade wo n’t get worn in one particular spot — too sharp in one spot and not sharp enough in another , too sharp in the sense that the blade is no longer straight .
You ’ve worn it down too much in one spot .
There are a lot of things you have to watch out for , simply in the act of sharpening a blade .
But when you have that skill in your repertoire , then when the time comes to meditate , it ’s easier to relate to what you ’re doing : that same kind of consistency , that same evenness of pressure , the continual mindfulness and alertness that are needed to maintain that proper pressure .
Another skill sometimes used as an analogy is that of a hunter .
The hunter has to be very quiet so as not to disturb the animals , not to scare the animals off , and at the same time has to be very alert so as not to miss when a particular animal comes by .
And our tendency as meditators is to slip off either into too much stillness or too much mental activity .
You have to find the proper balance .
I was talking to an anthropologist one time , and he said that of all the skills that primitive societies have and that anthropologists try to learn as they go into those societies , the hardest one to learn is hunting .
It requires the strongest concentration , the most sensitivity .
So here we ’re not hunting animals , but we ’re hunting concentration , which is even more subtle and requires even more stillness and alertness .
The Importance of Patience and Consistency
Sometimes we in the West think that we come to the Dharma with an advantage : we ’ve got so much education .
But we have a disadvantage in that we lack the patience and consistency that come with mastering a skill .
So keep that in mind as you ’re meditating , when you find yourself getting impatient for results .
You simply have to be watchful and consistent .
You need that sense of being bathed by the breath , being open to the breathing sensations in all parts of the body down to every little pore of your skin .
Then you learn the sensitivity that ’s required , the consistency that ’s required , to maintain that .
That way the sense of fullness can grow and grow and grow until it really becomes gratifying , really satisfying , to give the concentration the kind of strength , the sense of refreshment , the sense of nourishment that it needs in order to keep going .
Ajaan Fuang once said that without this sense of fullness , refreshment , or rapture , your meditation gets dry .
This is a lubricant that keeps things smooth and running : the sense of well - being and refreshment , the immediate visceral pleasure of being in a concentrated state .
Healing Our Mental Wounds
At the same time , it heals all our mental wounds : any sense of tiredness , of being stressed - out .
It ’s like medicine for these mental wounds .
Now , medicine often takes time to work , especially healing and soothing medicine .
Think of the creams you put on your skin when your skin gets chapped .
It ’s not that you put the cream on and the skin is immediately is cured .
It takes time .
The skin has to be exposed to the cream for long periods of time to allow the cream to do its work .
The same with concentration .
It takes time to expose your nervous system to the sense of fullness , giving it a chance to breathe in , breath out all around so that the mindfulness and the breath together can do their healing work .
So do n’t get impatient , do n’t feel that nothing is happening .
A lot of things that are very important require time , and they do their work subtly .
If you give them the time they need , you find that you ’re more than repaid .
After all , you could be sitting for the whole hour planning next week , planning next month , planning next year .
What will you have at the end of the hour ?
A lot of plans .
And part of you may feel satisfied that you ’ve provided for the future , but then when you reflect on how many of your past plans have actually borne results , you ’ll realize that the odds are against your new plans ’ ever amounting to much .
What would you have to show for your hour ?
Nothing very certain .
Maybe nothing but straw .
But if you give the breath an hour to do its healing work , opening the body totally up to allow the breath to bathe every nerve in the body out to every pore , you know that you ’ll come out at the end of the hour with a body and mind in much better shape .
The body will be soothed body ; the mind , bright and alert .
And you do n’t need to stop being bathed in the breath when the hour is up .
You can keep it going in all your activities .
That way , even though you may not be armed with a whole set of plans for facing the future , at least you ’re in a position where you do n’t need that kind of armor .
You ’ve got the armor of a healthy body and mind .
You ’ve got an invisible armor : the force field of this all - encompassing breath , continually streaming out from your center to every pore , protecting you on all sides .
That ’s something you feel in every cell of your body , something that you know for sure , for you can sense it all around you , right here and now .
And you know that whatever the future brings , you ’re prepared .
You can handle it .
This sense of fullness , brightness , alertness : that ’s all you ’ll need to keep the mind capable , healthy , and strong .

After a long week of tough talk from the Dems on financial reform , the weekend started on an off note , with the administration offering a key concession to Republicans .
The Obama administration is telling Senate Democrats to ditch a measure in their financial reform bill that would create a $ 50 billion liquidation fund by assessing a fee on big financial institutions .
The fund is intended to be used to cover the cost of winding down large firms , when they fail .
According to the Associated Press , the administration would like the financial industry to cover the cost of liquidation after an institution has been dismantled .
Perhaps not coincidentally , this is a measure Republicans oppose , on the grounds , they say , that the mere existence of the fund will incentivize risk taking , and lead to more bailouts .
That 's also the provision Mitch McConnell and other Republicans used the Luntz " permanent bailout " rhertoric , the talking points Senate Dems , the DNC , and the White House launched a " tough " campaign against .
It 's reminiscent of the Republicans calling the end - of - life care provisions " death panels " and allowing undocumented workers to purchase insurance with their own money " illegal immigrants getting our health care , " lies which the White House and Dems loudly denounced , but then conceded to by removing the provisions .
Predictably , the results are about the same as with the health reform concessions .
Senate Republicans say they 're prepared to work constructively with Democrats on a consensus financial reform bill .
But this weekend , after the White House offered up a key substantive concession , they swatted President Obama 's hand away in a fashion that was all too reminiscent of their strategy of opposition to health care reform .
" We ought to go back to the drawing board , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on CNN Sunday morning .
Likewise , moderate Republican Scott Brown ( R - MA ) , once considered a swing vote on regulatory reform , explicitly threatened to vote to block the bill from even being debated .
Asked by CBS ' Bob Schieffer if he 'd filibuster the bill rather than let it come to the Senate floor , Brown was unequivocal : " In this particular instance , yes , " he said .
And in a move that just feels all too familiar , Geithner will meet with Collins this afternoon .
" I had to find a religion , " said Graham Greene , " to measure my evil against . "
This puts Greene the " Catholic novelist " ( a description he detested ) into correct perspective : before he chose Christ as his highest value , he was first a man obsessed with scale itself .
No 20th - century writer had a subtler mind for human comparison .
Where lesser novelists deploy broad strokes to separate good guy from bad , Greene was the master of the multiple distinction : the thin lines that separate evil from cruelty from unkindness from malevolent stupidity .
His people exist within a meticulously calibrated moral system .
They fail by degrees .
And so there is no real way to be good in Greene , there are simply a million ways to be more or less bad .
This detailed ethical realism is an aspect of Greene often neglected in favour of the more baroque aspects of his oeuvre - the forthright sexuality , the wanderlust , the journalistic reportage - traits which seem to place him securely amongst the company of his fellow adventurers : Erskine Childers , Len Deighton , Alec Waugh , John Le Carré .
Certainly Greene was always a writer interested in thrill - as a teenager he played Russian roulette of the deadly , non-metaphorical kind .
Still , it 's sometimes good to remind oneself of the fact that upon Greene 's own book shelves Henry James reigned .
Whatever else he was , Greene was a literary double agent , and some of the depth of his work is revealed when we reinscribe Henry James ( rather than , say , his childhood hero H Rider Haggard ) as his central antecedent .
In Greene 's novels , as with James's , all the vicissitudes of human personality are brought to the table for dissection .
Distinctions of character that we fondly imagine concrete , upon which we define ourselves ( " But I am kind , where he is only cynical " ) , are revealed to hold little currency in the face of the human extremities : war , death , loss and love .
" Human nature is not black and white but black and grey . "
Greene is not the first novelist to note it , but his grey was marvellously various .
Into this grey area we must place the shady triad of The Quiet American : the honest venality of Phuong , the disengagement of Fowler , and the innocence of Pyle .
Is n't it a brilliantly constructed novel ?
It reminds one of the game jack straws , in which the aim is to take each stick in turn without disturbing the others .
It is a masterful trick to balance these three people against each other - comparing and contrasting their cynicisms , their hopes , their personal failures - and yet weighting the situation in such a way as to never allow us to make that final , satisfying judgement upon their characters which would signal that the reader 's work is done .
Greene did not like to permit his readers this satisfaction : " When we are not sure , we are alive . "
In the case of The Quiet American ethical ambivalence is built into the very foundation of the novel .
I spoke earlier of a calibrated moral system , and this reminds us of the careful , judicious James of The Europeans , but what a different job it is to place your people in a battlefield instead of a drawing room !
You can not be sure about anything on a battlefield .
Greene was compulsively drawn to some of the messiest conflicts his century had seen , wars that people continued to fight long after the reasons to fight them had grown obscure .
His characters radiate the ethical uncertainty and confusion that comes from living a war - without - end .
But despite this , in Vietnam Phuong and the foreign correspondent Fowler have found each other , a blessing which seems , to Fowler at least , as much as can be hoped for .
Theirs is a small ledge between a rock and a hard place .
" I'm a great believer in purgatory , " said Greene in an interview , " Purgatory , to me , makes sense ... one would have a sense of movement .
I can't believe in a heaven which is just passive bliss . "
Into Fowler 's purgatory comes Pyle , who believes in Heaven .
He arrives armed with his grand narrative about Vietnam , which he will force Vietnam to fit , by hook or by crook .
But he is not alone in clinging to misleading , self - serving stories in this novel .
Pyle has his story about Fowler , but Fowler also has his own about Pyle ( the dominant narrative of the book ) , a story that mistakenly casts him as more of a quiet American than he turns out to be .
Both men have their equally distorting , unavoidably colonial , story about Phuong .
None of these tales is to be trusted ; they are shot through with personal need .
Greene understood the selfish currents that run through our deepest motivations ( he had been extensively psychoanalysed by a Jungian when he was still a young teenager ) and he was unique in tracing the progress of these desires from their intimate microcosm ( two people in love ) to their geopolitical macrocosmic consequences .
He knew one country could fall for another , get involved with it , grow tired of it and break its heart .
In The Quiet American personal motivations are linked with their political mirror twins .
Listen to Fowler 's running commentary on his ex-wife 's letter .
Wherever there is a person mentioned , think of a country :
Who could blame her for seeking my own scars in return ?
When we are unhappy we hurt .
The hurt is in the act of possession : we are too small in mind and body to possess another person without pride or to be possessed without humiliation .
Unfortunately the innocent are always involved in any conflict .
Always , everywhere , there is some voice crying from a tower .
I thought , " How much you pride yourself on being dégagé , the reporter , not the leader - writer , and what a mess you make behind the scenes .
The other kind of war is more innocent than this .
One does less damage with a mortar . "
Greene 's personal - political layers work not by flattening the complexity of the relationships but by artfully recognising the connections and drawing them out .
Love of a foreign country and love of its women are honestly expressed as related phenomena ( when Greene was asked why he came to Vietnam he answered " It was partly the beauty of the women - it was extraordinary . " )
The simultaneous desire we all possess for both the liberty of our lovers , and their submission to our will , applies equally to Pyle 's contradictory relationship with Phuong and the country she was born in .
These mirrored applications are where Greene showed himself not only more than a hack but also more skilled than many English novelists .
In this emblematic love triangle Phuong is of course representing Vietnam to some extent , but she is still everywhere her idiosyncratic self .
She is the girl in white dancing better than Pyle , she is curled up in bed reading about Princess Anne .
She keeps her counsel .
One feels that where Greene did not know enough of her life , or could not imagine , he resolved not to describe .
As a result Phuong floats free of her symbolic weights ; she has her own inviolate life in the rue Catinat - buying silk scarves , drinking milkshakes - outside the reach of Fowler 's narrative eye , and thus denying the reader 's base and natural request that she embody her entire country .
We sense a real , breathing woman , not just the idea of a woman that Pyle is trying to steal from Fowler .
Part of Fowler 's battle is to defend her essential Phuong - ness from Pyle 's ossifying rhetoric .
He is only partially successful at this .
There are moments in which Fowler is self - conscious enough to glimpse the fact that his protection of Phuong against Pyle 's idea of her leads him into new caricatures of his own .
In fact , his first - person commentary is often more alert to the dangers of colonial caricature than Greene 's own when the novel seems to fall into a more generalised third person : '" For voices have a colour too , yellow voices sing and black voices gargle , while ours just speak . "
It is to be noted that ideological blind spots like these are first creative failures .
It would have taken a further , fulfilling , imaginative leap on Greene 's part to conceive of what Fowler sounds like to Phuong .
Such lapses are unusual , however .
Despite Fowler , this is a fiercely politically engaged work .
The dissection of political naiveté in the person of Pyle seems to gain in resonance with each year that has passed since publication :
I hope to God you know what you are doing here .
Oh I know your motives are good , they always are ... I wish sometimes you had a few bad motives , you might understand a little more about human beings .
And that applies to your country too , Pyle .
But the quiet American does not learn .
To the end he remains determined that belief is more important than peace , ideas more vital than people .
His worldly innocence is a kind of fundamentalism : he believes that there must be belief .
By hook .
By crook .
Reading the novel again reinforced my fear of all the Pyles around the world .
They do not mean to hurt us , but they do .
Greene 's great achievement is to allow a cynic like Fowler to champion the cause of life by insisting on the authenticity of those deaths Pyle considers to be merely symbolic .
Fowler is at least idealistic enough to believe that there is not an idea on this earth worth killing for .
When Pyle interrogates Fowler as to what , if anything he believes , he says " Oh , I 'm not a Berkeleian .
I believe my back 's against this wall .
I believe there 's a Sten gun over there . "
Pyle replies , " I did n't mean that . "
Greene 's work does mean exactly that .
The hope he offers us is of the kind that only close observers can give .
He defends us with details , and the details fight the good fight against big , featureless , impersonal ideas like Pyle's .
Too much time has been spent defending Greene against the taint of journalism ; we should think of him instead as the greatest journalist there ever was .
If more journalists could report as well as Greene bringing us the explosion in the square , how long could we retain the stomach to fight the wars we do ?
The devil is in the details for Greene , but redemption is also there .
The accretion of perfectly rendered , everyday detail makes us feel human , beats away the statisticians , tolls us back to ourselves .
How many journalists can write reportage - or anything else - like this ?
... he smiled brightly , neatly , efficiently , a military abbreviation of a smile ... the gunfire travelling like a clock - hand around the horizon .
" Will you have a cup of tea ? "
" Thank you , I have had three cups already . "
It sounded like a question and answer in a phrase book .
I have read so often of people 's thoughts in the moment of fear : of God , or family , or a woman .
I admire their control .
I thought of nothing , not even of the trap - door above me : I ceased , for those seconds , to exist : I was fear taken neat .
At the top of the ladder I banged my head because fear could n't count steps , hear , or see .
Then my head came over the earth floor and nobody shot at me and fear seeped away .
When Greene died in 1991 , Kingsley Amis - a man not given to generous estimations of his peers - gave him a neat , fitting obituary : " He will be missed all over the world .
Until today , he was our greatest living novelist . "
Amis 's and Greene 's vision of a great novelist was different from the present conception : it was of a working man with a pen .
An unpretentious man , in and of the world , who wrote for readers and not critics , and produced as many words per day as a journalist .
English writers these days work in spasms , both in quantity and quality , and so keen are they to separate " entertainments " from " literature " that they end up writing neither .
This was one of the few distinctions Greene did not concern himself with .
Reportage turned to novel turned to film ; he got several short stories from the material he found in his own dream diary .
He even occasionally dreamt to order : finding himself stuck in the middle of a novel one day , he went to bed and slept on the problem , waking up in the morning fully furnished with the solution .
" The book was hesitating ... the dream came and seemed to fit . "
Any writer would envy an imagination of such irresistible contrapuntal thrust - he never lacked a story , he was drowning in them .
He famously said that childhood is the credit balance of the novelist , and Greene 's childhood - the misery of his public school , the power struggles with his headmaster father , the teenage seduction of his own psychiatrist 's wife , the flirtations with madness and God - well , he was never , ever going to be in the red .
There are many natural storytellers in English literature , but what was rare about Greene was the control he wielded over his abundant material .
Certainly one can imagine nobody who could better weave the complicated threads of war - torn Indochina into a novel as linear , as thematically compact and as enjoyable as The Quiet American .

Engineers have been installing a new protection system for the LHC 's magnets
The organisation that operates the Large Hadron Collider has set a date for the start of its science programme .
On Tuesday 30 March , engineers at Cern will make their first attempt to collide beams at an energy of 3.5 trillion electronvolts ( TeV ) per beam .
The LHC reached this beam energy last week , breaking its own particle beam energy record .
But , among other things , engineers will need to ensure the beams are stable at 3.5 TeV before trying for collisions .
The LHC will search for the elusive Higgs boson , dubbed the " God particle " because of its importance to our understanding of physics .
Getting beams circulating is one thing .
Having them circulate for a reasonable lifetime is another
James Gillies
Director of communications , Cern " Symbolically , the start of the LHC research programme is when we start systematically colliding beams for physics at the energy we have chosen for this year , " Cern 's director of communications Dr James Gillies , told BBC News .
" That 's what we 're hoping for a week today . "
Steve Myers , director for accelerators and technology at Cern , explained : " With two beams at 3.5 TeV , we 're on the verge of launching the LHC physics programme .
" But we 've still got a lot of work to do before collisions .
Just lining the beams up is a challenge in itself .
It 's a bit like firing needles across the Atlantic and getting them to collide half way . "
' Golden orbit '
The experiment , housed in a 27 km - long tunnel under the Franco - Swiss border near Geneva in Switzerland , has only been back online since November 2009 .
WHAT IS AN ELECTRON VOLT ?
Charged particles tend to speed up in an electric field , defined as an electric potential - or voltage - spread over a distance
One electron volt ( eV ) is the energy gained by a single electron as it accelerates through a potential of one volt
It is a convenient unit of measure for particle accelerators , which speed particles up through much higher electric potentials
The first accelerators only created bunches of particles with an energy of about a million eV ( MeV )
The LHC can reach beam energies a million times higher : up to several teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) This is still only the energy in the motion of a flying mosquito But LHC beams include trillions of these particles , each travelling at more than 99.99 % of the speed of light A magnet fault caused one tonne of liquid helium to leak into the tunnel in 2008 , shortly after the machine was first switched on , requiring a programme of repairs that lasted 14 months .
Between now and 30 March , the LHC 's team will be working to commission the beam control systems and the systems that protect the machine 's detectors , or experiments , from stray particles .
All these systems must be fully commissioned before collisions at 3.5 TeV can begin , Cern says .
" Getting beams circulating is one thing .
Having them circulate for a reasonable lifetime is another .
Having a ' golden orbit ' - where the beams complete lap after lap after lap for hours - is important , " Dr Gillies said .
" All of these things you have to do before the machine operators can say : ' the beams are now stable , you can switch on the detectors . "
The LHC is being used to smash together beams of proton particles in a bid to shed light on the nature of the Universe .
Some 1,200 superconducting magnets bend proton beams in opposite directions around the tunnel at close to the speed of light .
At allotted points around the tunnel , the proton beams cross paths , allowing particles to smash into one another .
Detectors located at the crossing points will scour the wreckage of these collisions for discoveries that extend our knowledge of physics .

Another possible option is to attempt to raise fish on our own property .
On a very small scale , we read instructions such as these :
If we are short on food in general , one of my first concerns would be overfishing of lakes , streams , and areas that are easy to access with small boats ( or with large ones ) .
This is really a Tragedy of the Commons issue -- what seems to be good for one , if pursued by all , will deplete the fish stock , and there will be less for everyone .
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this problem ?
It seems like fish has been a significant food source , for a very long time .
In fact , the oceans are badly overfished because of this .
My question is , " What sustainable ways are there to continue to eat fish in the future ? "
You can , from your own back yard , raise fish to eat for a fraction of what it costs in the stores .
You can rear catfish , carp , bluegill or bass from fingerling size to adulthood in nothing bigger than a 55 gallon barrel by following the steps in this guide .
Step 1
Find a location for your fish .
Search for a level area approximately 12 square feet in size , in partial shade , near a source of water or within reach of your garden hose .
Step 2
Prepare your fish barrel .
Clean both barrels and rinse well .
Place 4 inches of gravel on the bottom of one barrel and situate the filter firmly in the substrate .
Step 3
Attach a circulation pump or aerator to the fish barrel to ensure there is adequate oxygen in the water and secure a garden hoseto the bottom of the barrel to ease in the daily replacement of the tank water .
Step 4
Attach a thermometer to the side of the barrel in a location which will allow the bulb to be submerged .
The ideal temperature for your fish tank is between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit .
If it is consistently too hot or too cold , you will have to relocate the tank to get more or less sun , accordingly .
Step 5
Fill the barrel and treat the water with commercial de-chlorination treatment drops .
Cover the barrel with a pane of glass .
Allow the barrel to sit for 48 hours , so the temperature of the water can stabilize .
The guide goes on for quite a few more steps .
Clearly this method depends on our current infrastructure for sustainability , but it is an interesting hobby .
Issues of maintaining water quality are pretty much pushed off on someone else .
You keep replacing water in the tank with fresh water , and dumping the polluted water out .
Another idea , if you have a lake or pond ( or even left over swimming pool ) is to stock it with fish .
I would think there would be a lot of ins and outs to know , to do this successfully .
One issue is adequate aeration ; another is pollution with too many fish ; a third is freezing weather in winter .
On a larger scale , I can imagine people setting up local fish farms .
Whether or not it is a good idea , people will put cages in streams and try to grow fish in cages .
I would expect ocean fishing would continue , since boats can be made to run on almost fuel ( including wind ) , and their actual fuel use is pretty low .
If there is a bottleneck , it would be in refrigerating and transporting fresh fish long distances , after they have been caught .
It seems like over - fishing of fish in the ocean would continue to be a problem .
Mercury Pollution Issues
One thing that concerns me about fish is the mercury pollution issue .
The EPA is fairly sanguine about this issue :
Research shows that most people 's fish consumption does not cause a health concern .
Elevated methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the developing nervous system , impairing the child 's ability to learn and process information .
However , certain sub-populations are at higher risk than the general population because of their routinely high consumption of fish and shellfish ( e.g. , tribal and other subsistence fishers and their families who rely heavily on locally caught fish for the majority of their diet ) .
Mercury concentrations in fish vary widely .
While local freshwater fish also contain methylmercury , the majority of fish species consumed in the U.S. are ocean species and the methylmercury concentrations in these species are primarily influenced by the global mercury pool .
Fish that are higher in the food chain -- such as king mackerel , swordfish , tilefish , and shark -- have much higher methylmercury concentrations than fish that are lower in the food chain .
But pollution levels of lakes are not good , if we are thinking of using them as a more major source of our food .
A news article from 2009 reports :
The EPA ’s new report , National Study of Chemical Residues in Lake Fish Tissue , found mercury in all fish from 500 lakes sampled randomly across the continental U.S.
The data also showed mercury concentrations in game fish exceed EPA ’s human health screening levels at 49 % of the lakes nationwide .
The EPA is taking steps to limit mercury emissions from power plants within the United States .
However , Mercury Policy Project ’s director Michael Bender points out , “ Two - thirds of the mercury that ’s rained on Vermont and the U.S. comes from Asia and elsewhere outside the U.S. ”
Therefore , the international pollution control treaty in the works could have an even greater impact on the U.S .
This study related to predators and bottom dwellers , which would seem to be the fish most affected by mercury pollution .
Questions
1 . How do we keep from over - fishing lakes and streams ?
2 . What experiences have you had with raising fish at home ?
Would you recommend it for others ?
3 . Has anyone worked with mercury pollution ?
I wonder whether the thresholds set by the EPA are low enough .
How do we know what a " safe " mercury level is ?
I read articles like Autism Risk Linked To Distance From Power Plants , Other Mercury - Releasing Sources and Exposure To Low Doses Of Mercury Changes The Way The Arteries Work and wonder .

Disaster duly followed .
Is there any reason to think this scenario is n't worse now , more likely to be repeated ?
While some people worry about inflation , and others about a double dip recession , what 's actually happened is that we 're back in the same boom / bust cycle .
Of course I understand that the various government actions have helped .
That 's the point .
There is nothing that will prevent this from happening again .

Is n't that worse ?
Of course I understand that CEOs are corrupt and Bush lied and [ random Huffington Post link here ] .
Enough , I get it .
But have you changed ?
Doing anything differently ?
Instead of buying yet another identity signal , have you saved the money for the kid you do n't even have yet ?
Blame the CEOs if you want , they do n't shop at Aeropostale and if they do they can afford it .
So ?
The problem and solution is you .
It has to start with you .
It is always you .

Of course I know Bear Stearns went under , I was watching TV when it happened .

A more cynical person , though , might think that AZ simply used the " recession " as an excuse to lay people off , and get fewer workers to do more .
And a paranoid would think this : there 's a popular idea that in a recession , the government should create jobs programs / public works projects .
But what if it 's the other way ?
What if the government had some projects it needed done ?

So either we have the same amount of money we had in 2007 and are spending the same , or we have less than 2007 and are spending more .

More than half a century before Alfred Kinsey started to study the surprising diversity of human sexual behaviour , Stanford professor Clelia Mosher surveyed Victorian - era women on their bedroom behaviour but buried the results .
Her report , its accidental discovery , and the sex lives of 1890s women are covered in a fascinating article for Stanford Magazine .
Mosher was an amazing woman by all accounts and took a scientific approach to testing some of the ‘ received wisdom ’ of the day , such as that women were inherently weaker and that menstruation was necessarily disabling .
As part of her work , she surveyed women on their experience of sex and sexuality , much as Kinsey would do many decades later .
Slightly more than half of these educated women claimed to have known nothing of sex prior to marriage ; the better informed said they ’d gotten their information from books , talks with older women and natural observations like “ watching farm animals . ”
Yet no matter how sheltered they ’d initially been , these women had ‚Äîand enjoyed ‚Äîsex .
Of the 45 women , 35 said they desired sex ; 34 said they had experienced orgasms ; 24 felt that pleasure for both sexes was a reason for intercourse ; and about three - quarters of them engaged in it at least once a week .
Unlike Mosher ’s other work , the survey is more qualitative than quantitative , featuring open - ended questions probing feelings and experiences .
“ She ’s actually asking these questions not about physiology or mechanics ‚Äîshe ’s really asking about sexual subjectivity and the meaning of sex to women , ” Freedman says .
Their responses were often mixed .
Some enjoyed sex but worried that they should n’t .
One slept apart from her husband “ to avoid temptation of too frequent intercourse . ”
Some did n’t enjoy sex but faulted their partner .
Mosher writes : [ She ]
“ Thinks men have not been properly trained . ”
The whole article is an amazing read , both because Mosher was clearly such a pioneering researcher in a largely male dominated world and because her survey overturns many of our stereotypes about Victorian sexuality .

Wow , less than 24 hours after putting his hands on it , Dev-Team member Musclenerd just tweeted that apparently , he already managed to jailbreak the iPad .
His tweet , consisting of the screenshot above and the announcement :
" initial porting of " Spirit " jailbreak by @comex to iPad "
shows that he can already remotely access the iPad 's entire file system and run programs on it .
Needless to say this is huge folks ;
First of all , Musclenerd is one of the main actors of the jailbreak scene and can definitely be trusted on this one and secondly , the fact that he already made it this far means that we 'll be getting Cydia on there in no time .
*** Update 1
Now in video ( youtube link ) :
Several behavioral economic games have been devised to study prosocial behavior .
Two of the most famous ones are the two - person Ultimatum and Dictator games , hereafter referred to as UG and DG .
In the UG , individual A is given a sum of money ( e. . , $ 10 ) and asked to split this amount with individual B .
Once a split is offered , individual B can either accept the split in which case they each receive their respective shares , or he / she can refuse it , and in this case neither receives any monetary amount .
Classic economic theory posits that individual A should offer the smallest possible denomination .
For example , if the ten dollars are available as 40 quarters then he / she should offer a quarter as from the perspective of individual B , the utility of receiving $ 0.25 is better than receiving nothing .
The DG is similar to the UG with one key difference : individual B has no veto power .
In this case , classic economic theory suggests that individual A should offer nothing !
Of course , the world inhabited by classical economists is different from the one that we live in .
Hence , it is no surprise that countless studies have shown that people are much more generous than is expected by axioms of rational choice .
Several years ago , one of my former doctoral students ( Tripat Gill ) and I conducted experimental studies on both the UG and DG with the expressed intent of exploring whether the composition of the two players would have an effect on the amount offered by individual A .
Of the four possible dyads , male - male , male - female , female - male , and female - female , which do you think yielded the highest and lowest offers ?
Whenever I ask this question to my students whilst lecturing , they come up with all sorts of interesting answers .
Think about it for a moment prior to reading on .
Using an evolutionary psychological perspective , we theorized that in the context of a resource - based game ( as is the case with both the UG and DG ) , men would be differentially generous to women ( as a means of signaling , altruism , etc. ) whereas they would be maximally competitive when facing other men ( as a form of intra-sexual rivalry ) .
Women would be equally generous irrespective of the sex of the opposing individual B .
Here is what we found ( using $ 10 as the amount to be shared ) :
In the UG In the DG
Male - Male : $ 4.25 Male - Male : $ 1.23
Male - Female : $ 5.17 Male - Female : $ 2.15
Female - Male : $ 5.00 Female - Male : $ 1.87
Female - Female : $ 4.93 Female - Female : $ 2.55
In both instances , our hypothesis was confirmed , namely , only men display differential behavior ( statistically significantly so ) as a function of the sex of the person that they are facing .
In both games , men gave more to women than they did to men .
No such effect was found for women , as they did not differentiate on the basis of the sex of their opposing partner .
This does not mean that women are not as competitive with their same - sex cohorts .
Rather , they are less likely to express this rivalry using financial resources .
Did you predict these findings ?
If so , you might be a closeted evolutionary psychologist ! ☺
Have a good Sunday .
Ciao for now .

In some parts of the country , rhubarb will soon start to show up in local markets .
First used for medicinal purposes in China as early as 2700 B.C. , rhubarb is perhaps best known as a pie filling , despite numerous other applications .
The leaves of rhubarb can be toxic , but they are normally removed and cleaned before they are sold .
When shopping for rhubarb , look for long , firm , and fleshy stalks for optimal taste and freshness .

' It just shows she 's confident ' : New assistant Karen Gillan defends her short skirts in sexed - up Doctor Who
So far we 've seen her raise a few eyebrows in a mini-skirt and battling aliens in a soaking wet shirt .
But Karen Gillan today defended criticism that Doctor Who producers were ' shamelessly sexing up ' the long - running sci- fi show .
The model - turned - actress , 22 , appeared on This Morning where she spoke about her new role telling hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that the sexy looks are all part of the show .

After Holly Willoughby told her ' We think you ’re the sexiest companion there ’s been ! , she said : ' She wears lots of short skirts … and it got a few column mentions !
It ’s interesting , it ’s part of the plot and it ’s not that bad . '
Following her debut at the weekend , Miss Gillan 's appearance was labelled ' slutty ' by a small section of fans who objected to her first appearance on screen in a policewoman 's outfit with a tiny skirt .
In one scene her character tells the Doctor , played by Matt Smith , that her kissogram repertoire also includes nuns and nurses ' outfits .

No mini skirts here : Karen wore a more demure look for her appearance on the show
Gillan grew up in Inverness but moved to London to join the Italia Conti academy in London .
During her first year she landed a role in Rebus .
She previously defended the mini skirt in the Big Issue .
' I mean , look down most high streets and girls Amy 's age wear that .
It 's not that weird .
' Short skirts show that Amy is confident and comfortable about her look .
You have to have confidence to wear something like that .'
Raising eyebrows : Karen Gillan in character , left , and , right , pictured at a photocall in Manchester to launch the new series of the show
And , this coming Saturday , her character Amy Pond , is seen battling aliens in a shirt that becomes sheer when she gets soaked .
No doubt , certain factions will accuse the show 's producers of turning it into some kind of wet T - shirt competition .
Gillan also described the secrecy that surrounded her audition process .
Drenched : The Doctor , Matt Smith , and his assistant Amy Pond are soaked to the skin after a terrifying encounter with a creature called The Beast Below
She revealed : ' I could n’t tell main reception why I was there , I had to go there and tell them that I was going there for something called Panic Moon which is an anagram of Companion .
' And then I was n’t allowed to tell any of my family or friends that I was auditioning and then I had to keep it a secret when I got the role which was quite agonising !'
' To keep it from my mum – who is one of the biggest Doctor Who fans for two weeks was tough - I was allowed to tell her but decided against it , because I think she would ’ve burst .
' She would ’ve told somebody , she even has the Dalek bubble bath !
But I just remember her face when I told her I got it …it was a picture , it was amazing . '

Who is on BBC1 on Saturday at 6.15 pm
Nearly every country in the world has an intelligence agency that is charged with espionage in order to protect its own interests in all aspects , including economic , political and military interests .
While some of these agencies have agreements to share information with others for greater impact , others are very secretive and make it a point to share with no one .
It is widely known that many countries have spies in other areas of the world for the purpose of gathering intelligence data .
Who these spies are and exactly how they operate is more secretive in nature .
1 : ISI ( Pakistan )
The Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence ( more commonly known as Inter - Services Intelligence or simply by its initials ISI ) , is Pakistan ’s premier intelligence agency , responsible for providing critical national security intelligence assessment to the Government of Pakistan .
The ISI is the largest of the three intelligence service agencies of Pakistan , the others being the Intelligence Bureau ( IB ) and Military Intelligence ( MI ) .
It is the successor of the IB and MI formed after the Indo - Pakistani War of 1947 to coordinate and operate espionage activities for the three branches of the Pakistan Armed Forces .
The ISI was established as an independent intelligence agency in 1948 in order to strengthen the sharing of military intelligence between the three branches of Pakistan ’s armed forces in the wake aftermath of the Indo - Pakistani War of 1947 , which had exposed weaknesses in intelligence gathering , sharing and coordination between the Army , Air Force and Navy .
2 : U.S. Intelligence Agencies
The United States of America ’s intelligence community is made up of sixteen different agencies .
Most notable and recognizable on that list are the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
While in the past these agencies operated in mostly isolated states , the sharing of intelligence information has increased considerably since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The CIA is the largest of the intelligence agencies and is responsible for gathering data from other countries that could impact U.S. policy .
The NSA is the country ’s intelligence agency responsible for intercepting and deciphering foreign signals while protecting the information systems of the United States .
The DIA gathers intelligence information that is pertinent to military operations around the world while the FBI is the link between the intelligence and law enforcement communities in the country .
3 : CSIS ( Canada )
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service is responsible for intelligence gathering on a domestic level .
The agency does not have the authority to work on foreign intelligence and its main objective is to protect Canada from national threats .
It works closely with intelligence agencies from other countries , including the United States .
4 : ASIS ( Australia )
The Australian Secret Intelligence Service was founded in 1952 .
For more than twenty years , the existence of the agency was a secret even from its own government .
Its primary responsibility is gathering intelligence from mainly Asian and Pacific interests using agents stationed in a wide variety of areas .
Its main purpose , as with most agencies , is to protect the country ’s political and economic interests while ensuring safety for the people of Australia against national threats .
5 : Mossad ( Israel )
The Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks is the intelligence agency of Israel .
Also widely known as Mossad , it was founded in 1951 .
The agency has always operated in a secret state and , until the mid-90s , the identity of the director of the agency was even regarded as a secret .
Mossad is responsible for gathering intelligence data using human field agents throughout the Middle East .
While other countries are also included , their main focus is on countries in their own region .
Current estimates number their force at just over one thousand agents .
6 : BND ( Germany )
The Federal Intelligence Service of Germany is referred to as BND .
The agency sees almost the entire world as an opportunity for intelligence gathering with agents stationed in more than one hundred countries .
BND is widely known for sending agents in as undercover embassy workers to gather intelligence data .
The agency employs more than four thousand worldwide .
7 : DGSE ( France )
The General Directorate for External Security ( DGSE ) of France has a rather short history compared to other intelligence agencies in the region .
It was officially founded in 1982 from a multitude of prior intelligence agencies in the country .
Its primary focus is to gather intelligence from foreign sources to assist in military and strategic decisions for the country .
The agency employs more than five thousand people .
8 : GRU ( Russia )
The Main Intelligence Administration or GRU , largely came into play after the fall of the Soviet Union .
Its main task is gathering military intelligence data both on domestic and foreign levels .
Even though its staff size is smaller than the intelligence agencies under the Soviet Union , the GRU still remains an important player in the world intelligence community and is regarded as a professional force .
Russia and China have a signed treaty for the sharing of intelligence information between their agencies .
9 : MI6 ( UK )
The Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom , also known as MI6 , has a long history dating back to 1909 .
The agency ’s main office is in London and it is responsible for gathering information from across the globe that could impact political and economic interests in the UK .
MI6 has a strong focus on terrorism , weapons of mass destruction and crimes of a serious nature that have the potential to impact the entire region .
10 : MSS ( China )
The current intelligence agency of China , the Ministry of State Security , was founded in 1983 .
Its main objective is to gather intelligence on those that could be seen as enemies with the goal of overthrowing or otherwise dismantling the socialist government of China .
The MSS has agents stationed throughout the world posing as ordinary citizens .
The MSS has a primary interest in the United States and has many agents posted throughout the Silicon Valley in California .
11 : RAW ( India )
India ’s intelligence agency is known as the Research and Analysis Wing or RAW .
It is sometimes also abbreviated as R&AW .
RAW was founded in 1968 with its main objective to gather intelligence about its neighbor , Pakistan .
Throughout the years , Pakistan has continued to be a primary target of its intelligence gathering efforts .
It is estimated that RAW employs more than eight thousand field agents in various locations throughout the world .

Tunecore has been a boon for musicians like Trent Reznor , who pay the Brooklyn - based company a flat fee of $ 40 or so and then see their music available for sale on Amazon , iTunes , and eMusic .
The copyrights all remain in the artists ' hands , as do the revenues ; after paying the flat fee , 100 percent of the payout returns to the artists .
( The digital stores take their cut first , of course . )
Today , Tunecore announced that it would extend this model to e-books through a service called Bibliocore .
After an upfront payment , the e-book is delivered to Apple 's iBookstore , rights remain with the author , and Bibliocore takes no cut of the royalties .
To participate , you need a few basic things .
First , you need an ePub formatted book that has passed the 1.0.5 ePub check , contains no unmanifested files , and has its own ISBN number .
Second , you need some cover art , at least 600 pixels " along the larger axis . "
Third , you fill out some metadata and set the price .
Boom .
The service , now launching in beta , does n't currently offer listed prices ; interested authors must e-mail for a custom quote .
Along with numerous other services like Smashwords , Bibliocore makes it simple to get books into the iBookstore .
But once you 're in , then what ?
Authors face the challenges of abundance that musicians have faced for the last decade .
How do you get noticed ?
Who will help you market your work ?
How does one book a reading tour ?
For those who already have an established audience , such services look like an incredible way to up one 's royalty percentage on each sale — at the cost of being much more entrepreneurial about spreading the word , getting a cover designed , generating blurbs , getting an ISBN , buying all that brie for the launch party ...
But if you 're ready to become youre own indie publisher , it 's quickly becoming simple to do .
Companies like Smashwords can even distribute to multiple stores , including Barnes & Noble , Amazon , and now the iBookstore , saving would - be authors even more work .
Publishers have been watching the music biz carefully , and have hopefully learned some lessons .
They 're about to face the same pressures : infringement gets easier , disintermediation means that publishers are n't the gatekeepers to quality work they once were , and digital storefronts can soon start dictating terms to you if they grow too powerful .
Print - on - demand has done its own disintermediation work for the last five years , but the sheer ease of the new devices and the digital storefronts , along with their recent popularity , look set to bring a whole new level of entrepreneurial activity to the book world — and that probably means more pain for traditional publishers .
Twice a month , we revisit some of our readers ’ favorite posts from throughout the history of Nettuts +.
Even after using PHP for years , we stumble upon functions and features that we did not know about .
Some of these can be quite useful , yet underused .
With that in mind , I 've compiled a list of nine incredibly useful PHP functions and features that you should be familiar with .
1. Functions with Arbitrary Number of Arguments
You may already know that PHP allows you to define functions with optional arguments .
But there is also a method for allowing completely arbitrary number of function arguments .
First , here is an example with just optional arguments :
Now , let 's see how we can build a function that accepts any number of arguments .
This time we are going to utilize func_get_args ( ) :
2. Using Glob ( ) to Find Files
Many PHP functions have long and descriptive names .
However it may be hard to tell what a function named glob ( ) does unless you are already familiar with that term from elsewhere .
Think of it like a more capable version of the scandir ( ) function .
It can let you search for files by using patterns .
You can fetch multiple file types like this :
Note that the files can actually be returned with a path , depending on your query :
If you want to get the full path to each file , you can just call the realpath ( ) function on the returned values :
3. Memory Usage Information
By observing the memory usage of your scripts , you may be able optimize your code better .
PHP has a garbage collector and a pretty complex memory manager .
The amount of memory being used by your script .
can go up and down during the execution of a script .
To get the current memory usage , we can use the memory_get_usage ( ) function , and to get the highest amount of memory used at any point , we can use the memory_get_peak_usage ( ) function .
4. CPU Usage Information
For this , we are going to utilize the getrusage ( ) function .
Keep in mind that this is not available on Windows platforms .
That may look a bit cryptic unless you already have a system administration background .
Here is the explanation of each value ( you do n't need to memorize these ) :
ru_oublock : block output operations
block output operations ru_inblock : block input operations
block input operations ru_msgsnd : messages sent
messages sent ru_msgrcv : messages received
messages received ru_maxrss : maximum resident set size
maximum resident set size ru_ixrss : integral shared memory size
integral shared memory size ru_idrss : integral unshared data size
integral unshared data size ru_minflt : page reclaims
page reclaims ru_majflt : page faults
page faults ru_nsignals : signals received
signals received ru_nvcsw : voluntary context switches
voluntary context switches ru_nivcsw : involuntary context switches
involuntary context switches ru_nswap : swaps
swaps ru_utime .
tv_usec : user time used ( microseconds )
user time used ( microseconds ) ru_utime .
tv_sec : user time used ( seconds )
user time used ( seconds ) ru_stime .
tv_usec : system time used ( microseconds )
system time used ( microseconds ) ru_stime .
tv_sec : system time used ( seconds )
To see how much CPU power the script has consumed , we need to look at the ' user time ' and ' system time ' values .
The seconds and microseconds portions are provided separately by default .
You can divide the microseconds value by 1 million , and add it to the seconds value , to get the total seconds as a decimal number .
Let 's see an example :
Even though the script took about 3 seconds to run , the CPU usage was very very low .
Because during the sleep operation , the script actually does not consume CPU resources .
There are many other tasks that may take real time , but may not use CPU time , like waiting for disk operations .
So as you see , the CPU usage and the actual length of the runtime are not always the same .
Here is another example :
That took about 1.4 seconds of CPU time , almost all of which was user time , since there were no system calls .
System
Time is the amount of time the CPU spends performing system calls for the kernel on the program 's behalf .
Here is an example of that :
Now we have quite a bit of system time usage .
This is because the script calls the microtime ( ) function many times , which performs a request through the operating system to fetch the time .
Also you may notice the numbers do not quite add up to 3 seconds .
This is because there were probably other processes on the server as well , and the script was not using 100 % CPU for the whole duration of the 3 seconds .
5. Magic Constants
PHP provides useful magic constants for fetching the current line number ( __LINE__ ) , file path ( __FILE__ ) , directory path ( __DIR__ ) , function name ( __FUNCTION__ ) , class name ( __CLASS__ ) , method name ( __METHOD__ ) and namespace ( __NAMESPACE__ ) .
We are not going to cover each one of these in this article , but I will show you a few use cases .
When including other scripts , it is a good idea to utilize the __FILE__ constant ( or also __DIR__ , as of PHP 5.3 ) :
Using __LINE__ makes debugging easier .
You can track down the line numbers :
6. Generating Unique ID's
There may be situations where you need to generate a unique string .
I have seen many people use the md5 ( ) function for this , even though it 's not exactly meant for this purpose :
There is actually a PHP function named uniqid ( ) that is meant to be used for this .
You may notice that even though the strings are unique , they seem similar for the first several characters .
This is because the generated string is related to the server time .
This actually has a nice side effect , as every new generated id comes later in alphabetical order , so they can be sorted .
To reduce the chances of getting a duplicate , you can pass a prefix , or the second parameter to increase entropy :
This function will generate shorter strings than md5 ( ) , which will also save you some space .
7. Serialization
Have you ever needed to store a complex variable in a database or a text file ?
You do not have to come up with a fancy solution to convert your arrays or objects into formatted strings , as PHP already has functions for this purpose .
There are two popular methods of serializing variables .
Here is an example that uses the serialize ( ) and unserialize ( ) :
This was the native PHP serialization method .
However , since JSON has become so popular in recent years , they decided to add support for it in PHP 5.2 .
Now you can use the json_encode ( ) and json_decode ( ) functions as well :
It is more compact , and best of all , compatible with javascript and many other languages .
However , for complex objects , some information may be lost .
8. Compressing Strings
When talking about compression , we usually think about files , such as ZIP archives .
It is possible to compress long strings in PHP , without involving any archive files .
In the following example we are going to utilize the gzcompress ( ) and gzuncompress ( ) functions :
We were able to achive almost 50 % size reduction .
Also the functions gzencode ( ) and gzdecode ( ) achive similar results , by using a different compression algorithm .
9. Register Shutdown Function
There is a function called register_shutdown_function ( ) , which will let you execute some code right before the script finishes running .
Imagine that you want to capture some benchmark statistics at the end of your script execution , such as how long it took to run :
At first this may seem trivial .
You just add the code to the very bottom of the script and it runs before it finishes .
However , if you ever call the exit ( ) function , that code will never run .
Also , if there is a fatal error , or if the script is terminated by the user ( by pressing the Stop button in the browser ) , again it may not run .
When you use register_shutdown_function ( ) , your code will execute no matter why the script has stopped running :
Conclusion
Are you aware of any other PHP features that are not widely known but can be quite useful ?

Outspoken Rep. Alan Grayson Alan Mark GraysonFlorida's Darren Soto fends off
Dem challenge from Alan Grayson Live results : Arizona and Florida hold primaries The Hill 's Morning Report : Frustration mounts as Republicans blow up tax message MORE ( D - Fla . ) criticized Sarah Palin , Chief Justice John Roberts and the Tea Party on Bill Maher 's HBO show .
Grayson compared tea partiers to a character in the movie " Nemo " who can't remember anything that happened more than a year ago .
He said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) is trying to make " fascism fashionable . "
And he mocked Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy for being out of touch with technology .
During a recent case before the high court , Kennedy asked what would happen if a text message was sent to someone who was sending a text at that same moment .
Roberts asked what was the difference between an e-mail and a pager .
Some say Roberts 's comments were taken out of context , asserting he was asking that question as it relates to privacy rights .
Grayson is not in that group , saying , " Some people are literally feeling they are being dragged , kicking and screaming , into the 21st Century and you just described two of them . "

The Florida lawmaker , who is one of the GOP 's top targets this fall , disputed characterizations by Matthew Continetti of right - leaningthat the media has been unfair to Palin .
" I think she 's gotten a pass from the media , " Grayson said , adding , " She 's trying to make fascism fashionable and she gets away with it .
" Grayson claimed that Palin " dropped out of college four times , " but both Continetti and Maher pointed out that the former vice presidential candidate changed colleges four times .
( CNN ) -- Police arrested a 64 - year - old Washington state resident who authorities say made death threats against Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington , the Justice Department announced Tuesday .
A department statement said the suspect , identified as Charles Alan Wilson of Selah , Washington , made the threats in phone messages to Murray 's office between March 22 and April 4 .
Wilson allegedly stated that Murray " had a target on her back " and that he wanted to kill her , according to the statement , which said the threats were in response to congressional passage of the new health care bill .
According to the statement , Wilson allegedly " told undercover FBI agents that he regularly carries a firearm with a concealed weapons permit " and " also stated that he was extremely angry about the passage of the health care reform legislation . "
A statement from Murray 's office said that after receiving the phone calls , staff contacted the Capitol Police Department , which advised them to contact the FBI .
The office declined to comment further , citing the ongoing investigation .
" Senator Murray will continue to focus on working for the people of Washington state , " the statement said .
Threatening a federal official is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine , the Justice Department statement said .
Threats against U.S. senators and representatives increased as Congress held its final debates and votes on the health care bill , which was unanimously opposed by Republicans .
In addition , conservative activists around the country protested the bill .
Most of the reported threats were against Democrats , though there were some against Republicans .

Playing with Fire on April Fools ’
Playing with Campfire marshmallows , that is .
Although we will also play with real fire too .
I received a HUGE box full of delightful marshmallows yesterday ( thanks to Doumak , Inc. ) , so I figured I could use them somehow for April Fools ’ Day .
If you have n’t already thought of a prank or two , pick up a few bags of marshmallows at the grocery store and note the following :
1. Remove your roommate ’s pillows from their cases , and fill the cases with bags of marshmallows .
Place the real pillows in the freezer .
** It ’s fun to stick stuff in the freezer ….
and it pisses people off .
Try it .
2. Play Vanessa Carlton ’s “ A Thousand Miles ” over and over ( in the office ) until all of your co-workers are annoyed .
Then offer them ear plugs , but give them each matching pairs of mini fruit flavored marshmallows .
3. Microwave 4 - 5 marshmallows in a clear glass for 15 seconds .
Allow it to cool .
Then walk towards a friend / co - worker and pretend to trip and fall .
Make sure to point the glass of milk towards him / her !
4 . Offer to make dinner for your friends and / or family .
Tell them you will make seared scallops with Beluga caviar in a brown butter sauce .
Here is how you will do it :
• Cut off the tops of 3 regular white marshmallows with a pair of kitchen scissors to give your scallops a slightly edgier edge .
“ Sear ” the tops and edges with a lighter , blowtorch , or by using the flame from a gas stove ( just stick the other end of your marshmallow with a metal fork or chopstick ) .
Remember , this trick can also apply for when you simply crave a roasted marshmallow but do n’t feel like building a fire .
• Cut 3 thin slices of kiwi .
These will be cucumber garnishes .
• Place the marshmallows on top of each kiwi slice .
Using a black gel icing pen , dot Beluga caviar pieces on the tops of each scallop .
• Melt and brown 2 tbsp of butter with 1 tbsp of sugar over medium heat .
Drizzle the brown butter sauce over the seared scallops and serve !
Mmmmm …. so good !
But not in the way your friends and family will expect .
Tell me how it goes ….
Until next time ….
xoxo
HH Contessa
This week he told the Kalmar newspaper : " It 's not acceptable for a priest to fall asleep in the middle of a call ; this should not happen when you call up in search of help .
I felt bad and wanted to kill myself , but I pulled myself together and made the call .
I am very disappointed . "
With just a couple of weeks until the World Cup begins , this was a game posing more questions than offering solutions for Fabio Capello .
Whilst England recorded a 3 - 1 win , they were outplayed and outpassed by a technically superior Mexico side for large parts of the game .
Few individual performances stood out for England – Glen Johnson was awarded the man - of - the - match award , presumably solely for goal , but this was one of his weaker displays ; he looked very uncomfortable up against Mexico ’s extremely high winger , and contributed little in attack .
That he was England ’s best player sums up what a poor show it was .
Capello was expected to try a different shape for this game , with a possible 3 - 5 - 2 system rumoured last week , followed by suggestions he could play two out - and - out wingers either side of Wayne Rooney .
In the end , Capello went with the modified 4 - 4 - 2 he played throughout qualification , which was a little disappointing for those who wanted to see him try something different , but gave us a chance to analyse this shape in detail , and it remains the system England will most likely play against the USA in their opening World Cup game .
First , we should make clear that there were notable absences from this game .
The players who contested last week ’s FA Cup Final were not considered ; John Terry , Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard would surely all have started tonight ’s game .
Gareth Barry , too , is absent through injury , though with him battling to be fit for the World Cup , it was an opportunity to test out alternative midfield options , so James Milner and Michael Carrick dovetailed in midfield .
The basic formation
Hopefully the basic 4 - 4 - 2 shape should become clear above .
When Rooney drops off , it becomes a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 , when the wide players push on , it becomes a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 .
But the basic starting shape is a 4 - 4 - 2 .
The modifications to the system basically start with Steven Gerrard ( marked in pink ) .
England have notoriously not had a decent left - winger for decades , and Gerrard fills this role by playing very narrow , always looking to come inside and link with Wayne Rooney .
His narrow position means that Leighton Baines ( marked in green ; to be replaced by Ashley Cole for the World Cup ) has license to get forward on the overlap , and the fact that Gerrard has drawn his marker inside has opened up a lot of space for Baines to exploit here – he has a 15 - 20 yard band of space all to himself on the left .
On the opposite flank , the situation is rather different .
Theo Walcott ( marked in yellow ; vying with Aaron Lennon for the right - wing position ) keeps his width at all times , hugging the touchline and stretching the play .
He is rarely involved in the build - up play other than from long diagonal balls to him , and the basic idea is to isolate the full - back , and get England ’s right - winger running against him at pace .
Walcott ’s wide role means there is relatively little space to be exploited by Glen Johnson , the right - back ( marked in blue ) , and here he remains more level with his centre - backs than Baines does .
The defensive nature of Johnson ’s role is probably partly why Jamie Carragher appears to be his natural replacement , rather than a more typically rampaging right - back .
In midfield , Michael Carrick and James Milner ( marked in red ) play as a traditional partnership in a 4 - 4 - 2 .
Neither had the holding role , neither had more license to attack , although Carrick ’s natural tendencies means he dropped deep to receive the ball from the centre - backs more often .
Upfront , Peter Crouch and Wayne Rooney do not have ‘ fixed ’ positions to one side .
When England do n’t have the ball , Rooney tends to drop to the left , but when they do , Crouch ( marked in purple ) takes up a position on the opposite side to where the ball is , pulling off the centre - back and providing the option for a long , diagonal ball .
Evolution in possession
When Gerrard comes in a lot from the left , England look a better side .
Here , he has drifted in further , and creates a midfield triangle with Carrick and Milner ( marked in pink ) .
This allows Carrick to drop deep to receive and have time on the ball .
When this happens , Baines ( marked in yellow ) finds himself in even more space at left - back , whilst Wayne Rooney tends to drift towards that side too ( run marked in orange ) , creating a left - sided option high up the pitch .
As mentioned earlier , Crouch ( marked in green ) tends to drift from side to side , according to which flank the ball is on .
Here , he takes up a position outside Mexico ’s left - sided centre - back .
Creating space for the right - winger
England ’s build - up play tends to start on the left , from Rooney and Gerrard , with England ’s central midfielders moving to that side .
England ’s right - winger always stays very wide on the right , though , creating an option for the midfielders to switch the play quickly to the right - hand side , using the pace of Walcott ( marked in pink ) .
Here , he is not within 40 yards of another England midfielder , making the Mexico defence slightly wider than it would like to be .
Defensive worries
Firstly , this shows that Wayne Rooney ( blue ) takes up a left - sided role when the opposition have the ball , which sometimes means he ends up at full - back if the opposition right - back gets forward .
Whilst Steven Gerrard and James Milner were switched permanently after half - time , they tended to swap naturally within the game anyway – here Milner ( yellow ) and Gerrard ( green ) have switched roles briefly in the first half .
England looked uncomfortable with this switching , particularly as they had no designated holding midfielder , so they were quite flimsy infront of the back four .
That back four , though , was the main worry – especially as it is the one area of the team that pretty much remains the same regardless of the shape in midfield and attack .
England were consistently opened up through easy balls from midfield towards the onrushing wingers making out - in runs into the centre of the pitch , and were only saved by two excellent saves from Robert Green .
This example above shows why , because the defensive line was poor throughout the game .
Admitedly , England had just won possession of the ball so the Mexico attackers are not an immediate threat , but England ’s centre - backs have got themselves into an awful shape where the full - backs are five yards behind the centre - backs ( all marked in red ) .
This means that England had a huge gap in the centre of their defence – any balls played into the box marked by the pink dots would be an immediate threat .
Ledley King had an awful game – constantly being dragged towards the ball by Franco , before being forced to suddenly turn and run towards his own goal – and a quick change in direction is not something King likes .
john
Terry remains a far better option .
Defending corners
No manager wants to see goals lost from set - pieces , and that ’s how England conceded tonight .
Leighton Baines marks the near post ( yellow ) , whilst the rest of the players have a hybrid marking system , where Gerrard and Crouch ( blue ) zonally mark the near post area , with the rest performing man-marking roles .
With three players in a specific zone , six man-marking , a goalkeeper and one player staying up the pitch , England were prone to short corners – sometimes tempting Crouch and Gerrard out of position .
A potentially lethal set - piece routine would be for the opposition to attempt to move one of Crouch or Gerrard with a run towards the corner - taker , before getting a second player to exploit the space left .
Franco was allowed to wonder into the space between Crouch and Gerrard fairly easily for the goal :
Conclusion
England were flattered by the 3 - 1 win – two goals came exclusively because Peter Crouch is ludicrously tall , another came from a tremendous strike Glen Johnson is unlikely to replicate in South Africa .
There were very few chances created by good build - up play , the ball retention throughout was very poor , and England ’s defensive shape was awful , with the full - backs ( and the defence as a whole ) too deep , combined with the centre - backs coming too high up the pitch towards the ball .
The midfield partnership did n’t work – Carrick has received inevitable criticism but was not particularly worse than Milner .
The problem was surely that the two did n’t seem to have set roles , and seemed confused about what they were supposed to be doing .
Walcott remains a threat because of his pace ( which is vital to that right - wing position considering how much space that player has ) but Aaron Lennon remains a better option on the ball .
Gerrard looks good in his left - wing position drifting inside , and that part of the pitch will be much more productive when Ashley Cole returns from injury .
Crouch might well have moved ahead of Emile Heskey for the ‘ big man ’ role – he can win the ball in the air and hold it up , but he is also much more mobile than Heskey , which is crucial considering the nature of his role – moving from side to side according to where the ball is .
England ’s players look relatively comfortable in the system , although some slight changes in personnel and positioning are clearly needed .
The problem is not that this 4 - 4 - 2 does n’t suit England , it ’s that it seems too easy for technically good , intelligent players to play against .
England struggled to cope against Mexico ’s fluid system that dominated possession , just as they have done whenever they ’ve faced a top - class side under Fabio Capello .
This shape will easily beat weaker sides , but Capello must experiment with an alternative shape ( in training , but hopefully also against Japan ) if England are to triumph against world class opposition .

On the heels of its riveting debut and intermittently compelling fall episodes , ABC 's alien - wolves - in - babe 's - clothing drama V returns Tuesday .
When the series went on break last November after just four shows , the groundwork had been laid for an inevitable showdown this spring : Extraterrestrials sheathed in human skin have beguiled most of the human population with their " We come in peace " promises .
But , aided by human - loyal aliens , a few skeptics reject the smooth - talking propagandists .
The spring season debut episode , " Welcome to the War ( preview above ) , " recaps the essentials with a cram course that brings new viewers up to speed .
Happily , the series ' most potent asset , Morena Baccarin , remains on view as Anna , the aliens ' uber - cool master manipulator .
Beneath the fake smile , Anna only becomes more sinister as her reptilian agenda begins to emerge .
Anchoring the core story is FBI Agent Erica Evans , played by Lost 's Elizabeth Mitchell .
Evans ' son has joined the alien mothership and she 's determined to bring him back .
Improving on last year 's conventional feel – when routine shoot 'em - ups would have fit right in on 24 – Mitchell kicks up the intensity now that her character 's toothy teen son Tyler ( played by Logan Huffman ) has been seduced by gorgeous alien Lisa ( Laura Vandervoort ) .
Factoring in brain - aneurysms - in - progress holograms , a half - human / half - alien baby due for delivery , creepy vaccines and an increasingly complicated resistance movement , V continues to intrigue .
Whether the show transcends the characters ' deadly earnest delivery and potboiler plot twists to generate genuine chills remains to be seen .
Blowback : Sound Off on V — — — — — — ——
–
One thing 's certain :
If the sci - fi series fails to bring in fresh viewers and hang on to existing fans , the people behind the V reboot wo n't be able to blame the show 's lead - in : It now follows Lost at 10 p.m./9 p.m. Central on ABC .
What 's your take ?
Is there too much dead weight in the large ensemble cast ?
Would you like to see more of Anna ?
Is it taking too long to get to the aliens ' master plan , or do you like the episode - by - episode tease ?

Air Force spaceplane is an odd bird with a twisted past
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : April 2 , 2010
More than a decade after its conception in the halls of NASA , and having snaked its way through multiple Pentagon bureaucracies , an unmanned military spaceplane is finally on the verge of launching on an unprecendented test flight .
This artist 's concept of the X - 37 spaceplane in orbit was produced when the project was under NASA management .

A stubby - winged spaceship called the Orbital Test Vehicle will fly into orbit on an Atlas 5 rocket , taking a round - trip shakedown voyage for the U.S. Air Force .
" What it offers that we have seldom had is the ability to bring back payloads and experiments to examine how well the experiments performed on - orbit , " said Gary Payton , the undersecretary of the Air Force for space programs .
" That 's one new thing for us . "
Payton , a former space shuttle flier and NASA manager , is now the Air Force 's top civilian space official .
Liftoff should occur the evening of April 19 in a launch window opening at 6:49 p.m. EDT and closing at 9:12 p.m. EDT , according to an Air Force spokesperson .
Several weeks or months later , the spacecraft will drop into the atmosphere and glide to an automated landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base , Calif .
The 11,000 - pound spaceplane is more popularly known as the X - 37B , but its cost and ultimate objectives are top secret .
NASA guided the project through its infancy before funding dried up in 2004 and the agency handed over its X - 37 assets to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
The Air Force took over in 2006 after another programmatic shakeup .
The civilian space agency no longer has any formal management role in the program , but NASA officials say the upcoming test flight provides an unparalleled opportunity to study how a small spaceplane performs during re-entry .
" We stay connected with the Air Force on the thermal protection system , [ and ] on the guidance , navigation and autonomous re-entry and landing , " said Daniel Dumbacher , the former X - 37 project manager at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
" We stay in touch with them for data - sharing purposes , but that 's the extent of it . "
Teams have been preparing the spacecraft at Cape Canaveral since it arrived at the launch site in late February .
The X - 37B was built by Boeing Phantom Works in California .
United Launch Alliance is also readying the ship 's Atlas 5 launch vehicle .
The rocket rolled to the launch pad at Complex 41 early Thursday for a practice countdown and fueling test .
The launch team loaded propellant into the two - stage rocket Friday during a wet dress rehearsal .
The Atlas 5 rocket is fueled on the launch pad Friday .
After workers tow the rocket back inside the nearby Vertical Integration Facility , the X - 37B space plane will be hoisted into place atop the booster 's Centaur upper stage .
It is one - quarter the size of a space shuttle orbiter and can spend up to nine months in orbit , but the ship will be hidden inside the Atlas rocket 's payload fairing for liftoff .
The Atlas 5 will use a larger version of its nose shroud to fit around the X - 37B 's nearly 15 - foot - wide wingspan .
The Air Force is n't saying what equipment is stowed inside the spaceplane 's unpressurized cargo hold , which is about the size of a pickup truck bed .
Potential OTV payloads could be as mundane as materials science experiments or low - cost technologies on the fast track for adoption into operational Air Force space missions .
" For new experimental space technologies , it gives us the ability to put them on - orbit , demonstrate whether they do or do not work , and then bring them back , " Payton said in an interview with Spaceflight Now last week .
Another likely application for the spaceship could be reconnaissance of war zones and foreign strategic sites , but launches from Cape Canaveral can only reach low - inclination orbits , limiting the spacecraft 's geographic coverage for such missions .
Others suggest the OTV might deploy and retrieve miniature satellites or rendezvous with another spacecraft to demonstrate orbital inspection and repair techniques .
The X - 37B carries a large rocket engine mounted at the rear of the ship for significant orbit - changing and de-orbit maneuvers , but the Air Force wo n't divulge its specifications .
Early X - 37 concepts called for a propulsion system capable of changing the spacecraft 's velocity by nearly 7,000 mph .
The space plane is designed to fly at altitudes between 110 and 500 nautical miles , or 126 to 575 statute miles , an Air Force spokesperson told Spaceflight Now .
The spokesperson declined to specify the orbital parameters for this month 's mission .
The Air Force 's plans for more X - 37B missions are up in the air .
A second flight is on the books for 2011 , but that launch 's fate is tied to the outcome of the inaugural mission , according to Payton .
" We 're waiting until this first flight is over before we decide on the size of any potential X - 37 fleet , " Payton said .

The OTV could eventually be partnered with the Operationally Responsive Space office , a military initiative to field new low - cost , adaptable satellite systems capable of being rapidly launched based on urgent needs .
" If we 're successful with this first launch , I would love to see us proliferate the X - 37 idea and marry it up with Operationally Responsive Space , " Payton said .
" We could have an X - 37 sitting at Vandenberg or at the Cape , and on comparatively short notice , depending on warfighter requirements , we could put a specific payload into the payload bay , launch it up on an Atlas or Delta , and then have it stay in orbit , do the job for the combatant commander , and come back home , " Payton said .
" And then the next flight , we could have a different payload inside , maybe even for a different combatant commander . "
Since its establishment in 2007 , the ORS program has flown tactical demonstration satellites and overhauled the military 's space acquisition and development paradigm for small missions .
Although the X - 37B is outfitted to spend up to 270 days in orbit , the first mission 's length will hinge on accomplishing all of its goals .
" We 'll have certain de-orbit opportunities just like the shuttle does , " Payton said .
" We are n't married to any particular on - orbit duration right now . "
After completing its mission , the 29 - foot - long spacecraft will fire its rocket engine to fall from orbit and glide to a precise touchdown on a runway at Vandenberg along California 's Central Coast .
Vandenberg 's 15,000 - foot - long landing strip was originally built for space shuttles returning from orbit .
The OTV 's debut mission will be the first time the concrete runway has been the landing point for a vehicle gliding back from space .
Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of California is the spacecraft 's backup landing site .
Despite rampant speculation on the Air Force 's intentions for the X - 37B , a major goal of the test flight is to verify the spaceplane will actually work .
Payton said the foremost objective of the flight will be a technical demonstration of the spacecraft 's design , fulfilling its role as an experimental X - vehicle .
One of the mission 's more significant technological leaps will be the first attempted autonomous atmospheric entry and runway landing in the history of the U.S. space program .
The former Soviet Union accomplished the feat with the single automated test flight of its Buran space shuttle in 1988 .
The X - 37B final approach will be guided by a differential Global Positioning System precision landing system to feed navigation data into the craft 's flight computer , giving the vehicle cues as it flies toward Vandenberg and lines up with the runway .
Like the space shuttle , the X - 37B will soar through the upper atmosphere enduring scorching temperatures with the help of a shield of heat - resistant tiles .

Tiles made of high - temperature ceramic material will protect the X - 37B during the trip home .
" The X - 37 re-entry environments were more harsh that what [ the ] shuttle sees , " Dumbacher said Friday .
The space plane will approach the landing site and line up with the runway for a steep glide reaching speeds of nearly 300 mph .
In the last few seconds of the flight , the craft will flare its nose , deploy its tricycle landing gear and slap down on the runway traveling well above 200 mph .
Dumbacher , now the director of Marshall 's engineering division , said the X - 37 touches down at a higher velocity than the shuttle orbiter .
" From the outside , it looks a lot like the shuttle , " Payton said .
" From the outer moldline , the hypersonic drag [ characteristics ] and subsonic flight control system , it looks and acts a lot like the shuttle . "
But on the inside , the X - 37B is a different breed .
Instead of running on fuel cells like the shuttle , the OTV will unfurl a small solar array to produce electricity in orbit .
And the X - 37B uses electromechanical actuators instead of hydraulics to move its flight control surfaces .
The solar array gives the vehicle a renewable energy source , permitting the X - 37B to loiter in orbit for much longer than the space shuttle , which is limited to missions lasting a few weeks .
Other technologies the OTV flight will test include advanced guidance , navigation and control , thermal protection systems , avionics , high temperature structures and seals , and conformal reusable insulations , according to an Air Force fact sheet .
The Air Force manages the OTV project through the Rapid Capabilities Office , a top - level group reporting to a board of senior branch officials including the secretary of the Air Force , the Air Force chief of staff , and the undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics .
The office " expedites development and fielding of select Department of Defense combat support and weapon systems by leveraging defense - wide technology development efforts and existing operational capabilities , " according to an Air Force fact sheet .
Many of the Rapid Capabilities Office 's projects are implemented on accelerated timelines , the fact sheet said .
NASA selected Boeing Co. to develop the X - 37 in 1999 as a testbed for reusable launch vehicle technologies .
The X - 37 was later described as a demonstrator for NASA 's Space Launch Initiative and Orbital Space Plane projects seeking less expensive and more reliable access to low Earth orbit .
" The primary reason for selecting X - 37 was the need to have a demonstrator for thermal protection systems and re-entry systems , " Dumbacher said .
" We can do arcjet testing and other things on the ground , but you never get the right environment until you actually fly stuff back from orbit .
The reason NASA stayed [ with the X - 37 ] as long as they did was because of the thermal protection system technology demonstration aspect . "

While the X - 37 program was under NASA management , engineers dropped an 85 - percent scale model of the X - 37 named the X - 40A seven times from an Army Chinook helicopter .
The approach and landing tests occurred in 2001 .
In 2004 , after NASA cancelled the Orbital Space Plane and started work on the Constellation program in the wake of the Columbia accident , the space agency transferred the X - 37 project to the DARPA .
The move instantly thrust the project into a murky middle ground somewhere between traditional white and black space programs .
Unlike purely classified programs , the government acknowledges the X - 37's existence and openly discusses the vehicle 's design , but officials give only vague answers on the purpose of its existence .
NASA had not started manufacturing a spaceworthy X - 37 when its work was transitioned to DARPA .
Engineers were focusing on building a full - scale vehicle for drop tests .
DARPA oversaw the second round of glide and landing tests in 2006 using the Scaled Composites White Knight carrier aircraft .
The Air Force announced its intentions to finish developing and building the X - 37B in late 2006 .
Throughout its checkered history , the X - 37 was supposed to launch on the space shuttle and a Delta 2 rocket .
The Air Force selected the Atlas 5 rocket in 2006 .
The craft is the manifestation of the Air Force 's long - held , on - and - off again dream to operate its own space plane .
The first time the military flirted with the idea of a reusable spaceship was the Dyna - Soar project of the late 1950s and early 1960s .
The Dyna - Soar , also named the X - 20 , was envisioned as a piloted spacecraft for anti-satellite , reconnaissance and even space weapons applications .
After Dyna -Soar 's cancellation in 1963 , the Air Force turned its attention to an ill - fated manned space station called the Manned Orbiting Laboratory .
It was cancelled in 1969 .
The military contributed to the earliest conceptual designs of the space shuttle beginning in 1971 .
The Air Force selected Vandenberg to host shuttle launches on polar orbit missions with classified national security payloads .
But the Pentagon scrubbed plans to launch the shuttle from Vandenberg after the Challenger accident .
The military 's last dedicated shuttle mission launched from Florida in 1992 .
" There are a number of differences between our shuttle experience and this bird , " Payton said .
" Our top priority is getting the bird to orbit and getting it back down again . "

Move against Spanish magistrate , who pursued Pinochet over human rights abuses , seen as politically motivated
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The stellar career of the crusading Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón may have come to an abrupt end today after he was suspended from his post as an investigating magistrate at Madrid 's national court .
The higher council of judicial power , which oversees Spain 's judges , temporarily suspended Garzón while the supreme court tries him on charges of distorting the law by opening an investigation into crimes against humanity carried out by the Franco regime .
" It will come into effect as soon as he is told , " the council 's spokeswoman , Gabriela Bravo , said this morning .
Judges and co-workers later lined up outside the national court to say goodbye to the man whose investigations into Latin American dictators , including Augusto Pinochet of Chile , had turned the court into a key player in global human rights .
Some shed tears as Garzón hugged and kissed them before being driven off from the courthouse in his armour - plated car for what may be the last time .
The decision to suspend him , although expected , nevertheless shocked leftwing Spaniards , who see it as the latest stage in a political and professional vendetta against the controversial magistrate .
" This stinks of shameful revenge , " the writer and journalist Juan Cruz wrote on his blog .
Garzón 's supporters claim there is nothing coincidental about the fact that the trial comes at the same time as two other , separate cases in which he is also accused of knowingly twisting the law .
The private prosecutions against him have been brought by rightwing groups and one case refers directly to a corruption investigation into the main opposition party , the rightwing People 's party .
Campaigners who have been seeking justice for those killed by Franco death squads before and after the Spanish civil war claimed that Garzón had become " the last victim of Francoism " .
Today 's decision was rushed through , apparently in an attempt by enemies within Spain 's highly politicised judicial system to stop him taking up an offer to be adviser to the international criminal court in The Hague .
A demonstration was called for tonight in Madrid .
The decision was criticised by international human rights groups .
" Judge Garzón 's suspension will be mourned by human rights activists around the world , " said Reed Brody , legal counsel for Human Rights Watch .
" Garzón helped to deliver justice for atrocity victims abroad and now he 's being punished for trying to do the same thing at home . "

“ If there is no struggle , there is no progress .
Those who profess to favor freedom , and yet depreciate agitation , are men who want crops without plowing up the ground .
They want rain without thunder and lightning .
They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters .
This struggle may be a moral one ; or it may be a physical one ; or it may be both moral and physical ; but it must be a struggle .
Power concedes nothing without a demand .
It never did and it never will .
Find out just what a people will submit to , and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them ; and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows , or with both .
The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress .
Men may not get all they pay for in this world ; but they must pay for all they get .
If we ever get free from all the oppressions and wrongs heaped upon us , we must pay for their removal .
We must do this by labor , by suffering , by sacrifice , and , if needs be , by our lives , and the lives of others . ”
– Frederick Douglass
Since his recent talking point conflating resolution authority with a " bailout " did n't seem to work out so well , Frank Luntz has a new talking point for Republicans which Sean Hannity happily allows him to pass along ; Chris Dodd 's financial services bill is going to result in a " checkbook tax " .
Apparently Arriana Huffington did n't mind allowing him a format to peddle this garbage as well .
From his post at the HuffPo Why the Dodd Financial Services Bill Is Bad ...
For Democrats :
But here 's where it gets really interesting .
The Democrats supporting the current legislation have assured an anxious electorate that whatever funds are used to create whatever regulatory scheme created will come from the banks , not the taxpayers .
Let me emphasize that so that even casual readers will catch it : the Democrats promise that you wo n't pay for their legislation , banks will .
Really ?
Since when have corporations ever paid taxes , fees or penalties ?
Employees end up paying in the form of lower salaries and benefits .
Customers end up paying in the form of higher costs .
And in this case , every account holder will be forced to pay higher fees on their checking account and savings account .
That 's you , my friendly reader .
Can you say " checkbook tax " ?
I can , and I think lots of candidates will be saying it come November .
Is that what you really want to do to your constituents , Senator Lincoln ?
Is that what you really want to explain on the campaign trail , Senator Bennett ?
From the looks of the comments section over there , Luntz 's latest script for the Republicans is n't going over so well .
We 'll see how many of them start repeating it like mindless drones in the next week or so .
That was plain to see from the front page of the government newspaper this month .
China ’s ambassador to Niger , Xia Huang , was prominently shown inspecting the bridge that his country is building here in the capital .
About 10 days before , Mr. Xia had proclaimed on state television that China ’s extensive oil and uranium interests in Niger had not been “ disrupted by the events ” — the coup — in February , news agencies reported .

There may still be some small perturbations .
The junta has said broadly that it may adjust any deals made by Mr. Tandja to ensure that they sufficiently benefit Niger , a nation rich in uranium and , potentially , oil .
But the junta does not seem eager to upset the Chinese — “ checking does n’t mean calling into question , ” said Col.
Abdoulkarim Goukoye , a junta member — and for now China appears to be proceeding confidently , sealing its reputation here as the continent ’s behind - the - scenes force , ready to do business regardless of who is in power or whatever outrage exists about it .
“ They could n’t care less ” who leads the country , Mohamed Bazoum , a former opposition leader recently appointed by the junta to a civilian council , said of China ’s investments in Niger .
“ The Chinese , they were about to destroy democracy .
They were playing a very negative role . ”
But even Mr. Bazoum did not suggest breaking with China now .
In a sign of how desperately Niger needs investment — the nation ranks at the very bottom of the United Nations human development index — Mr. Bazoum said he hoped the old deals would be respected , suggesting how quickly the looming backlash against China here has become an embrace .
There is a plaque adorning the entrance to the KC Stadium , commemorating the achievements of Adam Pearson in " revitalising " Hull City .
It refers to his work in his first stint as chairman , between 2001 and 2007 , when he hauled the East Yorkshire club up from the brink of a financial abyss and began a run of three promotions .
Now for the reprise .
The extent of Hull 's financial plight will unravel before the end of the Premier League season – estimates of their deficit are in excess of £ 30 m – but theirs effectively ended yesterday when Darren Bent 's early goal , coupled with victory for West Ham , left them six points behind with only two matches to play , a goal difference of minus 41 condemning them .
Pearson will begin discussions tomorrow designed to buy further time to sort out their plight , with meetings scheduled with banks and creditors both in Hull and London throughout the week .
Administration , according to club owner Russell Bartlett , is not an option .
" There are numerous routes we can take and one of them is an informal one where you sit down with creditors and try to restructure payments , " Pearson said .
" One of the last scenarios would be to go through a Company Voluntary Agreement but if we have to go down that route we would have to build a team that could fight back from that kind of deficit . "
Hull 's gamble to place manager Phil Brown on gardening leave and allow Iain Dowie a nine - match stretch to avert the drop failed , and Pearson has not ruled out Brown 's return , given he is on contract for another 14 months .
" There is absolutely no rush at this moment in time to employ a new manager , or bring Phil Brown back until we can tell him what his budget is for next year .
Everything is an option at this point . "
Immediate goals are to finish above Burnley – and hence earn a further £ 800,000 – then try to sell some players quickly and talk others into pay cuts .
Management consultant Dowie warned that edginess was inevitable given Hull 's dire circumstances , and Sunderland preyed upon it when Bent steered in his 24th Premier League goal of the season with a deft volley beyond the far post just seven minutes in .
Yet they were given a lifeline when Michael Turner , a cornerstone of Hull 's promotion side but now Sunderland 's captain , stuck out a leg to fell Geovanni in the area five minutes before the break .
Jimmy Bullard failed to live up to the role of saviour , thudding the ball against the base of a post from 12 yards .
Heads disappeared into hands all over the KC Stadium and despair wafted around the crowd in first - half injury time when striker Jozy Altidore was dismissed along with Sunderland 's Alan Hutton for a skirmish on the touchline .
Steve Bruce , later sent to the stands for encroaching out of his technical area , was incensed by Altidore 's actions .
" It was GBH , not a sending - off , " the Sunderland manager said .

THE FANS ' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT
RICK SKELTON , HullCityOnline.com
It was a bit of a wimper - ish way to go down .
We started appallingly , and Sunderland could have had three in the first 10 minutes .
Then we missed the penalty , lost Altidore – who was stupid to react and deserved to get sent off – and the second half was a non-event .
We had plenty of the ball but we have n't broken anybody down in two seasons .
We 're in trouble now - there 's going to be a CVA or we 'll go into administration , and I 'm certain we 'll start on - 10 points next season .
I would n't mind Iain Dowie staying as he seems to empathise with the place but will we be able to afford even him ?

PETE SIXSMITH , SalutSunderland.com
An away win at last but it was as poor a game as I have seen all season .
We played some decent stuff in the first half and could have been three up early on , as Hull were caught square very easily .
Once again Bent showed how important he is .
But referee Lee Probert had a nightmare 20 minutes leading up to half time - the penalty should have been a foul on Hutton , some of his bookings were bizarrre and by the time he sent Hutton and Altidore off , he had lost the game .
The second half was truly awful : niggling , scrappy and devoid of skill .
Hull worked hard and their fans who stuck with them , but I fear for their future .
The fan 's player ratings Gordon 8 ; Hutton 6 , Turner 8 ( Ferdinand 46 7 ) , Kilgallon 7 , Richardson 7 ; Campbell 6 , Meyler 7 , Henderson 7 , Malbranque 6 ( Bardsley 46 7 ) ; Jones 6 ( Cana 60 7 ) , Bent 7

I find rather hilarious - and a shame at the same time - that HTML5 elements and attributes are implemented as is w/o vendor prefix even if the document is only a WD while we still require differenciated vendor prefixes for CSS until CR that are a huge burden on web authors .
The last case is the placeholder attribute on html input fields , recently implemented in Gecko and already implemented long ago as is in Webkit .
I said it in the past and I maintain my opinion : the vendor prefixes as we manage them in CSS do n't make sense .
We have border - radius and border - image interoperable enough so web authors copy precisely styles only changing the prefix .
That gives stylesheets that are a pain to maintain , and with my editor 's implementor hat on , hell to edit .
We 've had @namespace implemented w/o vendor prefix eons before CR .
The vendor prefixes also pollute all the compatibility tests available on the web ( or in our test suites ) because the day vendor prefixes are removed , we have to update everything .
The day vendor prefixes go away , editing tools also have to be updated and that is not always easy to do .
Think *- border - radius : a modern editing tool CANNOT avoid it .
So it has _today_ to deal with at least 4 different versions of the property for editing , for computed style , etc .
Think CSS 3 transformations or transitions , the new cool kids on the block .
It 's a mess ...
I understand that nothing in a spec is really frozen until the spec is released , but I do n't see why there is a burden on CSS and not on other Web standards here .
Again , HTML5 is only a WD and implementations do n't use prefixes .
I am officially requesting that a DRASTIC change of the way we manage CSS vendor prefixes ( and in particular when we remove them ) be discussed between browser vendors , for instance during the forthcoming CSS WG face - to - face meeting .
An idea could be to let the WG decide when a given property can avoid vendor prefixes instead of enforcing the CR status for the whole spec .
I would like the following to never happen again ( example taken from a real stylesheet on the web ) if the properties are already interoperable enough to avoid it : - moz - border - radius : 5 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 5 px ; -o- border - radius : 5 px ; - ms - border - radius : 5 px ; border - radius : 5 px ; Counter - productivity at its best ...

While all of us are focused on the Texas School Board insanity , it 's really important to remember it 's not limited to Texas .
There are a lot of " off the cliff " school districts , boards and administrators out there .
Norfolk , Virginia is a shining example .
Via PilotOnline :
Oakwood Elementary 's principal was placed on administrative leave Friday as school officials investigated why life like , 4 - inch - long plastic fetus dolls were given to dozens of third - , fourth - and fifth - grade students .
On Thursday , the school staffer thought to be responsible for handing out the dolls was placed on leave .
I read this twice to be sure I was n't imagining it .
Seriously ?
I cannot imagine my reaction as a parent to my child coming home with such an atrocity .
Even though the article did n't mention it specifically , I would be willing to bet the students receiving these " gifts " were girls , not boys , too .
That 's what we need ... to intimidate and indoctrinate the girls at a young age while giving boys a pass .
Good job , Virginia .
This followed a blast aimed at the very same school by the ACLU for the principal 's invitation to students and teachers alike to participate in prayer and Bible study .
Both of these incidents point to shameless efforts on the part of the extreme religious right to indoctrinate children rather than educate them .
Editorial comment follows :
I have three children .
Two have graduated high school , moved on to the military in one case and college in the other .
My third is wrapping up her sophomore year .
If anyone tried half of what these lunatics are doing with my kids , there 'd be holy hell to pay .
I 'd be in front of every school board meeting reminding them that public schools have a duty NOT to shove any religion or moral instruction down my children 's throat , because state indoctrination runs counter to a functional republic with responsible citizens .
In fact , my daughter is reading " A Child of Hitler : Germany In The Days When God Wore A Swastika " as I write .
As a somewhat engaged parent , I did n't just buy the book and hand it off to her .
I skimmed most of it and read three chapters ( including the ending ) in depth .
Then I handed it to her with this warning : " When you read this , consider how similar efforts may be happening in the United States right now , today .
Then think about ways to stop that . "
" A Child of Hitler " is written by Alfons Heck .
It 's an autobiography of his history as a leader of the Hitler Youth , a role he was groomed for beginning in the first grade .
Heck spares nothing in the telling .
It is not apologetic nor does it soft - pedal the consequences of his activity .
Betrayal of friends , violence , and death are all part of the fabric of Heck 's youth .
Then , as now , God was used as a hammer to justify man 's evil .
But this does n't happen in a vacuum .
It happens when people stop paying attention , when they let themselves get so distracted by whatever distracts them -- whether it 's Facebook or a round of golf -- and they become complacent .
We 're on the edge of one of the most dangerous cliffs I 've seen in my lifetime , where our national values are in danger of being hijacked by extremists as dangerous ( if not more ) as Al Qaeda .
The damage done already is deep , wide and ugly .
I can't stress this enough .
Even if you do n't have children , please pay attention to what is happening in the schools in your neighborhood .
Those children are our future .
If they 're turned into dogma - spouting automatons , we 're all going to be off the cliff .
And yes , I did hijack the title of John Amato and Dave Neiwert 's new book to illustrate the point .
The story they tell can be only the beginning , or possibly a turning point , depending on what we decide to do .
If I lived in that Virginia school district , they 'd wish the ACLU was their biggest problem .
Just sayin' .
What Would You Do ?
A comprehensive assessment of global fossil - fuel subsidies has found that governments are spending $ 500 billion annually on policies that undermine energy security and worsen the environment .
The study , titled " The Politics of Fossil - Fuel Subsidies " by David Victor , a professor of political science with UC San Diego 's School of International Relations and Pacific Studies ( IR / PS ) , was one of five released April 22 by the Global Subsidies Initiative ( GSI ) of the International Institute for Sustainable Development ( IISD ) .
GSI 's goal is to reform , reduce and ultimately eliminate fossil - fuel subsidies , which are highest in Iran , Russia , China , Saudi Arabia , India and Venezuela .
The reform effort received a boost September 2009 when President Obama and other world leaders met in Pittsburgh , Pa. , for the Group of 20 Summit .
They agreed in a non-binding resolution to phase out fossil - fuel subsidies , but the measure did n't attempt to resolve difficult political issues such as how governments would actually achieve a phaseout .
Victor 's study addresses the political challenges .
The U.S. was one of the governments pressing for subsidy reform at the G20 Summit in September 2009 .
Such policy reforms are a relatively easy way to improve energy security for all nations and reduce growth in emissions of gases that cause global warming .
" Fossil fuels are often the most cost - effective way to provide useful energy , especially in poor households living on already stretched budgets , " said Victor , director of IR / PS 's Laboratory on International Law and Regulation .
" But the pervasive role of fossil fuels in countries ' economies makes them attractive for politicians to subsidize , which leads to over - consumption .
Virtually every analysis of fossil - fuel subsidies has shown that most are a complete waste of money , or worse , because money spent on subsidies is n't available for other purposes that yield much greater social benefits , such as education and rural agriculture . "
Victor 's assessment found that as of November 2008 , Venezuela had the lowest gasoline prices of any country , prices maintained at their low levels by subsidies .
While Iran 's fuel prices are nearly as low , the financial burden on that nation is much higher because its fuel consumption is greater .
" Iran 's fuel subsidy totals about $ 55 billion ( U.S. ) a year , or roughly one - tenth of global energy subsidies , " said Victor .
He said the largest subsidies are usually found in oil - producing democracies : fuel prices often are a major campaign issue , and politicians who face contested elections would most likely lose if they attempted to reform subsidies .
" When leaders do n't feel secure in power , as in Iran or Venezuela , they find it particularly difficult to roll back massive subsidy programs , " Victor said .
" As a result , consumers in those countries are not only using more fossil fuels , but also are demanding more subsidies , which are plunging those countries into an economic death spiral . "
The pressure for subsidies extends to many other countries as well .
India spends a conservatively estimated $ 15 billion ( U.S. ) to subsidize fossil fuels as part of its official policy to make energy services more affordable to the country 's poorest citizens .
Victor noted that the subsidies help provide power and irrigation services to farmers at low regulated prices .
However , his assessment and others have found that many of India 's fossil - fuel subsidies do n't actually help poor households , but instead benefit those who can already afford to own vehicles and electrical appliances .
" When the price of crude oil jumped a few years ago , the Indian government was stuck paying the difference between the regulated price to consumers and the actual price of oil on international markets , " said Victor .
" The money that the India government spent on those subsidies was not available for other more beneficial programs to reduce poverty and facilitate economic development . "
As a large oil importer , India 's energy security remains vulnerable to interruptions in its supply of crude oil or to sudden spikes in price .
" China was in a vulnerable energy - security situation similar to India 's , but the Chinese government took the major political step of reducing subsidies sharply and exposing consumers to market forces , " said Victor .
" It makes China more secure by reducing growth in its consumption of fossil fuels and forcing consumers to respond when markets tighten .
It also helps China reduce its rate of increase of greenhouse gas emissions and enables it to invest in renewable energy and other sustainable development projects . "
" In facing today 's global challenges - be they economic recession , rising temperatures , or the need for sustainable development - governments worldwide are beginning to take a closer look at how they use public money to favour the fossil - fuel sector , " said an IISD statement accompanying the release of the report .
Beyond reducing subsidies , Victor 's report suggests that governments also need to look more closely at raising fuel taxes .
Among the advanced industrialized countries , major fossil - fuel subsidies are rare , but fuel - tax rates vary widely .
As a percent of its total economic output , the U.S. has low fossil - fuel subsidies ; however , only 20 countries had lower retail gasoline prices than the U.S. , according to the 2008 International Fuel Prices report .
That report said 152 countries had retail gasoline prices higher than those in the U.S. , primarily due to higher gasoline taxes and other country - specific duties and taxes .
" The U.S. does not tax fossil fuels to the level needed to offset the costs of burning them , " Victor said .
" The more that consumers in every country in the world pay the full price for fuels — a price that reflects the true costs of fuel combustion on the economy and environment — the easier it will be for market forces to encourage more secure and cleaner energy supplies . "
Although most fossil - fuel subsidies are harmful , Victor said some are beneficial .
Notably , subsidies for research on new energy technologies are essential since companies and universities are unlikely to perform such research otherwise .
Victor 's study shows that political forces in favor of these good subsidies are usually much less powerful than the forces that promote pernicious subsidies .
The five - part research series , " Untold Billions , " produced by the IISD 's Global Subsidies Initiative was supported by the governments of Denmark , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Sweden , the United States and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation .

Le sigh ... I am actually a professional bra fitter .
I trained for 6 months , and I have fits thousands of women at this point .
Couple pointers ...
1 . It would be amazing if every individual could get fit at a great bra fitting boutique .
Victoria Secrets is not one of them , Sears is not of them , the Bay is not one of them ( although the Bay is improving ) .
Why ?
In order to properly fit someone , you need to a have full range of bra sizes to put them in bras to see how they fit , because you can measure someone as much as you want , but until you start to see styles on there is no way to account for breast shape , sternum placement , spine curvature , wire sensitivity etc. etc .
The problem with being fit at the above places is they only carry about 20 % of the average size range .
Victoria Secret / La Senza only carry about 20 sizes .
To you give perspective our boutique carries about 100 sizes , and there are still sizes I wish we had that do n't exist yet or our owner wo n't stock because they are so rare .
Getting fit at a poorly stocked store is like buying shoes at a place that only carries sizes 6 - 8 .
Will a lot of women find something they can squeeze into there ?
Yes , but most people will end up in the wrong size with some discomfort .
2 . That said , it sucks because not many women have access to great bra fitting boutiques and even then each boutique 's technique varies slightly and it may take sometime to find the approach that works for you .
Our store is pretty almost militant about our fits , we base our fitting on the engineering of the bra , how the engineers and designers behind the bra created them to fit .
Other stores are more laid back and will fit more for personal preference .
That said , our boutique is the most popular in our city and people travel from around the world to visit us .
What I recommend if you do n't have access to a bra fitting boutique in your area is the next time you get to travel somewhere , google " bra fitting name of destination " and see what is available to you .
You would be surprised at the places that have great boutiques that are not major cities .
3 . A good bra is expensive .
You are wearing this item every single day .
It should cost more than your tee - shirt , it may even cost more than your jeans .
Why ?
A good fitting bra is designed by engineers , not just designers , so that for that particular size ( 32C , 30GG , 36E ) it can be the best fit possible for as many shapes as possible .
It should also use better quality materials .
Real lace cost money .
Having 40 different sizes of wire cost money .
High quality foam costs money .
Good elastic costs money .
And elastic is key .
4 . Your back should always always always always always run parallel to the floor .
If your back is riding up , guess what is dropping forward ?
Your breasts .
This is why you want a high quality elastic .
The back ( elastic ) is the first part of a bra to break down .
This part of the bra will only stretch out and get looser and looser from the moment you wear it .
So the cheaper the bra , the quicker the elastic breaks down , the sooner your band ends up near your shoulder blades .
Were you fit and the back never sat parallel ?
Your fitter did n't have your size and cheated you by putting you in a bigger back to make your cup fit .
Were you fit on the tightest set of hooks ?
Your fitter did n't have your size and cheated you by putting you in a bigger back to make your cup fit .
5 . Your wire should never ever ever ever be on breast tissue .
It should always sit ever so slightly just outside your breast tissue as to avoid chafing , discomfort and scarring .
You should be able to put your bra on , scoop your breast tissue into the cup from the side and bottom and have all your breast fit within the wires and material of the cup .
If you do this and your breasts pop out the top , your fitter put you in a cup that is too small .
If you do this and the wire comes away from your body at an angle , your fitter put you in a cup that is to small .
If you do this and when you lift your arms up you slide out the bottom , your fitter put you in a cup that is too small .
6 . So what does a good fit look like ?
At our store we always educate our customers because a good bra fitting boutique wants to do more than make a quick buck , they want to see all women in the best size and styles for their bodies .
Every once and awhile I get a lady in , for whom our boutique is just out of their budget .
And I am more than happy to take her back , fit her , and educate her on what she should be looking for in a great fitting bra , even if she needs to find it elsewhere .
The major points ...
- Back is snug enough to lay parallel to the floor all day , when you move around .
It should be firm with about an inch of give if you pull .
- After you have scooped up and in to your bra the wire should lay just outside ( by like 1 millimeter ) the breast tissue .
In the center it should be flush to the sternum or parallel to the body , without driving in .
- The straps should be comfortable with the LEAST amount of weight on them .
If you tighten your straps too much you will pull even the snuggest back up and your cups will drop forward .
An inch of give is ideal , the fabric in straps has more give ( because it is not designed to carry all the weight ) so it should not feel as firm as the inch of give in the back .
- You should have no breast tissue popping out of the cup , and minimal space or gaping in a cup .
Bear in mind that in is natural to have space in the area near your armpits .
Why ?
Statistically speaking the odds are not in your favor genetically to be that round and full there .
Some women are , but that particular look today is most often ( not always ) the result of breast augmentation .
There is space in this area because the bra is transitioning from a wide cup , to a relatively narrow strap .
Also if you prefer lined cups or t- shirt bras you may end up with more space because these bras are literally baked on molds .
Molds do n't move , your body does , eventually you will move your body and your breasts in a way the mold cannot follow .
7 . Finally any fitter worth her salt , and any boutique worth spending money at SHOULD NEVER BE PART OF THE PROCESS OF BODY SHAME .
My job is exhausting emotionally in that day in and out I hear what women hate about themselves .
A good fitting boutique should help you embrace your size , not freak out about it .
Remember how I said a lot of stores only want to carry 20 % of the sizes available ?
I am talking about 32A to 42 DD .
That is the bottom 20 % .
Our boutique carries from a 28 AA up to a 46N .
So 32 DD is not a big size .
34 FF is one of our most popular sizes and indicative of a beautiful figure that most women would kill for .
42H is a fuller size , but there are lots of ladies who are that size and just like you they deserve great bras .
Your bra size is just a number , and just like any other piece of clothing it is not consistent .
For example my friend " Sharon " is a 36 F .
In her favorite bra , she wears a 34H .
Why ?
The fabric in the back in looser so she needs a snugger back , and the company is French which means they do not make DD , FF , or GG .
Which means the H fits closer to a FF/G , in an already small cup .
8 . We are not miracle workers .
Your breasts have a natural shape and it can only be tweaked so much .
For the average lady your breast should hit their fullest point in the middle of your arm .
When you see celebrities or ladies with breasts sitting high almost near their collarbone it is a case of one of three things .
Either ...
- Their cup is too small , way too small , and it is literally pushing their breast out the top of the bra .
- They have had a breast augmentation .
- They are part of a statistically small group of women whose genetics endow them to sit very high and very firm , and so they are lucky to be meeting the current Hollywood aesthetic for breasts .
Do n't hate these ladies , because in my experience as a bra fitter the grass is always greener on the other side and they would probably love to have your size and shape .
The same goes for fullness in the center .
Not all women are naturally full in the center , and this becomes less and less likely the smaller your size .
While more women have this shape naturally , again a lot of women achieve this looks by wearing a cup that is too small , or breast augmentation .
So if your not full in the center , embrace it .
Its natural for your body , and do you really want to fake it and give yourself scars by wearing a cup that is too small .
That is all I can think of for now ... but any other questions shot me a message or post a comment .
Your average , worn out , professional bra fitter .
There is a real Bill issuance fest coming in the next week , as the US Treasury does everything but what it promised in regard to extending average Treasury maturities .
After all , someone must let banks repo newly auctioned assets at zero rates so they can keep pushing the market ever higher into dot.com levels and far , far beyond .
Here is the listing of upcoming Bill auctions over the next week :
We will keep you updated on what the net impact of these auctions will be .
We anticipate that April will see a total of over $ 250 billion in net issuance between Bills , Notes and Bonds , to follow on the heels of the $ 333 billion in March : Almost $ 600 billion auctioned off in just two months !
Average take - home pay for Goldman 's 32,500 permanent and temporary employees is a mere $ 500,000 for their performance in 2009 .
Which may sound a lot - and it is a lot - but it is a lot less than it would have paid had it followed its normal remuneration procedures .
Believe it or not , if it had followed past form and paid out 50 % of net revenues to staff - which is its ceiling for what employees can pocket - pay per head would have been over $ 700,000 .
So what 's gone wrong ( or right - depending on your perspective on bankers and their pay ) ?
Well a number of things , one of which is Alistair Darling 's special one - off bonus tax .
This has led to a bit of a reduction in bonuses for senior UK based staff .
That said , Goldman 's top bods tell me they still expect to pay the British taxman " several hundred million pounds " - perhaps half a billion pounds - as its share of Darling 's bonus levy .
Which implies that just those bonuses paid in the UK by Goldman ( in addition to salaries and benefits ) will be in the region of £ 1bn in aggregate .
Not too shoddy .
And it means that a fair number of London based execs will be banking many millions of pounds each .
That said , Goldman execs tell me they are trying to respond to the public mood and are therefore exercising some restraint over what all their top people are paid throughout the world .
It has chosen to allocate just 35.8 % of its net revenues to compensation and benefits , the lowest proportion since it became a public company just over ten years ago .
And it points out that in 2009 it has contributed more than $ 1bn to charitable causes and financial support for small businesses .
Even so , as a proportion of revenues , JP Morgan appears to have paid out a bit less than Goldman ( and Morgan Stanley paid out miles more as a proportion , though massively less in absolute terms ) .
Goldman 's remuneration pot of $ 16.2 bn is still a handsome 49 % more than it paid out in 2008 .
How so ?
Well it 's boom time for investment banks and for this one - the world 's most successful - in particular : net revenues in 2009 were up more than 100 % at $ 45.2bn , and pre tax earnings increased by a factor of almost nine to $ 19.8 bn .
Here 's the thing : in the autumn of 2008 , all big banks were just hours from meltdown ; and here is Goldman , a year later , generating a fraction less than its all - time record 2007 revenues .
It 's a funny old world .
UPDATE 15:55
Goldman is keen to point out that JP Morgan employs a different methodology when comparing remuneration to revenues .
And it says that if it used the same approach ( with admin workers excluded ) its ratio would be similar or lower to Morgan's .
Flaws in a cement encasement intended to seal BP ’s well were most likely the root of last month ’s deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , according to interviews , government officials , congressional hearing testimony , drilling reports and other company documents .
The April 20 accident , which has resulted in millions of gallons of oil being spewed into the Gulf of Mexico , is the subject of multiple investigations that promise to be long and complex .
Hearings in the last two weeks offered multiple lines of inquiry into what one engineer calls “ a confluence of unfortunate events . ”
But at least a dozen experts with intimate knowledge of offshore drilling , including one who has seen investigation documents , agreed that , deep in the well , cement , or pipes encased by cement , had to have failed first .
Several have specifically fingered BP ’s design for that cement job , which used relatively little cement and relied on an unusual configuration that made it harder to test for imperfections , they said .

Cementing is supposed to form an impenetrable seal to keep the hot , gassy oil from surging up the well .
But a single flaw in that seal , perhaps a crack the size of a human hair , can be enough to unleash a volcano of petroleum .
The Mississippi Canyon Block 252 project had encountered problems , including two reported gas kicks , where drillers failed to keep gas from surging up , according to the hearings and company sources .
Government and company documents suggest the project was over budget .
But the Deepwater Horizon had struck oil , something that happens in only about a quarter of exploration wells .
All that was left to do was to seal the well so another vessel could produce from it later .
Cementing involves standard techniques .
But “ there is an art to it , and every well is a little different , ” said Gene Beck , an associate professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M who testified at the congressional hearings .
Halliburton , the cementing contractor , worked according to BP ’s design .

An exploratory oil well consists of a series of nested pipes , or casings , each plunging deeper into the seafloor .
Crews pumped cement into the well until it crept outside of the steel casings , forming a bond between the pipe and the rock deep under the seafloor .
The goal was to let the cement set , add a few temporary cement plugs within the casings for good measure , then haul up the blowout preventer and move off .
But forming a good seal is tricky .
Traces of drilling mud , a clay substance used to tamp rising oil as crews work , can pollute wet cement , creating weak spots .
Wet cement also can drizzle into the rock or be distributed unevenly , leaving gaps — especially if the casings are n’t properly centered in the well — which can cause the encased pipes to collapse .
Any of these failures can give gas under extreme pressure a chance to creep in and build up in the well bore , or between nested casings .

Beck said BP ’s encasement design called for only partial coverage of casings deep in the well .
Cement did not reach the bottom of the next - largest casing in high - pressure areas , a decision Beck called “ shocking . ”
He also raised questions about the design ’s reliance on a single , central casing instead of several for the 2.5 - mile - deep well .
For technical reasons , BP ’s configuration would make it more difficult later to test the cement job for leaks .
Several other independent engineers agreed with Beck ’s assessment , although they said more information was needed .
Alfred Eustes , associate professor of petroleum engineering at the Colorado School of Mines , cautioned that conditions particular to the formation could have dictated the design .
BP declined to comment on this and other issues raised in this article .
The crew of the Deepwater Horizon conducted pressure tests that assess seals , but not the cement .
Hearing testimony suggested that the pressure tests revealed some discrepancy .
It could have been a confusing , anomalous reading that meant little .
Or it might have provided an early hint that gas had begun to leak into the well bore , perhaps creeping up through the mud between the casings , said Tadeusz Patzek , professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas in Austin .

An official with Transocean , the company that leased the drilling rig to BP , has cited “ hearsay ” accounts that there was an argument among crew members about the readings , and survivors have said the same in media accounts .
Regardless , it appears someone made a decision that the seal was good , so the crew moved to the next step : pumping seawater into the riser and taking out mud .
It was a fatal moment .
The switch from mud to relatively lightweight water decreased pressure .
Deep in the well , gas surged .
Originating deep in the well , the gas probably blasted through the wellhead sitting on the seafloor , perhaps overwhelming seals in that device .
It surged through a blowout preventer sitting atop the wellhead , and went up the riser , expanding into multiples of its volume in the last stretch of pipe — “ an exponential process once it starts , ” said Tim Robertson of Nuka Research , an Alaska consultant .

Questions remain regarding when the crew detected the gas and what they did .
Transocean has said the crew had almost no time .
Once the gas hit the rig , an explosion erupted .
Eleven died .
Some crew members reportedly made a last - ditch effort to close the blowout preventer .
This blowout preventer has seven valves .
Some clasp and unclasp the drill pipe during the course of normal work .
Others close to block rising oil .
And one , used only in emergencies , shears the pipe and pinches the column shut .

But the blowout preventer did n’t close .
It remains unclear why .
Small mechanical glitches , such as leaking hydraulic fluids , have also raised questions .
But drilling specialists , and officials with both BP and Transocean , have said a more likely explanation is that something is jammed in the blowout preventer , or it would have responded to the multiple efforts by robotic submarines to make it work .
The force of gas bursting through the wellhead could have thrust casings , wellhead parts , drill pipe and other debris into the blowout preventer , blocking the valves .
A thick well pipe joint could have also blocked it , although Transocean has said it was unlikely such a joint would be positioned in the blowout preventer at this point of the work .

It is possible , too , that the blowout preventer just was n’t strong enough .
The U.S. Minerals Management Service updated rules on the device after a 2002 study of six deepwater blowout preventers found that half the time , they could n’t shear the pipe .
The number of possible scenarios for the accident highlights deeper issues with drilling , Patzek said .
Deepwater work may , in some conditions , involve risks that no technology can anticipate , he said .
Tolerances of the seals , riser and blowout preventer , for example , appeared close to manufactured maximums and basic physical limits .
And in the deep sea , strange things happen .
Gas randomly forms solids .
Materials behave unpredictably .
In such conditions , “ we are no longer dealing with a complicated system , but with an essentially complex system , ” Patzek said .
“ Very small factors … can create a large response . ”

UPDATE :
Everything is fixed !
No real patch was required , but everything magically went back to normal and PlayStation 3 owners everywhere are sighing with relief .
From our experience , Trophies are no longer corrupt , but any Trophies on your system that had been corrupted are now blanked out .
In other words , if you had n't synced them before the error hit , you 're out of luck .
Our saves , thankfully , seem to work in full .

- PS3 ERROR 8001050F
- New POP Movie Trailer
- Daily Fix Correction
- Giveaway Winners !
We 've gone ahead and left the happenings prior to the fix untouched below in case you want to relive your nightmares in the future .
This will be a day long remembered ...
It should have been a calm , simple Sunday night , but on Feb. 28 , 2010 , all hell broke loose .
In the blink of an eye everyone went from happily gaming on their PlayStation 3s to being totally screwed by the biggest system blackout in the history of the videogame industry .
This is the curse of Error 8001050 F .
Yes , an error in the internal settings of the PlayStation 3 is crippling certain consoles .
The affected PS3s can't play games or connect to the PlayStation Network , and their system clocks have been automatically reset to 12/31/99 .
Worse yet , Trophies earned before syncing the system appear to be lost and in some cases " corrupted " , which would make it seem like you 'll never get them back again .
It 's a sad day to be a PS3 owner .
Rather than weep in an IGN HQ that has zero PlayStation 3s running for the first time in years , we thought we'd walk you through what we know – there 's a lot of misinformation out there .
Click +the+image+to+see+the+error+in+action .
Right now , only the older PS3 " Fats " are in trouble ; but not all of them ( though it is the majority ) .
The newer PS3 Slims are operating without issue .
In short : bad stuff .
Sony says that there 's a bug in " the clock functionality incorporated in the system " .
What that means is that affected systems are resetting their internal clocks to 12/31/99 , and this is causing a whole mess of problems including the inability to log into the PlayStation Network , start games and play certain video rentals .
In addition , Trophy data for the games you 're trying and failing to play turns into " corrupt data " .
We do n't know yet .
Sony says that its engineers are working on it and that they hope to have it resolved by Tuesday morning .
There are a handful of fixes that users have come up with floating around Internet forums , but we 'd suggest waiting it out for an official fix .
Do n't turn it on .
Sony 's asking you to keep it turned off until they have a fix in place .
We do n't know yet .
Sony tells us that its engineers are working on it and that they hope to have the issue fixed in the next 24 hours ( Tuesday morning ) .
Officially , we do n't know , but off the top of our heads , you 're screwed if you had stuff on there that you had n't synced with the PlayStation Network yet .
See , until you sync your Trophies with the PSN , they live on your system .
If that data gets corrupted , you can't sync it with the Network ; you 'll lose those Trophies .
Sony 's even preparing you for this sad truth with its official line of " In the meantime , if you have a model other than the new slim PS3 , we advise that you do not use your PS3 system , as doing so may result in errors in some functionality , such as recording obtained trophies , and not being able to restore certain data . "
Thankfully , if you synced before the corruption , you should be able to sync when all this is over and get your Trophies back on your system .
Or we hope so anyway ... Unlikely .
We have a corrupted system , and our saves appear to be fine , but we wo n't know for sure until this is all over .

In which a shot messenger hauls out the whole Huckabee
by Jeremy Hooper
Yesterday , after his unbelievable comments about homosexuality and puppies ( among many other things ) exploded on the web , Mike Huckabee issued the following statement , snarkily condemning M.C. Tracey , the College of New Jersey journalist who had printed his thoughts :
Governor Mike Huckabee : " The young college student hopefully will find a career other than journalism .
I would ask that he release the unedited tape of our conversation .
I believe that what people do as individuals in their private lives is their business , but I do not believe we should change the traditional definition of marriage .
Not only did n't he attempt to sensationalize my well known and hardly unusual views of same - sex marriage , he also inaccurately reported my views on Michael Steele as GOP chairman - I offered my support and did n't " Rip into Steele " as his article asserted .
I had a candid and frank conversation with the group about health care , education , the economy and national security while the young journalism student , instead , chose to focus on the issue of same - sex marriage and grossly distort my views . "
Only problem for the former Arkansas governor , current FOX news host , onetime shedder - of - extra - poundage , and likely GOP presidential hopeful ?
Well , that the young reporter did indeed do his legwork :

RESPONSE TO HUCKABEE STATEMENT
[ The Perspective ]
And there 's your tape , Gov. Huckabee .
Same comments that were in the print piece , same offense taken .
Or actually , even more offense , since the comments all put together like this sound even worse than they did in print !
Gov .
Huck :
How about if you want to be president of the entire nation , you stop shooting down both journalistic messengers and the basic civil rights of citizens who fall outside of your personal moral purview , and instead develop the fortitude to embrace both your own spoken words and the full spectrum of society ?
And if you can't respect a constitution with both a sense of equal protection and a free press , perhaps you should stop suggesting alternative career paths for others and start considering whether your own views make you fit to serve as a top executive of this fair and free nation .

A Bank of America worker installed malicious software on his employer 's ATMs that allowed him to make thousands of dollars in fraudulent withdrawals , all without leaving a transaction record , according to federal prosecutors .
Rodney Reed Caverly , 53 , was a member of the bank 's IT staff when he installed the malware .
The Charlotte , North Carolina , man made fraudulent withdrawals over a seven - month period ending in October 2009 , according to prosecutors , who 've charged him with one count of computer fraud .
The government would n't say how much money Caverly stole ; the charging document ( .pdf ) , filed April 1 , states only that his payoff surpassed the statutory minimum of $ 5,000 .
Caverly , reached by phone , told Threat Level he had no comment , and hung up .
According to court records , he has entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors and is set to appear in court on April 13 .
" I am absolutely , completely shocked .
It does n't sound like something he would do .
This is just absolutely crazy .
" Caverly was formerly the founder and CEO of Sovidian , LLC , a North Carolina - based software development company established in 1999 .
The company merged in April 2003 with Data On CD , a document management and archiving firm .
According to a news release on Sovidian 's website announcing the merger , the company has provided " tailored software and software integration solutions for the finance industry for over 10 years , " and counted Bank of America and two other major financial institutions as customers .
" Our customers range from large service bureaus ( IBM , EDS and M&I Data ) ; to multibillion dollar banks ( Bank of America , First Union and Bank of Nova Scotia , Canada ) ; to local community banks , " Caverly is quoted as saying in the release .
" Banks are very individualistic .
Each situation and operating environment is completely different .
There are no off - the - shelf solutions especially for integrating new and old technologies and applications .
We specialize in making applications talk to each other and integrating peripherals into existing software environments . "
Tom Chase , general manager for Sovidian , told Threat Level that the company has n't had any banking or finance customers since 2004 , and that Caverly has n't worked there for years .
Though he 's still a major investor in the business , he has " very little involvement " with it now , said Chase .
" I am absolutely , completely shocked [ by the charges ] , " Chase said .
" It does n't sound like something he would do .
This is just absolutely crazy . "
Caverly took the job with Bank of America some time around 2007 , said Chase .
The charges were filed the same day that credit card company Visa warned the banking industry that Eastern European ATM malware recently showed up in America for the first time .
That code , initially spotted last year on some 20 ATMs in Russia and Ukraine , was designed primarily to capture PINs and bank card magstripe data , but also allowed thieves to instruct the machine to eject whatever cash was still in it .
At the time , security firm Trustwave warned that the malware was likely headed for ATMs in the United States .
At least 16 versions of the East European malware have been found so far and were designed to attack ATMs made by Diebold and NCR , according to the April 1 Visa alert .
There is no information tying the malware found in Russia with the malware allegedly used by Caverly .
Bank of America did not immediately respond to a call for comment about the case , but told the Associated Press that the bank discovered the thefts internally .
Caverly 's attorney did not return a call .
Nick Percoco , vice president and head of Trustwave ’s SpiderLabs Incident Response Team , said the malware does sound like it could be the malware found in East Europe or a version of it .
" [ Caverly ] could have obtained a copy of that and modified it for his own use , " he told Threat Level .
" But the ability to dispense cash without recording activity – that was definitely a feature of the East European malware . "

NEW YORK — Mosab Hassan Yousef , who helped Israel 's security forces kill and arrest members of the Islamic militant group Hamas , is probably marked for death .
He should be keeping silent .
But he 's got a story to tell , one he delivers in his new book published this week , " Son of Hamas .
"
" To be honest with you , being killed is not the worst thing that can happen , " he said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press .
" If they want to do kill me ... let them do it , and they will be responsible for my blood .
"
In his memoir , Yousef , the 32 - year - old son of a Hamas founder , claims he was one of the Shin Bet security agency 's best assets and was dubbed The Green Prince , a reference to his Hamas pedigree and the Islamists ' signature green color .
During his 50 - minute interview , for which he arrived with armed security , Yousef criticized Hamas leaders including political chief Khaled Meshaal .
He lashed out at Hamas , saying the organization lives in the Middle Ages .
And he hurled his most inflammatory comments at Islam , which he called a religion that teaches people to kill .
" It is not a religion of peace , " said Yousef , who converted to Christianity .
" The biggest terrorist is the God of the Quran .
I know this is very dangerous and this will offend many people .
The more you follow the steps of the prophet of Islam and the God of Islam , the more you get close to being a terrorist .
" Yousef said he started working with the Shin Bet after he was arrested and witnessed Hamas brutalities inside prison .
When he was released in 1997 , he started meeting with the Shin Bet and gravitating toward Christianity .
Yousef thought he could do some good , preventing the deaths of Israelis and Palestinians .
" I got a chance to stop killing , " he said .
In his book , Yousef clearly relished his importance to Shin Bet and even designed his own missions , one involving duping Meshaal , who lives in Damascus .
" I love this spy stuff , especially with Israeli intelligence paving the way , " he wrote .
" In this way , a new communications channel was established with Damascus , even though Meshaal had no idea that he was actually on a party line with the Shin Bet listening in .
" Yousef said Hamas has no idea how Shin Bet operates and accused Hamas of killing innocent people suspected of collaborating with Israel .
The US government considers Hamas a terrorist organization .
Hamas says it provides schools and other social benefits to residents in the areas it controls .
Yousef declined to discuss certain aspects of his intelligence relationship with the Israeli security organization , saying he did n't want to hinder its operational capabilities and give Hamas a " free gift . " " They 're facing a dirty , difficult war , " he said , referring to the Shin Bet battles with Hamas .
" I do n't agree with everything that they do .
But their job is very important .
" His relationship with the Shin Bet lasted for more than a decade until he decided he'd had enough .
He ended his lonely and dangerous existence as a spy in 2007 .
Yousef said the Israelis allowed him to leave the region for a few months to take a break from his harrowing job and travel to America , where he stayed , working as a security guard at a grocery store .
When he told his story to his new friends in America , people did n't believe him .
But folks seem to be believing him now .
His father , a senior Hamas leader , disowned him Monday .
Sheik Hassan
Yousef said in a letter that his family had renounced " the one who was once our eldest son , who is called Mosab .
" The son " disbelieved in God " and " collaborated with our enemies , " said the father , who 's serving a six - year term in an Israeli prison .
Mosab
Yousef said he did n't take it personally .
" I know his heart , " Yousef said .
" My dad is a loving person .
He would never disown me .
At some point we will be together again .
I love my father , and he loves me .
" Yousef blamed his father 's decision on the Quran .
" The God of Quran is trying to unskin Muslims from their humanity , " he said , later adding , " Muslims are good people .
But their God is absolutely bad .
" Yousef 's claims have rocked Hamas and exposed its vulnerability .
His book comes on the heels of the assassination of a top Hamas operative in Dubai in January .
Yousef denounced this latest killing in which Israel has been blamed and said the timing of the book was just a coincidence , not some Israeli scheme to generate even more paranoia among the ranks of Hamas .
Israel has not commented on Yousef 's claims or on widespread speculation that it carried out the Dubai assassination .
Asked about why people should believe his book , which was displayedat a Manhattan bookstore 's Christian inspiration section , Yousef said : " I am not expecting everybody to believe this story .
Some people willdoubt it .
" Yousef said Hamas had no idea how to govern and hehoped the violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis would end .
He said he thinks his traitorous efforts will pay off .
" A change , " he said , " will happen for the next generation . "

Here in Canberra local Labor Party Education Minister Andrew Barr has threatened teachers who impose any NAPLAN test bans with the loss of four hours pay under Rudd ’s workchoices law , the Fair Work Act .
Can somebody explain to me again what exactly the difference is between Labor and the Liberals ?
The Australian Education Union ’s response does not inspire confidence .
Rather than threatening to take on Labor ’s anti-worker laws and escalate the dispute if teachers are fined , the Union has muttered that the action might not be subject to the Fair Work laws .
Do n’t muck around with legalities .
Use your industrial strength to defeat Labor ’s attacks on teachers .
Otherwise Labor and the courts will screw you .
Barr is also trying to organise scabs to break the teachers ’ bans on supervising NAPLAN tests .
Typical of what the ALP has now become – a bosses ’ party .
Barr has promised to use exterior exam providers and called on teachers who are not union members to scab on the ban .
He will direct public servants in the Education Department to supervise the tests .
This Labor party Minister has threatened those staff who refuse to obey his direction with action under the ACT ’s Public Sector Management
Act for refusing to obey a lawful and reasonable direction .
The penalties range from fines , loss of pay all the way to dismissal .
The Community and Public Sector Union covers employees in the Education Department .
It is at the moment fighting with the Canberra Labor Government over a pay increase and job cuts .
The Stanhope Labor Government has frozen recruitment .
Separations are running over 5 percent per annum and the Government expects the same amount of work from a falling number of workers .
The Government has offered its workers a pay increase that will be less than inflation over the next two years .
So it is cutting jobs and wages , and now is ordering some of those overworked and underpaid staff to scab on teachers .
The CPSU has been silent on the issue .
The union should strike for higher pay on the same day this Scab Labor Government tries to break the teachers ’ ban on NAPLAN testing .
Such a strike is protected action because it is during the bargaining period .
Of course the CPSU leadership is the plaything of Labor politicians .
The union affiliated to Labor to supposedly influence their decision but the only beneficiary to date has been National Secretary Stephen Jones who has been parachuted into the safe Labor seat of Throsby for the next federal election .
Bugger the membership , I ’ve got a seat in Parliament .
In fact the price of the seat was buggering the membership for Labor .
Local Labor only survives as a minority Government with the support of the Greens .
The time has come for the Canberra Greens to show they support the teachers .
They could threaten to bring down the Government if Labor organises scabs against the teachers .
Will they ?
If not then why be a member of such an unprincipled and spineless organisation ?
And to all those good Labor Party members , why waste your time in such a reactionary organisation that actively organises scabs against teachers ?
We socialists do n’t scab .
We do n’t attack jobs and wages .
We do n’t lock up asylum seekers .
We fight for a better world for all , not just the bosses .
Maybe it ’s time for those who want real and progressive social change to desert the Labor Party and the Greens and consider the largest grouping of the revolutionary left in Australia , Socialist Alternative .
" Come on , " said Vic .
" It 'll be great . " " No , it won't , " I said , although I 'd lost this fight hours ago , and I knew it .
" It 'll be brilliant , " said Vic , for the hundredth time .
" Girls ! Girls ! Girls ! "
He grinned with white teeth .
We both attended an all - boys ' school in south London .
While it would be a lie to say that we had no experience with girls --
Vic seemed to have had many girlfriends , while I had kissed three of my sister 's friends -- it would , I think , be perfectly true to say that we both chiefly spoke to , interacted with , and only truly understood , other boys .
Well , I did , anyway .
It 's hard to speak for someone else , and I 've not seen Vic for thirty years .
I 'm not sure that I would know what to say to him now if I did .
We were walking the backstreets that used to twine in a grimy maze behind East Croydon station -- a friend had told Vic about a party , and Vic was determined to go whether I liked it or not , and I did n't .
But my parents were away that week at a conference , and I was Vic 's guest at his house , so I was trailing along beside him .
" It 'll be the same as it always is , " I said .
" After an hour you 'll be off somewhere snogging the prettiest girl at the party , and I 'll be in the kitchen listening to somebody 's mum going on about politics or poetry or something .
" " You just have to talk to them , " he said .
" I think it 's probably that road at the end here . "
He gestured cheerfully , swinging the bag with the bottle in it .
" Do n't you know ? " " Alison gave me directions and I wrote them on a bit of paper , but I left it on the hall table .
S'okay .
I can find it . " " How ? "
Hope welled slowly up inside me .
" We walk down the road , " he said , as if speaking to an idiot child .
" And we look for the party .
Easy .
" I looked , but saw no party : just narrow houses with rusting cars or bikes in their concreted front gardens ; and the dusty glass fronts of newsagents , which smelled of alien spices and sold everything from birthday cards and secondhand comics to the kind of magazines that were so pornographic that they were sold already sealed in plastic bags .
I had been there when Vic had slipped one of those magazines beneath his sweater , but the owner caught him on the pavement outside and made him give it back .
We reached the end of the road and turned into a narrow street of terraced houses .
Everything looked very still and empty in the Summer 's evening .
" It 's all right for you , " I said .
" They fancy you .
You do n't actually have to talk to them . "
It was true : one urchin grin from Vic and he could have his pick of the room .
" Nah .
S'not like that .
You 've just got to talk .
" The times I had kissed my sister 's friends I had not spoken to them .
They had been around while my sister was off doing something elsewhere , and they had drifted into my orbit , and so I had kissed them .
I do not remember any talking .
I did not know what to say to girls , and I told him so .
They 're just girls , " said Vic .
" They do n't come from another planet .
" As we followed the curve of the road around , my hopes that the party would prove unfindable began to fade : a low pulsing noise , music muffled by walls and doors , could be heard from a house up ahead .
It was eight in the evening , not that early if you are n't yet sixteen , and we were n't .
Not quite .
I had parents who liked to know where I was , but I do n't think Vic 's parents cared that much .
He was the youngest of five boys .
That in itself seemed magical to me : I merely had two sisters , both younger than I was , and I felt both unique and lonely .
I had wanted a brother as far back as I could remember .
When I turned thirteen , I stopped wishing on falling stars or first stars , but back when I did , a brother was what I had wished for .
We went up the garden path , crazy paving leading us past a hedge and a solitary rosebush to a pebble - dashed facade .
We rang the doorbell , and the door was opened by a girl .
I could not have told you how old she was , which was one of the things about girls I had begun to hate : when you start out as kids you 're just boys and girls , going through time at the same speed , and you 're all five , or seven , or eleven , together .
And then one day there 's a lurch and the girls just sort of sprint off into the future ahead of you , and they know all about everything , and they have periods and breasts and makeup and God - only - knew - what - else -- for I certainly did n't .
The diagrams in biology textbooks were no substitute for being , in a very real sense , young adults .
And the girls of our age were .
Vic and I were n't young adults , and I was beginning to suspect that even when I started needing to shave every day , instead of once every couple of weeks , I would still be way behind .
The girl said , " Hello ? " Vic said , " We 're friends of Alison's . "
We had met Alison , all freckles and orange hair and a wicked smile , in Hamburg , on a German exchange .
The exchange organizers had sent some girls with us , from a local girls ' school , to balance the sexes .
The girls , our age , more or less , were raucous and funny , and had more or less adult boyfriends with cars and jobs and motorbikes and -- in the case of one girl with crooked teeth and a raccoon coat , who spoke to me about it sadly at the end of a party in Hamburg , in , of course , the kitchen -- a wife and kids .
" She is n't here , " said the girl at the door .
" No Alison . " " Not to worry , " said Vic , with an easy grin .
" I'm Vic .
This is Enn . "
A beat , and then the girl smiled back at him .
Vic had a bottle of white wine in a plastic bag , removed from his parents ' kitchen cabinet .
" Where should I put this , then ?
" She stood out of the way , letting us enter .
" There 's a kitchen in the back , " she said .
" Put it on the table there , with the other bottles . "
She had golden , wavy hair , and she was very beautiful .
The hall was dim in the twilight , but I could see that she was beautiful .
" What 's your name , then ? " said Vic .
She told him it was Stella , and he grinned his crooked white grin and told her that that had to be the prettiest name he had ever heard .
Smooth bastard .
And what was worse was that he said it like he meant it .
Vic headed back to drop off the wine in the kitchen , and I looked into the front room , where the music was coming from .
There were people dancing in there .
Stella walked in , and she started to dance , swaying to the music all alone , and I watched her .
This was during the early days of punk .
On our own record players we would play the Adverts and the Jam , the Stranglers and the Clash and the Sex Pistols .
At other people 's parties you 'd hear ELO or 10 cc or even Roxy Music .
Maybe some Bowie , if you were lucky .
During the German exchange , the only LP that we had all been able to agree on was Neil Young's , and his song " Heart of Gold " had threaded through the trip like a refrain :
The music playing in that front room was n't anything I recognized .
It sounded a bit like a German electronic pop group called Kraftwerk , and a bit like an LP I 'd been given for my last birthday , of strange sounds made by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop .
The music had a beat , though , and the half - dozen girls in that room were moving gently to it , although I only looked at Stella .
She shone .
Vic pushed past me , into the room .
He was holding a can of lager .
" There 's booze back in the kitchen , " he told me .
He wandered over to Stella and he began to talk to her .
I could n't hear what they were saying over the music , but I knew that there was no room for me in that conversation .
I did n't like beer , not back then .
I went off to see if there was something I wanted to drink .
On the kitchen table stood a large bottle of Coca - Cola , and I poured myself a plastic tumblerful , and I did n't dare say anything to the pair of girls who were talking in the underlit kitchen .
They were animated and utterly lovely .
Each of them had very black skin and glossy hair and movie star clothes , and their accents were foreign , and each of them was out of my league .
I wandered , Coke in hand .
The house was deeper than it looked , larger and more complex than the two - up two - down model I had imagined .
The rooms were underlit -- I doubt there was a bulb of more than 40 watts in the building -- and each room I went into was inhabited : in my memory , inhabited only by girls .
I did not go upstairs .
A girl was the only occupant of the conservatory .
Her hair was so fair it was white , and long , and straight , and she sat at the glass - topped table , her hands clasped together , staring at the garden outside , and the gathering dusk .
She seemed wistful .
" Do you mind if I sit here ? "
I asked , gesturing with my cup .
She shook her head , and then followed it up with a shrug , to indicate that it was all the same to her .
I sat down .
Vic walked past the conservatory door .
He was talking to Stella , but he looked in at me , sitting at the table , wrapped in shyness and awkwardness , and he opened and closed his hand in a parody of a speaking mouth .
Talk .
Right .
" Are you from around here ? " I asked the girl .
She shook her head .
She wore a low - cut silvery top , and I tried not to stare at the swell of her breasts .
I said , " What 's your name ?
I'm Enn . " " Wain 's Wain , " she said , or something that sounded like it .
" I 'm a second . " " That 's uh .
That 's a different name .
" She fixed me with huge , liquid eyes .
" It indicates that my progenitor was also Wain , and that I am obliged to report back to her .
I may not breed . " " Ah .
Well .
Bit early for that anyway , is n't it ?
" She unclasped her hands , raised them above the table , spread her fingers .
" You see ? "
The little finger on her left hand was crooked , and it bifurcated at the top , splitting into two smaller fingertips .
A minor deformity .
" When I was finished a decision was needed .
Would I be retained , or eliminated ?
I was fortunate that the decision was with me .
Now , I travel , while my more perfect sisters remain at home in stasis .
They were firsts .
I am a second .
Soon I must return to Wain , and tell her all I have seen .
All my impressions of this place of yours . "
" I do n't actually live in Croydon , " I said .
" I do n't come from here . "
I wondered if she was American .
I had no idea what she was talking about .
" As you say , " she agreed , " neither of us comes from here . "
She folded her six - fingered left hand beneath her right , as if tucking it out of sight .
" I had expected it to be bigger , and cleaner , and more colorful .
But still , it is a jewel .
" She yawned , covered her mouth with her right hand , only for a moment , before it was back on the table again .
" I grow weary of the journeying , and I wish sometimes that it would end .
On a street in Rio at Carnival , I saw them on a bridge , golden and tall and insect - eyed and winged , and elated I almost ran to greet them , before I saw that they were only people in costumes .
I said to Hola Colt , ' Why do they try so hard to look like us ? ' and Hola Colt replied , ' Because they hate themselves , all shades of pink and brown , and so small . '
It is what I experience , even me , and I am not grown .
It is like a world of children , or of elves . "
Then she smiled , and said , " It was a good thing they could not any of them see Hola Colt . " " Um , " I said , " do you want to dance ?
" She shook her head immediately .
" It is not permitted , " she said .
" I can do nothing that might cause damage to property .
I am Wain's .
" " Would you like something to drink , then ? " " Water , " she said .
I went back to the kitchen and poured myself another Coke , and filled a cup with water from the tap .
From the kitchen back to the hall , and from there into the conservatory , but now it was quite empty .
I wondered if the girl had gone to the toilet , and if she might change her mind about dancing later .
I walked back to the front room and stared in .
The place was filling up .
There were more girls dancing , and several lads I did n't know , who looked a few years older than me and Vic .
The lads and the girls all kept their distance , but Vic was holding Stella 's hand as they danced , and when the song ended he put an arm around her , casually , almost proprietorially , to make sure that nobody else cut in .
I wondered if the girl I had been talking to in the conservatory was now upstairs , as she did not appear to be on the ground floor .
I walked into the living room , which was across the hall from the room where the people were dancing , and I sat down on the sofa .
There was a girl sitting there already .
She had dark hair , cut short and spiky , and a nervous manner .
Talk , I thought .
" Um , this mug of water 's going spare , " I told her , " if you want it ?
" She nodded , and reached out her hand and took the mug , extremely carefully , as if she were unused to taking things , as if she could trust neither her vision nor her hands .
" I love being a tourist , " she said , and smiled hesitantly .
She had a gap between her two front teeth , and she sipped the tap water as if she were an adult sipping a fine wine .
" The last tour , we went to sun , and we swam in sunfire pools with the whales .
We heard their histories and we shivered in the chill of the outer places , then we swam deepward where the heat churned and comforted us .
I wanted to go back .
This time , I wanted it .
There was so much I had not seen .
Instead we came to world .
Do you like it ? " " Like what ?
" She gestured vaguely to the room -- the sofa , the armchairs , the curtains , the unused gas fire .
" It 's all right , I suppose . "
" I told them I did not wish to visit world , " she said .
" My parent - teacher was unimpressed .
' You will have much to learn , ' it told me .
I said , ' I could learn more in sun , again .
Or in the deeps .
Jessa spun webs between galaxies .
I want to do that .
'" But there was no reasoning with it , and I came to world .
Parent - teacher engulfed me , and I was here , embodied in a decaying lump of meat hanging on a frame of calcium .
As I incarnated I felt things deep inside me , fluttering and pumping and squishing .
It was my first experience with pushing air through the mouth , vibrating the vocal cords on the way , and I used it to tell parent - teacher that I wished that I would die , which it acknowledged was the inevitable exit strategy from world .
" There were black worry beads wrapped around her wrist , and she fiddled with them as she spoke .
" But knowledge is there , in the meat , " she said , " and I am resolved to learn from it .
" We were sitting close at the center of the sofa now .
I decided I should put an arm around her , but casually .
I would extend my arm along the back of the sofa and eventually sort of creep it down , almost imperceptibly , until it was touching her .
She said , " The thing with the liquid in the eyes , when the world blurs .
Nobody told me , and I still do not understand .
I have touched the folds of the Whisper and pulsed and flown with the tachyon swans , and I still do not understand .
" She was n't the prettiest girl there , but she seemed nice enough , and she was a girl , anyway .
I let my arm slide down a little , tentatively , so that it made contact with her back , and she did not tell me to take it away .
Vic called to me then , from the doorway .
He was standing with his arm around Stella , protectively , waving at me .
I tried to let him know , by shaking my head , that I was onto something , but he called my name and , reluctantly , I got up from the sofa and walked over to the door .
" What ? " " Er. Look .
The party , " said Vic , apologetically .
" It 's not the one I thought it was .
I 've been talking to Stella and I figured it out .
Well , she sort of explained it to me .
We 're at a different party . " " Christ .
Are we in trouble ?
Do we have to go ?
" Stella shook her head .
He leaned down and kissed her , gently , on the lips .
" You 're just happy to have me here , are n't you darlin ' ? "
" You know I am , " she told him .
He looked from her back to me , and he smiled his white smile : roguish , lovable , a little bit Artful Dodger , a little bit wide - boy Prince Charming .
" Do n't worry .
They 're all tourists here anyway .
It 's a foreign exchange thing , innit ?
Like when we all went to Germany . " " It is ? " " Enn .
You got to talk to them .
And that means you got to listen to them , too .
You understand ? " " I did .
I already talked to a couple of them . " " You getting anywhere ? " " I was till you called me over . " " Sorry about that .
Look , I just wanted to fill you in .
Right ?
" And he patted my arm and he walked away with Stella .
Then , together , the two of them went up the stairs .
Understand me , all the girls at that party , in the twilight , were lovely ; they all had perfect faces but , more important than that , they had whatever strangeness of proportion , of oddness or humanity it is that makes a beauty something more than a shop window dummy .
Stella was the most lovely of any of them , but she , of course , was Vic's , and they were going upstairs together , and that was just how things would always be .
There were several people now sitting on the sofa , talking to the gap - toothed girl .
Someone told a joke , and they all laughed .
I would have had to push my way in there to sit next to her again , and it did n't look like she was expecting me back , or cared that I had gone , so I wandered out into the hall .
I glanced in at the dancers , and found myself wondering where the music was coming from .
I could n't see a record player or speakers .
From the hall I walked back to the kitchen .
Kitchens are good at parties .
You never need an excuse to be there , and , on the good side , at this party I could n't see any signs of someone 's mum .
I inspected the various bottles and cans on the kitchen table , then I poured a half an inch of Pernod into the bottom of my plastic cup , which I filled to the top with Coke .
I dropped in a couple of ice cubes and took a sip , relishing the sweet - shop tang of the drink .
" What 's that you 're drinking ? "
A girl 's voice .
" It 's Pernod , " I told her .
" It tastes like aniseed balls , only it 's alcoholic . "
I did n't say that I only tried it because I 'd heard someone in the crowd ask for a Pernod on a live Velvet Underground LP .
" Can I have one ? "
I poured another Pernod , topped it off with Coke , passed it to her .
Her hair was a coppery auburn , and it tumbled around her head in ringlets .
It 's not a hair style you see much now , but you saw it a lot back then .
" What 's your name ? " I asked .
" Triolet , " she said .
" Pretty name , " I told her , although I was n't sure that it was .
She was pretty , though .
" It 's a verse form , " she said , proudly .
" Like me . " " You 're a poem ?
" She smiled , and looked down and away , perhaps bashfully .
Her profile was almost flat -- a perfect Grecian nose that came down from her forehead in a straight line .
We did Antigone in the school theater the previous year .
I was the messenger who brings Creon the news of Antigone 's death .
We wore half - masks that made us look like that .
I thought of that play , looking at her face , in the kitchen , and I thought of Barry Smith 's drawings of women in the Conan comics : five years later I would have thought of the Pre-Raphaelites , of Jane Morris and Lizzie Siddall .
But I was only fifteen then .
" You 're a poem ? " I repeated .
She chewed her lower lip .
" If you want .
I am a poem , or I am a pattern , or a race of people whose world was swallowed by the sea . "
" Is n't it hard to be three things at the same time ? " " What 's your name ? " " Enn . " " So you are Enn , " she said .
" And you are a male .
And you are a biped .
Is it hard to be three things at the same time ? " " But they are n't different things .
I mean , they are n't contradictory . "
It was a word I had read many times but never said aloud before that night , and I put the stresses in the wrong places .
tradictShe wore a thin dress made of a white , silky fabric .
Her eyes were a pale green , a color that would now make me think of tinted contact lenses ; but this was thirty years ago ; things were different then .
I remember wondering about Vic and Stella , upstairs .
By now , I was sure that they were in one of the bedrooms , and I envied Vic so much it almost hurt .
Still , I was talking to this girl , even if we were talking nonsense , even if her name was n't really Triolet ( my generation had not been given hippie names : all the Rainbows and the Sunshines and the Moons , they were only six , seven , eight years old back then ) .
She said , " We knew that it would soon be over , and so we put it all into a poem , to tell the universe who we were , and why we were here , and what we said and did and thought and dreamed and yearned for .
We wrapped our dreams in words and patterned the words so that they would live forever , unforgettable .
Then we sent the poem as a pattern of flux , to wait in the heart of a star , beaming out its message in pulses and bursts and fuzzes across the electromagnetic spectrum , until the time when , on worlds a thousand sun systems distant , the pattern would be decoded and read , and it would become a poem once again .
" " And then what happened ?
" She looked at me with her green eyes , and it was as if she stared out at me from her own Antigone half - mask ; but as if her pale green eyes were just a different , deeper , part of the mask .
" You cannot hear a poem without it changing you , " she told me .
" They heard it , and it colonized them .
It inherited them and it inhabited them , its rhythms becoming part of the way that they thought ; its images permanently transmuting their metaphors ; its verses , its outlook , its aspirations becoming their lives .
Within a generation their children would be born already knowing the poem , and , sooner rather than later , as these things go , there were no more children born .
There was no need for them , not any longer .
There was only a poem , which took flesh and walked and spread itself across the vastness of the known .
" I edged closer to her , so I could feel my leg pressing against hers .
She seemed to welcome it : she put her hand on my arm , affectionately , and I felt a smile spreading across my face .
" There are places that we are welcomed , " said Triolet , " and places where we are regarded as a noxious weed , or as a disease , something immediately to be quarantined and eliminated .
But where does contagion end and art begin ? "
" I do n't know , " I said , still smiling .
I could hear the unfamiliar music as it pulsed and scattered and boomed in the front room .
She leaned into me then and -- I suppose it was a kiss .
. . . I suppose .
She pressed her lips to my lips , anyway , and then , satisfied , she pulled back , as if she had now marked me as her own .
" Would you like to hear it ? " she asked , and I nodded , unsure what she was offering me , but certain that I needed anything she was willing to give me .
She began to whisper something in my ear .
It 's the strangest thing about poetry -- you can tell it 's poetry , even if you do n't speak the language .
You can hear Homer 's Greek without understanding a word , and you still know it 's poetry .
I 've heard Polish poetry , and Inuit poetry , and I knew what it was without knowing .
Her whisper was like that .
I did n't know the language , but her words washed through me , perfect , and in my mind 's eye I saw towers of glass and diamond ; and people with eyes of the palest green ; and , unstoppable , beneath every syllable , I could feel the relentless advance of the ocean .
Perhaps I kissed her properly .
I do n't remember .
I know I wanted to .
And then Vic was shaking me violently .
" Come on ! " he was shouting .
" Quickly .
Come on !
" In my head I began to come back from a thousand miles away .
" Idiot .
Come on .
Just get a move on , " he said , and he swore at me .
There was fury in his voice .
For the first time that evening I recognized one of the songs being played in the front room .
A sad saxophone wail followed by a cascade of liquid chords , a man 's voice singing cut - up lyrics about the sons of the silent age .
I wanted to stay and hear the song .
She said , " I am not finished .
There is yet more of me . " " Sorry love , " said Vic , but he was n't smiling any longer .
" There 'll be another time , " and he grabbed me by the elbow and he twisted and pulled , forcing me from the room .
I did not resist .
I knew from experience that Vic could beat the stuffing out me if he got it into his head to do so .
He would n't do it unless he was upset or angry , but he was angry now .
Out into the front hall .
As Vic pulled open the door , I looked back one last time , over my shoulder , hoping to see Triolet in the doorway to the kitchen , but she was not there .
I saw Stella , though , at the top of the stairs .
She was staring down at Vic , and I saw her face .
This all happened thirty years ago .
I have forgotten much , and I will forget more , and in the end I will forget everything ; yet , if I have any certainty of life beyond death , it is all wrapped up not in psalms or hymns , but in this one thing alone : I cannot believe that I will ever forget that moment , or forget the expression on Stella 's face as she watched Vic hurrying away from her .
Even in death I shall remember that .
Her clothes were in disarray , and there was makeup smudged across her face , and her eyes -- You would n't want to make a universe angry .
I bet an angry universe would look at you with eyes like that .
We ran then , me and Vic , away from the party and the tourists and the twilight , ran as if a lightning storm was on our heels , a mad helter - skelter dash down the confusion of streets , threading through the maze , and we did not look back , and we did not stop until we could not breathe ; and then we stopped and panted , unable to run any longer .
We were in pain .
I held on to a wall , and Vic threw up , hard and long , into the gutter .
He wiped his mouth .
" She was n't a --"
He stopped .
He shook his head .
Then he said , " You know . . .
I think there 's a thing .
When you 've gone as far as you dare .
And if you go any further , you would n't be you anymore ?
You'd be the person who 'd done that ?
The places you just ca n't go .
. . .
I think that happened to me tonight .
" I thought I knew what he was saying .
" Screw her , you mean ? " I said .
He rammed a knuckle hard against my temple , and twisted it violently .
I wondered if I was going to have to fight him -- and lose -- but after a moment he lowered his hand and moved away from me , making a low , gulping noise .
I looked at him curiously , and I realized that he was crying : his face was scarlet ; snot and tears ran down his cheeks .
Vic was sobbing in the street , as unselfconsciously and heartbreakingly as a little boy .
He walked away from me then , shoulders heaving , and he hurried down the road so he was in front of me and I could no longer see his face .
I wondered what had occurred in that upstairs room to make him behave like that , to scare him so , and I could not even begin to guess .
The streetlights came on , one by one ; Vic stumbled on ahead , while I trudged down the street behind him in the dusk , my feet treading out the measure of a poem that , try as I might , I could not properly remember and would never be able to repeat .
Steven ( of LLW and Sinobytes renown ) sent me an e-mail yesterday that has been make its way from Chinese inbox to Chinese inbox in an expedient fashion .
I thought it was hilarious , and a some what rare opportunity to get a peek at the Chinese taking the piss at their own expense .

Crowds
4月20日上午，约20万人入园参观。结果人潮拥挤，迫使中国馆内的许多场馆停止参观。当时好象只有澳大利亚馆依然开放，于是无奈的观众都集中到此馆排队，排队长度有5~600米。突然间大家一拥往前奔跑，原来此馆也经受不住人多的压力，只好关闭。澳大利亚馆内工作人员在门口不断向等候者道歉解释…… /
On the morning of April 20th , about 200,000 people visited the Expo grounds .
The resulting crowds forced the China pavilion ’s venues to close .
At that time it appeared only the Australian pavilion was still open .
With no other option the visitors got in line at the pavilion , creating a 5 - 600 m long queue .
Suddenly the crowd pushed forward , and because the pavilion could not accommodate the crowd , they also closed .
The Australian pavilion representative continuously apologized to the waiting crowd …
2010.4.20上海世博会第一天试运行，迎来大批人流，很多馆都还在最后冲刺没开门迎客，使得少数试运行的展馆门口人山人海。德国馆吃不消了，仿佛被人潮吓坏了，直接贴出了“德国馆，关了”。看把德国人给逼的。。。 / 2010.4.20
For the Shanghai Expo trial run , a large crowd showed up , but many pavilions were still under preparations and so not open .
This forced the visitors to the gates of the only open pavilions .
The German pavilion , unable to accommodate the masses , quickly put up “ Closed ” signs .
Look what “ we ’ve ” forced the Germans to do .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Amazon.com plans to keep its
Kindle e-reader device focused on long - form reading to compete against new multi-purpose tablet devices such as the iPad , the CEO of the e-commerce giant said on Tuesday .
At an annual meeting of Amazon AMZN , +0.12 % shareholders , CEO Jeff Bezos said the company has sold " millions " of its e-reader product known as the Kindle .
The company has never given specific sales data for the device , which first went on sale two - and - a - half years ago and has since shaken up the market for electronic books .

But the Kindle has since come under heavy competition , not only from other companies such as Sony Corp .
that are making E - Ink - based reader devices , but from powerhouse Apple Inc. AAPL , +1.50 % , which launched its iPad tablet in early April and has since sold more than 1 million units of the device .
Asked by a shareholder at the meeting about the iPad , Bezos said the Kindle will compete by remaining focused on readers .
" The Kindle will compete with these LCD devices like the iPad by being a very focused product , " Bezos said at the meeting , which was webcast .
" Serious readers are going to want a purpose - built device , because it's an important activity for them . "

Das Glioblastom ist die häufigste und gefährlichste Gehirntumor - Art. Die Standard - Behandlungsmethoden wie das operative Entfernen des Tumors , Bestrahlung und Chemotherapie verschaffen den Patienten wenig Aufschub : Nur etwa die Hälfte der Erkrankten überlebt das erste Jahr nach der Diagnose .
Wissenschaftler vom Deutschen Krebsforschungszentrum ( DKFZ ) und der Neurochirurgischen Universitätsklinik in Heidelberg haben jetzt in Versuchen mit Ratten gezeigt , dass Glioblastome durch eine Behandlung mit bestimmten Parvoviren ( Typ H - 1 ) vollständig beseitigt werden können – ohne dass unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen auftreten , berichtet Technology Review in seiner Online - Ausgabe .
Da diese Virussorte beim Menschen keine Erkrankungen verursachen , hoffen die Forscher um Karsten Geletneky , Jean Rommelaere und Jörg Schlehofer , dass sich die Behandlung auch bei menschlichen Patienten bewähren wird .

If there ’s one thing we ca n’t stand , its getting all geared up to go somewhere , do something , or get something , only to get there and find the doors locked and lights out because its Sunday .
In a town like this with so many small businesses , it can be twice as bad , because whoever is n’t closed Sunday is probably closed Monday .
Nowhere is this more a problem than with arcane , useless , Christian - inspired laws about buying liquor on Sundays .
Fortunately for us , Hopkins Deli stands at the ready 7 days a week to insure our liquor cabinet never goes empty .
Long a favorite of the Hopkins Blue Jays , the Deli caters not only to college kids , but to lazy drunks of all ages , all over North Baltimore .
Open every day all day from 8 am until 11 pm , this place is more than the sum of it ’s parts .
It ’s a carryout with a full menu of pizzas and subs , pasta , wings , etc , a full service liquor store with a decent beer and wine selection , part convenience store and part grocery suprette , plus a nice spot to play keno and enjoy free wifi .
But aside from being able to nab a fifth of Granddad and a sixer of Heavy Seas at 10 pm on a Sunday , the real brilliance of Hopkins Deli is in their delivery .
You can call or even order online , and it ’s an open secret that they ’ll deliver anything in the store along with your order .
So , if like the Chop you find yourself tired , lazy , hungover and hungry on Sunday evening with an empty fridge and nothing but Kahlua and Seagram ’s gin to sustain you , Hopkins Deli can be a lifesaver when you do n’t feel like taking a shower , getting dressed , and making 3 or 4 different stops .
Since we moved into the Stately North Baltimore Pleasure Dome , its quickly become our go - to spot in the clutch .
Lets say you need a six pack of Lagunitas , some cheese fries and wings , a can of Maxwell House , a loaf of bread , a can of cat food , a mega millions ticket and a copy of the Sunday Sun … no problem .

Explanation : Spiral galaxy NGC 4651 is a mere 35 million light - years distant , toward the well - groomed constellation Coma Berenices .
About 50 thousand light - years across , this galaxy is seen to have a faint umbrella - shaped structure ( right ) that seems to extend some 50 thousand light - years farther , beyond the bright galactic disk .
The giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be composed of tidal star streams .
The streams themselves are extensive trails of stars gravitationally stripped from a smaller satellite galaxy that was eventually torn apart .
Placing your cursor over the image will superimpose a simulation of the satellite galaxy 's path as it was disrupted and absorbed into NGC 4651 .
Recent work by a remarkable collaboration of amateur and professional astronomers to image faint structures around bright galaxies suggests that even in nearby galaxies , such tidal star streams are common .
The result is predicted by models of galaxy formation , including the formation of our Milky Way .

Event - based programming has been highly touted in recent years as the best way to write highly concurrent applications .
Having worked on several of these systems , we now believe this approach to be a mistake .
Specifically , we believe that threads can achieve all of the strengths of events , including support for high concurrency , low overhead , and a simple concurrency model .
Moreover , we argue that threads allow a simpler and more natural programming style .
We examine the claimed strengths of events over threads and show that the weaknesses of threads are artifacts of specific threading implementations and not inherent to the threading paradigm .
As evidence , we present a user - level thread package that scales to 100,000 threads and achieves excellent performance in a web server .
We also refine the duality argument of Lauer and Needham , which implies that good implementations of thread systems and event systems will have similar performance .
Finally , we argue that compiler support for thread systems is a fruitful area for future research .
It is a mistake to attempt high concurrency without help from the compiler , and we discuss several enhancements that are enabled by relatively simple compiler changes .
Introduction
Highly concurrent applications such as Internet servers and transaction processing databases present a number of challenges to application designers .
First , handling large numbers of concurrent tasks requires the use of scalable data structures .
Second , these systems typically operate near maximum capacity , which creates resource contention and high sensitivity to scheduling decisions ; overload must be handled with care to avoid thrashing .
Finally , race conditions and subtle corner cases are common , which makes debugging and code maintenance difficult .
Threaded servers have historically failed to meet these challenges , leading many researchers to conclude that event - based programming is the best ( or even only ) way to achieve high performance in highly concurrent applications .
The literature gives four primary arguments for the supremacy of events :
Inexpensive synchronization due to cooperative multitasking ;
Lower overhead for managing state ( no stacks ) ;
Better scheduling and locality , based on application - level information ; and
More flexible control flow ( not just call / return ) .
Ultimately , our experience led us to conclude that event - based programming is the wrong choice for highly concurrent systems .
We believe that ( 1 ) threads provide a more natural abstraction for high - concurrency servers , and that ( 2 ) small improvements to compilers and thread runtime systems can eliminate the historical reasons to use events .
Additionally , threads are more amenable to compiler - based enhancements ; we believe the right paradigm for highly concurrent applications is a thread package with better compiler support .
Section 2 compares events with threads and rebuts the common arguments against threads .
Next , Section 3 explains why threads are particularly natural for writing high - concurrency servers .
Section 4 explores the value of compiler support for threads .
In Section 5 , we validate our approach with a simple web server .
Finally , Section 6 covers ( some ) related work , and Section 7 concludes .
Threads vs. Events
The debate between threads and events is a very old one .
Lauer and Needham attempted to end the discussion in 1978 by showing that message - passing systems and process - based systems are duals , both in terms of program structure and performance characteristics [ 10 ] .
Nonetheless , in recent years many authors have declared the need for event - driven programming for highly concurrent systems [ 11,12,17 ] .
To understand the threads and events debate , it is useful to reexamine the duality arguments of Lauer and Needham .
Lauer and Needham describe canonical threaded and message - passing ( i.e. , event - based ) systems .
Then , they provide a mapping between the concepts of the two regimes ( paraphrased in Figure 1 ) and make the case that with proper implementations , these two approaches should yield equivalent performance .
Finally , they argue that the decision comes down to which paradigm is more natural for the target application .
In the case of high - concurrency servers , we believe the thread - based approach is preferable .
Figure : A selection of dual notions in thread and event systems , paraphrased from Lauer and Needham .
We have converted their terminology to contemporary terms from event - driven systems .
Events
Threads event handlers
events accepted by a handler
SendMessage / AwaitReply
SendReply
waiting for messages
monitors
functions exported by a module
procedure call , or fork / join
return from procedure
waiting on condition variables
The message - passing systems described by Lauer and Needham do not correspond precisely to modern event systems in their full generality .
First , Lauer and Needham ignore the cooperative scheduling used by events for synchronization .
Second , most event systems use shared memory and global data structures , which are described as atypical for Lauer and Needham 's message - passing systems .
In fact , the only event system that really matches their canonical message - passing system is SEDA [ 17 ] , whose stages and queues map exactly to processes and message ports .
1
Finally , the performance equivalence claimed by Lauer and Needham requires equally good implementations ; we do n't believe there has been a suitable threads implementation for very high concurrency .
We demonstrate one in the next section , and we discuss further enhancements in Section 4 .
In arguing that performance should be equivalent , Lauer and Needham implicitly use a graph that we call a blocking graph .
This graph describes the flow of control through an application with respect to blocking or yielding points .
Each node in this graph represents a blocking or yielding point , and each edge represents the code that is executed between two such points .
The Lauer - Needham duality argument essentially says that duals have the same graph .
The duality argument suggests that criticisms of thread performance and usability in recent years have been motivated by problems with specific threading packages , rather than with threads in general .
We examine the most common criticisms below .
Performance .
Criticism : Many attempts to use threads for high concurrency have not performed well .
We do n't dispute this criticism ; rather , we believe it is an artifact of poor thread implementations , at least with respect to high concurrency .
None of the currently available thread packages were designed for both high concurrency and blocking operations , and thus it is not surprising that they perform poorly .
A major source of overhead is the presence of operations that are O ( n ) in the number of threads .
Another common problem with thread packages is their relatively high context switch overhead when compared with events .
This overhead is due to both preemption , which requires saving registers and other state during context switches , and additional kernel crossings ( in the case of kernel threads ) .
However , these shortcomings are not intrinsic properties of threads .
To illustrate this fact , we repeated the SEDA threaded server benchmark [ 17 ] with a modified version of the GNU Pth user - level threading package , which we optimized to remove most of the O( n ) operations from the scheduler .
The results are shown in Figure 2 .
Our optimized version of Pth scales quite well up to 100,000 threads , easily matching the performance of the event - based server .
Figure : A repeat of the threaded server benchmark from the SEDA paper [ 17 ] .
The threaded server uses a preallocated thread pool to process requests , while the event server uses a single thread to pull items from the queue .
Requests are internally generated to avoid network effects .
Each request consists of an 8 K read from a cached disk file .
Control Flow .
Criticism : Threads have restrictive control flow .
One argument against threaded programming is that it encourages the programmer to think too linearly about control flow , potentially precluding the use of more efficient control flow patterns .
However , complicated control flow patterns are rare in practice .
We examined the code structure of the Flash web server and of several applications in Ninja , SEDA , and TinyOS [ 8,12,16,17 ] .
In all cases , the control flow patterns used by these applications fell into three simple categories : call / return , parallel calls , and pipelines .
All of these patterns can be expressed more naturally with threads .
We believe more complex patterns are not used because they are difficult to use well .
The accidental non-linearities that often occur in event systems are already hard to understand , leading to subtle races and other errors .
Intentionally complicated control flow is equally error prone .
Indeed , it is no coincidence that common event patterns map cleanly onto the call / return mechanism of threads .
Robust systems need acknowledgements for error handling , for storage deallocation , and for cleanup ; thus , they need a “ return ” even in the event model .
The only patterns we considered that are less graceful with threads are dynamic fan - in and fan - out ; such patterns might occur with multicast or publish / subscribe applications .
In these cases , events are probably more natural .
However , none of the high - concurrency servers that we studied used these patterns .
Synchronization .
Criticism : Thread synchronization mechanisms are too heavyweight .
Event systems often claim as an advantage that cooperative multitasking gives them synchronization “ for free , ” since the runtime system does not need to provide mutexes , handle wait queues , and so on [ 11 ] .
However , Adya et al . [ 1 ] show that this advantage is really due to cooperative multitasking ( i.e. , no preemption ) , not events themselves ; thus , cooperative thread systems can reap the same benefits .
It is important to note that in either regime , cooperative multitasking only provides “ free ” synchronization on uniprocessors , whereas many high - concurrency servers run on multiprocessors .
We discuss compiler techniques for supporting multiprocessors in Section 4.3 .
State Management .
Criticism : Thread stacks are an ineffective way to manage live state .
Threaded systems typically face a tradeoff between risking stack overflow and wasting virtual address space on large stacks .
Since event systems typically use few threads and unwind the thread stack after each event handler , they avoid this problem .
To solve this problem in threaded servers , we propose a mechanism that will enable dynamic stack growth ; we will discuss this solution in Section 4 .
Additionally , event systems encourage programmers to minimize live state at blocking points , since they require the programmer to manage this state by hand .
In contrast , thread systems provide automatic state management via the call stack , and this mechanism can allow programmers to be wasteful .
Section 4 details our solution to this problem .
Scheduling .
Criticism :
The virtual processor model provided by threads forces the runtime system to be too generic and prevents it from making optimal scheduling decisions .
Event systems are capable of scheduling event deliveries at application level .
Hence , the application can perform shortest remaining completion time scheduling , favor certain request streams , or perform other optimizations .
There has also been some evidence that events allow better code locality by running several of the same kind of event in a row [ 9 ] .
However , Lauer - Needham duality indicates that we can apply the same scheduling tricks to cooperatively scheduled threads .
The above arguments show that threads can perform at least as well as events for high concurrency and that there are no substantial qualitative advantages to events .
The absence of scalable user - level threads has provided the largest push toward the event style , but we have shown that this deficiency is an artifact of the available implementations rather than a fundamental property of the thread abstraction .
The Case for Threads
Up to this point , we have largely argued that threads and events are equivalent in power and that threads can in fact perform well with high concurrency .
In this section , we argue that threads are actually a more appropriate abstraction for high - concurrency servers .
This conclusion is based on two observations about modern servers .
First , the concurrency in modern servers results from concurrent requests that are largely independent .
Second , the code that handles each request is usually sequential .
We believe that threads provide a better programming abstraction for servers with these two properties .
Control Flow .
For these high - concurrency systems , event - based programming tends to obfuscate the control flow of the application .
For instance , many event systems “ call ” a method in another module by sending an event and expect a “ return ” from that method via a similar event mechanism .
In order to understand the application , the programmer must mentally match these call / return pairs , even when they are in different parts of the code .
Furthermore , these call / return pairs often require the programmer to manually save and restore live state .
This process , referred to as “ stack ripping ” by Adya et al. [ 1 ] , is a major burden for programmers who wish to use event systems .
Finally , this obfuscation of the program 's control flow can also lead to subtle race conditions and logic errors due to unexpected message arrivals .
Thread systems allow programmers to express control flow and encapsulate state in a more natural manner .
Syntactically , thread systems group calls with returns , making it much easier to understand cause / effect relationships , and ensuring a one - to - one relationship .
Similarly , the run-time call stack encapsulates all live state for a task , making existing debugging tools quite effective .
Exception Handling and State Lifetime .
Cleaning up task state after exceptions and after normal termination is simpler in a threaded system , since the thread stack naturally tracks the live state for that task .
In event systems , task state is typically heap allocated .
Freeing this state at the correct time can be extremely difficult because branches in the application 's control flow ( especially in the case of error conditions ) can cause deallocation steps to be missed .
Many event systems , such as Ninja and SEDA , use garbage collection to solve this problem .
However , previous work has found that Java 's general - purpose garbage collection mechanism is inappropriate for high - performance systems [ 14 ] .
Inktomi's Traffic Server used reference counting to manage state , but maintaining correct counts was difficult , particularly for error handling .
2
Existing Systems .
The preference for threads is subtly visible even in existing event - driven systems .
For example , our own Ninja system [ 16 ] ended up using threads for the most complex parts , such as recovery , simply because it was nearly impossible to get correct behavior using events ( which we tried first ) .
In addition , applications that did n't need high concurrency were always written with threads , just because it was simpler .
Similarly , the FTP server in Harvest uses threads [ 4 ] .
Just Fix Events ?
One could argue that instead of switching to thread systems , we should build tools or languages that address the problems with event systems ( i.e. , reply matching , live state management , and shared state management ) .
However , such tools would effectively duplicate the syntax and run-time behavior of threads .
As a case in point , the cooperative task management technique described by Adya et al . [ 1 ] allows users of an event system to write thread - like code that gets transformed into continuations around blocking calls .
In many cases , fixing the problems with events is tantamount to switching to threads .
Compiler Support for Threads
Tighter integration between compilers and runtime systems is an extremely powerful concept for systems design .
Threaded systems can achieve improved safety and performance with only minor modifications to existing compilers and runtime systems .
We describe how this synergy can be used both to overcome limitations in current threads packages and to improve safety , programmer productivity , and performance .
Synchronization
Evaluation
To evaluate the ability of threads to support high concurrency , we designed and implemented a simple ( 5000 line ) user - level cooperative threading package for Linux .
Our thread package uses the coro coroutine library [ 15 ] for minimalist context switching , and it translates blocking I/O requests to asynchronous requests internally .
For asynchronous socket I/O , we use the UNIX poll ( ) system call , whereas asynchronous disk I/O is provided by a thread pool that performs blocking I /O operations .
The library also overrides blocking system calls and provides a simple emulation of pthreads , which allows applications written for our library to compile unmodified with standard pthreads .
With this thread package we wrote a 700 - line test web server , Knot .
Knot accepts static data requests , allows persistent connections , and includes a basic page cache .
The code is written in a clear , straightforward threaded style and required very little performance tuning .
We compared the performance of Knot to that of SEDA 's event - driven web server , Haboob , using the test suite used to evaluate SEDA [ 17 ] .
The / dev / poll patch used for the original Haboob tests has been deprecated , so our tests of Haboob used standard UNIX poll ( ) ( as does Knot ) .
The test machine was a 2x2000 MHz Xeon SMP with 1 GB of RAM running Linux 2.4.20 .
The test uses a small workload , so there is little disk activity .
We ran Haboob with the 1.4 JVM from IBM , with the JIT enabled .
Figure 3 presents the results .
Figure : Web server bandwidth versus the number of simultaneous clients .
We were unable to run the benchmark for Haboob with more than 16384 clients , as Haboob ran out of memory .
We tested two different scheduling policies for Knot , one that favors processing of active connections over accepting new ones ( Knot - C in the figure ) and one that does the reverse ( Knot - A ) .
The first policy provides a natural throttling mechanism by limiting the number of new connections when the server is saturated with requests .
The second policy was designed to create higher internal concurrency , and it more closely matches the policy used by Haboob .
Figure 3 shows that Knot and Haboob have the same general performance pattern .
Initially , there is a linear increase in bandwidth as the number of simultaneous connections increases ; when the server is saturated , the bandwidth levels out .
The performance degradation for both Knot - A and Haboob is due to the poor scalability of poll ( ) .
Using the newer sys_epoll system call with Knot avoids this problem and achieves excellent scalability .
However , we have used the poll ( ) result for comparison , since sys_epoll is incompatible with Haboob 's socket library .
This result shows that a well - designed thread package can achieve the same scaling behavior as a well - designed event system .
The steady - state bandwidth achieved by Knot - C is nearly 700 Mbit/s .
At this rate , the server is apparently limited by interrupt processing overhead in the kernel .
We believe the performance spike around 1024 clients is due to lower interrupt overhead when fewer connections to the server are being created .
Haboob 's maximum bandwidth of 500 Mbit/s is significantly lower than Knot 's , because Haboob becomes CPU limited at 512 clients .
There are several possible reasons for this result .
First , Haboob 's thread - pool - per - handler model requires context switches whenever events pass from one handler to another .
This requirement causes Haboob to context switch 30,000 times per second when fully loaded -- more than 6 times as frequently as Knot .
Second , the proliferation of small modules in Haboob and SEDA ( a natural outgrowth of the event programming model ) creates a large number of module crossings and queuing operations .
Third , Haboob creates many temporary objects and relies heavily on garbage collection .
These challenges seem deeply tied to the event model ; the simpler threaded style of Knot avoids these problems and allows for more efficient execution .
Finally , event systems require various forms of run-time dispatch , since the next event handler to execute is not known statically .
This problem is related to the problem of ambiguous control flow , which affects performance by reducing opportunities for compiler optimizations and by increasing CPU pipeline stalls .
Related Work
Ousterhout [ 11 ] made the most well - known case in favor of events , but his arguments do not conflict with ours .
He argues that programming with concurrency is fundamentally difficult , and he concludes that cooperatively scheduled events are preferable ( for most purposes ) because they allow programmers to avoid concurrent code in most cases .
He explicitly supports the use of threads for true concurrency , which is the case in our target space .
We also agree that cooperative scheduling helps to simplify concurrency , but we argue that this tool is better used in the context of the simpler programming model of threads .
Adya et al. [ 1 ] cover a subset of these issues better than we have .
They identify the value of cooperative scheduling for threads , and they define the term “ stack ripping ” for management of live state .
Our work expands on these ideas by exploring thread performance issues and compiler support techniques .
SEDA is a hybrid approach between events and threads , using events between stages and threads within them [ 17 ] .
This approach is quite similar to the message - passing model discussed by Lauer and Needham [ 10 ] , though Lauer and Needham advocate a single thread per stage in order to avoid synchronization within a stage .
SEDA showed the value of keeping the server in its operating range , which it did by using explicit queues ; we agree that the various queues for threads should be visible , as they enable better debugging and scheduling .
In addition , the stage boundaries of SEDA provide a form of modularity that simplifies composition in the case of pipelines .
When call / return patterns are used , such boundaries require stack ripping and are better implemented with threads using blocking calls .
Many of the techniques we advocate for improving threads were introduced in previous work .
Filaments [ 7 ] and NT's Fibers are good examples of cooperative user - level threads packages , although neither is targeted at large numbers of blocking threads .
Languages such as Erlang [ 2 ] and Concurrent ML [ 13 ] include direct support for concurrency and lightweight threading .
Bruggeman et al . [ 3 ] employ dynamically linked stacks to implement one - shot continuations , which can in turn be used to build user - level thread packages .
Our contribution is to bring these techniques together in a single package and to make them accessible to a broader community of programmers .
Conclusions
Although event systems have been used to obtain good performance in high concurrency systems , we have shown that similar or even higher performance can be achieved with threads .
Moreover , the simpler programming model and wealth of compiler analyses that threaded systems afford gives threads an important advantage over events when writing highly concurrent servers .
In the future , we advocate tight integration between the compiler and the thread system , which will result in a programming model that offers a clean and simple interface to the programmer while achieving superior performance .

An Auckland college after - ball party turned into an alcohol - free event after the intervention of police and liquor authorities overnight .
Pakuranga College students had paid $ 55 for the party , which followed the annual school ball .
But when they arrived at the venue , a vacant warehouse in Onehunga , they found Manukau District Licensing Agency inspector Paul Radich had prevented organisers from taking any alcohol inside , the New Zealand Herald reported .
A van which was carrying alcohol was at the warehouse about 30 minutes before the buses were due to arrive but was sent away .
It returned to park opposite the warehouse shortly after the party was due to start but Mr Radich got it to leave .

ENGINEERING students in Italy have come up with a novel idea to warn road users about the increasing number of potholes appearing on European roads .
Local authorities throughout Europe have neglected repairing their countries potholed roads , claiming they have no more funding to rectify the problem , so students Domenico Diego and Cristina Corradini have persuaded Italian road safety experts to adopt their ' Street Safe Initiative ' , which involves a layer of yellow asphalt a few centimetres beneath the road surface , so potholes become visible once the first layer of tarmac has eroded away .
Yes , it does sound bizarre but believe it or not a test - program will start this year in Rho , Italy .
The program represents a feasibility test for the idea - Diego plans to bring the product to multiple European markets .
“ We have compared the road surface to the human skin - when we are wounded , we start to bleed .
So our idea is to put a layer of yellow asphalt beneath the tarmac , which appears and creates a high chromatic contrast that is visible from a distance .
This way , the potholes are signaled as they appear and road users have enough time to react safely , ” Milan Polytechnic student Diego said .
Last month , Visordown reported the news the UK is facing a £ 10 billion bill to repair the two million potholes that plague the country 's road system .
Imagine that .
In 10 years time our roads could look like something from ' The Wizard of Oz ' .

More or less on a whim I split the GHCN data into two sets :
Those stations marked as being at an airport ; those stations not marked as being at an airport .
This is easy to do because the v2.inv file puts an ‘ A ’ in column 81 ( counting from 0 ) for airport stations .
Here ’s the airport versus non-airport comparison for ccc - gistemp :
Certainly for the most recent 50 years it does n’t seem to matter much whether you use exclusively airport based measurements or exclude airport based measurements ( considering the global anomaly ) .
My earlier post about the 1990s station “ dropout ” used a similar technique of splitting the input data into two sets .

“ We again find ourselves approaching the point when the financial sector will scream : rescue us all or face global economic collapse , ” warned Simon Johnson , the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund .
“ The markets came close to a total meltdown on Wednesday , ” one senior banker told the Financial Times .
By Thursday morning , things still looked grim , despite a successful debt issue by the Italian government .
Mohamed El - Erian , the CEO of PIMCO , the giant bond investment company , published an op-ed in the FT warning that a Greek default seems almost inevitable .
“ The Greek debt crisis has morphed into something that is potentially more sinister for Europe and the global economy , ” El - Erian wrote .
Paul Krugman , the Nobel prize - winning economist , thinks a default is “ all too easy to imagine , ” and worries about what could happen to Spain , Portugal , and Italy “ if Greece is in effect forced out of the euro . ”
Krugman , like Reuters financial blogger Felix Salmon , has decided to “ go hide under the table . ”
Meanwhile , the projected cost of a Greek “ bailout ” — which many experts think wo n’t work , anyway — has skyrocketed from € 45 ( $ 60 billion ) to € 120 ( $ 159 billion ) .
That would make it the largest “ rescue ” of a country ever .
It would also begin to drain the cash of the International Monetary Fund , which received $ 750 billion in new funding from the world ’s 20 biggest economies just last year .
That could hamper the IMF ’s ability to intervene if the Greek crisis spreads to Portugal , Ireland , or Spain , which has an economy five times the size of Greece ’s.
Rep. Mark Kirk ( R - Ill. ) , a onetime IMF employee who is running for President Barack Obama ’s old Senate seat in Illinois , has called for congressional hearings on the fund ’s ability to deal with Europe ’s problems .
Kirk is right to be worried .
As Salmon points out , national debt crises are inextricably linked to banking crises .
“ The world has never seen an insolvent country with solvent banks , and Greece wo n’t be the first , ” Salmon argues .
The banking system is interconnected and interdependent .
If the debt crisis spreads , Spanish , Irish , and even Swiss and German banks could be in trouble .
That could spell problems for the American financial system and the fragile economic recovery .
Crunch time for Europe is rapidly approaching .
Greece has to pay bondholders some € 8 billion ( $ 10.6 billion ) by May 19 , and its credit rating , reduced to junk status on Tuesday , is too low to effectively borrow that kind of money from private lenders .
So Greece ’s only hope is to reach a deal with the IMF soon .
Another big test for the Eurozone will come next Thursday , when Spain hopes to sell around € 3 billion ( $ 4 billion ) in bonds .
If it has trouble auctioning them off , the crisis could come to a head .
The Economist says the European Union ( especially the big economies ) have to act quickly and work with the IMF to reach a deal on the Greek debt as soon as possible .
Will ASAP be soon enough ?
Yesterday various reports came out late in the afternoon that Tom Hicks is " worried " or even " doubtful " about the sale of the Texas Rangers .
A sale that was thought to be as good as done on January 23rd , with only some minor details ( like , ahem , the sale price ) to be ironed out by both parties .
They had an April 9th deadline that passed by .
There have been disturbing details leaking about the negotiations seemingly every week since , and every time , Stars fans sigh and wonder if this is going to happen to us .
We also wonder if the Rangers sale needs to be complete before the sale of the hockey team can move forward .
Yesterday Richard Durrett of ESPN Dallas reported that the sale of the Stars is " just starting " and had this quote from Hicks : " We 're working on it , " Hicks said .
" It 's going to be done very quietly and learn some things from the Rangers process .
We want to do it as efficiently as possible . "
Very quietly ?
I hope you 'll forgive my skepticism , but for anything to happen quietly with Mr. Hicks in these troubled times would be quite the rarity indeed .
Consternation over the Liverpool FC sale is already starting to build ...
Our friends stuck in the same HSG prison as we are across the pond are also hoping for a rather swift pace to things , but they must be as patient as Tom told ESPN he 'll be :
However , it appears there may be little prospect of a swift sale as , following initial reports the club was up for sale at around £ 500 million , Hicks has now suggested they would be happy to wait to find a buyer willing to meet his apparent £ 654 million valuation .
" Liverpool Football Club has been a great investment , " he told the Sunday Mirror .
" It has probably tripled in value .
" His apparent valuaiton . "
At what price do you suppose Hicks values the Dallas Stars ?
Similar abiguities on asking price exist in the Rangers deal .
This is from baseball guru Evan Grant 's story in the Dallas Morning News :
A huge step toward mass production of coveted form of carbon
( Nanowerk News ) Scientists have leaped over a major hurdle in efforts to begin commercial production of a form of carbon that could rival silicon in its potential for revolutionizing electronics devices ranging from supercomputers to cell phones .
Called graphene , the material consists of a layer of graphite 50,000 times thinner than a human hair with unique electronic properties .
Their study appears in ACS ' Nano Letters ( " Graphene Synthesis on Cubic SiC / Si Wafers .
Perspectives for Mass Production of Graphene - Based Electronic Devices " ) .
Victor Aristov and colleagues indicate that graphene has the potential to replace silicon in high - speed computer processors and other devices .
Standing in the way , however , are today 's cumbersome , expensive production methods , which result in poor - quality graphene and are not practical for industrial scale applications .
This bulky machine constructed by one enthusiast retiree from the Russian city of Kirov is powered by the old Yamaha motorcycle engine and is entirely made of scrap .
Fiberglass seat was formerly a part of a small carousel , gear shift lever was a part of an unidentified old Coca - Cola souvenir .
The front skies are covered with fluoroplastic , a material with extremely low friction factor .
The main distinctive feature of this snowmobile is a big wheel instead of a regular for such kind of transport rubber heavy caterpillar made of metal and rubber .
For this reason this monster is very light which allows it to drive on fresh crumbly snow .
Another thing is that this wheel is much less complicated in maintenance and will never cause a stop in the middle of a snow field if one detail is broken , as caterpillar does .
The engine is mounted in such a way that it could warm the driver and give some heat to the fuel supply system .
Construction works on this unusual snowmobile have taken about one year .
Here is another work of some fanatic designer form the Kirov city .
This time it ’s propeller - powered sleds .
This particular construction appeared to be pretty successful because it picks up rather high speed as for such a transport mean , easily copes with deep snow and is eventually rather efficient which allows trips for long distances .
The next creation of the Russian do - it - himselfers entirely consists of the details of a rusting potato harvester and an engine and gearbox from the Lada ’s economy car “ OKA ” .
Lack of money and great willingness to make a simple snowmobile stipulated the use such components .
Traditional rubber caterpillar was changed for a part of the harvester ’s belt loader .
This caused one big problem – this pretty heavy machine can cope only with shallow snow and this is no good for Russian winter .
Here is one more snowmobile using the same concept of a caterpillar design as the previous one but looking pretty serious and reliable .
It ’s hardly recognizable but the next one is a remade motor scooter with unbelievable wheels .
And the motive power of this monster is given by a modified motor cultivator .
This man is a fan of winter fishing and just needed some means to get to the best fishing sites .
And here are some more .
Just check out the craziness of their design .

This is the twentieth in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s blog post covers some of the nice improvements coming with JavaScript intellisense with VS 2010 and the free Visual Web Developer 2010 Express .
You ’ll find with VS 2010 that JavaScript Intellisense loads much faster for large script files and with large libraries , and that it now provides statement completion support for more advanced scenarios compared to previous versions of Visual Studio .
[ In addition to blogging , I am also now using Twitter for quick updates and to share links .
Follow me at : twitter.com/scottgu ]
Improved JavaScript Intellisense
Providing Intellisense for a dynamic language like JavaScript is more involved than doing so with a statically typed language like VB or C#. Correctly inferring the shape and structure of variables , methods , etc is pretty much impossible without pseudo - executing the actual code itself – since JavaScript as a language is flexible enough to dynamically modify and morph these things at runtime .
VS 2010 ’s JavaScript code editor now has the smarts to perform this type of pseudo - code execution as you type – which is how its intellisense completion is kept accurate and complete .
Below is a simple walkthrough that shows off how rich and flexible it is with the final release .
Scenario 1 : Basic Type Inference
When you declare a variable in JavaScript you do not have to declare its type .
Instead , the type of the variable is based on the value assigned to it .
Because VS 2010 pseudo - executes the code within the editor , it can dynamically infer the type of a variable , and provide the appropriate code intellisense based on the value assigned to a variable .
For example , notice below how VS 2010 provides statement completion for a string ( because we assigned a string to the “ foo ” variable ) :
If we later assign a numeric value to “ foo ” the statement completion ( after this assignment ) automatically changes to provide intellisense for a number :
Scenario 2 : Intellisense When Manipulating Browser Objects
It is pretty common with JavaScript to manipulate the DOM of a page , as well as work against browser objects available on the client .
Previous versions of Visual Studio would provide JavaScript statement completion against the standard browser objects – but did n’t provide much help with more advanced scenarios ( like creating dynamic variables and methods ) .
VS 2010 ’s pseudo - execution of code within the editor now allows us to provide rich intellisense for a much broader set of scenarios .
For example , below we are using the browser ’s window object to create a global variable named “ bar ” .
Notice how we can now get intellisense ( with correct type inference for a string ) with VS 2010 when we later try and use it :
When we assign the “ bar ” variable as a number ( instead of as a string ) the VS 2010 intellisense engine correctly infers its type and modifies statement completion appropriately to be that of a number instead :
Scenario 3 : Showing Off
Because VS 2010 is psudo - executing code within the editor , it is able to handle a bunch of scenarios ( both practical and wacky ) that you throw at it – and is still able to provide accurate type inference and intellisense .
For example , below we are using a for - loop and the browser ’s window object to dynamically create and name multiple dynamic variables ( bar1 , bar2 , bar3 … bar9 ) .
Notice how the editor ’s intellisense engine identifies and provides statement completion for them :
Because variables added via the browser ’s window object are also global variables – they also now show up in the global variable intellisense drop - down as well :
Better yet – type inference is still fully supported .
So if we assign a string to a dynamically named variable we will get type inference for a string .
If we assign a number we ’ll get type inference for a number .
Just for fun ( and to show off ! ) we could adjust our for - loop to assign a string for even numbered variables ( bar2 , bar4 , bar6 , etc ) and assign a number for odd numbered variables ( bar1 , bar3 , bar5 , etc ) :
Notice above how we get statement completion for a string for the “ bar2 ” variable .
Notice below how for “ bar1 ” we get statement completion for a number :
This is n’t just a cool party trick …
While the above example is a bit contrived , the approach of dynamically creating variables , methods and event handlers on the fly is pretty common with many Javascript libraries .
Many of the more popular libraries use these techniques to keep the size of script library downloads as small as possible .
VS 2010 ’s support for parsing and pseudo - executing libraries that use these techniques ensures that you get better code Intellisense out of the box when programming against them .
Summary
Visual Studio 2010 ( and the free Visual Web Developer 2010 Express ) now provide much richer JavaScript intellisense support .
This support works with pretty much all popular JavaScript libraries .
It should help provide a much better development experience when coding client - side JavaScript and enabling AJAX scenarios within your ASP.
NET applications .
Hope this helps ,
Scott
P.S. You can read my previous blog post on VS 2008 ’s JavaScript Intellisense to learn more about our previous JavaScript intellisense ( and some of the scenarios it supported ) .
VS 2010 obviously supports all of the scenarios previously enabled with VS 2008 .
Whatever .

HOMEBUYERS are to be offered never - ending mortgages in a bid to overcome Australia 's affordability crisis .
ING Direct , Australia 's fifth largest lender , is preparing to sell loans that have no fixed term and no requirement to repay any capital along the way .
At current rates , the interest - only loans would cut repayments on a $ 300,000 mortgage by $ 5000 a year .
Repayments would be kept to a minimum , allowing borrowers to benefit from capital growth in their property .
" People are needlessly being denied the chance to buy a property while prices spiral rapidly out of their reach " ING Direct CEO Don Koch said .
" There is an urgent need to provide more affordable options and borrowers should be able to choose whether they want to repay the capital , or not . "
Mr Koch wants to position the bank as a " mortgage partner for life " , with borrowers carrying the same interest - only loan from property to property for as long as they wish , accumulating equity from rising house prices as they go .
Then , as they near retirement , they could sell their property for a big enough profit to pay off the original loan and buy a smaller place outright , leaving them mortgage - free .
Or , they could keep the mortgage going and repay the original capital from their estate , after death .
These loans has been popular for years in the UK and Europe , where repaying capital is seen by many as unnecessary and prohibitively expensive .
" It has worked fantastically in Europe as a way for people to get home ownership and build wealth throughout their lives .
It just requires a change in mindset about how you live with debt , " Mr Koch said .
" Some wo n't like carrying a mortgage for so long but , for a lot , this will make home ownership cheaper . "
Banks already offer interest - only loans , but borrowers often are allowed to keep them only for five to 10 years .
Then they must start paying the capital .
But ING says this preoccupation with paying off the loan is unnecessary .
" There is no economic reason for banks to insist on regular capital repayment , " Mr Koch said .
" It just makes the loan more expensive for the borrower .
" If this catches on and people carry the same mortgage around for life , instead of switching every five or six years , then the cost of providing mortgages should come down and make them even more affordable . "
Financial comparison website InfoChoice CEO
Shaun Cornelius said the move was a welcome innovation : " Depending on the size of the loan , it could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to a borrower 's cash flow over their lifetime . "

Texas Rep. Ron Paul proved once again Saturday that his politics continue to divide the Republican Party .
He was met with both disapproval and applause during the Southern Republican Leadership Conference for describing conservatives as hypocritical when they call for a return to Constitutional values while supporting foreign wars .
“ The conservatives and the liberals , they both like to spend , ” Paul said , according to Think Progress .
“ Conservatives spend money on different things .
They like embassies , and they like occupation .
They like the empire .
They like to be in 135 countries and 700 bases .

“ DonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t you think itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rather conservative to say , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœ Oh itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s good to follow the Constitution .
Oh , except for war .
Let the President go to war anytime they want .
Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢
We can do better with peace than with war . ”
While most of the other speakers at the event used plenty of rhetoric for “ easy applause , ” as Washington Post reporter David Weigel put it , Paul stuck to the outrage over American foreign policy that has defined his platform .
Whenever the boos grew loud enough , Paul returned to his “ humble ” foreign policy stance .
“ It ’s been 60 years since we went to war in Korea , ” said Paul .
“ Why do we have to have troops there ? ”
Enough of Paul ’s supporters showed up for the conference that many of his fellow speakers were met with boos on issues of government spending .
In a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February , Paul walked away with the most support for a 2012 presidential bid : 31 percent .
ADVERTISEMENT
Eying another bid for president after a run in 2008 , Paul is telling Republican activists that “ the American people have awoken ” because Washington wo n’t address the nation ’s fiscal crisis .
“ The reason why the American people have awoken … is because the country is broke and the people in Washington wo n’t admit it . ”
Paul added , however , that President Obama is not the “ socialist ” he has been labeled by Tea Party activists .

Most political commentators believe Paul is vying with Mitt Romney for the top slot of the straw poll of this weekend ’s conference .
In a question - and - answer period after his speech , a blogger asked Paul why his supporters seemed so disinterested in the Republican Party .

“ The question you should be asking , ” said Paul , “ is , why is n’t the Republican Party interested in them ?
We can get huge crowds with this message . ”

Paul ’s quote was first noticed by Think Progress .
This history of Iceland will not make for comforting reading for thousands of would - be air travelers stranded across northern Europe and beyond .
The last time Eyjafjallajökull erupted , it continued belching the Earth 's unsettled insides for 14 months , from December 1821 to January 1823 .
Scientists do not expect Eyjafjallajökull to keep northern Europe 's airports closed for 14 months , but they suggest that Eyjafjallajökull 's impact on world travel might not end with the end of this current eruption .
IN PICTURES : Iceland volcano
Moreover , Iceland 's " Angry Sister " has n't even awoken yet .
The three times in recorded history when Eyjafjallajökull has erupted , its neighbor , the much larger Katla , has followed suit .
Data do not yet suggest that a Katla eruption is imminent .
Yet , in some respects , it is the far greater concern , both in Iceland and beyond .
Katla : the sleeping sister
Katla has erupted 16 times since 930 , in 1755 exploding so violently that its ash settled on parts of Scotland .
In 1918 , Katla tore chunks of ice the size of houses from the Myrdalsjökull glacier atop it , sending them careening down its slopes and into the Atlantic on floods of melted glacier water .
While Eyjafjallavökull is virtually anonymous in Icelandic lore , Katla is one of the " Angry Sisters " along its even - more active twin , Hekla .
The 1918 eruption was the last major eruption of Katla – a volcano that has erupted twice a century , on average – which is why scientists have paid particularly close attention to it in recent days .
But while earth beneath Eyjafjallajökull trembled with thousands of small earthquakes in the months before the eruption – signaling that magma was welling up beneath the volcano – scientists have not seen the same activity at Katla yet .
Even as some scientists suggest that the current Eyjnafjallajökull eruption is abating , the past few days have been only a taste of what Icelanders have known for generations :
Their island is one of the most restless places on the planet .
In 1973 , an eruption near the nation 's primary fishing port split the island of Heimaey in two and required its entire population to be evacuated to the Icelandic mainland by fishing boat .
On 1783 , one - quarter of Iceland 's population was killed when Laki erupted – an eruption so massive that it changed global weather patterns , bringing record snow to New Jersey and drought to Egypt .
And in the 1755 Katla eruption , the volume of floodwaters from the Myrdalsjökull glacier were estimated to be equal to or greater than the discharge of water from the Amazon , Nile , and Mississippi Rivers combined .
Iceland : an Arctic thread of fire
Much like lands atop the Pacific Ring of Fire , Iceland sits atop a seam in earth 's crust , straddling two of the planet 's tectonic puzzle pieces .
In other such places , such as Chile , one piece of crust is sliding beneath the other , pushing up the Andes mountains .
But in Iceland , new earth is being born with every eruption .
Along the tectonic border marked by Iceland 's volcanoes , the world is spreading , gradually pushing Iceland 's halves – and the plates they sit on – farther apart .
The volcanoes are making new crust , their liquid rock cooling into new landscapes , eruption by eruption , foot by foot .
In this way , Eyjafjallajökull is merely part of the ancient tectonic dance of the continents .
But some scientists suggest that the changing global climate could make Icelandic eruptions more common .
As Iceland 's glaciers thin , their weight upon the island 's volcanoes will lighten , making it easier for magma to rise from the earth 's depths , they say .
In the upcoming Iron Man 2 , Scarlett Johansson portrays Natasha Romanoff , otherwise known as Black Widow .
The latest in a long line of female characters in the media to don catsuits and kick butt , Black Widow has been attracting recent attention , especially since these latest promo pics of Johansson were released .
Popaholic suggests that Black Widow might have even surpassed Michelle Pfeiffer ’s portrayal of Catwoman in Batman Returns as the sexiest comic book character to hit the screen , but well , Catwoman is a pretty hard act to follow .
Not only did Pfeiffer do something great for the catsuit long before Trinity or Seven of Nine , but Julie Newmar has been fueling comic book fantasies since 1966 .
Okay , and despite the rest of the film , Halle Berry did the catsuit justice , too .
So what do we think : Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow , Catwoman , or Other ?
Though perhaps more importantly , Iron Man 2 looks fantastic no matter what Johansson happens to be wearing .
DETROIT -- Sluggishness in their first home game following a West Coast trip has been an issue for the Detroit Red Wings for several years .
It surfaced in the first round of the playoffs , when they lost Games 3 and 6 at Joe Louis Arena after returning from Phoenix .
But after flying home from San Jose on Monday , the Red Wings can't afford to be jet - lagged Tuesday in Game 3 of their Western Conference semifinal playoff series against the Sharks .
San Jose has a 2 - 0 lead .
" Reality is we 've been a pretty good team all year ( at home ) , " Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" We 've been better on the road in the playoffs .
Now , we got to go home and get ourselves regrouped .
" Now , we have to answer the call and hold serve at home .
As long as you hold serve at home , then you 're back ( to San Jose for Game 5 ) with a best - of - 3 . ''
The Sharks do not have a good history in Detroit .
The Red Wings are 29 - 4 - 1 - 1 ( W - L - T - OTL ) during the regular season and 6 - 3 in the playoffs against San Jose at Joe Louis Arena .
" We 're confident playing at home , but playoffs are different than the regular season , '' Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" We know we have to play a lot better for 60 minutes to have success against this team . ''
Expect a bit of a chess match between Babcock and his former assistant , Sharks coach Todd McLellan , as they try to get favorable matchups .
" They got last change , they play extremely well there , they 'll have a bit of energy because their fans will be behind them , '' McLellan said .
" We face a very tough task .
There 's been many teams that have been up against that group before and have n't restarted the task .
" I do n't think you carry momentum over from one game to the next , you have to re-establish that . ''

Quantum computing expert Dr. Raymond Laflamme to speak at Laurier
Waterloo - Dr. Raymond Laflamme , a renowned expert in quantum computing and director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo , will speak to members of the Laurier community on Thursday , April 29 , at 4 p.m. in room N1044 of the Science Building .
Laflamme will speak about experimental quantum error correction , an area of study in which he has made groundbreaking contributions .
Laflamme completed his PhD under the direction of prominent theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking .
He holds a Canada Research Chair in Quantum Information and is director of the Quantum Information Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research .
The event is part of Laurier ’s Computational Science and Applied & Statistical Modelling ( CSASM ) seminar series .
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 2009 - Craig Conroy 63 3 12 15 -6 25 0 0 1 0 52 5.8
This season was an extraordinarily tough one for the the grizzled Flames vet ; not only was he limited to sixty - three appearances due to a myriad of injuries , but he found the back of the net on only three occasions and was even called out by Theo Fleury .
Conroy 's 5.8 SH % was his lowest since he played seven games with the Canadiens in 1995 - 96 , and his - 6 was his worst +/- rating in his second go - around with the Flames .
All this seems to fall in line with the expected decline of a thirty - eight year old player whose designated job has been to kill penalties , block shots , win faceoffs , and shut down the other team 's best , but Conroy accumulated forty - eight points and a plus - 20 just last season on a Flames team that finished in the top half of the league in scoring and possession but struggled in most defensive categories .
This past season , the team 's aptitudes and deficiencies were inverse , and Conroy finished with a relative corsi of +1.8/60 , just below Rene Bourque and far superior to fellow bottom - sixers Eric Nystrom and Jamal Mayers as well as occasional linemate Jarome Iginla , and while facing tougher competition than the former two .
Conroy had the third least - favourable zone start of regular Flames forwards this season at 49.1 % , and his zone finish ( 50.9 % ) combined with the team 's +2.45 corsi rate with him on the ice indicates that he was pushing the puck in the right direction ; the Flames allowed less shots with Conroy on the ice and directed more towards the oppositions ' net , even though those shots rarely resulted in goals .
The team scored only 1.48 goals /60 with Conroy on the ice , as opposed to 2.45 with him on the bench .
Despite only playing an average of 10.91/60 at even strength , the Flames allowed .18 more goals when Conroy was n't on the ice , and on special teams , his 140:29 of short - handed ice time was seventh most on the Flames and fourth most of all Flames forwards .
Conroy led the Flames in short - handed faceoffs won with 86 and came in second in ES faceoffs won with 355 , behind only Daymond Langkow .
Despite his injuries , Conroy still blocked 41 shots , fourth amongst Flames forwards , and doled out 43 hits .
Conroy may not be the offensive threat he was in his 75 - point career season alongside Iginla in 2002 or even last season for that matter , but one has to think that it 's very unlikely he 'll operate at a 5.8 SH % or that he 'll direct a meagre 52 shots on goal next season should he re-sign .
Is $ 1 M too much money to spend on an aging checking centre when the team should be shedding salary and allocating its remaining funds towards getting younger , faster , and more efficient ?
Probably , but Sutter has already traded away Dustin Boyd , and finding a natural centre who fits Conroy 's mold on the free agent market at a price affordable to the Flames wo n't be an easy task ; the closest fit the team has in the system would likely be Brett Sutter , whose offensive output at the NHL level looks to be just as limited as that of a soon to be 39 - year - old Craig Conroy .
Aside from Conroy 's contributions on the ice , his friendly and honest demeanor and his generous contributions to the community have vaulted him into the stratosphere of ' fan favourite , ' while his eloquence and outgoing personality have all but guaranteed him a job in hockey media should he retire .
In a recent interview which Robert linked in his post yesterday , Conroy expressed his desire to remain in Calgary while acknowledging that the team will likely aim to get younger with the limited funds they have available , perhaps at his expense , and that he 'll have to wait until free agency begins in July to determine his fate .
What do you think ?
1939 : The New York World ’s Fair opens in Flushing Meadow Park .
It will give visitors a glimpse of “ the world of tomorrow ” and shape industrial design , pop culture and the way the future would envision the future .
The fair ran two seasons , from 1939 to 1940 .
The most memorable exhibit was the General Motors Pavilion , and the most memorable feature in the General Motors Pavilion was a ride called the Futurama .
People stood in line for hours to ride it and experience the exciting possibilities of life in the distant future — the year 1960 .
The Futurama ride carried fair visitors past tiny , realistic landscapes while a narrator described the world of tomorrow .
The effect was like catching a glimpse of the future from the window of an airplane .
As you might expect from a ride sponsored by GM , the focus was on what roadways and transportation might look like in 20 years .
Watch excerpts from To New Horizons , a documentary that gives a glimpse of the miniature futurist landscapes featured in the Futurama ride at the 1939 - 1940 World ’s Fair .

“ Detailed miniatures are always compelling , ” says Dan Howland , editor of the Journal of Ride Theory .
“ It does n’t matter whether they are dollhouses or model trains or it ’s Legoland , something about them just sucks you in .
The 1939 Futurama had two other factors that compounded the fascination : first , a promise of personal car ownership ( and after the Great Depression that sounded pretty good ) , and second , a grand vision of the future .
Up until the Futurama , manufacturers had exhibited at fairs to show how they made their products .
Then the Futurama came along and said , Here is how the future will feel .
The 1939 audience was n’t used to having a company selling optimism , and it made their hearts sing . ”
GM ’s ride presented a utopia forged by urban planning .
Sophisticated highways ran through rural farmland and eventually moved into carefully ordered futuristic cities .
“ You have to understand that the audience had never even considered a future like this , ” says Howland .
“ There was n’t an interstate freeway system in 1939 .
Not many people owned a car .
They staggered out of the fair like a cargo cult and built an imperfect version of this incredible vision . ”
The Futurama was n’t so much about the cars GM intended to build .
Visitors were told about certain features these future cars might have — such as radio controls that help them maintain proper distance from each other — but the vehicles themselves were so tiny that they could barely be distinguished .
What the Futurama ride was really selling was a highway system — a taxpayer - funded highway system .
“ I think the best take on it was in E. L. Doctorow ’s novel World ’s Fair , ” says Howland .
“ A family exits the ride , and the father says , ‘ General Motors is telling us what they expect from us :
We must build them the highways so they can sell us the cars . ' ”
The original Futurama left an indelible imprint on popular culture , visible in everything from the art design in sci-fi films to forward - looking marketing campaigns to the widespread use of the suffix - arama .
It ’s no wonder that when New York hosted another World ’s Fair in 1964 , a second Futurama exhibit was mounted .
The original Futurama had presented the brave new world of 1960 .
Many of the predictions had already been disproven by the time Futurama II debuted .
“ This is always a recurring problem — the times catch up with science fiction visions , ” says Howland .
“ That ’s why Steampunk is so popular , because it ca n’t become obsolete .
But the Futurama , man , that was Dieselpunk ! ”
Futurama II looked even further into the future , presenting predictions of a time that most fair visitors wo n’t live to see .
In this world , mankind had dominion over the entire universe .
Six - wheeled moon buggies ( pictured above ) moved easily over the lunar surface , ritzy hotels had been built deep beneath the ocean , tree - devouring machinery carved highways through jungles .
The point of view was n’t quite as distanced as the original Futurama .
The far - fetched vehicles were much larger , and they were piloted by tiny human puppets .
The overall look was strikingly similar to the campy TV show Thunderbirds , which premiered as the 1964 - 1965 World ’s Fair was closing .
Watch an excerpt from the documentary To the Fair !
An American couple meet a couple from India at the 1964 - 1965 World ’s Fair , and they all decide to go for a ride on Futurama II .
After their worlds are rocked by a vision of life in the years to come , they luxuriate with a post - ride cigarette .

At the end of the first Futurama exhibit , fair visitors were given a pin .
At the end of the second , it was a pocket tab , but the simple message was the same : I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE .
It ’s easy to laugh at the datedness and the overoptimism of these futurist exhibits .
But we should resist the urge to dismiss them .
“ These things are n’t just quaint , ” says Cory Doctorow , a Boing Boing contributor and science fiction writer .
“ They ’re a caution and an inspiration .
They show us just how faulty our intuition about the future use of new inventions can be .
Most of this stuff was utterly plausible when the rides opened , and it ’s only in hindsight that we can see how weirdly wrong they got it . ”
“ It ’s an inspiration too , though , ” Doctorow adds .
“ They show us that we ’re pretty good at figuring out what ’s going to be important to the future , but not why .
Networks are important , but not for videophones .
Space is important — for weather satellites , Google Earth , spying , GPS .
But not colonizing — at least not so far . ”
Howland points out that we might be better off if we ’d followed the designs of the original Futurama to the letter .
“ The designer , Norman Bel Geddes , did a lot of research on how to build technological solutions to traffic problems , ” says Howland .
“ And he did it decades before the problems even manifested themselves .
Unfortunately , nobody paid any attention to the problems Geddes anticipated , so we ended up with all these fantastic freeways and they ’re all gridlocked by 5 p.m. every weeknight .
If we lived in the Futurama , we ’d be home by now . ”

Milliardenschäden durch fehlende Finanz­aufsicht : Stiftung Warentest und vzbv stellen Berechnungen vor
Finanzielle Schäden in Höhe von über 700 Millionen Euro entstehen den Verbrauchern jähr­lich durch ineffiziente Riester - Verträge , zu hohe Dispozinsen und Fremd­abhebegebühren .
Das zeigen Berechnungen der Stiftung Warentest und des Verbraucherzentrale Bundes­verbandes ( vzbv ) .
Um solchen Fehl­entwick­lungen entgegen­zuwirken , fordern die beiden Organisationen , den Verbraucher­schutz in der Finanz­aufsicht zu verankern .
„ Es reicht nicht allein , vernünftige Gesetze zu machen .
Die Einhaltung der Gesetze muss gerade auch bei Finanz­produkten kontrolliert werden .
Schließ­lich hat der Kunde kaum eine Chance , die Versprechungen der Anbieter selbst auf ihren Wahr­heits­gehalt zu über­prüfen “ , erklärt Hermann - Josef Tenhagen , Chef­redak­teur der Zeit­schrift Finanztest .
„ Die Beispiele zeigen systematisches Markt­versagen zulasten der Verbraucher .
Einzel­maßnahmen reichen da nicht aus .
Die Bundes­regierung muss den Verbraucher­schutz endlich auch in Deutsch­land effektiv in der Finanz­aufsicht verankern “ , fordert vzbv-Vorstand Gerd Billen .
Beispiel 1 : Riester - Verträge Bei der privaten Alters­vorsorge sind die finanziellen Schäden für Verbraucher besonders dramatisch : Vergleiche der Stiftung Warentest zeigen , dass viele Riester - Produkte zu teuer sind .
Fällt die durch­schnitt­liche Rendite dadurch nur ein Prozent nied­riger aus , sind die Verluste enorm .
Bezieht man dies auf die staatlichen Zulagen , die bis einschließ­lich 2009 gezahlt wurden ( gut sechs Milliarden Euro ) , summieren sich die Verluste für die Verbraucher auf 115 Millionen Euro .
Nimmt man weiter eine konstante Zulagen - Summe von 2,5 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr an , so wachsen die Verluste bis 2020 auf mehr als drei Milliarden Euro , bis 2030 sogar auf über 11 Milliarden Euro .
Beispiel 2 : Dispozinsen Ein weiteres Ärgernis sind über­höhte Dispozinsen .
Die Banken kommen derzeit besonders günstig an Geld .
Betrug der Leitzins der Europäischen Zentral­bank im September 2008 noch 4,25 Prozent , so lag er im Februar 2010 nur noch bei einem Prozent .
Dagegen sanken die durch­schnitt­lichen Zinsen für Über­ziehungs­kredite an private Haushalte im gleichen Zeitraum nur von 11,98 auf 10,28 Prozent .
Die Differenz zwischen der Absenkung des Leitzinses und der Dispozinsen beträgt demnach 1,55 Prozent­punkte .
Das Kreditvolumen lag im Februar 2010 bei rund 41,8 Milliarden Euro .
Bezogen auf diese Summe entsteht den Verbrauchern ein finanzieller Schaden von etwa 650 Millionen Euro im Jahr .

Outgoing , gregarious people who fill their lives with deep , meaningful conversations may have found at least one key to a happier life , suggests research from Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Arizona .
People who spend less time alone and more time talking to others have a much greater sense of personal well being , suggests the study , which is published in a recent issue of Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science .
“ Having more conversation , no matter how trivial , appears to be associated with a greater sense of happiness among the people in our study , ” suggests study co-author Simine Vazire , PhD , assistant professor of psychology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University .
“ The happiest were people who engaged often in more meaningful and substantive discussions , as opposed to those who filled conversations with idle chit - chat and small talk , ” she adds .
Based on the conversation patterns of 79 college - aged men and women as tracked over a four - day period , the study was conducted by Vazire and three colleagues in psychology at the University of Arizona : Matthias R. Mehl , Shannon E. Holleran and C. Shelby Clark .
Using an unobtrusive recording device that participants carried in a pocket or purse , researchers taped 30 seconds of sound every 12.5 minutes , amassing more than 20,000 audio snippets of sound from the daily lives of participants .
Members of the research team listened to the recordings and coded the number of conversations each participant had , and whether each conversation was substantive or small talk .
Each participant ’s happiness level was scored using standard psychological tools for gauging personality and well being , including self - assessments and reports from friends .
Participants scored as “ happiest ” in the study spent about 25 percent less time alone and 70 percent more time talking to others , as compared with the unhappiest participants .
The happiest participants had twice as many substantive conversations and one third as much small talk as the unhappiest participants .
" Overall , these findings suggest that meaningful interactions with others are important for well - being , ” Vazire concludes .
“ However , our research cannot determine whether meaningful interactions cause happiness , whether happiness causes people to have more meaningful conversations , or whether there is another explanation .
We believe it 's likely that both are true -- happiness leads to more meaningful connections with others , which then produce more happiness -- but this remains to be tested in future research . "

Private Bergdahl looks fit in the video
The Taliban have released a new video which appears to show an American soldier who was captured in Afghanistan in June last year .
On the video , a man in combat uniform asks the US government to intervene and win his release .
The soldier , Private Bowe Bergdahl , looks fit and is heard listing the names of his family and friends .
A Taliban spokesman says in the video they are demanding the release of prisoners in exchange for the soldier .
Nato said in a statement that using Pte Bergdahl " as a means of propaganda is a deplorable act and only fuels our efforts to find him and bring him home " .
Pte Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska - based infantry regiment in Paktika province .
He vanished from his base , near the border with Pakistan , just five months after arriving in Afghanistan .
The military has been trying to locate him ever since , and a reward has been offered for his safe return .
He is believed to be the first soldier seized in either Iraq or Afghanistan for at least two years .
The last words in “ Please Give , ” Nicole Holofcener ’s latest comic drama of spiky manners , are “ you ’re welcome . ”
They ’re uttered by Kate , a New York malcontent played with complex appeal by the wonderful actress Catherine Keener .
Kate ’s daughter , Abby ( Sarah Steele ) , a stridently truculent teenager , has in a rare instance of filial generosity just thanked her mother for agreeing to pay for a pricey pair of jeans .
From the near - beatific look on Kate ’s face , it seems that after struggling to make amends for some vague , unarticulated wrong  by doling out cash to homeless people , for instance  she has found her moment of grace .
Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny , attractively imperfect and flat - out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener , whose features include “ Friends With Money ” and “ Lovely & Amazing . ”
You may not love them , but you recognize their charms and frailties , their fears and hopes .
They may remind you of your friends , your sisters or even yourself , which makes them attractive and sometimes off - putting , an unusual , complicated mix .
We do n’t necessarily or only go to the movies to see mirror versions of ourselves : we also want ( or think we do ) better , kinder , nobler , prettier and thinner images , idealized types and aspirational figures we can take pleasure in or laugh at in all their plastic unreality .
The female characters in Ms. Holofcener ’s films do n’t live in those movies : they watch them .
“ Please Give ” involves a cluster of such women , including Kate and her only child , the 15 - year - old Abby , and their irascible next - door neighbor , Andra ( Ann Guilbert ) , a nonagenarian with two granddaughters , Rebecca ( Rebecca Hall ) and Mary ( Amanda Peet ) .
Kate and her husband , Alex ( Oliver Platt ) , expect to take over Andra ’s apartment when she dies , a macabre objective that they compensate for with strained smiles and by running an occasional errand for her .
Kate and Alex also own a store specializing in midcentury Modern furniture , lamps and the like , which they stock from the apartments of the dead .
It stings when a customer calls them ambulance chasers , but there ’s a touch of truth to that remark .

Given how unpleasant Andra is , you can almost understand Kate and Alex ’s impatience , though I do n’t think that is exactly what Ms. Holofcener had in mind when she gave her characters so many thorns .
Kate and Alex want to expand their already spacious Upper West Side apartment , a desire that slightly embarrasses them and creates tension , particularly during a birthday party that Kate gives for Andra .
Mary , who comes with so many spikes she could star in a “ Hellraiser ” sequel ( as Mrs. Pinhead ) , and has had too much to drink ( as is her habit ) , urges Kate to explain her renovation plans to everyone , Andra included .
It ’s an uncomfortable exchange , but like too many scenes , it also feels rigged for maximum outrage .

Many Arsenal fans were not happy with today ’s result against the Blues .
The best way to treat this defeat is to go down our injury list and that would explain why we did n’t play excellent against the strong Chelsea team .
Arsene Wenger on the other hand would n’t do that .
In fact , never has Wenger complained that not having Fabregas was the problem of our recent defeats in the EPL .
When Wenger was asked about Wilshere ’s performance he responded with the best response any manager can respond with , “ he ’s only 18 years old . ”
This phrase has many interpretations and through those interpretations , we can make many other interpretations .
You see , Wilshere is a top class English midfielder FOR HIS AGE !
Basically , Arsenal cannot depend on Wilshere to show leadership skills .
Rather we should depend on him for his excitement and most of all , his skills .
Towards the end of the game it was evident that Wilshere seemed to get tired and did n’t have the stamina to continue as Wenger wanted .
The issue with Wilshere is simple yet sensitive .
It ’s very easy for Wenger to start Wilshere in domestic cup , EPL and UCL games but at the same time Wenger understands that Wilshere needs to mature not as a player but as a person .
Example , the night club incident earlier in the season still proves that he might not be as disciplined as Wenger wishes .
What is the point of this ?
To realize that Wilshere cannot carry Arsenal against top level teams because he still is n’t mature as a person .
This is n’t to shed darkness on Wilshere fans because I am a huge Wilshere fan and I do believe that within 5 more years , he will be deadly to other teams .
We must look at our problems and realize that Arsenal is not playing with a cushion behind their backs .
Wenger is being forced to start Wilshere to search for answers .
Fabregas , Bendter , Almunia , Vermaelen , Ramsey , Van Persie , Walcott and now Diaby are all out due to injuries .
Honestly speaking , we have done great to answer the injury crisis but players like Wilshere , Nasri and Chamakh cannot handle the pressure to perform greatly in every game we play in .
Yet , they still do which impresses Wenger time and time again .
With the injury crisis , today ’s game was still close and Arsenal had many chances to score .
Let us take the starting lineup of Arsenal and “ make ” it equal to Chelsea ’s squad and make a lineup from Chelsea that mirrors our lineup .
Arsenal ’s lineup was missing Fabregas , Van Persie , Almunia , Vermaelen and Walcott .
So if Chelsea had Lampard , Drogba , Cech , Terry and Malouda all out of today ’s lineup , would Chelsea have won today against Arsenal ?
I ’m pretty sure it would have been a much tougher game for Chelsea .
Many people out there believe that Arsenal does n’t have what it takes to win the EPL title or the UCL title .
That ’s bogus !
Throughout the entire season injuries have hit Arsenal hard and players have stepped up to not offer injuries as an excuse to our recent defeats .
Arshavin has 5 goals and 6 assists in 11 games .
Wilshere has shown his coming of age and showed that he is able to handle the pressure .
Chamakh has done amazing , bringing us back in the Bolton game as well as this midweek UCL game in Serbia .
Nasri nearly gave us a point by scoring two goals last weekend in a time of urgency .
Look for a strong lineup against Newcastle in the midweek Carling Cup matchup .
It seems that our problems have forced Wenger to look at other options which is great .
We can give it one more month and many of our players will be back , well rested and waiting to play some football .
Chelsea , we will get out revenge the next time we meet .
Watch out .

I ’ve conceived and rejected about 50 different ways to construct this season in review .
But , unlike Darryl Sutter ’s plan headed into the season , I did n’t decide to simply start it without really having a good idea in mind .
The most logical place to start , I suppose , would be the beginning : June 27 , 2009 .

Prologue : The Age of Innocence
I was on a golf course , about to tee off for the first time since junior high , when I got the text from a friend of mine .
" Get excited , buddy .
The Flames traded Leopold and a third for the rights to negotiate with Jay Bouwmeester . "
I was n’t even on the first green and I was fistpumping like Tiger Woods ( construe that simile any way you like ) .
This was the most sought - after free agent defenseman in years , and coming off a season in which Calgary had the 21st - ranked team defense in the league , I figured that was a good thing .
After my nine - hole slog ( I hit about 14 over , thanks ) , I was checking Twitter and I also saw that Jim Vandermeer got traded to Phoenix .
Bouwmeester AND a salary dump in the same day ?
I quickly forgot the four - putt on 7 .
This , it seemed , was Darryl Sutter at his shrewdest .
But by July 1 , the magic had run out as quickly as the Flames ’ cap space .
The signings in the immediate aftermath of the free agent cattle call ’s start were , shall we say , underwhelming .
Freddy Sjostrom , Garth Murray , Riley Armstrong , Staffan Kronwall , Jason Jaffray , and Brian McGrattan all signed by July 11 , but Flames fans " got it . "
Sure it was going to be a top - heavy roster — most Cup contenders are adept at finding diamonds in the rough and turning them into minor stars in their own right — but look at how good that top was !
Jarome Iginla , one of the premier wings in the NHL even at 31 years old , coming off 89 - point season .
A defensive troika of Canadian Olympic Team probables in Bouwmeester , Robyn Regehr and Dion Phaneuf .
And , hopefully , a Vezina - winning goalie rounding back into form .
Led by a new coach that had as recently as a few months prior guided the New Jersey Devils to a 106 - point season .

In Sutters Flames fans now trusted , and they had been given very little reason to find fault with the plan of attack for the new season .
They were , of course , dead wrong .
Chapter 1 : The September issue
The cracks started to show early .
Or at least they started to show as much as they could in preseason with gamenight rosters loaded up to 75 percent with AHL - level players .
This was a team that could n’t score .
There were some noisy outputs against some " B " and even " C " squads , but when a team brought its NHL players , the Calgary offense quieted down faster than a substitute teacher ’s classroom when the principal walks in .
Oh , but the preseason tells you very little about a team and blah blah blah .
I get that , and that ’s why I , along with everyone else , it seemed , was n’t particularly bothered .
Then began Darryl Sutter ’s incessant tinkering .
After camp had wrapped but before the season began , he shipped Anton Stralman , a somewhat promising young offensive defenseman whom the Flames had gotten in the Wayne Primeau salary dump , and who had in my opinion earned a spot on the final D pairing , to Columbus for a third - round pick .
While I was somewhat bothered by the deal , and the fact that it ensured Staffan Kronwall an opening - night roster spot , what was anyone going to say ?
Calgary still had the best team defense in the league .
In Sutter we had to trust .
Of course , it proved symptomatic of a much , much larger problem : Sutter was never happy with this team .

Chapter 2 : October sky
Calgary record to start the month : 0 - 0 - 0 , 0 points
Status : Eager
Over the years , the Flames have grown infamous for their slow starts , so when they ripped off four straight wins with 17 goals to show for it , everyone was pretty well chuffed .
In fact , through their first 10 games , the Flames picked up 15 points and were second in the West on Oct. 24 .
The offense , too , was positively humming along .
The Flames had piled up 41 goals in just 10 games , tied for the league lead with the New York Rangers ( of all teams ) and allowed a worrying 33 .
But that worry was sure to be short - lived , right ?
The belief was that the defense was too good to not sort itself out , while the offense kept producing at a torrid pace .
And , even if the defensive problems persisted , Sutter had acquired a steady if unspectacular bottom - pairing defenseman in Aaron Johnson for the bargain - basement price of Kyle Greentree .
Problem was , they ended the month with two straight home losses , one to a surprising Colorado team that had exploded out of the gate , and one to Detroit .
In both games , the offense was ineffectual .

By Halloween , Calgary had slipped to seventh in a very tight Western Conference .
Chapter 3 : November reign
Calgary record to start the month : 7 - 4-1 , 15 points
Status : Edgy
The next morning , the Flames awoke to find themselves in eighth , though concern , at that point , had n’t really crept in .
The two - game home losing streak gave way to what was sure to be a difficult stretch of two road games , a home game , then three more road games on both sides of both the continental divide and Mason - Dixon line .
But the Flames emerged nearly unscathed , having left just one point from 12 on the table thanks to an overtime loss at white - hot Buffalo .
Two more troubling home losses — another to Colorado and a 7 - 1 steamrolling at the hands of the bogeymen from Chicago — were forgiven as easily as Calgary rolled over to concede them .
Another run of two away , one home , three away saw the Flames yield the same result , 11 points from 12 , to end the month .
Surely the Saddledome mailroom was receiving plaudits in quantities not seen since the swingin’ days of the Red Mile and Martin Gelinas ’s bevy of series - winners .
The Flames ended a month with 10 road games at 10 - 2 - 2 , and were , for the second time this season , No. 2 in the West .
Chapter 4 : The long December
Calgary record to start the month : 17-6 - 3 , 37 points
Status : Invincible
Oh yes , this was the team we were promised back in July .
The Flames had lost a grand total of one road game in regulation all season .
A spectacular feat .
Was there cause for concern in that 7 - 5 - 0 home record ?
Perhaps , but if they just kept above .500 in Calgary , they could probably even afford to slip a little bit when it came to games away from home .
That theory was soon put to the test .
Calgary had but six road games in December , and a spate of beatable opponents .
If nothing else , they ’d be able to take something like 18 - 20 points from their 14 games and still be in very solid shape headed into the new year .
As it happened , 18 points was an unattainably high number .
Calgary lost their first two road games outright since Oct. 13 in the span of four days , to Phoenix and Los Angeles , respectively .
A three - point mini-homestand against Atlanta and Minnesota buoyed the hopes for a bounceback — after all , the other road game in that time was a win at the Shark Tank — but Calgary dropped their next two road games , to Colorado ( again ) and , disappointingly , 14th - in - the - West St. Louis .
Apart from the final three games of the year — at Edmonton , then hosting LA and Edmonton — all of which were gimme wins , Calgary won but three games of the other 11 .
The defense had indeed rounded into form , having conceded 97 goals all season , good for sixth - best in the league , even after a rocky start .
But the offense , as some feared it would , had vanished .
Calgary scored just 28 goals in their 14 games in December .
Their team offense was now 19th in the league and falling .
December ’s record , an appalling 6 - 6 - 2 against some genuinely bad opponents , reflected the latter far more than the former .
Chapter 5 : January jones
Calgary record to start the month : 23 - 12-5 , 51 points
Status : Uneasy
Even that three - game win streak at the end of December was n’t enough to really boost anyone ’s morale to the high - water marks of a month prior .
A quick - and - easy win over Toronto on Jan. 2 marked the 41st game of the season , and Calgary was , as dubbed by the great Jean Lefebvre , " not too bad . "
Damned by faint praise , really .
Just 30 days prior , Calgary was 17 - 6 - 3 and seemed unstoppable .
And Calgary had dropped lumps of holiday coal all over the place .
Little did we know it was about to get much worse .
I ’ll spare you the grislier details of the first month of what should have been a fresh start — a nine - game losing streak , losing 11 of 12 , 31 goals for and 44 against , a 9 - 1 loss to San Jose , etc. etc. etc. — but suffice it to say Calgary fans were fiending for anything , anything at all , that would give them reason to believe in the team ’s playoff chances .
Just a day after Calgary snapped its franchise - worst losing streak , Darryl Sutter dashed them for good .
Former Norris candidate and one - time Olympic hopeful Dion Phaneuf was shipped to Toronto , along Freddy Sjostrom and prospect Keith Aulie , for what amounted to spare parts for which Brian Burke no longer had any use .
Enter the struggling Matt Stajan , the overpriced - and - signed - through - 2012 Niklas Hagman , the mustachioed Ian White , and the what - is - he - doing - here Jamal Mayers as some sort of cure for what was ailing the Flames .
Perhaps Phaneuf did " have to go . "
Maybe the whispers of a blowout between he and Brent Sutter were true .
Maybe his attitude was a divisive issue in the dressing room to the point it was affecting the on-ice product so terribly that he had to be shuttled out of town as soon as humanly possible .
But I have to assume that Sutter could have gotten a better return than a bunch of middle - of - the - road castoffs from the 29th - best team in the league , because he would have to be an idiot otherwise .
Calgary finished the month 4 - 9 - 3 , and with a considerably worse roster , and record , than when it began .
Chapter 6 : February scars
Calgary record to start the month : 27 - 21 -8 , 62 points
Status :
In a tailspin
The sledding did n’t get much easier in February .
Calgary started the month with a loss , and , on Feb. 2 , completed a deal that had been rumored for a few days .
Olli Jokinen was out ( yay ! ) and Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins were in ( … what ? ) .
It was Sutter ’s second baffling move in a week , not so much because the player getting run out of town was particularly wanted , but because no one with even a rudimentary hockey knowledge would have brought in the players Sutter did .
Now you could n’t swing a puck bag in the Flames dressing room without hitting a good four or five third - line wings masquerading as something more , all in the name of Sutter ’s bizarre , quixotic mission to rid Calgary roster of all its so - called " cancers . "
But even if the team started promenading hand in hand through the Deerfoot Mall and sharing intimate meals in some upscale restaurants around town , the results needed to come , y’know , on the ice .
So when the Flames picked up their first back - to - back wins since Jan. 5 , both of which came in the wake of the trade ’s announcement ( only the second tilt of that two - game shangri - la featured Kotalik and Higgins ) , little did we know that was to be the pre-Olympic high point .
Calgary lost three of its next four before the league folded up tents for three weeks and jetted off for the unseasonably warmer climes of Vancouver .
The Olympics came and went , and only Jarome Iginla really had any kind of success , personal or otherwise , in that time .
After a 3 - 3 - 1 month , was this renewed - and - improved Iggy going to lead Calgary back to home ice contention ?
Chapter 7 : Death March
Calgary record to start the month : 30 - 23-9 , 69 points
Status : Oddly optimistic ?
For a little while , it seemed like it .
Colorado was beginning to crater and Calgary actually looked almost like the team we saw in , say , October : not unstoppable , but not incompetent either .
Hell , they won six of the first nine games they played , including an impressive four - game win streak against New Jersey , Minnesota , Detroit and Ottawa .
But the margin for error had become so narrow that any slip - up would surely spell the Flames ’ doom .
Flames fans and employees alike hoped that a relatively easy four - game stretch against Minnesota , Los Angeles , the New York Islanders and Boston Bruins ( with the first , third and fourth being on the road ) would give the team the boost it needed for the frantic final weeks of the season .
They , as ever , were wrong .
Calgary lost to Minnesota in a shootout , beat Los Angeles in a manner just convincing enough to instill that pesky hope for a playoff berth , lost an oddly spiritless game to the woeful Isles , and got brutalized in Boston .
And just like that , the season was over .
Sure , they beat the Capitals and Coyotes as a kind of ha - ha - look - what - we - can - do - now - that - it - does n’t - matter move to round out the month , but we ’d the damage was done , and so were the 2009 - 10 Flames .
They ended the month with a 9 - 6 - 0 record , but it just was n’t good enough .
Chapter 8 : Miss April
Calgary record to start the month : 39 - 29 -9 , 62 points
Status : Devastated
By some miracle , Calgary actually had two games that kinda mattered here .
If Colorado did especially poorly , and Calgary got six or seven points from its four April dates , it could sneak into the playoffs and , to some extent , lessen the pain this season had brought .
And , by some further miracle , they actually beat the Avalanche in their final head - to - head match up to keep hope alive just a short while longer .
The Sharks put a quick end to that , and a shootout loss to Minnesota gave way to an oddly appropriate steamrolling at the hands of the Canucks ( and more specifically the Sedin twins ) to end the Flames ’ season .
Calgary ended the month having gone 1 - 2 - 1 .
Epilogue : Summer daze
Calgary record to end the season : 40-31-10 , 90 points
Status : Bewildered
In writing this review , what really struck me was how Jekyll and Hyde this team was .
One five - game win streak , four four - game win streaks and two more three - game win streaks .
That accounts for 27 of the team ’s 40 wins this year .
Then look at the losing streaks : nine games , four games , and three of three - games .
That ’s 14 of the team ’s 31 regulation losses , and eight of their OT / SO losses .
I have to think a good majority of that is on the coaching , but how do we know for sure ?
Brent Sutter wore the same glum , world - weary look on his face the night of the 9 - 1 loss as he did when Calgary broke the nine - game losing streak .
There ’s a certain steadiness to that some might find reassuring .
Not me , though , I want my coach throwing chairs and choking defensemen like Season - on - the - Brink - era Bobby Knight .
But leave no doubt about it , Darryl Sutter is the man left holding the bag for this categorical catastrophe .
There was never any offense of which to speak outside the first two or three weeks of the season , and that was my fear all along .
But his far , far greater crime is the mountains he moved to field this team , which will miss the postseason for the first time since 2003 .
No playoffs , no picks , no prospects , no cap space .
Jesus Christ , it ’s going to be a long summer .
SAN JOSE , California — Michael Bledsoe 's story begins like that of many other Iraqi war veterans .
In 2007 , he was chasing insurgents through Anbar province when a roadside bomb exploded , breaking Bledsoe 's back and both his feet .
A former Army Ranger working as a security contractor , Bledsoe soon knew his high - paying military career was over .
Back home , Bledsoe ( not his real name ) felt angry almost constantly .
Nightmares haunted him .
He withdrew and became isolated .
" It was a serious sense of loss , " he says .
His psychiatrist quickly diagnosed post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Despite months of talk therapy , the nightmares continued , and Bledsoe grew desperate .
Then " something almost miraculous " happened , he says .
An online search brought him to a unique study of the banned drug MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ) , well known as the street drug ecstasy .
The 21 - patient study , sponsored by the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) , launched in 2004 as the first U.S. clinical trial of a psychedelic drug in 35 years .
After several bond - building sessions with psychiatrist and study leader Michael Mithoefer and a co-therapist , Bledsoe swallowed a white tablet , donned eyeshades and reclined in Mithoefer 's comfortable Charleston , S.C. , office .
Over the next eight hours , Bledsoe revisited the explosion and recounted the trauma to Mithoefer .
After two more MDMA - assisted psychotherapy sessions , Bledsoe says his PTSD symptoms were " completely eliminated . "
This weekend at a MAPS - sponsored meeting here , Mithoefer reported similar results for nearly all of the trial 's participants .
After two or three MDMA sessions , patients who received MDMA experienced huge drops in symptoms as measured by a standard PTSD scale .
At baseline , study patients had an average Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) score of 79 , but after MDMA - assisted therapy , CAPS scores dropped to 23.4 in the 13 - person MDMA group , whereas an eight - person placebo group averaged a score of 60 .
( Later , seven of eight placebo patients chose to receive MDMA as well . )
The improvements appeared to endure , Mithoefer reported .
After an average of 3.5 years , 13 of 16 patients remaining in contact with the researchers no longer met the criteria for PTSD .
However , two of the patients " clearly relapsed , " Mithoefer says .
In addition , many of the patients returned to using antidepressants and other psychoactive medications , though the total number of prescriptions in the group was much lower than before .
Julie Holland , a psychiatrist in New York City who used to work at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx , says the data " look really great .
It 's amazing that when patients are done with therapy , they do n't meet criteria for PTSD .
I 've never even seen that .
It 's a very big deal . "
If MDMA were legal , Holland added , she would " absolutely " use it in her practice .
Brain - imaging studies in healthy volunteers show that MDMA quiets the amygdala , an almond - shaped structure deep in the brain that some researchers call a “ fear center ” due to its central role in triggering strong negative emotions .
MDMA also releases a flood of the brain messengers serotonin and dopamine while increasing blood levels of the hormones oxytocin and prolactin , which promote social bonding .
This potent mix diminishes fear and defensiveness and boosts empathy and the desire to connect with others , says Holland , so “ the therapy work goes faster and deeper . ”
Veterans suffer very high rates of PTSD , according to surveys .
One 2004 study in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that up to 18 percent of Iraqi and Afghanistan combat veterans experience the disorder .
" This is our way of trying to contribute to our moral obligations to our veterans , " says MAPS founder and executive director Rick Doblin .
He added that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has rejected overtures from MAPS to work together on five separate occasions .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has been friendlier to the group .
This month , the agency granted MAPS permission to continue testing MDMA in 16 additional veterans with PTSD .
But the road to full FDA approval is long and expensive , and Doblin anticipates five to 10 years of additional trials .
He envisions eventually building a network of psychedelic therapy centers .
A dedicated network of therapists experimented with MDMA - assisted psychotherapy in the 1970s and 1980s before the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration banned the drug in 1985 .
The next year , Doblin launched MAPS to revive psychedelic research , a movement that 's now gaining steam .
A dozen human studies of MDMA , LSD , a powerful African drug called ibogaine and psilocybin , from so - called " magic mushrooms , " are now under way , testing the once - stigmatized drugs as treatments for not only PTSD , but also cluster headaches and addiction , as well as anxiety and depression in cancer patients .
Charles Grob , a psychiatrist at Harbor - UCLA Medical Center , dosed 12 end - stage cancer patients with psilocybin to test whether the experience could ease anxiety and help the patients cope with their diagnosis .
Grob did not present his data , which are under review for publication , at the San Jose meeting , but the buzz on the results is positive .
Grob and his co-investigators did offer snippets of letters and reactions from study patients .
One said , “ It feels like healing . ”
Similar studies of psilocybin in the terminally ill are now launching at New York University in New York City and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .
However , the going has been slow , with Doblin carefully dotting every regulatory " i " to prevent a second backlash against psychedelics .
" This is n't the ' 60s , " he says .
" We 've learned the lessons of that era , and now we 're trying to integrate ourselves into science , into medicine , into society . "
At the San Jose meeting , dubbed " Psychedelic Science in the 21st Century , " that integration was in full swing .
Eleven hundred therapists , physicians , basic researchers and psychedelics enthusiasts gathered for three days of scientific and cultural talks , visionary art shows and late - night celebrations .
The unlikely mix found conservatively dressed researchers from prestigious universities mingling with the heavily tattooed and the green haired .
As for Bledsoe , he 's now a true believer .
His MDMA sessions were " an almost sacred experience , a very special and uplifting experience , " he says .
After the therapy , he vacationed in Jamaica , began dating a local woman and bought a house on the island .
" I 'm happy and well adjusted now , " he says .
" It 's a good fairy - tale ending .
As soon as we get some little Bob Marley kids it 'll be even better . "

Israel on Monday vehemently rejected claims in a British newspaper that it offered to sell nuclear warheads to Apartheid - era South Africa in 1975 .
" There exists no basis in reality for the claims published this morning by The Guardian that in 1975 Israel negotiated with South Africa the exchange of nuclear weapons , " the president 's office said in a statement .
" Unfortunately , The Guardian elected to write its piece based on the selective interpretation of South African documents and not on concrete facts , " said the statement .
" Israel has never negotiated the exchange of nuclear weapons with South Africa .
" There exists no Israeli document or Israeli signature on a document that such negotiations took place . "
The Guardian newspaper said Sunday that documents uncovered by a U.S. academic during research for a book on Israel 's ties with South Africa provided the first hard proof that Israel has nuclear weapons .
Israel maintains an official policy of " nuclear ambiguity " over whether it is an atomic power .
The Guardian said documents declassified by South Africa 's post - apartheid government at the request of author Sasha Polakow - Suransky included top - secret minutes of meetings between senior officials of the two countries in 1975 .
Those papers , the newspaper said , showed that South Africa 's defense minister at the time , P.W. Botha , asked warheads and his counterpart Shimon Peres , now Israel 's president , offered them in " three sizes " .
The Guardian claimed that this referred to conventional , chemical and atomic weapons .
Asked about the report , Peres spokeswoman Ayelet Frisch said : " There is no truth to the Guardian report . "
" We regret that the newspaper did not seek a comment from the president 's office .
If it had done so , it would have discovered that the story is wrong and baseless , " she added .
According to the Guardian report , the alleged nuclear deal did not go ahead , partly because of the cost .
Speculation about Israeli -South African nuclear cooperation was raised in 1990 when a U.S. satellite detected a mysterious flash over the Indian Ocean .
The U.S. television network CBS reported it was a nuclear test carried out by the two countries .
EDEN , on the state 's south coast , is set to be the first Australian town to be powered by a wood - fired electricity plant , despite concerns that burning trees could generate more greenhouse gas emissions than burning coal .
The woodchip company behind the plant , which is being considered by the NSW government , describes it as a renewable energy project that will make practical use of offcuts and sawdust from its existing mill .
Climate change activists display black balloons ( representing pollution ) outside the offices of the NSW government in Sydney to protest at its approval of a new woodchip fired power station in Eden .
Credit: AFP
But it faces fierce opposition from sections of the local community which believe the plan will entrench logging in native forests and promote demand for woodchips .
Although the plant 's developer , South East Fibre Exports , plans to phase in plantation wood , the majority of the 51,000 tonnes of fuel will still come from logging in native forests .
When the role of the living trees as carbon sinks is factored in , emissions from the plant soar to up to four times that of a coal plant , campaigners argue .
Two of Israel 's largest extreme - left groups , B'Tselem and Peace Now , are accused of acting illegally as foreign agents in the United States .
Two of Israel 's largest extreme - left organizations , B'Tselem and Peace Now , have been accused of potentially violating United States law by acting illegally as foreign agents .
The U.S. Department of Justice has been informed of the accusations , and is looking into the matter .
The charges were raised by Attorney Lee Bender .
Bender first notified the Department of Justice 's National Security Division of the potentially illegal status of Americans for Peace Now in November 2009 .
While awaiting the conclusions of the Justice Department , he developed concerns about B'Tselem as well and last week contacted the National Security Division to report in the group .
The Americans for Peace Now group is part of the Isreli left - wing movement that campaigns against a Jewish presence in all of the land restored to Israel in the Six - Day War in 1967 .
Its activists often support Arab incitement as part of the " resistance . "
B'Tselem is a self - acclaimed human rights group that consistently has condemned Israel for counterrorist operations against Hamas and has blamed Israel for most Arab violence .
Both organizations use the Israeli Supreme Court as venue for attempting to bring about home demolitions in Judea and Samaria communities and for attempts to indict Israeli civilians and soldiers for what they term unnecessary violence in the face of perceived terrorist threats .
Both organizations are suspected of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) .
The law , enacted in 1938 , requires those acting as agents of foreign principles in a political or quasi-political capacity to disclose their relationship to the foreign principles and their activities .
B'Tselem and Peace Now both receive much of their funding from the European Union and individual European countries .
As Bender wrote , “ They have and continue to receive funds from European governments , and have an office in Washington D.C. that lobbies United States officials . ”
If the two organizations are found to be foreign agents under FARA , they will need to report all contact with American officials , as well as for every political activity they organize .
In Israel , organizations funded by foreign governments are required to report the donations they receive to the Non-Profit Associations Registrar .
Since 2008 , such groups have been required to make their donations public via the Internet as well .
In 2009 , MK Danny Danon revealed that he plans to criminalize the activities of Peace Now , B'Tselem and similar organizations by making it illegal for foreign - funded groups to engage in political activity inside Israel .
As we ’ve mentioned once or twice , quarterback Tim Tebow ’s habit of openly expressing his religious beliefs could potentially rub folks the wrong way , especially in a locker room of grown men who choose to keep their beliefs to themselves , who do n’t share his beliefs at all , and / or who only want to hear “ God bless ” after they have sneezed .
We ’re told that Tebow already has gotten a taste of the resistance he might face at the next level .
At the Scouting Combine , the Wonderlic exam is administered to players in groups .
The 12 - minute test is preceded by some brief instructions and comments from the person administering the test .
Per a league source , after the person administering the test to Tebow ’s group had finished , Tebow made a request that the players bow their heads in prayer before taking the 50 - question exam .
Said one of the other players in response : “ Shut the f–k up . ”
Others players in the room then laughed .
We ’re not passing judgment on this one ; we ’re just passing along what we ’ve heard .
And it illustrates the type of challenges that could be faced by the team that drafts Tebow .
That said , some teams might embrace those challenges .
The final decision will depend largely on the composition of the team , and the personalities of the coach , the G.M. , and the owner .
So I have long in the back of my mind wondered if having the people in charge of marketing and such for US Soccer and the MLS , also be in charge of the same for the Mexican National team ?
Is n't having the same leadership of our league ( " the Don " ) , running the company who controls the marketing and commercial rights of our league ( " the Don " ) and all commercial rights to US Soccer ( both men 's and women 's team ) ( " the Don " ) , enough to probably lead to some conflicts of interest but several years ago SUM took over the marketing and promotion of the Mexican National Team in the US .
Now news that the relationship between SUM and the Mexican National team is being extended : Soccer United Marketing officials will be chanting " viva Mexico " for four more years , following a recent agreement to extend the agency 's eight - year partnership with the Mexican national soccer team .
SUM and the Mexican soccer federation ( FMF ) reached agreement on a new deal that will see SUM continue to organize Mexican exhibition games and manage Mexican marketing rights through 2014 .
The future of their partnership , which began in 2003 , was thrown into jeopardy in March when Traffic , a Brazilian - based soccer marketing company , put forward a competitive bid to take over management of the Mexican team .
Traffic's offer to the Mexican soccer federation was valued in the high seven figures annually and included revenue - sharing opportunities .
SUM had a right to match Traffic 's offer , but it is unclear what SUM proposed to pay .
Terms of its extension were n't available .
The deal is expected to include the same number of games as the previous one plus an Olympic tour in 2012 , a South American tour before the ' 14 World Cup and a plan to develop a Mexican team website in the U.S. from Sports Business Journal
I am sure all of this is on the up and up , but for me having a group in charge of promotion and commercial decisions of opposing organizations would be a natural conflict of interest .
Can an organization that has shown more interest in promoting their SuperLiga , than the US Open Cup , be trusted to make the decisions on what is best for soccer in the US ?
Or are they simply trying to find ways to capitalize on the large soccer following Hispanic community in the US ?
More , including a comment from " the Don " on the topic , after the jump :
So we if you read my blog on a regular basis you know I have a lot of respect for what MLS Commissioner and SUM CEO , Don Garber , has done for the MLS and to a lesser extent for soccer in the US .
I do however believe that he has switched focus so many times that he now spends more time jumping to the flavor of the week that his leadership has lost it's way and that the interest of the sport , the league and the owners would be best served if he were to take over SUM on a full time basis and MLS find a new leader who can take us from where we are today into a better future for MLS and professional soccer in the US .
Here is one of the many reason why :
It has been this type of thinking since SUM started their relationship with the Mexican National team , but the reality is that MLS trails the Winter Olympics as far as popularity among Hispanics in the US .
The reality is that the Hispanic fan base is important to overall success of the sport in the US , but there is nothing that shows me that having the group responsible for the commercial promotion of the MLS , and US Soccer has done much over the last 8 years , only a 3.6 % increase among those who call themselves fans ?
The sport has grown but I believe it has been much more the coverage of the sport in all aspects ( MLS , EPL , WPS , US Soccer ) by both national media ( ESPN , FSC ) and the emergence of the non traditional media .
So is having the man in charge of our league being the same man in charge of promotion of the Mexican National team a conflict of interest ?
It is a question that only time will tell the answer to , but for me in this new world of transparency , if it looks like a fish , feels like a fish , it is probably going to smell like a fish .

I have paid a very high price for ' bigot ' gaffe , says Brown as Labour is on course for worst election defeat in 92 YEARS
Two newpapers withdraw Labour support : Guardian backs Lib Dems , Times the Tories
Gordon Brown said today he has ' paid a very heavy price ' for his ' bigoted ' outburst against an elderly widow .
He admitted Wednesday 's encounter with 68 - year - old Gillian Duffy had damaged him .
' I have personally paid this heavy price for a mistake that I made , ' he told the Daily Telegraph .
' Sometimes you say things in the heat of the moment , sometimes you pay a very heavy price for those things .
Sometimes you say things you greatly regret .
' And I have paid a very high price for it . '

Mr Brown suffered a further blow to his election hopes today as two major newspapers withdrew their support for Labour .
The Left - wing Guardian announced it was now throwing its weight behind the Liberal Democrats while The Times , which has also supported Tony Blair in previous elections , urged its readers to vote Conservative .
But today he dismissed them switching their endorsements away from Labour as irrelevant and declared he would ramp up campaigning with just five days left to turn the General Election around .

A Daily Mail poll reveals Labour support has crashed to 24 per cent following the Prime Minister 's ' bigot ' gaffe and his lacklustre performance in the final TV debate .
But it provides cold comfort for David Cameron - putting his party on 33 per cent , just one ahead of the Liberal Democrats .
The findings suggest Britain is firmly on course for the paralysis of a hung Parliament - even though a majority of voters believe that outcome will be bad for the country and the economy .

But his hopes of a Commons majority remain in serious jeopardy thanks to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg , who last night declared the election a ' two - horse race ' with Labour already beaten .
In a sign of Labour 's growing desperation , a suntanned Tony Blair , who has spent most of the election campaign on holiday or earning money on the lecture circuit , was wheeled out to try to shore up support .
Addressing activists after visiting what should be a rock - solid Labour seat in north - west London , he said : ' This Lib Demmery has to stop .
If it is possible to be profoundly vacuous , that is what they are . '
He was forced to deny that Mr Brown had been a ' failure ' as Prime Minister and said he did not expect Labour to gain fewer votes than the Lib Dems , despite a series of polls putting it in third .
However , in a further body blow to the party , the traditionally Labour - supporting Guardian newspaper today comes out in favour of the Liberal Democrats .
While Mr Brown insisted he would fight to ' the very last second ' , Labour sources say Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , Home Secretary Alan Johnson and Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth are preparing to back a leadership bid by Foreign Secretary David Miliband after a defeat on May 6 .
There is growing support for Chancellor Alistair Darling - rather than the party 's deputy leader Harriet Harman - to take over as a ' caretaker ' leader while a permanent successor is chosen .
Last night Mr Darling insisted he had ' no ambitions at all , not even for a few minutes ' of becoming prime minister .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls , Mr Brown 's closest Cabinet ally , is expected to mount a challenge to the Blairite Mr Miliband .
The fiasco of the Prime Minister 's encounter with Labour - supporting grandmother Gillian Duffy - whom he was overheard calling a ' bigot ' - has cemented a view in Labour circles that Mr Brown cannot stay on as leader .

' It will be quick , as much for his sake as anything else , ' one Labour veteran was quoted as saying .
Another Labour insider said : ' Gordon will not be able to carry on if we poll below 30 per cent .
It just wo n't be tenable . '
A large majority of voters in today 's Harris poll - 66 per cent - agree Mr Brown should not remain Prime Minister , even if Labour wins the most seats but falls short of a Commons majority .
Overall , the Tories are down one point on last week , on 33 per cent , the Lib Dems up three on 32 and Labour down two on 24 .
The findings will be a blow to Mr Cameron , who had hoped his success in Thursday night 's TV debate would translate into an immediate poll bounce .
However , he is judged by 31 per cent to be the best potential prime minister , with Mr Clegg on 25 and Mr Brown on just 21 .
The Tory leader is also seen as the most effective in managing the economy , with 33 per cent backing him against 30 for Mr Brown and just 17 for Mr Clegg .
One of the most startling findings is that large numbers of voters believe a hung Parliament will be bad for Britain - but many still say they intend to vote Lib Dem .
Some 48 per cent say a hung Parliament would fail to tackle government debt , 48 per cent say it would be weak and indecisive , 46 per cent disagree that it would be a good thing and 50 per cent disagree that it would strengthen international confidence in Britain .
Most voters do not want the Lib Dems to join forces with either of the two main parties - with 38 per cent saying they should instead vote on each issue in Parliament as it comes up .
Some 26 per cent say they should join a coalition with or support a Labour minority government , almost the same as the 25 per cent who say they should prop up the Tories .
Business leaders have issued a fresh warning that a hung Parliament would be bad for the economy and stifle growth .
A poll of 300 heads of firms by BDRC Continental on behalf of financial channel CNBC found that 77 per cent fear turmoil if there is no decisive result next week .

ANALYSIS : Tories must play on the Fear Factor
by ANTHONY KING
Party leaders make less difference to the outcomes of most British elections than people suppose .
Winston Churchill was the man who won the war in 1945 but lost the general election that same year .
Jim Callaghan was bookies ' favourite to remain Prime Minister in 1979 , but Margaret Thatcher 's Tories won decisively .
Policies rather than personalities are normally what sway most voters .
Crunch time : David Cameron , pictured yesterday meeting pupils at Landau Forte College in Derby , must split up the Lib Dem vote by playing on fears of a hung parliament
Nick Clegg addresses the crowd during the semi final World Snooker Championships at The Crucible Theatre in Sheffield , England
But 2010 looks like being an exception .
Labour would probably have lost anyway because of its recent record in office , but Gordon Brown has almost certainly nailed the lid on his party 's coffin .
Indeed things are so desperate for Labour that next Thursday it could well finish third .
There is no precedent in British history for a governing party being thus humiliated .
Not only does Labour trail the Tories by nine points according to the Daily Mail 's latest Harris poll , but a mere 21 per cent of voters think Gordon Brown would make the best prime minister .
In fact a large majority reckon that , even if Labour is the largest party in the next Parliament , he should definitely depart Downing Street .
To compound the misery , his rude remarks about Gillian Duffy on Wednesday - calling her a bigoted woman for raising concerns about mass immigration - undoubtedly did immense damage to what was left of his personal reputation .
Fully one in three of Harris 's respondents feels ' less favourable ' towards the Prime Minister than before the incident .
This leaves the Conservatives in a position at once formidable and frustrating .
It is formidable because they seem certain to emerge from the election with more Commons seats than any other party .
On a uniform swing across the country , Harris 's voting - intention figures give the Tories 265 seats in the new parliament compared with only 222 for Labour .
If , as some polls suggest , they are doing particularly well in marginals , that lead could well be higher .
But their position is frustrating because such numbers leave them well short of an overall majority and point to a hung parliament in which a David Cameron - led government would be forced to rely on the votes of Liberal Democrat MPs to remain in power .
At the very least , Mr Cameron might find himself having to concede a referendum on proportional representation as a means of guaranteeing Lib Dem parliamentary support .
To clinch an overall majority and free themselves from dependence on the Lib Dems , the Tories need both to squeeze Nick Clegg 's party between now and next Thursday and further widen the gap between themselves and Labour .
If the Tories could somehow edge upwards from their present 33 per cent to 37 per cent , and if support for both the Lib Dems and especially Labour fell back , Mr Cameron could still win an overall majority - but his majority would be tiny and , like John Major 's in 1992 , potentially precarious .
The stance of Lib Dem voters is paradoxical .
They evidently remain unconvinced by David Cameron 's liberal and centrist credentials .
The fine print of Harris 's findings suggests that Lib Dem supporters , although they despair of Gordon Brown , still remain more inclined to Labour than the Tories .
However , at the same time a substantial proportion of Lib Dem supporters are clearly unsettled by the prospect of a hung parliament .
According to Harris , nearly one - third of Lib Dem voters fear a coalition or minority government would be ' weak and indecisive ' and that such a government ' would fail to tackle the government 's enormous deficit ' .
But pharma's recent plan to move from mass - market molecules into more lucrative vaccines and biologics did not see the anti-vaxer movement coming : millions of Americans saying You Want to Vaccinate Me -- and My Child -- with WHAT ?? and condemning vials of H1N1 , rotavirus and MMR vaccines to sit , well , way past their expiration dates .
Nor were fears of an international vaccine conspiracy helped by former CDC Director Julie Gerberding resurfacing as President of Merck Vaccines in December .
( Nice revolving door if you can catch it . )
April 16 , 2010 | Since direct - to - consumer drug advertising debuted in 1997 , pharma 's credo has been When The Medication Is Ready , The Disease ( and Patients ) Will Appear .
Who knew so many people suffered from restless legs ?
Now pharma is back to creating new diseases , patients , risks and " awareness campaigns " faster than you can say thimerosal ( the vaccine preservative that started the backlash . )
1. SERM deficiency
A pill to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis packs the " magic three " of drug sales -- fear , forever and faith -- since you never know if it 's working or you need it but fear stopping .
But 15 years after women began swallowing bisphosphonates like Boniva and Fosamax because pharma - planted bone density machines in medical offices revealed they had " osteopenia , " * bisphosphonates are linked to jaw bone death , esophageal cancer and causing the fractures they were supposed to prevent .
Sorry about that .
Now pharma is hawking Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators ( SERMs ) like Evista and Tamoxifen to prevent osteoporosis and even some cancers .
Unfortunately they can cause others ...
2. Statin Deficiency
If it seems like the whole world is on statins , it 's not your imagination .
Last year the FDA approved AstraZeneca 's Crestor for children as young as 10 and in March it approved Crestor for 6.5 million people who have no cholesterol or heart problems at all !
( See : fear , forever and faith . )
Many say , since lead investigator of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention study Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston is co-patent holder / inventor of the C- reactive protein ( CRP ) test which " proves " Crestor 's effectiveness , there 's a conflict of interest .
Others say , since CRP is n't necessarily even a marker for heart disease and statins can cause Type 2 diabetes , it 's bad science along with a conflict of interest . )
3. Circadian Dysrhythmia
Insomnia is a gold mine for pharma because everyone sleeps -- or watches TV when they can't .
But Ambien , Lunesta , Sonata and Rozerem have reached market saturation , so pharma is rolling out subcategories like nocturnal , middle - of - the - night ( MOTN ) and terminal insomnia and sleep eating , sleep walking and sleep sweating ( yes sweating ) to boost the franchise .
Meanwhile another demo is swelling Circadian Dysrhythmia numbers :
Thanks to restless legs syndrome , sleep apnea , shift work sleep disorder , people who skimp on sleep and of course insomnia meds themselves , there 's an epidemic of excessive sleepiness !
Enter Provigil --" a mood - brightening and memory - enhancing psychostimulant which enhances wakefulness and vigilance , " -- Adderall and Vyvanse , known in the days of Lenny Bruce -- also an " excessive sleepiness " sufferer -- as speed .
4. Adult Autism , ADHD and Refusal to Play Nicey
Having marketed adult diseases like depression , bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in 4 - year - olds to death , pharma is now finding childhood diseases in adults .
Adults with ADHD have hyperactivity , impulsivity , " executive function deficits " and " difficulty with organization and time management , " says Harvard Medical School 's Joseph Biederman , in a 2004 JAMA .
The disease , found in most people 's brother - in - laws , requires " lifelong " medication says Biederman , who was accused of pushing Risperdal and hiding pharma income by Congress in 2008 .
Adults may suffer from autism too says a 2008 article in Psychiatric News , if they 're " unsociable , extremely rigid , given to angry outbursts " and " acutely sensitive to light , heat , and pain . "
Luckily , in two studies " SSRI antidepressants led to a decrease in repetitive behaviors and to somewhat more socializing , " in adults with autism says Psychiatric News .
Martha Rosenberg frequently writes about the impact of the pharmaceutical , food and gun industries on public health .
Her work has appeared in the Boston Globe , San Francisco Chronicle , Chicago Tribune and other outlets .
How contact lenses could help save your life
It used to be that contact lenses were worn only instead of glasses .
Now a new generation of lenses has transformed them into valuable health tools that can help not only with serious eye problems , but everything from migraines to diabetes .
Migranes
I see red : England cricket captain Andrew Strauss wears red - tinted contact lenses to remove harsh sun glare
Red - tinted contact lenses have been developed to relieve the agony of migraines .
They work by filtering out wavelengths of light that over - stimulate retinal receptors - lightsensitive tissues lining the inner surface of the eye - which results in head pain .
Dr Richard Garrison , of San Jacinto Methodist Hospital in Texas , recently trialled 33 migraine patients with a history of photophobia - excessive sensitivity to light .
red - tinted lenses were inserted during acute attacks , resulting in immediate pain relief for all but two of the patients .
Sportsmen and women are also starting to wear red - tinted contact lenses .
England cricketers , including captain Andrew Strauss and wicketkeeper Matt Prior , recently trialled the lenses , which act like sunglasses to enable them to see the ball better in sunny conditions .
They work by filtering out bright sunlight , while relaxing the eyes to stop squinting .
Unlike sunglasses , the lenses - available now - do not restrict peripheral vision .
Nor do they become covered in sweat or get steamed up .
Diabetes
A new development in contact lens technology could see the end of diabetes sufferers constantly having to check their blood sugar levels using skin prick tests .
Researchers at the University of Western Ontario , Canada , have created lenses that chemically react to glucose found in tears .
The lenses monitor blood glucose levels and alert wearers to any changes by changing tint , saving sufferers from having to undergo regular blood tests .
Glucose levels in tears are revealed 30 minutes behind levels in blood , but as most diabetics leave hours between their skin prick tests , the lenses will still be a more efficient and less invasive method .
Dyslexia
Six million people in Britain have dyslexia to some degree , with one in 25 cases being severe .
Professor John Stein , of Oxford University , has estimated that one in three dyslexics could be helped by using colour filters on lenses .
Many find reading easier when text appears on coloured - rather than white - backgrounds .
White light is formed of colours moving at different frequencies , some of which can cause confusion when the brain receives the information .
Breakthrough : Contact lenses are now being used to treat a number of common ailments
Tinted contact lenses filter out the problem light frequencies .
The degree of tint is assessed by eye experts for each individual .
Many dyslexics are also mildly colour blind - and now there are lenses that can help , too .
These work by changing the colour of the incoming light to a shade that can be detected by the wearer .
Vision itself is not affected , but the ability to tell the difference between certain colours is improved .
Colour blindness affects up to one in ten men and one in 200 women .
Corneal disease
A research team from the ­University of New South Wales in Sydney has used stem cells - ­‘master cells ’ with the ability to turn into other cell types - on contact lenses to treat corneal disease .
They removed small samples of stem cells from the eyes of three ­corneal sufferers and grew them on a contact lens .
The stem cell - coated contacts were then put into their eyes for three weeks .
During that time , the stem cells moved off the lenses and began to heal the damaged corneas .
Using a patient ’s own cells eliminates the need for donors and means the cells will not be rejected .
A research team from the ­University of New South Wales in Sydney has used stem cells - ­‘master cells ’ with the ability to turn into other cell types - on contact lenses to treat corneal disease .
Associate Professor Nick Di ­Girolamo , the university ’s director of ocular research , says : ‘ The procedure is ­simple and cheap .
Unlike other techniques , it requires no foreign human or animal products , only the patient ’s own serum , and it ’s completely non-invasive .
There ’s no suturing or operation .
‘ For the moment , we are solely treating blindness due to corneal disease from limbal stem cell failure .
We hope that in the future we can make this technique widely available .
‘ It is not designed to treat any ­ocular condition .
But we predict that modifications to the procedure could be made so that it can be adapted to treat other blinding disorders , including those characterised by retinal degeneration . ’
Damage to retinal blood vessels is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight , including many cases of age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) .
The disease is most common in the over - 60s and around 200,000 Britons are registered as blind or partially - sighted because of it , making it the leading cause of blindness in the UK .
The contact lenses used in the ­operation are widely used after surgery .
Glaucoma and cataracts
Contact lenses that release drugs such as ­vitamin E directly into the eye might soon be used to treat common eye diseases .
These include dry eye , when the eye does n’t make enough tears , leading them to dry out ; glaucoma , a chronic condition where the pressure in the eyeball increases , damaging the optical nerve and resulting in vision loss ; and cataracts , a ­condition causing cloudiness in the eye lens .
Scientists at the University of Florida have developed contact lenses that can ‘ dispense ’ prescription drugs , over a period of weeks , to the precise spot in the eye they are needed .
The lenses are embedded with ­particles of medicine and , it is hoped , will be more efficient than eye drops , the method currently used to clear such problems .
Study author Anuj Chauhan , ­Associate Professor at the university ’s department of chemical ­engineering , said : ‘ Only about one to five per cent of drugs delivered via eye drops reach the cornea and the rest enters systemic circulations and can cause side - effects .
‘ We ’ve developed transparent ­particle - laden contact lenses that deliver drugs at therapeutic doses for five to 30 days .
‘ That can lead to a 40 - fold increase in the fraction of the entrapped drug that enters the cornea . ’
Mr Chauhan explained that traditional eye drops mix with tears , which then drain into the nasal cavity and penetrate the bloodstream , where the drugs can cause serious side - effects .
For instance , Timolol , used to treat glaucoma , can cause heart problems .
The lenses , which are due for human trials within the next two years , have the added benefit of ­protecting the eye from sun damage because vitamin E in contact lenses blocks UV radiation .
Barbara McLaughlan , of the Royal National Institute of Blind People , said : ‘ The concept of a contact lens that keeps nutrients such as vitamin E close to the eye , to treat glaucoma , seems plausible .
‘ It may offer more flexibility to ­people who struggle with their ­current treatment regime . ’
Health check - ups
Green light : Contacts that administer drugs direct to the part of the idea they 're designed to treat have recently been introduced
As the eye is made up of a network of blood vessels , it offers the means to measure a range of ‘ biomarkers ’ — indicators found in the blood that can reveal the state of your health .
Scientists at the University of Washington in the U.S. are working on solar - powered contact lenses with in - built microscopic computers .
With a tiny radio transmitter in the circuitry , health condition reports measured from the eye ’s surface could be automatically sent to ­doctors monitoring a patient .
This technology is still in early research stage .
But , potentially , it could identify illnesses that require diagnostic blood tests such as anaemia , diabetes , ­cholesterol ­levels , thyroid , kidney and liver functions , and even some sexually transmitted diseases .
Using hundreds of semi-­transparent LEDs , sensors and wireless technology , contact lenses could also display images and words .
This could be used to inform the wearer when to take their tablets or seek medical help .
The lenses could even be ­developed to include translating speech into ­captions in real time for the deaf .
Short - sightedness
Contact lenses worn only at night are helping people suffering from short - sightedness by gently pressing on the eye to restore it to the shape of someone with normal vision .
With short - sighted sufferers , the ­cornea is either too curved or the eyeball too long .
This means the light rays from distant objects focus in front of the ­retina , rather than directly on it , making objects seem blurred .
The new overnight lenses work by gently pressing on the cornea , reducing its curvature and so refocusing the light directly on to the retina .
The lenses , available since 2008 , are also made to prescription , so patients can see if they wake up at night .
Overnight lenses are made from a special hard type of plastic lens , called gas permeable , that allows oxygen to reach the eye .
Tissues in the cornea maintain their transparency in part by not having blood vessels flowing through them , but this means the cornea must get its oxygen directly from the air .
­Without oxygen , the cornea will become less transparent and can scar .
Although the lenses should be worn every night for continued benefits , it takes a few days for short - sighted effects completely to wear off .
An ­independent review found the new lenses could improve vision by around 70 per cent after one night , often ­correcting sight fully within a week .
Around 12 million people in the UK are short - sighted and three million already wear normal contact lenses .
Implantable Contact Lenses - another innovation already available - also offer severe short - sightedness sufferers an ­alternative to correct their vision .
( The lenses can also help those not suitable for corrective laser eye surgery , because if eyes are already poor , an operation is considered too risky . )
The lenses , which cost £ 2,500 to £ 3,500 for each eye , improve vision by working with the eye ’s existing natural lens , boosting its effectiveness and allowing the patient ’s eye to adapt to different distances .
The 15 - minute procedure causes minimum discomfort and has instant results .

Despite the Palestinian Authority ’s announcement that it had postponed the inauguration of a square in el - Bireh named after Dalal Mughrabi , the Fatah woman who led the 1978 Coastal Road massacre in which 37 Israeli civilians and an American photographer were killed , and 71 were wounded , Fatah officials on Thursday evening went ahead with the ceremony .
In addition , the PA on Sunday launched a seminar named after Mughrabi .
The four - day seminar , called “ Martyr Dalal Mughrabi Camp , ” is being held in Jericho under the auspices of the PA ’s Military Science Academy .
Its main goal is to discuss the legislative and local elections in the PA territories .
About 120 university students from the West Bank are participating in the conference .
The seminar is being held on the 32nd anniversary of the Coastal Road attack and is seen more as a rally in honor of Mughrabi than as an academic seminar .
The PA said on Thursday that the square - naming ceremony that took place was not an official event , but rather a “ popular rally ” organized by local residents and Fatah supporters .
On Thursday morning , Adnan Dumairi , a senior PA security official , announced that the official ceremony to name the square after Mughrabi had been delayed for “ technical reasons . ”
Dumairi denied that the decision to put off the ceremony was related to pressure from Israel and the US .
However , in the evening , dozens of Palestinians gathered at the site , where Fatah leaders officially announced that the square had been named after Mughrabi .
A local Fatah official claimed that the decision to go ahead with the ceremony was taken without coordination with the PA .
“ The Palestinian Authority canceled the official ceremony becausethey were afraid of [ US Vice President ] Joe Biden , ” he said .
“ But the Palestinian leadership could n’t prevent Palestinian residents and Fatahfrom holding their own celebration to honor this great woman for hersacrifices and heroism .
” The 1978 bus hijacking on the CoastalRoad was the deadliest terrorist attack ever perpetrated againstIsrael .
Planned by Abu Jihad ( Khalil al - Wazir ) and carried out by Fatah , it was aimed at halting peace talks between Israel and Egypt .
China ’s High - Growth Ghost Towns
In the gritty Inner Mongolian wind , I stood at the pinnacle of the global economy , at least in terms of GDP growth : the main drag of one of the fastest growing cities in the fastest - growing region in all of China , the world ’s supposed new economic powerhouse .
Built in a breakneck five years , Kangbashi is a state - of - the - art city full of architectural marvels and sculpture gardens .
There ’s just one thing missing : people .
The city , built by the government and funded with coal money , its chief industries energy and carmaking , has been mostly vacant for as long as it has been complete , except for the massive municipal headquarters .
It ’s a grand canyon of empty monoliths .
In a paradox only possible in today ’s economic system , Kangbashi manages to be both a boom town and a ghost town at the same time .
Kangbashi represents a particularly destructive economic force at work in China today : an obsession with GDP that ignores all other metrics of progress or human capital .
GDP as calculated in China — or the rest of the world , for that matter — does n’t make any distinction between quantity and quality , or between creative and destructive expenditures .
Due to the industrial pollution billowing out of the country ’s GDP - enhancing factories and mines , cancer is the leading cause of death in China .
A recent government survey showed that 30 percent of children in Yunnan province suffer from lead poisoning .
Perhaps the biggest and most destructive GDP boost came from construction of the Three Gorges Dam , for which 1.24 million people were evicted .
Even some of the newly rich , however , shower in tainted brown tap water .
Meanwhile , in places like Kangbashi , an accelerated development in the real estate market has not been matched by long - term sustainability , and in recent months , predictions have grown louder that China ’s real estate bubble is about to burst .
This debate has been batted back and forth by columnists and TV talking heads lately .
For now , income growth is still outpacing housing price growth , meaning that the real estate market is not technically a bubble .
Still , China ’s emphasis on growth at all costs is creating some bizarre monsters , and Kangbashi is one of them .
Six years ago , Ordos county officials decided to move their headquarters out of old , cramped Dongsheng and into land that was then occupied by two small villages inhabited by about 1,400 people .
By the end of 2008 , the new district of Kangbashi was crisscrossed with 2.4 billion yuan ( $ 352 million ) worth of roads .
Officials initially said they expected the population to reach 100,000 this year and 300,000 by 2020 .
They also say the population reached 50,000 last year , which seems improbable given that pedestrians on the street were outnumbered by street sweepers .
A local real estate agent , Cao Ting , told me it had actually been easy to sell apartments .
She said 80 percent of the apartments had been sold .
I believed her even though 80 percent of them looked empty , with no curtains or furniture visible during the day and no lights on at night .
The buyers were mostly investors or future residents waiting for schools and hospitals to open before moving in .
The new buildings look great from the outside , and they ’re economically fine on paper , if you believe the local government .
And they may continue in this state , since the government will prop up the property market because it holds up so much else as well .
Local governments ’ revenues are completely dependent on land sales .
Eventually , perhaps , the population will catch up with this accelerated development .
When I went to visit last October , however , the lonely residents of Kangbashi did n’t seem likely to be welcoming new neighbors anytime soon .
Over glazed pork one night , I struck up a conversation with a middle - aged Chinese interpreter for German engineers employed at the state - owned coal mines nearby .
Later that night , he showed me how he staves off the loneliness : sitting alone in his hotel room with a microphone in his hand , crooning along in online karaoke rooms .
Kangbashi ’s eight - story library has a computer lab with about 100 brand - new computers , but I saw only an attendant and two teenage boys playing games .
Near the town ’s reservoir , two large screens were showing footage from the National Day parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People ’s Republic .
I looked up to see a sea of people in a clenched - fist salute in Tiananmen Square .
But I was the only one watching .
The only other people in sight were a dozen laborers landscaping the center dividers , their faces shrouded against the cold wind .
Across the reservoir , cranes were parked around construction sites .
A trade and commerce district is in the works , according to blueprints decorated with cartoon animals and wispy shooting stars in the style of Disney ’s Fantasia .
The image of spindly glass skyscrapers reflected on the water bears a striking resemblance to Dubai , funded by government revenue from fossil fuel extraction .
But whereas Dubai is already bankrupt , here construction continues .
At least , for now .
It 's my favorite new adjective .
Aspergery .
I came across it while reading Time Magazine 's series of autism articles .
In one of the articles , The Geek Syndrome , reporter J. Madeleine Nash writes , " There is no question that many successful people — not just scientists and engineers but writers and lawyers as well — possess a suite of traits that seem to be , for lack of a better word , Aspergery . "
I 'm currently making a career move from teaching kids with a range of disabilities to exclusively teaching kids with autism .
Why ?
While other teachers seem to get exasperated by their students with Asperger 's and autism , I get along with them easily .
I really do n't get the problem .
These kids are amazing .
Who would n't want to teach them ?
At the beginning of the semester , I was warned by several teachers about Jeremy , a 9th grade " troublemaker . "
Teachers apparently could n't control him .
One teacher said , " I just do n't know what his problem is . "
This is why EVERY teacher needs special ed training .
I realized within two minutes of meeting Jeremy that he has a classic case of Asperger's .
As yet another example of the stellar special ed services in the South Bronx , Jeremy , despite having a very clear IEP indicating that he should be in small classes , had been placed in large high school classes with no special ed support .
According to a guidance counselor , Jeremy 's IEP had been " lost in the shuffle . "
He was n't placed in my class until spring semester .
Jeremy is wonderful .
I hang out with him during lunch .
He fixes the classroom computers and shares his unique life insights .
One of his more colorful insights came during a fixation on breakfast cereals : " Apple Jacks make sense .
I realized that this morning .
They make sense .
They just do . "
( He went on for about 15 minutes . )
Jeremy also easily passed the Living Environment Regents exam on his first try .
Although I try not to show favorites , the other kids are obviously becoming jealous of my relationship with Jeremy .
One day , hyperactive Christopher began banging on my classroom door during lunch .
Jeremy was absent that day .
When I ignored Christopher 's banging , he shouted , " If I was Jeremy Stevens you would let me in !!! "
( Christopher actually banged out each syllable of the sentence on the door as he yelled this - we'd had a grammar lesson earlier that day . )
What can I say ?
He was right .
I love kids with autism , and I know that teaching them is what I want to do with my life .
As I 've begun to interact more with my students with autism , I 've also begun to realize that there is a reason I understand and get along so well with them .
I 'm a bit Aspergery myself .
I would certainly never claim to have any form of autism , because I do n't , but mild Obsessive Compulsive Disorder does seem to run in my family , and I believe OCD and Asperger 's are neurologically linked .
In his brilliant portrayal of an OCD - inflicted detective on the hit USA show Monk , Tony Shalhoub shows us just how quirky , exhausting and lovable people with severe OCD can be .
Some Monk fans believe Shalhoub 's performance more closely resembles a person with Asperger 's or high functioning autism .
In any case , Detective Adrian Monk reminds me of Jeremy .
A lot .
He also reminds me , to a lesser extent , of my sister , several friends , and - oh crap ! - myself .
I suspect there are many people out there who have more Aspergery minds than they 're willing to admit .
Taking a look at my own mind helps me better understand my students with autism .
I recently began working with Pre-K kids in their homes .
One four - year old girl lines up all her stuffed animals on her bed in a particular order , and she has a tantrum when they 're out of order .
( We 're working on this . )
Another student fixates on symbols .
On the playground , while his non-autistic classmates naturally socialize and play together , this boy naturally gravitates toward every letter or number to be found on the playground - usually on signs .
This is in some ways great because he 's learning to read at an unusually early age .
But it 's not so great when he socially isolates himself .
Like Adrian
Monk says , " It 's a blessing .
And a curse . "
Hanging out with these kids has helped me recall some of my own childhood ' quirks . '
Like many of my students , I have hypersensitive hearing , and I 've always been easily overwhelmed by certain noises .
I used to get unusually upset by seemingly minor sounds around the house .
I also remember fixating on symbols , creating patterns , and repeating them in my head when I was a kid .
I used to sit in my childhood living room , stare at the digital clock on the VCR , and repeat in my head , " Eight flash flash ten .
Eight flash flash ten . "
The " flash flash " came from the blinking colon on the digital clock .
Who even notices that ?
I also remember fixating on street signs while sitting in the back of the family car and having to repeat , " Stop ahead , stop ahead , stop line , stop " eight times before reaching a stop sign .
( There was a " Stop Ahead " sign , then " Stop Ahead " was also written on the road , then " Stop " was written on the road , then there was a white line on the road , and then , finally , there was the stop sign .
Thus , " Stop ahead , stop ahead , stop line , stop . " )
I 'm not sure what I thought would happen to me if I did n't repeat this phrase eight times , but I just had to do it .
I think it started when I was eight .
As many girls do , I kept these things hidden , and no one knew what was going on in my mind .
( I believe both autism and OCD are under - diagnosed in girls . )
I still occasionally catch myself memorizing a license plate for no apparent reason or washing my hands far too many times .
I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night to check the alarm clock that I already checked ten times before falling asleep .
Of course , my apartment locks can never be checked too often .
Sound familiar ?
I think we all , to some extent , have minds that cause us to do seemingly bizarre , repetitive things from time to time .
We all have our neuroses .
( And I 'm willing to bet that those who spend time in the blogosphere have them even more so than others . )
I 'm one of the lucky ones .
My life has not been held hostage by OCD , Asperger 's , or any form of autism .
I believe fewer lives would be if , rather than judging and fearing children with neurological disorders , more people - especially more educators - were willing to take a look at their own minds and see how much they have in common with these kids .
Often , when I tell people I teach kids with autism , they 'll say things like , " Oh I could never do that .
It would be too sad . "
Sad ?!
I do n't find it the least bit sad .
Kids with autism are amazing .
Frankly , there 's something sad about people who do n't get that .
