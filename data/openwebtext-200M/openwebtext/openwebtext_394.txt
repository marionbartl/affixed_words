There is a lot of talk in Washington these days about " containment . "
Foreign policy pundits insist that the U.S. must contain Iran , whose rise as a political - military power poses a threat to Western strategic and economic interests in the Persian Gulf region .
At the same time , economic experts maintain that the U.S. should contain its mounting financial crisis , which first raised its ugly head in the obscure sub - prime mortgage market and now seems to be having a devastating effect on the entire economy , and perhaps across the global financial system .
So Washington has been doing a lot of " containing " in both the foreign policy and economic arenas this year .
In the Middle East , the Bush administration has been trying to reassert U.S. power in the region by :
Increasing the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to 160,000 while providing support to the Shi’ite - controlled government and to Sunni forces .
Isolating Syria and Lebanon ’s Hezbollah .
Re-energizing the Israel - Palestine peace process .
Imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions on Iran .
The result of the grand U.S. strategic designs in the Middle East ?
The anti-American and sectarian violence continues in Iraq , and there has been no progress toward political reconciliation between the Shi’ites and Sunnis in the country .
Pressure from Syria and Hezbollah is preventing the election of a new president in Lebanon .
The peace process is stalled , and Israelis and Palestinians are continuing to kill each other .
And to dramatize the scale of American failures , Iran ’s anti-American President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been received on a red carpet in Baghdad , while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have been strengthening ties with Iran , getting closer to Syria , and negotiating with Hamas .
On the economic front , the Federal Reserve has been leading the way , and the administration and Congress have been protecting the rear .
They are slashing interest rates again and again and again .
They are promoting new plans to stimulate the economy and assist those who are finding it more and more difficult to finance their mortgages , make payments on their credit cards , and even fill their car ’s gas tanks .
And then there have been several " creative " efforts by the Fed to provide new sources of liquidity for troubled American banks .
But coming up with new fiscal rescue plans by the federal government  paid by the same American taxpayer who is enduring the current economic pains  and printing more and more money do not seem to provide the needed " containment . "
Instead , they are igniting inflationary pressures and putting more downward pressure on the U.S. dollar , whose value has been declining as investors have been pulling money out of the U.S .
And there are no signs that the banks and the other financial institutions are ready to provide new credit to business and consumers .
If anything , they seem to be in panic .
Indeed , if the visit by President Ahmadinejad to Iraq made it clear that America is failing to secure its position in the Middle East , last week ’s emergency rescue of Bear Stearns , one of Wall Street ’s respected financial institutions , by J.P. Morgan and the Federal Reserve demonstrated that the credit crisis is spreading to the broader economy and could threaten the U.S. financial system .
Last Friday , Bear Stearns ’ stock was worth $ 30 a share .
By Monday , rival bank J.P. Morgan
Chase reached a deal to buy the troubled firm for $ 236 million , or just $ 2 a share .
And there is a point  the Arab oil fields  in which America ’s strategic woes in the Middle East are intersecting with its growing economic problems .
Hence the humiliating images of President George W. Bush  and now Vice President Dick Cheney , who is in the Middle East  pleading with the Arab oil sheiks to please try to keep those energy prices down .
But the oil producers in the Middle East  whose economies are suffering from inflation because of the weak U.S. dollar to which their currencies are tied while their sovereign wealth funds have been keeping alive several distressed U.S. financial institutions  are reminding their American guests that the resurgence of Iran is the direct result of the U.S. ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
And its current economic problems are the outcome of the mismanagement of U.S. monetary and fiscal policies .
This reality also reveals the constraints operating on the dual American containment policies in the Middle East and the financial markets .
Officials in Washington are aware that the threat of using American military force against Iran is not credible under the current tight economic conditions , in particular , rising energy prices .
But the continuing costly U.S. military intervention in the Middle East also makes it difficult to put America ’s economic house in order .
It is clear therefore that the next U.S. president will have to find a way to go beyond military surges and economic bailouts , which tend to be both expansive and futile , and readjust U.S. global strategy and economic policies in accordance with the changing realities of American power .

Norman Podhoretz , an impassioned cheerleader for war with Iran , reached heights of apocalyptic sang - froid scaled only by the criminally insane when he predicted the following scenario , in the event of a US attack on Iran : “ It [ Iran ] would attack Israel with missiles armed with non-nuclear warheads but possibly containing biological or chemical weapons .
There would be a vast increase in the price of oil , with catastrophic consequences for every economy in the world , very much including our own .
The worldwide outcry against the inevitable civilian casualties would make the anti-Americanism of today look like a love - fest . ”
But Hillary Clinton is n’t frightened , even as commentators from all over the political spectrum issue similar dire warnings .
She told an ABC interviewer , “ In the next 10 years , during which they [ the Iranians ] might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel , we would be able to totally obliterate them . ”
The threat ( which the Boston Globe called “ foolish and dangerous ” and the Saudi - based Arab News called the “ foreign politics of the madhouse ” ) puts her in lockstep agreement with President Bush , who has pledged to “ defend Israel , no ifs , ands , or buts . ”
Mrs. Clinton is so desperate to play the tough guy card that she ’s had herself photographed throwing shots and beers back with the boys .
Now , with her nuclear threat , she proves that she ’ll say anything , do anything in order to win what Ken Silverstein of Harper ’s calls “ the frenzied bidding war to be the most ‘ pro - Israel . ’ ”
There ’s no indication , as yet , that she ’s ready to explain the monstrous consequences of a war with Iran to the American people .
William Lind , writing from the Center for Cultural Conservatism , fears the slaughter of US troops in Iraq , if we bomb Iran .
Iranian regulars and Iraqi militias , grossly outnumbering US forces , could cut off US supply lines from Kuwait .
“ [ W ]e could lose the army now deployed in Iraq , ” said Lind in an Antiwar.com piece .
If that happens , “ American power and prestige would never recover . ”
Consequences at home could be as ugly as those abroad .
An attack on Iran would be an invitation to a retaliatory terrorist attack on American turf , and , as Pentagon Papers author Daniel Ellsberg has pointed out , “ if there ’s another 9/11 or a major war in the Middle - East involving a U.S. attack on Iran there will be , the day after or within days an equivalent of a Reichstag fire decree that will involve massive detentions in this country , detention camps for middle - easterners and their …sympathizers , critics of the President ’s policy and essentially the wiping - out of the Bill of Rights . ”
Should the US risk existential defeat for Israel ?
Clinton adviser Ann Lewis seems to think so .
Lewis , President Clinton ’s Director of Communications in the late nineties , is now an active member of Hillary ’s campaign staff , and , in the event of a Clinton win , likely to follow her , in some capacity , back into the White House .
Making Mrs. Clinton ’s case for president at a United Jewish Communities debate in Washington , she recently made the astounding pronouncement that “ [t ] he role of the president of the United States is to support the decisions that are made by the people of Israel .
It is not up to us to pick and choose from among the political parties . ”
And what are these “ decisions that are made by the Israeli people ? ”
A survey by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz found “ fully 71 percent of Israelis believe that the United States should launch a military attack on Iran if diplomatic efforts fail to halt Tehran ’s nuclear program , according to a new poll . ”
But Mrs. Lewis is not on record as to what responsibility , if any , Israel has here ?
Despite a decades - long propaganda campaign that paints Israel as an island of stability in an otherwise unstable corner of the world , this sixty year old state , without geographical borders or a constitution , does n’t seem able or willing to enforce its own laws .
Benjamin Netanyahu pledged recently that , in the event of his election to Prime Minister of Israel , he will disregard any peace deal made between current Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
So Israel would be selective in its choice of treaties to honor , but the US , as pledged by President George Bush and potential president Hillary Clinton , would go to war for Israel without reservation or qualification .
The moderate voice of President Abbas identifies Israel ’s illegal settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as “ the most important obstacle to the peace process . ”
Yet Israel has broadened its settlement construction so expansively ( even as an ever - groveling US State Department “ warns ” against it ) that , according to the Israeli group Peace Now “ almost nothing is left of the [ Annapolis peace conference ] promise that Israel would freeze construction in the settlements . ”
Why should America risk everything for a so - called ally who cares so little for a genuine peace process ?
No matter how many illegal settlements rise , no matter how cruel the collective punishment of innocents in Gaza , no matter how many broken promises on the “ road map to peace , ” and – most frighteningly – no matter how deadly the consequences to the US , Clinton would write Israel a blank check .
Pat Buchanan , that severe old lion of the Paleo Right , writes in a recent column , “ In early 2007 , Nancy Pelosi pulled down a resolution that would have denied Bush the authority to attack Iran without congressional approval . ”
The Jewish Telegraph Agency , in a March 2007 piece , referred to the destruction of that same resolution : “ It did not help AIPAC ’s case for bipartisanship [ at it ’s annual convention ] that the lobby this week successfully pressed for the removal of a provision in an Iraq war funding bill that would have required the president to get congressional approval for war against Iran . ”
In the same JTA piece , Representative Gary Ackerman brags , “ you should get them [ the Iranians ] to know that maybe we ’re as crazy as they think we are . ”
Now Hillary Clinton has shown the world just how crazy she is .
Azerbaijan is among the most tolerant countries of the world .
This has been repeatedly stated even on state level .
Our country serves as an example for other CIS states .
However , foreign citizens , residing in our country , should not abuse this tolerance .
We will present a little example , which reflects disrespect of British citizens towards the local population .
It should noted that we do not try to wage international enmity , we are just presenting a fact .
A pub named Camel 's toe which initially seems to mean what it means - " A toe of a camel " functions in the very center of Baku , several meters away from the passage , at 22 .
Mamedaliyev street .
But , in fact the name has a double meaning .
The Camel 's
Toe has a meaning " the clear visible presence of a woman 's vulva as a consequence of wearing overly tight pants ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_toe ) .
A question comes to mind : was it named so on purpose ?
And what does the logotype of the pub , which locates in one of the most popular streets of Baku , mean ?
( see the photo below ) .
By information , our news agency received , prostitutes are working at some pubs , providing services to foreign " fat cats " for at least $ 500 .
" Ladies " do not want the local population to see them , therefore , such establishments are usually private and local residents are not allowed in .
In order to get answers to our questions , we directed to this pub and learned the following .
We were first not allowed to the pub , as we were apparently differing from the British citizens .
We noticed that almost all tables were empty in the pub .
But when the girl at the entrance heard pure " Russian speech " , they decided to allow us in .
It should be noted that we did not notice any prostitute in the pub .
Yet there were several curious moments .
The walls of the pub were decorated with different flags including the flags of Scotland , England , Great Britain and Russia .
All , except Azerbaijan .
The said fact proves the direct violation of the law " On rules of use of flags of other countries and international organization in the territory of Azerbaijan " .
Perhaps , the pubs owners have no idea of the law .
But the fact that the pub does not bear the flag of the country , it functions in , says that the bar owners do not respect the attributes of Azerbaijan .
The girl at the bar said the pub was named on purpose .
" Every client understands it as he wills ... "
She refused to translate our questions to the bar owner saying that the latter is aware of the name .
Well , we would not make any conclusions .
But several questions arise unwittingly .
Why did they name the pub like that ?
Could they not understand that this may arise protest among the local population ?
Perhaps , the British citizens wanted to introduce European culture in Azerbaijan , forgetting about the local mentality ?
Perhaps , they wanted to mock at Azerbaijanis , who are not aware of such details of British slang ?
Or perhaps they bound the slang name of the pub with Azerbaijani ladies , visiting it ?
It should be reminded to the pub owners that the name of the pub should be written in Azerbaijani or in a foreign language with the immediate translation or provision of transcription in Azerbaijani .
We hope that the pub owners will answer the questions of the due structures .
At the same time , we would remind that face control is applied at some foreign pubs of Baku , in the result of which most citizens of Azerbaijan are not able to enter this or that establishment .
It is up to our readers to decide whether it is fair or not .

Deadly Silences
The Hurricane Andrew Cover-up
The authorities grossly understated the death toll from hurricane Andrew , the worst natural disaster in US history , and left thousands of survivors to die in a zone contaminated by radiation .
In addition to those who died and were injured , scores of people were left homeless and the Red Cross and other relief agencies had to act as a temporary home , hotel and apartment finder for thousands all around the nation and then HUD and FEMA became involved .
The article below shows how the unprecedented events occurred and also the aftermath .

THE EMERGENCY ALERT THAT CAME TOO LATE
The largest natural disaster ever recorded in the history of the United States was hurricane Andrew , which struck South Dade County , Florida , as midnight turned the clock into August 24 , 1992 .
Contrary to what the American news media broadcast across the United States and throughout Europe , the first outer wall of the hurricane unexpectedly slammed into South Dade , packing 214 + mph winds which quickly escalated to 350 + mph .
Most of the 414,151 residents living in the danger zone were asleep when the outer wall struck .
Thousands of them lost their lives , for no one in South Dade had been evacuated or even advised to evacuate .
Instead , residents had been repeatedly informed by local news media that South Dade should expect to experience " 50 mph winds " .
By 11.00 am the following morning , 8,230 mobile homes along with 9,140 apartments had vanished off the face of the Earth .
The Hiroshima - like horror was beyond catastrophic .
Entire families perished in ways too horrifying to describe .
The stench of death had already begun to saturate miles and miles of the massive devastation ; the hot humid air was reeking with foul , rotting flesh .
How do I know ?
Because I was in the midst of it all .
Never will I forget the frantic , last - minute " emergency alert " broadcast that was aired on television just before all hell broke loose .
My son and I had the TV on , hoping to catch an updated report on the hurricane , when the screen suddenly went blank with a loud warning signal .
Before we knew it , a panic - stricken voice began the announcement :
We interrupt this program to bring you an emergency alert from the National Broadcast Emergency Center .
This is an emergency alert !
I repeat , this is an emergency alert !
The outer winds of hurricane Andrew have just reached the Florida coast .
Hurricane Andrew has unexpectedly shifted five degrees south .
I repeat , Hurricane Andrew has shifted five degrees south .
Andrew is expected to strike South Dade within minutes .
I repeat , Andrew is expected to strike South Dade within minutes .
All South Dade residents should take immediate cover !
I repeat , all South Dade residents should take immediate cover !
This is an emergency alert !
Our tiny pre-fab apartment , which was nothing more than a glorified mobile home , had been constructed to withstand maximum wind speeds of 90 mph .
The blood - curdling announcement gripped us both .
Paralysed by sheer terror , our bulging eyes stayed glued to the television as the voice continued .
All South Dade residents are advised to stay put !
Do not attempt to leave the area !
Within seconds , we actually heard hurricane Andrew bearing down on us , slamming into us with all the force of a speeding locomotive .
The horrendous wall of winds crashed against our tiny apartment like an exploding bomb !
Glasses flew off the kitchen counter , shattering onto the quaking floor .
Hanging pictures plunged straight down the walls towards the ground .
The huge hanging mirror crashed on top of the television set , spraying the living room with shattered glass .
The entire apartment resembled a rickety old train , shaking fiercely out of control while rumbling down a railroad track .
The screeching winds quickly transformed into the piercing , monotone hum of a jet engine , sounding as if it had sucked us inside !
It was so deafening , all other noises ceased to exist .
It felt like a monstrous earthquake - and - tornado hitting at the same time !
Before either one of us could react , the metal front door of our apartment began to peel steadily downward towards the floor , like a piece of wet , limp paper .
Then the voracious jaws of Andrew attacked for the final kill .
A mega -giant , two - storey - tall , solid concrete transformer pole with electrical cables attached , torpedoed right through our living room wall and roof , exploding the entire building on impact !
And that was just the beginning É
ATROCITIES IN THE AFTERMATH
There is n't a person on the face of this Earth who will ever convince me that hurricane Andrew was a " hurricane " by any sense of the definition .
Just ask any survivor of Andrew what the six - and - a - half - hour siege was like and the answer will always be the same .
" We did n't have any prior warning .
We heard hurricane Andrew suddenly bearing down on us like a speeding locomotive . "
This is the same description given by survivors of monstrous F - 5 tornadoes ( packing winds of 350 + mph ) -- the only difference being that tornadoes strike for just seconds , whereas hurricane Andrew struck and stayed for hours on end .
The injuries of those who survived were mind - boggling .
I had a broken jaw with eight teeth knocked out .
Huge shards of glass impaled my body so deeply , they were impossible to remove without the aid of a scalpel .
My head injuries were so severe that they permanently affected my eyesight .
But I was only one amongst thousands of severely injured victims who struggled to survive the aftermath .
For ten long days we were roped off from the outside world by United States military forces , leaving us stranded with no food , no water , no medical supplies , no shelter .
Suffering from severe shell - shock , we waited and waited for rescue teams to arrive , but that just never happened .
None of the injured in the roped - off areas was ever rescued from the devastation .
It was the worst gut - wrenching betrayal I have ever experienced .
I saw grown men lying on the ground in the foetal position , moaning and groaning pathetically as they tried to hug and rock themselves .
My son was amongst them .
Do n't get me wrong .
United States military forces were indeed present in the roped - off areas within hours of Andrew ending .
But they were not there to help survivors .
The National Guard along with the Coast Guard , the Army , FEMA ( the Federal Emergency Management Agency ) , Metro Dade Police , state police and local police removed dead bodies and body parts as quickly as possible during those first ten days of the aftermath .
Horrified survivors watched as both uniformed and civilian - clothed men searched the rubble and filled body bags , which they then stacked in military vehicles or huge refrigerator trucks normally used to transport food , only to drive off and leave the stranded injured to fend for themselves .
Not until I managed to escape the aftermath did I discover that the " thermo- king " sections of these same refrigerator trucks , jam - packed with wall - to - wall body bags , ended up being stored at Card Sound Navy Base , located in an isolated area just above the Florida Keys .
The inside temperature was kept cool by portable generators until the bodies were either incinerated or just plain dumped into huge open grave pits .
Those working on the body pick - up operation were forced to take what is known as the Oath of Sworn Secrecy , which is strictly enforced by the government .
Many of them plunged into shock , once exposed to the ghastly devastation and countless mutilated bodies .
The horrors were way beyond human comprehension .
I can vouch for this , as I accidentally stepped on the severed hand of a young child when I initially crawled out of the debris , only to witness shortly thereafter two dead teenagers and the decapitated body of a baby girl .
Fighting mental shock became such a big problem for the body pick - up teams that a special group of psychiatrists had to be brought in to help them cope with it .
I believe this in itself is the reason why many who worked on the body collection did n't comprehend the tragic consequences this would inevitably lead to in the future .
The survivors of hurricane Andrew and the rest of the American people were betrayed by their own government .
But the betrayal also extended to foreign nationals .
At the time Andrew struck , South Dade was inhabited by a large population of Mexican illegal immigrants .
The United States Department of Immigration was fully aware of their presence but quietly turned its back on the situation , knowing full well that South Dade farmers could n't afford to harvest their crops without the help of the Mexican illegals .
The heavily populated migrant camps were situated at the edge of the Florida Everglades .
The people who lived there vanished without a trace during that fated night .
Many bodies were found way out in the Everglades .
When I lectured at the Clearwater Convention in Florida in 1999 , a man in the audience stood up and introduced himself as Chief Petty Officer Roy Howard .
He proceeded to address the audience with this exact statement , which is now a matter of public record :
Just for your information , I was called up to active duty after hurricane Andrew went through South Dade County .
I spent nine weeks down there .
Now I will certify for the benefit of our audience here that the death figures that were officially published are totally inaccurate .
According to the information which I received from my own sources within the National Guard , the figure I was quoted when I was down there was 5,280 - something .
And they were quietly disposed of in incinerators that were hurriedly put together by both the National Guard and FEMA ...
As the Chief Petty Officer stated , " 5,280 - something " bodies were confiscated by the United States National Guard .
In addition to this , the Coast Guard independently confiscated " 1,500 bodies " from the lakes and surrounding waters .
Neither one of these figures embraces the number of dead bodies confiscated by other branches of federal and state government directly involved in the body pick - up operation .
This leaves the number of dead confiscated by various US authorities in South Dade still unknown .
The total number who died during hurricane Andrew is obviously staggering , yet whenever the " official death toll " is mentioned in the media , a figure of anywhere between 15 and 59 is quoted .
The population of the 21 communities annihilated by Andrew 's eye - wall had been officially recorded by the Dade County Census Bureau as 415,151 before Andrew struck .
Bodies of human beings confiscated and disposed - of like rubbish , as if their lives had no more worth or meaning than a piece of discarded litter -- it 's horrifying to be suddenly confronted by the same kind of atrocities as perpetrated by the Nazis .
Once again repeating history , a master - minded cover - up was dutifully carried out by armed military forces , right smack in the midst of horrendous human suffering .
To complete this historical comparison , in the same way that many residents who lived near Nazi concentration camps were unaware or in denial of the atrocities close by , so too were many residents who were located just outside the catastrophic devastation left behind by Andrew 's eye - wall .
GOVERNMENT BETRAYAL
So what actually did take place when Andrew survivors tried to get help from those collecting dead bodies in the aftermath ?
Well , I for one can give a first - hand account .
About the third day into the aftermath , a long line of police cars cautiously drove into my area during the late afternoon .
We had not had contact with any other people from outside the devastation up until this point .
There were approximately 12 to 15 police cars comprising this caravan , each marked from different locations throughout the state .
Each car was driven by a man dressed in a dark police uniform and had three other plain - clothed men riding as passengers , making a total of four men in each vehicle .
Someone from our group spotted the caravan and ran to get me , knowing that I had been badly injured and urgently needed emergency medical help .
My twenty - five - year - old son and one other adult male survivor helped escort me to the caravan .
We hurried towards the lead car .
It stopped moving when we approached the driver 's side .
The officer sitting behind the wheel rolled down the window .
For a few moments he rudely ignored us , at one point giving us an impatient look of disgust .
This is the exact conversation and course of events that took place .
" Please , sir , I need medical help , " I begged , barely able to speak .
The officer sitting behind the wheel sighed heavily .
He turned his head away from me and gazed out his windshield .
The other three men in the car quietly looked at me .
" Sir , please , I need to get to a hospital ... , " I begged frantically .
The officer took his time about reaching over to turn off the engine .
With another sigh , he slowly opened the door and climbed out .
He then proceeded to close the door and stood there with his legs spread astride .
" Lady , do me a favour , " he answered .
" Find yourself a piece of paper and a pencil .
Write down your name and social security number next to the telephone number of your nearest living relative .
Tuck the piece of paper in your pocket so tomorrow , when I find your body , I 'll know who to contact . "
" No ! No ! " I cried out .
" You do n't understand .
I need to get to a hospital .
I 've been badly injured . "
" No !
You 're the one who does n't understand , " he hissed back .
With that , he reached over to his holster and took out his gun .
He grabbed me , forcing me up against the side of the car , and proceeded to put the barrel of the gun against my temple .
I heard the hammer cock .
From the position he had pushed me into , I could see directly into the car .
The man sitting in the front passenger seat looked away from me immediately , glancing down at the floor .
The two passengers in the back seat turned their heads quickly , staring out the window on the opposite side of the car .
My son and the other survivor watched as the officer had pulled back the hammer on the gun .
So shocked out of their minds by what they were witnessing , neither one could move !
" You do n't belong here ! " the officer growled , pressing the barrel into the side of my head .
" Now you get the hell outta here before I blow away your ass ! "
He shoved my face into the car window and then released me .
Someone grabbed me from behind and whirled me around so fast , I did n't have time to think !
Before I knew it , I was being thrown over a shoulder .
My rescuer took off running as fast as he could !
I caught a brief glimpse of my son running next to me .
With one gigantic leap , he and the survivor who carried me , dove behind a pile of debris .
All three of us crashed on top of each other in one tangled - up heap .
" I 'll shoot your damn asses ! " the officer 's voice rang out .
When hurricane Andrew slammed into South Dade , the State Attorney of Florida was none other than Janet Reno .
Her office was located at the Dade County Court House in the City of Miami .
The President of the United States was President George H.W. Bush , and the Vice - President was Dan Quayle .
Bill Clinton was running for President , and Al Gore for Vice - President .
Senator Bob Graham held office , and the late Lawton Chiles was Governor of Florida .
His successor turned out to be Jeb Bush , still the Governor of Florida and , ironically enough , the son of former President Bush whose other son , George W. Bush , the then Governor of Texas , has since become the " self - selected " President of the United States ...
Curious how the United States Government evacuated Homestead Air Force Base just before hurricane Andrew struck , yet never released the information to the civilians of South Dade .
" This is worse than anything we saw in Saudi , " said Master Sgt Lester Richardson ( who had spent six months in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm ) one week into the aftermath .
" These people need a miracle É "
The survivors did need " a miracle " , but what we got instead did n't resemble anything near it .
MEDIA UNDERSTATEMENT
While we remained roped off from the outside world by Metro Dade Police and the military , the news media reported grossly understated information from the first day onward .
On August 24 , 1992 , the morning hurricane Andrew ended , the Miami Herald broke with :
Andrew Hits Hardest in South Dade .
Five thousand people were left homeless by the storm , Metro Dade Police Director announced .
They 'll be moved into shelters in North Dade .
Over subsequent days , the Miami Herald read as follows :
August 25 , 1992 :
Destruction at Dawn .
Among worst hit in the Country Walk area of South Dade , few homes escaped at least minor damage and many were utterly destroyed .
10 killed in Dade .
August 27 , 1992 :
The Toll Rises. 22 dead as the search continues .
63,000 homes destroyed .
175,000 homeless .
1 million without power .
August 28 , 1992 :
WE NEED HELP .
Relief effort collapsing due to United States inaction , Metro charges .
Aid us now or more will die , Feds told .
As Dade County 's hurricane relief effort neared collapse Thursday , more than 1,500 airborne US soldiers were ordered into the county to cope with what is now being called the worst natural disaster in United States history .
The move came after a day of bitter sniping among agencies that share responsibility for the relief effort .
United States aid official Wallace Stickler stated : " Andrew has caused more destruction and affected more people than any disaster America has ever had . "
Dade County 's Emergency Director pleaded for federal help , one angry voice among many that spoke in dire terms of needs unmet .
Frustrated to the point of tears , Kate Hale said that the relief project was on the brink of collapse , a victim of incompetence and political games :
" Where the hell is the cavalry on this one ?
We need food !
We need water !
We need people !
If we do not get more food into the south end [ South Dade ] in a very short period of time , we are going to have more casualties !
" We have a catastrophic disaster .
We are hours away from more casualties .
We are essentially the walking wounded .
We have appealed through the State to the Federal Government .
We 've had a lot of people down here for press conferences .
But Dade County is on its own .
Dade County is being caught in the middle of something and we are being victimized .
" Quit playing like a bunch of kids and get us aid !
Sort out your political games afterward ! "
On the same day Hale made the desperate plea , Miami Herald staff writers Martin Merzer and Tom Fiedler wrote :
The question echoed through the debris Thursday :
If we can do it for Bangladesh , for the Philippines , for the Kurds of northern Iraq , why in God 's name can't we deliver basic necessities of life to the ravaged population of our own Gold Coast ? "
The short answer : because no single person or agency is in charge .
The result : a planeload of food and equipment is still a rarity .
Instead of delivering goods , helicopter pilots shuttle government officials who just sit idle .
Metro police turn away individuals trying to bring in food or water to a barren South Dade .
On August 29 , 1992 , six days into the aftermath , the Miami Herald reported :
Problems Plague Red Cross .
The man on the phone wanted to donate 100 electric generators , extension cords and enough tools to build a small subdivision .
But the operator who took his call at the Red Cross Command Center in Miami had no idea what to do with the offer .
" We get a call , we take a message , we give it to somebody who signs it to somebody else , " said the operator , Melitta de Liefd .
" We have no idea what happens to it .
The whole place is being run by senior citizens and college kids . "
Welcome to Red Cross headquarters -- where the brains of Dade County rescue effort have been knocked almost unconscious most of the week .
Callers offering services and supplies are put on hold .
Others can't get through at all .
The hurt and suffering plead for help over ham radio .
On August 29 , 1992 , one week after hurricane Andrew struck , the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel reported 250,000 people homeless in South Dade .
A NUCLEAR INCIDENT
Of course , the rather " insignificant " incident resulting from Andrew 's winds bombarding the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant was not aired by the news media either nationally or abroad .
Tom Dubocq reported in the Miami Herald of September 5 , 1992 :
Demolition crews toppled a 400 - foot smokestack at Turkey Point [ Nuclear ] Power Plant [ owned by Florida Power and Light Company ] , Friday [ September 4 ] .
The stack , which had a gaping 200 - foot crack , was dropped without a hitch , a Florida Power and Light [ FPL ] spokesman said .
The other smokestack at the plant will be salvaged .
Turkey Point will be shut down for several months while repairs are made .
The cost will exceed $ 90 million , according to an initial damage report É
When Turkey Point was built in the 1960s , its main structures were designed to withstand 235 mph winds .
Hurricane Andrew was clocked at 164 mph at the plant .
FPL officials do n't know why the smokestack did n't hold up ...
One hundred million dollars worth of damage resulted from the nuclear power plant 's smokestack having been cracked wide open .
The plant is situated approximately 15 miles northeast of where I lived .
How well I recall the leaflets circulated several months before Andrew struck , advising all residents within a " thirty - five mile radius " of Turkey Point nuclear plant to be aware of the potential hazards involved if an event such as a natural disaster or unexpected catastrophe happened .
Such a grim reminder of the Chernobyl tragedy .
Could it be more than coincidence that within 24 hours of hurricane Andrew ending , all 12 survivors in my little group , including our animals , broke out in big , raw , oozing sores which itched and burned at the same time ?
We suffered horrible headaches which made us so nauseous we had the dry heaves , and our stomachs cramped badly from sudden onsets of diarrhoea .
These symptoms lasted well over three months .
Within a relatively short period of time , each one of our surviving animals died from cancer .
HURRICANE BUREAU'S FAILURE TO WARN
Speaking of coincidence , I often wonder what kind of a coincidence it is that the National Hurricane Bureau is responsible for reporting to the US Department of Commerce -- especially considering that during 1992 South Florida did $ 31 billion worth of trade in tourism .
Hurricane Andrew had barely left Florida , heading for Louisiana , when the Division of Tourism placed a $ 47,000 advertisement in USA Today , reading " Florida , we 're still open " .
" Most people have very short memories .
We 're all sort of banking on that , " said Donal Dermody , Director of the Nova University Center for Hospitality Management .
Kind of puts a big damper on belief in the human race : hide the truth , ignore the suffering , do it for a dollar !
What upsets me most is the incident that happened during the late afternoon hours just prior to Andrew striking .
I had just walked out to the garbage dumpsters , located by the parking lot , to throw away some garbage .
I turned to head back to the apartment when the horn of an oncoming car began blasting away .
I looked up to see a familiar resident , whom I had spoken to on many different occasions , heading directly towards me .
This particular individual worked at Metrozoo .
Being affiliated with wild animals , he frequently stopped by to ask me questions about the behaviour of certain species .
He sped right up to me and then slammed on the brakes .
" Come here ! " he whispered excitedly .
I leaned down close to him .
" What 's the matter ? "
" Listen ! " he paused to look around nervously .
" You 've got to get the hell outta here now ! "
" Why ? " I asked , puzzled by his behaviour .
" I have n't got time to explain , " he whispered .
" But I just came from the National Hurricane Bureau in the Gables .
Gotta friend of mine who works over there ; bigwig -- know what I mean ? "
" Yeah ... " I nodded .
" Well , this is n't for public information , if you get my drift , " he went on rapidly .
" But the National Hurricane Bureau has known all along that hurricane Andrew is going to slam into South Dade !
They 're telling the public it 's going to come in at Palm Beach because they want Miami Beach evacuated , and there are n't enough shelters for South Dade residents to evacuate to .
They do n't wanna cause panic .
So they 're keeping quiet .
We 're all a bunch of god - damn sitting ducks !
You got to get the hell outta here !
This is a killer hurricane !
Nobody 's ever seen anything like this before ! "
" Holy shit ! " I exclaimed , shocked out of my mind .
" You mean Andrew 's coming over South Dade ? "
" Damn straight !
That 's exactly what I mean !
They figure the eye of the storm is coming right in over us !
Those fellas at the National Hurricane Bureau have known it all along !
I 'm gettin ' the hell outta here now !
Shit , man , this thing is a killer hurricane !
Listen , I gotta run !
Get your son and get the hell out now !
You ain't gonna have a shot in hell once it hits ! "
I ran into the apartment and called my son at work , begging him to come home so we could get out .
I had no reason to disbelieve anything I had just heard .
I knew my neighbour well enough to know he would n't fabricate anything like this .
So I related the entire conversation to my son , Eric .
He was stunned !
Eric said he would leave work within a few minutes , but as the minutes ticked on they dragged into hours .
Another immediate course of action I took after hearing the terrifying warning from my neighbour was to phone the local CBS television station located in Miami .
I called three separate times .
Each time , my call went directly into the local news broadcast room of meteorologist Bryan Norcross .
Although I never spoke to Norcross directly , I did manage to speak to three separate individuals working in the broadcast room .
I specifically stated : " I live in South Dade , adjacent to Metrozoo and within walking distance of Country Walk , in a pre-fab apartment that is constructed to withstand up to 90 mph winds .
Should I evacuate ? "
All three individuals advised and reassured me that I was situated in a safe area .
There definitely was n't need for me to take any evacuation measures .
Meanwhile , one work catastrophe after another seemed to crash down on my son , until finally it was just too late for us to evacuate .
By the time he got home it was almost midnight .
Within minutes of his arrival , Andrew slammed into us with full force .
ONGOING TRAGEDIES FROM THE COVER -UPS
It 's not easy dealing with the anguish I feel because of all the perpetrated lies .
So much suffering resulted .
It took three - and - a - half weeks before my son and I managed to escape the devastation on our own .
Homeless and penniless , with no insurance to cover our losses , we slowly made our way north towards Broward County , our only possessions being the clothes on our backs and a demolished van .
The long , agonising journey turned out to be another nightmare from hell .
Over 4,000 people were officially listed as " Missing " in Andrew when we parted South Dade .
I had lost 23 pounds during those wretched weeks of being trapped in the devastation and still had not received any medical attention .
Little did I realise it would take another three weeks before a doctor would even agree to see me without any money or identification .
By then , six weeks had passed since I had been injured .
Most of my teeth had turned a putrid grey colour because the nerves had died as a result of fierce blows to my head , complicated by my broken jaw .
The final heartbreak came when doctors discovered the optic nerve in both my eyes had begun to die off -- which meant , because of the head injuries , I was going blind .
This may sound strange but , regardless , it is the truth .
Today , in the year 2001 , there still remain three ongoing tragedies created by hurricane Andrew cover - ups -- tragedies which remain unbearable for the survivors to live with .
The first tragedy is the horrifying fact that the bodies of our loved ones were intentionally confiscated from us by our own government and then so inhumanely disposed of .
Without graves , or some kind of memorial erected in their memory , we have no hope of reaching closure .
The second tragedy is the impact the cover-ups had in downplaying , dismissing and ignoring our horrendous suffering .
And the third tragedy is the great number of Andrew survivors who were inevitably forced to join the ranks of approximately 10 million other homeless Americans struggling to stay alive on the streets .
With 10 million Americans homeless , and another 32 million Americans going to sleep hungry each night , the United States Government can't truthfully claim to be a government for all the people .
Maybe it 's just me , but I honestly thought the world learned a lesson from the Nuremberg trials in Germany : " Evil can only be defined as absence of empathy ... "
SIMILARITIES IN TURKEY
On June 20 , 2000 , I flew to Istanbul , Turkey , where I lectured at a major international conference .
While visiting there , I was asked if there was anything I specifically wished to do or see .
My simple answer came very naturally .
" Yes , I would like to visit the areas that were devastated by the earthquakes last August and November and spend time with the survivors . "
The following day my simple wish was granted .
I was graciously escorted by a medical doctor who had unselfishly devoted many hours of practice in the devastated regions .
When he informed me that 20,000 + died in August 1999 during the Izmit earthquake and that another 20,000 + died in November during the Bolu earthquake , I was stunned .
This was not what the news media had reported .
" Are you saying that between the two earthquakes last year , over 40,000 people died ? " I asked .
His eyes filled with tears .
" Yes , " he nodded sadly .
" Over 40,000 people perished , between the two disasters . "
The horrendous destruction I saw matched every word he stated .
I walked over areas where the earth had opened up , swallowing entire buildings before closing back up again , like a giant white shark gulping down its prey .
I understood when weeping survivors squeezed my hand tightly , too overcome by grief to explain how they never found the bodies of their loved ones .
Long pauses of silence took over when tears replaced words .
The poverty I witnessed was too startling to escape my poorly sighted eyes .
Pathetic cardboard - type huts , covered by plastic sheets , greeted me everywhere I went .
Then there were the bleak rows of government - funded temporary housing which lacked simple basic needs like indoor private showers .
I often wonder , now that I 've returned back home , how those Turkish survivors weathered the 115° temperatures of July , since their temporary housing lacked proper insulation and air - conditioning .
As the month of August began to unfold , torrential rains bombarded the country , bringing a new kind of disaster : flash flooding .
How many lives were lost to this disaster ?
The most pathetic survivors of all are children .
Like many of the children who survived hurricane Andrew , many Turkish children whom I saw who could no longer smile or play .
Shell - shock has very pronounced effects on the young ; often , they stop communicating altogether .
One little girl in particular caught my attention .
Her arm had been badly injured , twisted into a permanent position of deformity .
She stood very still , holding her hair in her good hand , never moving or showing any signs of emotion .
" She needs medical attention , " I said to the doctor .
" Yes , " he agreed , " a lot of the young survivors desperately need medical attention . "
His answer puzzled me .
" But I thought financial aid was donated from foreign countries . "
" Yes , " he nodded , " but most of the money ended up in the pockets of government officials .
It never reached the survivors . "
How well I knew what that meant .
How well indeed .
After pausing , he added , " When the earthquakes struck , one foreign country offered to construct a hospital at the devastated site .
But because of political differences , our government refused the offer . "
I left the Turkish people , wondering : what kind of future is man creating for himself ?
Only one thought came to mind : " Evil can only be defined as absence of empathy ... "

Obama building war machine to respond to ' Swift Boat ' attacks John Byrne

This " He 's not going to sit there and sing ' Kumbaya ' as the missiles are raining in , " David Axelrod , Obama 's chief strategist , tells Newsweek for its Apr. 28 issue .
" I do n't think people should mistake civility for a willingness to deal with the challenges to come . "
The Obama campaign is planning to expand its research and rapid - response outfit to repel planned " Swift - Boat " like attacks , the magazine will report .
The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth tooled spurious stories and message points against Sen. John Kerry in 2004 .
Obama continues to face heat over his ties to indicted Chicago real estate developer Antoin Rezko .
More important in the present , perhaps , are messages from the Clinton campaign that he's not electable because he has n't been tested by Republican attacks .
There are signs that Swift - Boat - like agents are on the horizon .
" Operatives such as David Bossie , whose Citizens United group made the Willie Horton ad that helped sink Michael Dukakis 's 1988 presidential bid , are sharpening knives as expectations mount that Obama will be their target in the fall , " Newsweek 's Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff write .
" Bossie says he is assembling material for TV spots about Obama 's ties with Ayers , a Chicago professor and unrepentant former member of the Weather Underground , a group that bombed several government buildings to protest the Vietnam War . "
The issue received prominent treatment in last week 's ABC debate .
Obama served on a nonprofit with Ayers and attended a campaign event at the professor 's house in 1995 .
Ayers dismisses the link -- at a dinner party , the magazine will report , " Ayers ' ridiculed ' the notion that Obama shared his left - wing views : " He thought the idea that there was a political connection between them was absurd . ' "
Obama , meanwhile , faces concerns on his other flank regarding the trial of Chicago real estate developer Antoin Rezko .
A witness testified that Obama had met with an Iraqi mogul convicted of fraud in France who had been barred from entering the United States .
Rezko is said to have sought the help of unnamed Illinois officials to help lobby on Auchi 's behalf .
An Obama spokesman says he neither recalls the event or ever meeting Auchi .
Strategists -- who are also Clinton supporters -- continue to use the Swift Boat meme against Obama .
On Saturday , the communications director for the International Association of Machninists and Aerospace Workers -- a Clinton - backing union -- sent an " urgent memo " aiming to get more voters to pay attention to Obama 's Ayers connection .
With the title " What Is Rove Up To ? , " Sloan asserts Rove will try to hijack Obama 's slogan " Change We Can Believe In " and brand it as " revolutionary change , change driven by an alien ideology , change no patriotic American could stomach .
And he intends to do so by channeling Sen. Joseph McCarthy . "
The memo was acquired by ABC .
" The IAMAW endorsed Clinton last year , and Sloan is an avid Clinton supporter , " ABC adds .
" The document makes no mention of Sloan 's position with the union , and he told ABC News he sent it as a private citizen , not in his role as a spokesman for the union . "
At the same time , supporters of Hillary Clinton have taken umbrage at reports and comments that focus on the New York senator 's hairstyle and clothing — in their view implying that because she is a woman , she should not be taken seriously as a potential president .
Many who back Barack Obama are still angry at what they saw as former President Bill Clinton 's efforts to minimize Obama 's victory in the South Carolina primary by comparing the Illinois senator with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , who twice won the same primary ( in 1984 and 1988 ) but never was considered a front - runner .
There 's been an understandable focus on bias in this year 's race for the Democratic presidential nomination , with the two remaining contenders vying to become either the first woman or the first African American to head a major - party ticket for the White House .
... on " Fox News Sunday " by Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , who is supporting Obama , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , who is backing Clinton .
" We have two extremely , extraordinarily qualified candidates , and either one of them will make history as the first African American president or the first woman president of the United States .
And both of them have faced discrimination in the course of their personal and political lives , " Durbin told host Chris Wallace .
" In terms of whether Sen . Clinton has faced some bias because she 's a woman , of course she has .
All of us who have worked hard to bring women into politics — and Dianne knows this personally — know the struggle that they faced even with other women in convincing people of their fitness .
" But secondly , understand that African Americans have also faced many , many burdens and obstacles , and Barack Obama has been facing that during the course of this campaign .
Some of the rumors — and I know Dianne is well aware of them , we 've talked about them on the Senate floor — about Sen .
Obama are vicious and negative and totally false .
And they are abounding across the Internet .
Many of them leak into some of these reports and the like , these blogs , and even journalism that should be more discerning . "
For her part , Feinstein said flat - out that there is gender bias in the Democratic campaign :
" I read a lot of newspapers .
I read a lot of columns .
I 'm amazed at the number that are spent on really picayune things about Sen. Clinton — her hair , her suits , " Feinstein said .
" And I think some of this just drives toward the insecurity of having a woman running for this office .
If anyone is qualified to run for this office , Chris , Sen. Clinton is — eight years in the White House .
Sure , it 's first lady .
I know that .
" You know Hillary .
You know her interest in policy .
You know her care and concern about people .
And most important right now , I think it 's the economy and her knowledge of what 's happened to the middle class in the last eight years and how you mend that and bring people up into becoming economically upwardly mobile .
" That 's what we should be talking about , instead of — I read a lot of stuff which is really irrelevant to the kind of president she will be , and I think some of it is driven by the fact that it 's easy to hit at a woman . "
Clinton herself addressed the gender issue during a campaign appearance in Akron , Ohio , on Sunday afternoon , highlighting the support she has received from ( male ) generals , including retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark , the former NATO commander .
" I know we 've never hired a woman for this job before , and I know for some people that 's still a question mark , " she said , wrapping up her stump speech in a packed gymnasium at Garfield High School .
But , she continued , " why would [ the generals ] be supporting me unless they had concluded that I was the best person for the job ? "
— Leslie Hoffecker
I see this question posted with some regularity in the many personals sections on the internet and what not , so I thought I 'd take a minute to explain things to the ladies out there that have n't figured it out quite yet .
What happened to all the nice guys ?
The answer is simple : You did .
See , if you think back , really hard , you might vaguely remember a platonic guy pal who always seemed to want to spend time with you .
He 'd tag along with you when you went shopping , stop by your place for a movie when you were lonely but did n't feel like going out , or even sit there and hold you while you sobbed and told him about how horribly the ( other ) guy that you were f*** ing treated you .
See , if you think back , really hard , you might vaguely remember a platonic guy pal who always seemed to want to spend time with you .
At the time , you probably joked with your girlfriends about how he was a little puppy dog , always following you around , trying to do things to get you to pay attention to him .
They probably teased you because they thought he had a crush on you .
Given that his behavior was , admittedly , a little pathetic , you vehemently denied having any romantic feelings for him , and buttressed your position by claiming that you were " just friends . "
Besides , he totally was n't your type .
I mean , he was a little too short , or too bald , or too fat , or too poor , or did n't know how to dress himself , or basically be or do any of the things that your tall , good - looking , fit , rich , stylish boyfriend at the time pulled off with such ease .
Eventually , your Platonic buddy drifted away , as your relationship with the boyfriend got more serious and spending time with this other guy was , admittedly , a little weird , if you were n't dating him .
More time passed , and the boyfriend eventually cheated on you , or became boring , or you realized that the things that attracted you to him were n't the kinds of things that make for a good , long - term relationship .
So , now , you 're single again , and after having tried the bar scene for several months having only encountered players and douche bags , you wonder , " What happened to all the nice guys ? "
Well , once again , you did .
You ignored the nice guy .
You used him for emotional intimacy without reciprocating , in kind , with physical intimacy .
You laughed at his consideration and resented his devotion .
You valued the aloof boyfriend more than the attentive " just - a - " friend .
Eventually , he took the hint and moved on with his life .
He probably came to realize , one day , that women are n't really attracted to guys who hold doors open ; or make dinners just because ; or buy you a Christmas gift that you mentioned , in passing , that you really wanted five months ago ; or listen when you 're upset ; or hold you when you cry .
He came to realize that , if he wanted a woman like you , he'd have to act more like the boyfriend that you had .
He probably cleaned up his look , started making some money , and generally acted like more of an asshole than he ever wanted to be .
Fact is , now , he 's probably getting laid , and in a way , your ultimate rejection of him is to thank for that .
And I 'm sorry that it took the complete absence of " nice guys " in your life for you to realize that you missed them and wanted them .
Most women will only have a handful of nice guys stumble into their lives , if that .
So , if you 're looking for a nice guy , here 's what you do :
1. ) Build a time machine .
2. ) Go back a few years and pull your head out of your ass .
3. ) Take a look at what 's right in front of you and grab a hold of it .
I suppose the other possibility is that you STILL do n't really want a nice guy , but you feel the social pressure to at least appear to have matured beyond your infantile taste in men .
In which case , you might be in luck , because the nice guy you claim to want has , in reality , shed his nice guy mantle and is out there looking to unleash his cynicism and resentment onto someone just like you .
If you were five years younger .
So , please : Either stop misrepresenting what you want , or own up to the fact that you 've f** *ed yourself over .
You 're getting older , after all .
It 's time to excise the bullshit and deal with reality .
You did n't want a nice guy then , and he certainly does n't want you , now .
Radio Reg Based on the rather insane number of messages I 've received over the last couple of weeks , you guys really , really wanted part two of our interview with Steve Usdin , author of Engineering Communism .
Well , here it is .
Episode 16 of Semi-Coherent Computing picks up where we last left off with the tale of two Americans who became spies for the Soviets and then helped create the Soviet version of Silicon Valley .
If you missed the first show , check it out here .
The first run proved one of our most popular episodes of SCC to date with the downloads now heading toward the 7,000 mark .
We also managed to clear out all of Amazon 's Engineering Communism stock in the US and UK .
Thanks , as always , for your interest .
In this show , we get a bit more of a personal touch .
Steve talks about his views on Joel Barr and what the man was really like in person .
In addition , we learn more about Barr 's impressive love life , his counter - culture party house in Leningrad and his min-fab invention , which let you produce small amounts of ASICs via a desktop machine .
Funny enough , Barr actually returned to the US after decades of work for the Soviets and obtained a US passport .
He even started receiving Social Security payments , which will make you all feel really good .
So , on we go with Barr 's story .

Bush Claims More Powers Than King George III
MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL OF LAW AT ANDOVER
Bush Claims More Powers Than King George III ,
Constitutional Scholar David Adler Contends
The Bush administration has arrogated powers to itself that the British people even refused to grant King George III at the time of the Revolutionary War , an eminent political scientist says .
“ No executive in the history of the Anglo - American world since the Civil War in England in the 17th century has laid claim to such broad power , ” said David Adler , a prolific author of articles on the U.S. Constitution .
“ George Bush has exceeded the claims of Oliver Cromwell who anointed himself Lord Protector of England . ”
Adler , a professor of political science at Idaho State University at Pocatello , is the author of “ The Constitution and the Termination of Treaties ” ( Taylor & Francis ) , among other books , and some 100 scholarly articles in his field .
Adler made his comments comparing the powers of President Bush and King George III at a conference on “ Presidential Power in America ” at the Massachusetts School of Law , Andover , April 26th .
Adler said , Bush has “ claimed the authority to suspend the Geneva Convention , to terminate treaties , to seize American citizens from the streets to detain them indefinitely without benefit of legal counseling , without benefit of judicial review .
He has ordered a domestic surveillance program which violates the statutory law of the United States as well as the Fourth Amendment . ”
Adler said the authors of the U.S. Constitution wrote that the president “ shall take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land ” because “ the king of England possessed a suspending power ” to set aside laws with which he disagreed , “ the very same kind of power that the Bush Administration has claimed . ”
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez , Adler said , repeatedly referred to the President ’s “ override ” authority , “ which effectively meant that the Bush Administration was claiming on behalf of President Bush a power that the English people themselves had rejected by the time of the framing of the Constitution . ”
Adler said the Framers sought an “ Administrator in Chief ” that would execute the will of Congress and the Framers understood that the President , as Commander - in - Chief “ was subordinate to Congress . ”
The very C - in - C concept , the historian said , derived from the British , who conferred it on one of their battlefield commanders in a war on Scotland in 1639 and it “ did not carry with it the power over war and peace ” or “ authority to conduct foreign policy or to formulate foreign policy . ”
That the C - in- C was subordinate to the will of Congress was demonstrated in the Revolutionary War when George Washington , granted that title by Congress , “ was ordered punctually to respond to instructions and directions by Congress and the dutiful Washington did that , ” Adler said .
Adler said that John Yoo , formerly of the Office of Legal Counsel , wrote in 2003 that the President as C - in - C could authorize the CIA or other intelligence agencies to resort to torture to extract information from suspects based on his authority .
However , Adler said , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1804 in Little vs. Barreme affirmed the President is duty - bound to obey statutory instructions and reaffirmed opinion two years later in United States vs. Smith .
“ In these last eight years , ” Adler said , “ we have seen presidential powers soar beyond the confines of the Constitution .
We have understood that his presidency bears no resemblance to the Office created by the Framers …
This is the time for us to demand a return to the constitutional presidency .
If we do n’t , we will have only ourselves to blame as we go marching into the next war as we witness even greater claims of presidential power . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Air Force on Friday announced one of the largest military acquisition programs in U.S. history , saying the service had chosen Northrop Grumman over Boeing to replace its aging air refueling tanker fleet .
A KC - 135 Stratotanker prepares to refuel a B - 2 over the Pacific Ocean in an undated photo .
" We look forward to partnering with them as we continue to defend our great nation in the future , " said Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne .
The announcement was a surprise to many in the business industry who expected Boeing to be favored over the company , which will use a European company 's airframe , Airbus , for the tanker .
The $ 40 billion deal to start replacing 179 tankers -- known as the KC - 45A program -- will expand to over $ 100 billion to replace the entire fleet of almost 500 planes , Pentagon officials said .
Boeing proposed a tanker based on its 767 commercial airliner , while Northrop -- working with Boeing arch-rival Airbus and its parent company , European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ( EADS ) -- offered a model based on the Airbus A330 airliner , which is larger than the 767 .
To sweeten the deal , EADS announced it would put a plane assembly plant in Mobile , Alabama , if the company won the contract .
Boeing , a U.S. company , builds planes in the state of Washington .
" We had two very competitive offers in this competition , " said Sue Payton , assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition , briefing reporters after Wynne made the announcement .
" Northrop Grumman clearly provided the best value to the government . "
Payton said " debriefings " were planned for both competitors , and declined to say where Boeing 's offer fell short until after that happens , sometime on or after March 12 .
" We owe it to Boeing to give them the first debrief on this , " she said .
The Air Force has been trying since 2001 to replace the tanker fleet , which has some planes close to 50 years old , according to Air Force statistics .
The average age of the fleet is more than 24 years , while the average age of a U.S. commercial airline fleet is just over nine years , according to Air Force officials .
It will take several years to get the new KC - 45 flying , said Gen. Arthur Lichte , commander of Air Mobility Command .
" We hope that we 'll get the first aircraft into the test program beginning in 2010 .
And we 're hoping that the first capability operationally will be about 2013 , " he said .
Lichte went on to explain the benefits of the new planes .
" From my perspective , I can sum it up in one word , ' more ' .
More passengers , more cargo , more fuel to off - load , more patients that we can carry , more availability , more flexibility and more dependability , " he said , comparing the new tankers to the current fleet .
Explainer : How planes refuel at high altitudes »
But one lawmaker called the decision to award the contract to Northrop Grumman a blow to the American defense industry and an economic boon for European countries .
" These are the same European governments who are unwilling to support us in the global war on terror and over the last few months refused to provide even an additional 100 soldiers apiece for Afghanistan operations , " said Rep. Duncan Hunter , R - California .
" Instead , we have to send 3,200 additional U.S. Marines to Afghanistan while they take $ 35 billion in American taxpayer contracts . "
The contract to replace the aging fleet of air refueling tankers was mired in corruption and political wrangling for years .
In 2004 , Congress , led by Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , banned the Air Force from working out a lease and purchase deal with Boeing after a federal investigation uncovered improprieties at the highest levels of the Air Force procurement process .
Critics also complained that Boeing was awarded the contract without competition and that the deal was a bailout for the 767 program , which was facing slumping sales .
Congress forced the Air Force to start a new contract bidding plan that allowed Airbus to compete for the contract .
Pentagon officials said the losing company could protest and ask the Government Accountability Office to investigate the decision , which would delay the program again .
Although the deal announced Friday is one of the largest U.S. military contracts in history , it falls short of the Army 's recent $ 200 billion Future Combat System program and the Pentagon 's future F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program , expected to be over $ 200 billion .

James Gosling氏に敬意を表したい。彼は、より良いツールがあるにもかかわらず、開発時のニーズを満たすためと称してEmacsを使い続ける開発者らに引導を渡してくれた。
Builder AUの編集者であ るChris Duckettが、Javaの生みの親であり、Emacsの開発にも携わったことのあるJames Gosling氏にインタビューを行っている。同氏のEmacsに対する思いは、このエディタを日々の作業で使い続けている人々の熱い想いほどには強くないようである。以下の発言は、Emacsを熱狂的に支持する人々の強い反感を買うことになるに違いない。
あー 、Emacsね。あれは1978年頃のアイデアとしてはとても素晴らしいものだったよ。何年前になるかな？30年前？みんな、もういい加減使うのをやめたらどうだ。30年前と言えば、ムーアの法則が少なくとも15回は適用できることになる。2の15乗倍ものCPU性能があれば、もっと違うやり方ができるはずだ。NetBeansを試してみることを強く勧めるね。セマンティックスをリアルタイムで解釈してくれるプラットフォームを使い、キーストロークを逐次分析させることで、素晴らしい魔法のようなことができるようになるんだよ。だから、Emacsのことなど忘れてしまった方がいい。もうテレタイプなんて使っていないんだろう--それってあまり頭の良いことじゃない。とにかくEmacsを使うのはやめた方がいい。
もちろん、われわれ はGosling氏がSunのNetBeansを推していることは知っている。とは言うものの同氏のこの発言は、NetBeansをEclipseに置き換えても通用する。なお上記の発言は、Club Builderのこのビデオ（後半部分）で視聴することができる。

Americans discouraged by higher gas prices and airline fares may decide to spend more vacation time at home , perhaps watching television .
But that , too , will cost them more than ever .
Cable prices have risen 77 percent since 1996 , roughly double the rate of inflation , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this month .
Cable customers , who typically pay at least $ 60 a month , watch only a fraction of what they pay for  on average , a mere 13 percent of the 118 channels available to them .
And the number of subscribers keeps growing .
The resiliency of cable is all the more remarkable because the Internet was supposed to change all things digital .
Technology has led to more choices and lower prices for news and music as well as cellphone and landline minutes  not to mention computers , cameras , music players and phones themselves .
A reader writes , " In preparation for the release of his newest book The Word of God , respected New Wave SF writer Thomas M. Disch ( The Brave Little Toaster , Camp Concentration ) has revealed himself to be God and is now taking questions from the faithful at his blog . "
Dear G_d : Could you clarify the order of Creation ?
There are two different lists in Genesis , and people have died over interpretation .
Please guide your humble flock .
PS : What did you do on the 8th Day ?
The Aardvarks came first .
Then the others , in alphabetical order .
Except some of the really cute ones , like the panda , wheedled their way to the head of the line .
And the zebra just stood there feeling this would be his lucky day .

Because of experiences like this one ( and my email in - tray is now full of them ) :
I drove for two hours yesterday to Bangor with my sister and daughter to see Barack speak in Maine .
I figured it would be interesting to see a candidate speak , when Maine is typically forgotten .
We made the mistake of getting there about an hour before the doors opened to the Bangor Auditorium , as the population of the city had increased by a third for his speech .
We waited in the longest line I had ever seen in my life for almost two hours .
We met some wonderful people , many younger and surprisingly many quite a bit older .
After all of that waiting , we were only a few hundred feet from the auditorium when we were told that the main room had filled to capacity as well as the overflow room .
Just when we were ready to turn back , we were told that Barack would speak to us outside , and would do so FIRST .
So imagine a scene like the stump speeches only read about in books , people jostling on snowbanks , climbing fences , trees , even each other in the calm cold that was Maine yesterday to hear and see Barack , for only a few minutes .
And did he deliver .
There was excitement , there was hope , and there were specifics .

What is MacHeads The Movie about ?
This macheads ’ movie Actually is a documentary that lasts one hour .
It talks about the Macintosh fan community , mac heads , it features interviews with former employees of Apple , a fair bunch of fanatics who got really emotional when explaining how Mac changed their lives and also industry commentators .
The mac head community is known as fanboyz or macheads ( a group that is integrated by nerds , science geeks , professionals and average people )
The Film also tells the story of Steve Jacobs , who in 1997 , exposed the first iMac .
It was premiered at Macworld Expo in 2009 .
It studies the Mac , iPhone and Apple products cult and at the same time it explores the community that seems to be supportive and that continues growing .
The film mentions how these products came along and changed everything , some groups started using the Macintosh and before you know it , it was popular all over the world , yet a Mac global community was already formed .
These products are a global phenomena and it is not anymore about a necessity but an obsession , specially for the mac head community
One of the question that was asked to Mac users was , “ how has the Mac changed your life ? ”
Some of the people in the documentary are unusual .
Some of them even pray to Steve Jobs .
Then , more than one mac head was asked about the object of his affection , whether if it is for Apple or for the community .
This documentary is full of outrageous characters who will make you laugh and it will make you think through about the products mentioned in it .
Many fans are devoted to Mac products because they feel that it makes their lives easier and at some point even better .
Some of them have been called “ Mac addicts ” however they disagree with that and feel it ’s not fair that just for expressing their appreciation for the product it makes them addicts

Blocked brain enzyme decreases appetite and promotes weight loss
“ We believe we have identified an important drug development target that could potentially turn into a metabolic triple play : appetite control , weight loss and blood sugar management , “ said Means , who is the Nanaline H. Duke Professor and Chairman of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology .
For many years , scientists have been identifying and testing every step of the appetite stimulation and suppression pathways in search of a target .
Such research is considered critical to finding ways for people to better control their weight and minimize their risk of developing diabetes , heart disease and other health conditions .
Activation of the enzyme CaMKK2 is just one step in the appetite stimulation pathway located in the hypothalamus section of the brain .
An empty stomach releases the hormone ghrelin , which launches a cascade of signals that ultimately results in increased appetite .
Means and colleagues believed that CaMKK2 in the ghrelin pathway might be a likely candidate for study , because it activates AMPK , an enzyme that stimulates animals to eat and gain weight .
They tested their theory in several ways , the results of which are published in the May issue of Cell Metabolism .
The work was funded by NIH grants , as well as by the Australian Research Council , National Heart Foundation , and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia .
First they blocked CaMKK2 in mice with a specialized molecule inhibitor and then measured food intake .
These mice ate significantly less food than untreated mice during the six days in which they were evaluated , and also lost body weight , which led the scientists to think they might be on to something .
Next they studied a group of mice that normally do not make CaMKK2 and found that the molecule inhibitor did not change feeding behavior or reduce weight .
“ The fact that blocking CaMKK2 worked in normal mice to make them eat less and lose weight , but not in mice missing the enzyme , provides compelling evidence that CaMKK2 signaling is a requirement for appetite control , ” Means said .
They also studied both normal mice and mice missing CaMKK2 to learn how these types responded to low - fat and high - fat diets .
After nearly 30 weeks on the specific diets , the normal mice on the high - fat diet became diabetic – they were unable to respond to insulin and were n’t able to manage blood sugar levels well .
In contrast , the normal mice on a low - fat diet stayed healthy .
In mice missing CaMKK2 , the scientists found that they stayed healthy regardless of whether they were on a low - fat or high - fat diet .
The CAMKK2 - negative mice apparently were protected from changes that lead to diabetes in a high - fat diet .
“ Remarkably , we find that blocking CaMKK2 in the brain prevents the deposits of fat in liver and skeletal muscle that are characteristic of obese , diabetic patients , ” Means said .
“ We find this very exciting and are trying to understand the mechanism responsible for this protective effect , as well as to identify more potent drugs to inhibit CaMKK2 . ”
It was , if you think about it , only a matter of time .
La Petite Anglaise , the Washingtonienne , Belle De Jour and the myriad other female blog sensations - for years women have been sharing their most intimate thoughts on the pursuit of love and the complications of longterm relationships , first online , and later ( thanks to the lucrative deals many of them subsequently landed ) in high - profile paperbacks .
So yes , it was inevitable that , sooner or later , their male equivalents would want a chunk of the action .
Who knew that modern man was so hostile ?
Or so angry ?
Or so utterly obsessed by sex ?
Meet the E Bachelors .
The men who purport to offer the definitive insight into the psyche of the post - modern , single male .
Through their blogs , their YouTube contributions and their lecture tours , they disseminate a bleak vision of contemporary masculinity .
Bitter , sex - obsessed , borderline misogynistic , really very depressing , they 're the new hot properties on the literary scene where they are commanding the kind of book deals that the girl bloggers of five minutes ago can now only dream about .
The question is , are the E Bachelors for real ?
Are their feminist - baiting , body - fascistic , terminally - faithless and hyper - sexual memoirs serious signs of the zeitgeist ?
Or are they sensationalist exaggerations of minority attitudes , designed to generate as much controversy as they possibly can ?
Spearheading the vanguard of E Bachelorhood is Eric Schaeffer , the 45 - year - old writer and film director whose book and blog about his quest to find a wife , I Can't Believe I 'm Still Single , has been so contentious - and compelling - it has become a staple of Manhattan gossip columns and fought over on Amazon .
In London the novelist Nirpal Dhaliwal is heading the charge with a stream of articles outlining his idiosyncratic disgust at the wussiness of 21st - century man .
Another strident American voice is Chad Kultgen , who says he wrote his bleak novel Average American Male to counter ' the accepted image of the Average American man as ... an oafish retard happy to swallow down gallons of his significant other 's crap in the hopes of being allowed to have sex with her once a week or at least watch some football . '
And last but not least is the ex-lawyer Tucker Max 's account of life as a self - proclaimed womanising ' dickhead ' in I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell .
' My name is Tucker Max , and I am an asshole , ' the introduction begins .
' I get excessively drunk at inappropriate times , disregard social norms , indulge every whim , ignore the consequences of my actions , mock idiots and posers and sleep with more women than is safe or reasonable .
But I do contribute to humanity in one very important way : I share my adventures with the world . '
While that may be debatable , it is the divorcing Dhaliwal who is making waves this side of the Atlantic with his scathing views on the failure of feminism and the urgent need for men to fight back against ball - breaking women .
Since the publication of his first novel Tourism he has detailed his infidelities and intimate feelings about his marriage - in itself dissected by his wife Liz Jones in a column - in a stream of blunt first - person pieces .
' My wife threw me out after discovering I 'd been cheating on her .
On the night we got back together , I made strong , passionate love to her , ' he wrote last year .
' At the height of her passion , I asked her : " Who 's the boss ? "
Initially she would n't give me a reply , but I enticed it from her .
" You are , " she finally gasped . '
While the first generation of female bloggers could at least agree they wanted to find love , the E Bachelors seem to share a quite different proposition : that women are difficult , dominating and dangerous , and should be avoided .
Dhaliwal , 33 , for instance , is adamant that modern men should snatch back the upper hand .
' They hold their tongues for fear of being misinterpreted as sexist ; they constantly attempt to second - guess their partner in order to avoid giving offence , ' he lamented of modern men last year .
' This backfiring feminist conspiracy has , of course , developed hand - in - hand with the march of raging political correctness in Britain .
The two have combined to explode in the faces of a generation of women . '
Kultgen , an LA - based scriptwriter who launched Average American Male with a viral marketing campaign on YouTube called What Men Really
Think , offers a similarly take - no - prisoners point of view .
' The unnamed narrator of Average American Male ... unabashedly reveals every thought that goes through his head , from his sexual fantasies involving his annoying girlfriend and other women he encounters , and his masturbation sessions while watching porn , ' he explains on his website .
' Our narrator suffers through a relationship with his fat - assed girlfriend until he finds the perfect girl .
But when he moves into the new relationship , he slowly learns that all women are pretty much the same , that man 's true desires will never be fulfilled , and the decision between living alone or biting the marriage bullet must be made . '
This , it seems , is the bleak choice these 21st - century bachelors see themselves as facing .
Schaeffer is the poster boy for these alienated , sex - obsessed creatures .
He documents with alarming honesty his quest to find a wife , along with the minutiae of the rest of his life : his preference for spending Sundays masturbating , his penchant for dominatrix prostitutes , his loneliness , his passion for Jivamukti yoga , his binges on chocolate cake ( and the time he was caught eating it out of the communal trash by his building porter ) plus of course his brittle dates with women .
He lays bare his self - loathing , his drug - addicted past , childhood with an overwhelmed mother and suicidally depressed academic father , one - time relationship with Molly Ringwald and glory days in the mid-Nineties when he co-starred with Elle Macpherson in his movie If Lucy Fell and played basketball with George Clooney .
But if the undertow in his account , like all the others , is despair , there is also an alarming streak of anger and aggression .
Schaeffer is open about his fury when his girlfriend ' April ' , a fantastically successful 32 - year - old writer , refuses to cancel a dinner party to run off to Vermont with him at the end of their first date .
He describes how , when his girlfriend of two years , ' Liza ' , expresses doubts about getting engaged , he walks out and never sees her again .
Then there is the time he dispatches another girlfriend , ' Amy ' , because she does n't like the brownies he baked her on a date ( ' all I heard was my own silent internal question : " Should I jerk off or watch DVR'd American Idol after I give her 10 more minutes and she leaves ? "
She was history . ')
Women may find a strange fascination in reading about Schaeffer 's view on the upside of dating repressed girls , what he does with his long sessions with Mistress Fiera , the dominatrix prostitute , and what women do to make him hate them on dates .
On the other hand , you see why , in the minds of some New York women , Schaeffer has become the epitome of the worst stereotypes of the men ' out there ' : that they are commitment - phobic , misogynistic and riddled with unnerving hang - ups .
Gawker , the online Manhattan gossip column , was so disgusted by Schaeffer 's book it began referring to him as ' Eric I can't believe I 'm still single even though every other sentient life form on the planet can soooo believe you 're still single ' .
It invited accounts of dates with him from its readers .
( ' He is the nuttiest nutjob I 've ever met who lives in the deepest depths of denial that I have ever visited , ' emailed one . )
Nevertheless , it is obsessed by him , perhaps because his book is an almost perfect expression of the impasse of the Western world , taken , in the dating scene in Manhattan , to its final neurotic acme .
But in a final ironic twist , after reading Schaeffer 's frank accounts of clumsily trying to pick up women at his Jivamukti yoga classes , nerdishly attempting to bump himself up the popularity chart of the dating site Nerve.com , compulsively scrutinising every women he meets in case she is The One and asking searching dietary questions to waitresses - you begin to wonder if it is actually just satire and not true at all .
But when I meet Schaeffer in New York , I think again .
There is something about the intentness of his blue eyes that makes me believe he could be for real .
Something in the combination of cap , loose unflattering jeans and a cream woollen T - shirt .
His apologies for being ' two minutes late ' , the abrupt , disconcerting flits to the bathroom , dismay over the quality of the grapefruit he has been served and way he is checking me out - darting glances at my chest and legs and tossing in the odd question about my age and star sign and if I date interviewees ...
' Yes , it 's all true , ' he assures me .
He did n't exaggerate for comic effect ?
He shakes his head soberly .
Not even the cake - in - the - trash scene ?
' It 's so - I do n't have a lot of shame about how I live , ' he observes .
He crosses his legs , still staring intently at me .
' I feel very comfortable with myself .
Even in my imperfections .
" Imperfections " is a weird word .
It 's a judgment , and I do n't even want to judge that . '
I ask if he thinks writing about his sessions with prostitutes might put potential girlfriends off ?
' But for the average man , I have n't been with that many ! ' he protests .
But the ways he'd been with them and the fact that he wrote about them in such detail ?
' I might have explored with the dominatrixes in a way that a lot of men have n't , ' he concedes .
He does seem slightly embarrassed .
' But anyone who would be sketched out by that , we would n't have a compatible sensibility . '
Sexually ?
' Yes .
And it speaks to me as a repression . '
What 's frightening to me is the dark preoccupation with sex that runs through all the men's accounts - and the fact that they are so open about it .
' Being a man , being a healthy hot - blooded American male , who really loves sexual contact , going months and months without that can become lonely to me , ' Schaeffer argues .
Kultgen is equally unabashed .
' Is it relentlessly sexual ?
Yeah , that 's a fair assessment .
I never pass a woman on the street without thinking what it would be like to have sex with her . '
Is this the new face of 21st - century man ?
Or are they just finally ' fessing up to what was there all along ?
And what 's with the anger ?
Schaeffer is open about the violent tirades his dates trigger in his book .
( ' By now , after the fifth time in three hours that my stomach alarm had gone off telling me to run for the hills , I despised her .
She made me nauseous .
I literally wanted to vomit ...' ) '
' I can't tell if you like me , ' he exclaims , disconcerted , 'or you think I 'm awful !
Disagree with me , fine .
But do it in a way that 's helpful .
And smart and thoughtful .
Say , " My impression of Eric when we had lunch is I think he 's deluded " . '
He stares forlornly at his rotten grapefruit .
' I get overwhelming love mostly , ' he assures me .
' The people who write the mean things really do scurry in shadows . '
And he is very gracious in interview .
I do actually like him .
But what I do n't get about this poster boy for modern single male is his strange mixture of hostility towards women and the fact that he really , really wants to meet the Right One , ideally right now , on his six - week publicity tour of America for the book .
So can he believe he is still single ?
' You know I can 't , ' he says .
He 's absolutely serious .
Does he think people are ever single because of their own issues ?
' Oh , of course , there are people who are commitment phobic , people who have such issues with themselves that they are constantly sabotaging relationships .
But I 've spent many , many years both in therapy and living on a kind of , you know , spiritual path of meditation and yoga and self - reflection where every day I 'm spending time examining my behaviour on a historical , psycho - social level .
So ...'
So , I think I would fire his therapist .
But , if you have a bazillion dates with people and none of them work out , do n't you finally have to put your hand up and say , ' It 's actually me ' ?
' I do n't agree , ' he says .
' For instance , there was a girl that I met the other day , but she has a boyfriend , and there was something about this girl , we talked for about five minutes .
There was a way about her , a sparkle in her eye - it 's indescribable .
She 's not the most beautiful woman , but she 's got an energy and a spark .
I feel like I would marry this woman in a heartbeat if she was single . '
His memoir ends on a cliffhanger - having manipulated himself to the Number One man spot on Nerve.com with three days of finger - bruising clicking he gets a date with Nerve 's Number One girl , the gorgeous ' Taudry Hepburn ' .
Did they have the date ?
He nods , pulling down his cap .
' She was disappointing .
She was perfectly nice but did n't look so much like her pictures .
She was a little hard - edged .
She felt a little jaded .'
He leaves a big tip and we go onto the pavement where he dances around me , holding his umbrella over my head and talks hopefully about playing hookey .
I do think he 's actually rather sweet .
There is something really rather heroic about his dogged attempts to find a partner , so undaunted by his endless crashing and burning .
Still , all the same , I head back to my hotel .
I 've almost reached it when my BlackBerry 's light flashes .
I am not wholly surprised to find the new email is from him .
' Thanks again for coming to town and buying me that lovely grapefruit , ' he has written .
' Had you not been so sweet and charming , even in your not - so veiled moments of disagreement with my interpretation about certain events in my life , I might have had an even more sour taste in my mouth from the foul fruit .
But instead I only am left with a twinge of disappointment that you are A : going steady and B : employ a rule about not dating interviewees which rendered the possibility of dinner out of the question .
More post - modern man satire ?
Only you can decide .
But if A and B ever change let me know , and you can investigate your theory more closely .
It 'll be win / win .
Either you 'll be right and scoop the world or you 'll be wrong and maybe fall in like ... or more .
And would n't that be nice ? '
I 'm kind of wryly charmed .
Maybe , once you get past the prostitutes and the posturing , even with these tough guys , all you need is love .

Eva Wiseman
Spanish and UCL ( University College London ) scientists have discovered a possible terrestrial - type planet orbiting a star in the constellation of Leo .
The new planet , which lies at a distance of 30 light years from the Earth , has a mass five times that of our planet but is the smallest found to date .
One full day on the new planet would be equivalent to three weeks on Earth .
The team of astronomers from the Spanish Research Council ( CSIC ) working with Dr Jean - Philippe Beaulieu , a visiting astrophysicist at UCL , made the discovery from model predictions of a new exoplanet ( meaning planet outside our solar system ) orbiting a star in the constellation of Leo .
Simulations show that the exoplanet , dubbed GJ 436 c , orbits its host star ( GJ 436 ) in only 5.2 Earth days , and is thought to complete a revolution in 4.2 Earth days , compared to the Earth ’s revolution of 24 hours and full orbit of 365 days .
On Earth , a full day ( sunset to sunset ) coincides quite closely with the rotation period .
On the new planet these two periods do not coincide , since the orbital translation period and the rotation period are very similar .
For this reason , a full day on the new planet would take four planetary years , or roughly 22 Earth days .
The study , published this week in Astrophysical Journal , predicted the presence of a small exoplanet perturbing an inner planet ( already known ) , producing changes on its orbit .
A re-analysis of archival radial velocities also permitted the identification of a signal that perfectly matches the simulations and corresponds to a planet in resonance with the inner one , meaning that for every two orbits of the known planet the new planet completes one .
Ignasi Ribas , lead author of the study from CSIC , says : “ After final confirmation , the new exoplanet will be the smallest found to date .
It is the first one to be identified from the perturbations exerted on another planet of the system .
Because of this , the study opens a new path that should lead to the discovery of even smaller planets in the near future , with the goal of eventually finding worlds more and more similar to the Earth . ”
Dr Jean - Philippe Beaulieu , visiting astrophysicist at UCL Physics and Astronomy , says : “ This is the fourth super - Earth planet discovered .
This planet is the hot twin of the frozen super - Earth ( OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390 lb ) we discovered by microlensing two years ago .
Other previously discovered planets of this class are the two hot super - Earths Gl 581b and Gl 876d detected by their Doppler wobble . “
Dr Giovanna Tinetti , UCL Physics and Astronomy who recently calculated the putative properties of this planet , says : “ Calculations indicate that the temperature of the planet could be within 400 - 700 Kelvin [ 127-427 Celsius ] , but it could locally be as low as 350 K [ 77 C ] at the poles , depending on the type of atmosphere . ”
Most of the 280 or so planets discovered to date are gas giants similar to Jupiter , although some with masses below 10 times that of the Earth have already been found .
Planets with masses of between one and 10 times the Earth are often dubbed super - Earths .
In this case , current models predict that the new planet is a rocky type and has a radius some 50 per cent larger than the Earth .

Initially , artificial turf was used to imitate the real look of grass for sports that are traditionally played outside ; it came into the public eye in 1966 when it was installed in the Houston Astros ’ state of the art indoor stadium .
Throughout the next decade the use of artificial turf became more widespread in sporting arenas .
In recent years artificial turf has become more widely used by both the recreation industry and school systems alike .
The high traffic nature of these types of venues makes maintaining natural grass more difficult .
Not only is synthetic turf a good option for large scale landscapes like sports fields , but it is commonly used residentially as well .
Unfortunately , there is some skepticism surrounding the use of synthetic turf and the safety of both the environment and the individuals playing on it .
When artificial turf was originally marketed to the public some of these concerns were reasonable , but with advancements in the technology used in creating artificial turf there is no longer risk surrounding the product .
A large concern for individuals considering purchasing artificial turf is the environmental impact it could have .
What many people do n’t know , however , is that it is , in fact , an environmentally responsible choice .
The largest benefit of using synthetic field turf is the amount of water saved by not having to water your lawn regularly .
In addition , there are no chemicals necessary to maintain the health of your grass like pesticides .
Some companies even offer recycling for both the turf itself and the rubber infill .
Another concern surrounding synthetic turf is if there is a heightened risk of injury for those playing on it .
Much research has been conducted to ensure the safety of using artificial turf and there has been no elevated risk to be found when playing on properly maintained surfaces .
In some cases playing on synthetic turf has actually proved to be safer than playing on natural grass .
Often times , the cost of installing artificial turf is called into question when one is considering buying it .
Due to the minimized cost of maintaining synthetic turf , however , many consumers earn back the cost of installation and artificial turf ends up being a very cost - effective investment .
Installing an artificial turf saves time and money .
It also has a long lifespan and will never suffer the effects of droughts or cold spells .
In the end , artificial turf is the best option for both residential and commercial use .
Fournier : ' Panic - button time ' for Clinton Associated Press
Published : Wednesday February 20 , 2008

Print This Email This By RON FOURNIER , Associated Press Writer The Democratic nomination is now Barack Obama 's to lose .
After 10 consecutive defeats  including a heartbreaker in tailor - made Wisconsin on Tuesday  Hillary Rodham Clinton can't win the nomination unless Obama makes a major mistake or her allies reveal something damaging about the Illinois senator 's background .
Do n't count her out quite yet , but Wisconsin revealed deep and destructive fractures in the Clinton coalition .
It 's panic - button time .
That explains why Clinton 's aides accused Obama of plagiarism for delivering a speech that included words that had first been uttered by Deval Patrick , the Massachusetts governor and a friend of Obama .
The charge bordered on the hypocritical  Clinton herself has borrowed Obama 's lines  and by itself was unlikely to have an impact on the race .
Clinton claimed Tuesday that reporters , not her campaign , pushed the plagiarism story line .
That is not true .
The Clinton camp hopes to produce other instances of rhetorical theft and show a pattern of bad behavior .
The danger for Obama is anything that undercuts his image as a candidate who rises above politics .
Something like this might work to Clinton 's advantage : Obama is backtracking on a pledge to abide by spending caps in the general election , and his explanation is bogus .
Obama is undeniably raw .
Less than four years removed from the Illinois Legislature , he stands at the brink of the Democratic nomination and will soon go one - on - one in debates with a tough and savvy former first lady .
The odds of a misstep are low but not impossible for these reasons : Clinton will grow increasingly negative ; Obama faces more scrutiny as the new front - runner ; his performance in multi-candidates debates was uneven ; and the charmed Illinois senator has never faced political crises .
Should Obama stumble in the next two weeks , does he know how to recover ?
Clinton certainly knows how to bounce back .
She helped her husband , Bill , recover from near - death experiences during his White House run and rebounded herself after a thumping in Iowa .
But her rival has won the most states , earned the most pledged delegates and has all the momentum .
Clinton needs to win Ohio and Texas on March 4  then Pennsylvania in April  to narrow Obama 's lead among pledged delegates .
Only then could she argue with a straight face that a majority of the nearly 800 free - roaming " superdelegates " should back her over Obama .
" Both Senator Obama and I would make history , " the former first lady told supporters Tuesday night .
" But only one of us is ready on Day One to be commander in chief , ready to manage our economy and ready to defeat the Republicans .
Only one of us has spent 35 years being a doer , a fighter and a champion for those who need a voice . "
Only one of them can win , and it does n't look good for her .
" The chances of Obama doing something that 's going to cause a major problem are about as low as her doing something that will turn it around , " said Democratic strategist Bill Carrick , who is not tied to either campaign .
" When you start pressing to come back , it 's usually the person who 's behind who makes the mistake . "
Ignore the Clinton advisers who argue that Wisconsin was just a bump on the road en route to the tell - all March 4 primaries .
Listen instead to the message sent by her ragged coalition : Obama led among whites ( widely among white men ) , moderates and those earning less than $ 50,000 , all bastions of Clinton 's past strength .
Obama and Clinton split the vote among women , erasing her one - time advantage .
Demographically , Wisconsin was a warm - up for Ohio : nearly 90 percent of Tuesday 's voters were white ; about 40 percent earn less than $ 50,000 annually ; nearly 60 percent have no college degree ; and half are over 50 years old  all demographics that have tended to favor Clinton .
In a sign of desperation , the Clinton camp floated the idea of poaching delegates that Obama earned via elections .
While allowable under Democratic National Committee rules , the tactic would likely divide Democrats along racial lines and set the party back decades .
It would be the ultimate act of selfishness and foolishness .
Even Clinton must realize there is little she can do to win the nomination .
She can only help Obama lose it .
FOR THE RECORD : New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson denies a report in last week 's column that former President Clinton chastised him for withholding his endorsement .
" It never happened , " said spokesman Pahl Shipley .

The Election Year Should Not Divide the Peace Movement -- Remain Advocates for a Real End to the Occupation
Divisions among peace voters about the presidential election are becoming evident in columns by peace advocates and on discussion lists .
The goal of ending the Iraq occupation and ending militarism is bigger than this election , so we should not let partisanship divide the peace movement .
The key to unity is advocating for a real end to the Iraq occupation , pressuring all candidates in that direction , as well as pushing for an end to the militarist foreign policy of the US .
Elections are never easy for advocates of real change on major issues .
The two parties tend to cloud their differences on the most difficult issues .
Even though bringing the troops home is supported by super majorities of US voters according to recent polls as well as by US troops and Iraqis , none of the candidates from the two established parties are calling for a complete withdrawal , but they are all trying to play to the peace voter .
Even the most hawkish candidate , John McCain , gave a speech defining his foreign policy saying “ I detest war ” and called for working with other countries not dominating them , and not solving every problem with the military .
Sounds good .
But , rather than withdrawal from Iraq , McCain says peace will be achieved only through victory .
He seems more likely to get the US into a war with Iran then get us out of Iraq . . . while detesting war .
While McCain was trying to sound like a peace candidate , Barack Obama was sounding like a Republican .
On March 28th Obama told an audience that his foreign policy would be like Reagan ’s and George H.W. Bush ’s .
He praised George H.W. Bush and said : “ The truth is that my foreign policy is actually a return to the traditional bipartisan realistic policy of George Bush ’s father , of John F. Kennedy , of , in some ways , Ronald Reagan . ”
The two Democrats have put forward incomplete withdrawal plans promising to remove US combat troops but leaving tens of thousands of troops in Iraq .
Combat troops would remain in the region to conduct strikes in Iraq .
Obama has a 16 - month timetable to withdraw combat troops .
Hillary Clinton has no deadline but a similar pace of removal .
Obama would leave tens of thousands , perhaps more than one hundred thousand , civilian security contractors in Iraq .
Clinton has very recently spoken in opposition to private security contractors , seemingly to out - peace Obama on an issue she had been silent on .
Both keep the military option against Iran on the table , and seek to expand the US military by nearly 100,000 troops .
At the same time , the independent political movement may have three of its strongest candidates in years — all opposed to Iraq and critical of militarism .
Two former Democrats and one former Republican have joined third parties and are either running or considering a run for president .
This includes Cynthia McKinney , the former Democratic congresswoman as the likely Green Party nominee ; Mike Gravel , the former Democratic senator and presidential candidate , now seeking the Libertarian nomination ; and Bob Barr , a former Republican congressman considering a Libertarian run .
And , the Nader - Gonzalez team is seeking the presidency through an independent run .
All of these candidates are solidly opposed to the war , oppose war in Iran and seek a less militarist foreign policy .
Some in the peace movement , like Tom Hayden , Danny Glover , Bill Fletcher and Barbara Ehrenreich , have urged the movement to support Senator Obama .
They see him as the most peace - oriented candidate with a chance of getting elected , and urge the peace movement to accept his withdrawal plan , recognizing that his plan is inadequate and not a complete end to the occupation .
Others like Chris Hedges , the noted author on war and military issues and former NY Times writer , say that the only choice for peace voters is Nader or McKinney ( he wrote before Gravel and Barr announced their intentions ) because the Democrats will continue the occupation .
And Naomi Klein and Jeremy Scahill urge peace advocates to take a new approach — push the peace agenda and do not accept the deficient withdrawal plans of Clinton and Obama .
What is a peace voter to do ?
How someone casts his / her vote is a very personal decision .
I ’m not going to tell anyone how to vote .
But things to consider :
First , do not forget — you do n’t vote the Electoral College votes .
Only 10 to 15 states are expected to be ‘ in play ’ in 2008 .
In the vast majority of states it is possible to predict right now where those Electoral College votes are going .
The democracy manipulation actually frees you to vote your hopes and dreams .
In ‘ safe ’ states your vote will show the two parties that they need to represent the vast majority of voters who oppose the war .
A peace supporter wastes their vote in these states by voting for a militarist candidate .
Voters in these states can act without concern for fear of the ‘ greater evil ’ candidate .
Second , there is no need to decide now how you are going to vote or to announce how you are going to vote .
If you remain undecided you can use the remainder of the primary as well as the General Election to tell the candidate : “ want my vote ? — support the majority of voters and really end the Iraq occupation . ”
This demand will make the candidates stronger as you will pull them toward the majority anti-war viewpoint in the US .
Third , recognize your power is not only in your vote but what you do during the election .
Peace voters can work together to push candidates to accept their position — no matter who they are going to vote for .
Those who support peace can be pushed to make it a higher priority .
Concerted effort by the peace voting bloc will push the agenda in our direction .
Take action today and tell the candidates to make ending the occupation a top issue in the campaign .
( See Peace Voter Power )
Fourth , do n’t be fooled by political rhetoric .
A common reaction by people who think of themselves as peace voters when hearing that Obama ’s withdrawal plan is only a partial withdrawal is disbelief .
People want to believe Obama stands for truly ending the occupation even though he has been clear that he does not plan to withdraw all troops even by the end of his first term .
And , Senator McCain , saying he detests war will not end the Iraq occupation .
His record speaks more loudly than his rhetoric .
Similarly , Senator Clinton ’s effort to re-make herself as an opponent of the war is held down by the anchor of her voting record .
With all candidates , how they vote , who funds them and who their closest advisers are tell us more than their rhetoric and advertising campaigns .
To help figure out what they will do if elected , Voters for Peace maintains a collection of key speeches , news reports , columns and other materials on all of the candidates .
This will be a continually expanding collection throughout the campaign .
Fifth , recognize that the peace movement is going to have to be bigger , stronger and more unified when the election is over .
So , do n’t burn bridges with your allies over the election .
We need to remember that elections in the US are manipulated by the two major parties , the concentrated corporate media and by funding from US business elites .
Peace voters are already manipulated to vote against their interests ; let ’s not let this faulty democracy divide us .
The peace movement will need to be unified to end the occupation and prevent future wars no matter who is elected .
Sixth , building the peace movement is bigger than the Iraq war ; it is building a political bloc that can defeat the military - industrial complex in future debates on war and military budgets .
While our founders opposed standing armies and foreign intervention , made it difficult to start war by vesting that power in Congress , and did not want the US to become an empire , the US has developed a tradition of militarism in the 20th Century and foreign policy based on military and economic domination .
The Cold War , serving as the world ’s policeman , and now the war on terror has resulted in a permanent arms industry that consistently saps more than half of the federal government ’s discretionary spending — no matter what the needs of the American people are .
We must build a peace voter bloc that is strong and unified so it can eliminate the permanent arms industry .
Seventh , the peace movement needs an inside - outside strategy .
There is a role for peace voters outside and inside the two parties .
Outside the two parties , we should support candidates and parties that clearly stand for an end to the occupation as well as an end to militarism .
And , on the inside , the Ron Paul movement needs to grow in the Republican Party and the wing represented by Dennis Kucinich needs to grow inside the Democratic Party .
Having an inside - outside strategy allows the peace movement to make a legitimate threat to their party as they have somewhere else to go .
Peace voters should never be taken for granted .
The life and death issue we advocate on is too important .
The Iraq occupation is going to continue to be a top issue during the presidential campaign .
The surge is unraveling .
Attacks and deaths inside the US Green Zone have led to the need to hide inside buildings within the fortified zone .
American and Iraqi casualties are increasing .
Baghdad is locked down in curfew .
And it is becoming more evident that the cost of the Iraq war is not only the loss of life , or increase in anti-Americanism , but of the US economy , which is now in what some call the Iraq recession or depression .
The peace movement needs to avoid losing its energy in the election .
It needs to be protesting any candidate who does not call for a complete withdrawal from Iraq and who is not calling for a reduction in the US military .
Movements cannot stop and start or take a year off .
Taking time off for an election year will make it difficult to re-start again in 2009 .
Peace voters need to remember that presidents are not where change begins .
Change begins from the grassroots , and the government accepts the change if the movement gets strong enough to demand it .
Elections are the time for peace advocates to demand peace .

Just before noon on July 25 , 2007 , Joel Charlebois caught a man , he says , breaking into his house .
When Charlebois gave chase , the man fell from the second - storey deck , landing hard on the ground below and breaking his leg .
As police arrived , Charlebois — an avid photographer who has a Flickr account under the name uwajedi , who is an active member of Torontoist ’s Flickr Pool , and who we ’ve regularly featured — took photos of the man .
One shot shows him flipping off the camera , others show him clutching his leg , others show him being approached by two police officers .
They ’re not the best photos that Charlebois has taken , but they ’ve since become the most newsworthy .
When CityTV arrived on the scene to do a story about the burglary , Charlebois says that he “ refused [ a reporter ’s ] request for an interview ….[ and ] asked him to leave . ”
Charlebois did , however , say that he “ had taken pictures of the perpetrator and was looking forward to posting them on [ his ] Flickr site ” ; the reporter “ was interested in seeing them , ” so Charlebois gave him his card , but , he says , not permission to use the shots in any way .
Charlebois uploaded the photos to Flickr , then left for Montreal later that afternoon .
( He also added them to both Torontoist and BlogTO ’s Flickr pools ; while we chose not to run any of them , BlogTO did . )
When he came back home , he was surprised to find out that the story had aired on the 6 p.m. broadcast of CityNews ( on both City and CablePulse 24 ) , and , most importantly , had included the photos that he had uploaded to Flickr ( above ) — without permission from or credit to him .
Somebody asked for it , and now it ’s up on the web .

The price of beer is likely to rise in coming decades because climate change will hamper the production of a key grain needed for the brew - especially in Australia , a scientist warned Tuesday .
Jim Salinger , a climate scientist at New Zealand 's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research , said climate change likely will cause a decline in the production of malting barley in parts of New Zealand and Australia .
Malting barley is a key ingedient of beer .
" It will mean either there will be pubs without beer or the cost of beer will go up , " Salinger told the Institute of Brewing and Distilling convention .
Similar effects could be expected worldwide , but Salinger spoke only of the effects on Australia and New Zealand .
He said climate change could cause a drop in beer production within 30 years , especially in parts of Australia , as dry areas become drier and water shortages worsen .
Barley growing parts of Western Australia , South Australia , Victoria and New South Wales would likely be harder hit than growing areas in New Zealand 's South Island .
" It will provide a lot of challenges for the brewing industry , " even forcing breweries to look at new varieties of malt barley as a direct result of climate change , Salinger said .
New Zealand and Australian brewer Lion Nathan 's corporate affairs director Liz Read said climate change already was forcing up the price of malted barley , sugar , aluminium and sugar .
Read said that in addition to climate change , barley growers are grappling with competition from other forms or land use , such as the dairy industry .

Five hours into their assault on West Point , the hackers got serious .
The SQL [ structured query language ] inserts that came earlier were just pablum intended to lull the Army cadets into a false sense of security .
But then the bad guys unleashed a stealthy kernel - level rootkit that burrowed into one workstation , started scraping data and " calling home . "
It was a highly sophisticated attack , but this time the bad guys were really good guys in wolves ' clothing .
For four days in late April , the National Security Agency – the nation 's most secretive repository of spooks , snoops and electronic eavesdroppers – directed coordinated assaults on custom - built networks at seven of the nation 's military academies , including West Point , the Army university 50 miles north of New York City .
It was all part of the seventh annual Cyber Defense Exercise , a training event for future military IT specialists .
The exercise offered a rare window into the NSA 's toolkit for infiltrating , corrupting or destroying computer networks .
The 34 Army cadets comprising the West Point IT team operated in a different kind of battlefield , but their combat skills and instincts need to be every bit as sharp .
Like George Washington said : " There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the enemy . "
The SQL injections , targeting their Fedora Core 8
Web server , were a piece of cake for these IT combatants .
Each injection tried to smuggle malicious code inside the seemingly harmless language used by the network ’s MySQL software .
The cadets handily defended with open source Apache web server modules , plus some manual tweaking of the SQL database to " avoid any surprises , " in the words of Lt Col .
Joe Adams , a West Point instructor who helped coach the team .
But the kernel - level rootkit was much more dangerous .
This stealthy operating - system hijacker can open unseen " back doors " into even highly protected networks .
When they detected the rootkit's " calls home " the cadets launched Sysinternal 's security software to find the hijacker , then they manually scoured the workstation to find the unwelcome executable file .
Then they terminated it .
With extreme prejudice .
" This was probably the most challenging part of the exercise , since it required them to use some advanced techniques to find the rootkit , " Adams says .
And rooting it out helped boost the West Point team to the top of the pile when , in the aftermath of the exercise , the referees rated all the universities ' network defenses .
For the second year in a row , the Army placed first over the Navy , Air Force , Coast Guard and others , winning geek bragging rights and the privilege of holding onto a gaudy , 60 - pound brass trophy festooned with bald eagles and American flags .
Adams credits the team ’s thorough preparation and their excellent teamwork despite the round - the - clock schedule .
At the network control room on the second floor of West Point ’s 200 - year - old engineering building ( which once was an indoor horse corral and still smells like it in some remote corners , according to one instructor ) , the IT team set up cots and , just for the hell of it , camouflaged netting .
They worked in shifts , with one team member always monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic .
He or she would alert other cadets – " router guys " – to block any suspicious addresses .
Meanwhile , off - shift cadets would make food and coffee runs to keep everyone fueled up and alert .
Together , the team was " faster than anyone else , " Adams says .
But the way the cadets designed their network was a big factor in their victory , too .
The NSA dictated some terms :
All networks had to be capable of e-mail , chat and other services and had to be up and running at all times despite any attacks or defensive measures .
Beyond that , the teams were free to come up with their own designs .
West Point 's took three weeks to build .
The cadets settled on a fairly standard Linux and FreeBSD - based network with advanced routing techniques for steering incoming traffic in directions of the IT team 's choosing .
The choices in software tools for responding to any attack really boiled down to " automatic " versus " custom , " says Eric Dean , a civilian programmer and instructor .
He adds that while automatic tools that do most of their own work are certainly easier , custom tools that allow more manual tweaking are more effective .
" I expect one of the ' lessons learned ' will be the use of custom tools instead of automatics . "
Even with a solid network design and passable software choices , there was an element of intuitiveness required to defend against the NSA , especially once it became clear the agency was using minor , and perhaps somewhat obvious , attacks to screen for sneakier , more serious ones .
" One of the challenges was when they see a scan , deciding if this is it , or if it ’s a cover , " says Dean .
Spotting " cover " attacks meant thinking like the NSA – something Dean says the cadets did quite well .
" I was surprised at their creativity . "
Legal limitations were a surprising obstacle to a realistic exercise .
Ideally , the teams would be allowed to attack other schools ' networks while also defending their own .
But only the NSA , with its arsenal of waivers , loopholes , special authorizations ( and heaven knows what else ) is allowed to take down a U.S. network .
And despite the relative sophistication of the NSA 's assaults , the agency told Wired.com that it had tailored its attacks to be just " a little too hard for the strongest undergraduate team to deal with , so that we could distinguish the strongest teams from the weaker ones . "
In other words , grasshopper , nice work – but the NSA is capable of much craftier network take - downs .

Welcome to bland , homogenous suburbia .
In 1960 fewer Americans lived in suburbs than in central cities or the countryside .
Ten years later the suburbs had overhauled both ; by 2000 they contained more people than the cities and countryside put together .
Despite more than a decade of urban boosterism , beginning with sitcoms like “ Friends ” and “ Sex and the City ” and continuing with expensive efforts to spruce up downtown districts , the drift to the cul - de - sacs continues .
Between 1990 and 2006 the city of Chicago added 50,000 residents , reversing a long decline .
Not bad — but in the same period the sprawling metropolis outside the city proper grew by well over a million .
As they swell , the suburbs are changing .
Perhaps none ever quite resembled the colourless domestic enclaves popularised by 1970s television programmes such as “ The Brady Bunch ” ; now , they look nothing at all like them .
America 's suburbs are ethnically and demographically mixed — sometimes more so than its cities .
Many are less dormitories than economic powerhouses .
Among the most changed is one of the most famous .
Willingboro , or Levittown as it used to be known , was built 50 years ago this summer .
It was created by William Levitt , who kept costs down by bringing in ready - made walls and buying cookers and refrigerators direct from manufacturers .
As he boasted to Time magazine , his company was the “ General Motors of the housing industry ” .
The new suburb was composed of self - contained neighbourhoods , each with its own school and swimming pool .
Every street was reassuringly curved and shared the first letter of its name with the neighbourhood to which it belonged .
Holyoke Lane , Henderson Lane and Hummingbird Lane all lay within Hawthorne Park .
One of Willingboro 's first residents was Herbert Gans , a sociologist who wanted to find out whether suburbia conformed to the popular image of bored commuters and alienated housewives .
His great book , “ The Levittowners ” , proved it did not .
But Gans had to admit that Willingboro was homogenous .
Virtually all home - buyers were white people in their 20s and 30s , with young children .
The population was overwhelmingly lower - middle - class and less than 1 % black .
These days Willingboro is two - thirds black .
Although it remains child - oriented , it is no longer exclusively so .
One in eight residents is now aged 65 or over .
As the proportion of children has fallen , schools have been converted to other uses .
One has been turned into a community centre where , on a recent Friday afternoon , an R&B band entertained a mixed - race crowd of old folk .
The music drifted into a small room where Muslims , a growing presence in the neighbourhood , had gathered for prayers .
Such diversity is now common in suburbia .
According to William Frey , a demographer , the white population of big-city suburbs grew by 7 % between 2000 and 2006 .
In the same period the suburban Asian population grew by 16 % , the black population by 24 % and the Hispanic population by an astonishing 60 % .
Many immigrants to America now move directly to the suburbs without passing through established urban ghettos .
Having conquered suburbia , ethnic - minority groups are now swiftly infiltrating the more distant “ exurbs ” .
As the suburbs become more mixed , some inner-city areas are turning less so .
Los Angeles , which markets itself as the city “ where the world comes together ” , and New York ( “ the world 's second home ” ) both added whites and lost blacks between 2000 and 2006 .
So many blacks moved out of Los Angeles that , were the exodus to continue unabated , they would disappear from the city around 2050 .
Manhattan and San Francisco lost Hispanics as well as blacks , which is remarkable given that group 's speedy growth in the country as a whole .
Meanwhile , the world came together on their fringes .
Gary Gates , who follows the subject at the University of California at Los Angeles , says the number of gay and lesbian couples in suburbia is also increasing .
Much of this can be put down to greater tolerance : more same - sex couples are coming out of the closet , at least to census - takers .
But some of it is due to migration from central cities .
Atlanta , Detroit and Philadelphia all lost gays and lesbians between 2000 and 2006 .
The suburban counties surrounding all three cities saw increases in the number of same - sex couples , sometimes huge ones .
Why are gays and ethnic minorities moving to suburbia ?
The obvious answer is that they can .
No suburban developer would dare bar blacks or any other group from buying houses , as William Levitt did until 1960 .
It has taken longer to overcome local prejudices — and the fear that behind twitching net curtains live intolerant neighbours rather than merely curious ones .
Yet such anxieties are now fading .
The Rev Willie James , who launched a lawsuit in 1959 that led to the desegregation of Willingboro , says overt racism is no more , and the covert kind is so covert as to be almost undetectable .
To the extent that ethnic - minority groups have needs distinct from those of whites ( which they do less and less ) they can increasingly meet them outside city centres .
Los Angeles ' best dim sum is to be found in the largely Chinese suburb of Monterey Park .
Its best Indian restaurants are in Artesia , another suburb .
Gays can go online to socialise , points out Mr Gates — or they can go to ordinary bars and clubs , where same - sex couples raise fewer eyebrows than they used to .
Many young gays hardly see the point of pricey enclaves like Chelsea in New York or the Castro in San Francisco .
Despite recent falls , property prices in cities like Los Angeles , New York , Miami and Washington have risen far more than the national average since the mid-1990s .
Many Americans find it worthwhile to move out and commute to jobs in the city .
And they may not have to commute at all .
The most important reason people are moving to the suburbs is economic : that is where the jobs are .
From bedrooms to boardrooms
Even when seen from a car at 65 miles per hour , Valencia does not conform to the popular image of suburbia .
Drivers heading north from Los Angeles along Interstate 5 see few houses , because most are hidden behind a golf course .
Instead they pass factories , warehouses and offices .
It is not a bad introduction to the place .
With some 60,000 jobs and 20,000 houses , Valencia boasts a better ratio of employment to homes than the city of Los Angeles .
And still its businesses grow .
Between 2002 and 2009 its supply of offices will have increased by half .
Valencia was designed by Victor Gruen , an architect who did as much to shape American suburbia in the 1960s as William Levitt had done in the 1950s .
Gruen was an idealist : his most enduring invention , the two - storey enclosed shopping mall , was supposed to evoke a European city centre .
For Valencia he devised a dense urban core and a series of neighbourhoods connected to each other and downtown via walkways known as paseos .
The settlement was supposed to be orderly and self - contained , unlike the chaotic San Fernando valley just to the south .
As one of the town 's early planners explained , it would be “ an island of reason in the path of metropolitan sprawl ” .
It did n't quite work out that way .
Valencia contains no building taller than six storeys and few taller than three storeys .
These days the paseos are used mostly for walking dogs , and by children .
Everybody else drives .
Nor did Valencia prove to be economically self - contained .
Each morning about half of its residents leave for jobs in Los Angeles .
Roughly the same number make the reverse trip over the Santa Monica mountains to toil in Valencia 's offices , sound stages and warehouses .
This is an increasingly common pattern .
In a forthcoming report , Alan Berube of the Brookings Institution , a think - tank , calculates that 45 % of the jobs in America 's 100 biggest metropolitan areas are found more than ten miles from the downtown core .
Between 1998 and 2004 fully three - quarters of all new jobs emerged in this area .
Many of these new positions were filled by local people , who were delighted to drop their long commutes to traditional city centres .
But more and more Americans wake up in one suburb and go to work in another .
Others , including many of Google 's Bay Area employees , wake up in a city and go to work in a suburb .
America 's suburbs have had shopping malls since the 1950s , and factories for longer .
Increasingly , though , they are centres of white - collar work .
The Inland Empire , a vast , sprawling area east of Los Angeles , accounted for more than a quarter of California 's new professional and business - services jobs between 1998 and 2007 .
Over time , Mr Berube reckons , urban and suburban employment patterns will continue to merge .
Health - care providers , for example , are drifting out of city centres to serve suburbia 's increasingly aged residents .
Suburbs generally have cheaper land , newer offices and less crime than city centres .
Companies that want to expand may well be able to do so in situ , and will not have to look for a new building across town .
In Valencia they have another explanation for the suburbs ' economic success .
As Jim Backer , a developer , explains : “ In the end , companies tend to move where their presidents want to move . ”
And many presidents want to live in places like Valencia .
To those who like their cities plain , without a dash of urban grit , Valencia seems delightful .
Its streets are safe and well - kept .
Its purpose - built “ town centre ” contains shops , cafés , wine bars and art studios .
Although nobody would mistake it for San Francisco , it also lacks that city 's homeless problem and has more public seating .
Teenagers coming out of the cinema enter a vaguely Mediterranean village square , complete with fountains , that is a far more pleasant place to linger than anywhere in , say , New York 's Chelsea .
Valencia was one of the first places in America to build a shopping district that evoked an old - fashioned town centre .
These days such things are popping up all over the country .
Rick Caruso , a master of the genre , has built them in the heart of Los Angeles as well as in suburbs like Glendale .
San Jose , in the Bay Area , has the hugely successful Santana Row , which is vaguely French , whereas Mr Caruso 's developments are vaguely Italian .
The popularity of such confections suggests that Americans want to spend time in places that look like cities but feel like suburbs .
They hint at a broader pattern : cities and suburbs are converging .
This is not entirely good news .
Trouble in Wisteria Lane
Right - thinking people disapproved of suburbs when Gans moved to Willingboro , and they dislike them today .
James Kunstler , an American urbanist , says they represent “ the greatest misallocation of resources the world has ever known ” .
Richard Florida , an influential writer , sees them as incidental , at best , to cities ' highest purpose , which is to concentrate young , creative folk who will come up with brilliant innovations .
Now that America worries about global warming , the acres of bungalows and freeway exit ramps seem not just pointless but harmful .
Although much of this is nonsense , it can not be denied that a little sheen has come off America 's suburbs in the past year .
Especially in the West , many have been hammered by foreclosures and falling house prices .
As a result , their budgets are a mess .
The fact that this is largely a consequence of success — the suburbs and exurbs grew rapidly at a time when lending standards were lax , and are now suffering the consequences — is little consolation .
Nor is the fact that , as Joel Kotkin of Chapman University points out , the bottom has also dropped out of the city - centre apartment market .
Other problems are creeping into suburbia .
The one that its inhabitants complain most bitterly about is traffic .
America has failed to build enough roads to accommodate the suburbs ' growing population — a big problem for places where public transport is generally weak or non-existent .
Interstate 5 , which is the only practical route between Valencia and the city of Los Angeles , is often clogged .
Those who make the journey in either direction pay twice as much for petrol as they did in the spring of 2004 .
Another worry is crime .
Since 2001 the number of violent crimes in suburban areas has risen by 10 % , according to the FBI .
That is no more than one would expect , given the speed of population growth there .
Yet it is a poor record compared with America 's big cities , which have cut violent crime by 17 % .
In the past few years many of America 's biggest indoor marijuana farms have been discovered in the suburbs .
In some suburbs fear of crime has risen more steeply .
Willingboro 's violent crime rate is one - quarter of Philadelphia 's , yet its teenagers enter school through metal detectors .
Blacks and whites alike worry that new arrivals from Philadelphia and Camden , in New Jersey , are importing gang culture .
“ They come here to escape , and sometimes they do n't leave all their baggage behind , ” explains Reva Foster , who works for Willingboro 's government .
Perhaps the greatest problem of all is demographic .
The suburbs used to be blessed with a young , productive population .
Many of the newer , more distant exurbs still are .
These days , though , many suburbs built in the 1950s are older than the central cities they surround .
Willingboro 's growing army of retirees is straining city services and resisting increases in property taxes , which account for almost two - thirds of the town government 's revenues .
Willingboro desperately needs to improve its schools if it is to continue attracting affluent settlers .
Yet it is finding it ever harder to persuade residents to pay for them .
Although many urban mayors would happily swap the suburbs ' problems for their own , cities do have one advantage : they tend to have large , centralised governments .
In states like New Jersey , many suburbs try to govern themselves and suffer from diseconomies of scale .
With just 33,000 residents Willingboro runs its own schools , police force , fire service and public - works department , among many other things .
Elsewhere suburbs are controlled by urban city halls that largely ignore them , except as generators of taxes .
Both arrangements make it difficult to come up with bold cures for the suburbs ' growing pains .
An ordinary place
Weak government is a particular problem because , as suburbs become less homogenous , they are also losing some of their cohesiveness .
A big complaint in Willingboro is that neighbours are less sociable than they used to be .
Levitt 's ideal of self - contained neighbourhoods is largely forgotten : most of the pools have closed , and children may no longer attend their local school .
Jim Gray , a longtime resident , complains it is ever harder to rustle up volunteers for civic events .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. assertions about the growing independence of Iraqi security units are often based on conflicting claims or assessment methods that do not allow for “ independent ” ratings , a U.S. watchdog agency said on Monday .

A report by the Government Accountability Office said the Defense Department and top military officials including U.S. Commander in Iraq Gen .
David Petraeus have sought to show progress by repeatedly citing numbers of Iraqi Security Force ( ISF ) units deemed “ independent ” or “ fully independent . ”
But it is unclear how the Pentagon and its officials have reached those conclusions , according to the GAO .
“ First , the process by which ISF units are assessed does not allow for a rating of ‘ independent ’ or ‘ fully independent . ’
Second , statements in DOD reports seemingly contradict claims of ISF independence , ” said the agency , a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress .
The GAO specifically pointed to Petraeus ’ September testimony to Congress in which he told lawmakers that coalition forces have assessed one ISF unit to be “ fully independent ” each month since November 2005 with only one exception .
“ Without clarity regarding the criteria according to which ISF units are assessed as independent ...
Congress cannot have clear visibility over DOD ’s role in assisting the ISF in becoming independent of coalition support , ” the 33 - page report said .
The United States has spent $ 19.2 billion since 2003 to train and equip about 350,000 Iraqi soldiers and police in hopes of deploying an effective security force that would ultimately allow for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
But with the Bush administration now beginning to withdraw 20,000 extra combat troops sent to Iraq to quell sectarian violence , the GAO report said there is no reliable data on how many of those Iraqi security forces are still serving .
The greatest obstacle preventing Iraqi security units from achieving full independence has been their lack of logistical support , intelligence and command and control structures .
The GAO said there has been some progress in these areas but that the Iraqi government has been stymied by continued sectarian violence that has led to a larger force at the expense of developing support capabilities .
The Ministry of Defense , which oversees the Iraqi Army , has diverted recruits intended for logistics into combat , understaffed training schools , experienced a growing shortage of noncommissioned officers .
Meanwhile , violence has prevented the Ministry of Interior , which controls the Iraqi police , from completing a command and control network and developing its intelligence capabilities .
An al - Jazeera cameraman detained by American forces in Afghanistan was last night released after spending nearly six years imprisoned without charge at Guantánamo Bay .
Sami al - Haj , 39 , was arrested on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan on December 15 2001 , while on assignment to cover the war against the Taliban .
Although he had a valid visa to work in Afghanistan , US intelligence alleged that he was an al - Qaida operative , and he was transferred to Guantánamo in June 2002 .
Last night , his lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , said Haj was en route to his home in Sudan to be reunited with his wife and son .
He said : " I 'm very glad Sami has finally been released , but the question is why he was n't freed many years ago . "
The US military alleged that Haj had secretly interviewed Osama bin Laden , smuggled guns for al - Qaida and worked as a financial courier for Chechen rebels .
But the evidence against him was never revealed , and he was never charged .
Prior to his release , Haj had been on hunger strike since January 2007 , and was forced to undergo " assisted feeding " via a tube through his nose .
According to Stafford Smith , he was suicidal and had throat cancer , but camp authorities withheld medical treatment .
" We are very concerned about him , because he has been under a tremendous amount of stress and has been on hunger strike for 480 days .
He has asked to be taken straight to a hospital in Khartoum , " Stafford Smith said .
In exchange for Haj 's release , the Sudanese government has agreed to ban him from working as a journalist or leaving Sudan , according to Reporters Without Borders .
Robert Ménard , secretary general of Reporters Without Borders , said : " Sami al - Haj should never have been held so long .
US authorities never proved that he had been involved in any criminal activity . "
Haj 's case was one of number involving journalists captured by US forces while reporting from war zones .
Two weeks ago US forces in Iraq released Bilal Hussein , a photographer from the Associated Press news agency , who was detained in Ramadi in April 2006 .
Commentators in the Middle East viewed Haj 's imprisonment as a proxy punishment for al - Jazeera , whose broadcasts have angered US officials .
When the BBC reporter Alan Johnston was kidnapped in Gaza , Haj appealed for his release .
Johnston in turn , called on the US authorities to free Haj .
But Stafford Smith said much of the western media had been slow to take up Haj 's case .
A spokesman for the Pentagon refused to comment on the case .
Iraqi alleges Abu Ghraib torture , sues US contractors

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) – An Iraqi man sued two U.S. military contractors , claiming he was repeatedly tortured while being held at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison for more than 10 months .
Emad al - Janabi ’s federal lawsuit , filed Monday in Los Angeles , claims that employees of CACI International Inc. and L - 3 Communications Holdings Inc. punched him , slammed him into walls , hung him from a bed frame and kept him naked and handcuffed in his cell beginning in September 2003 .
Also named as a defendant is CACI interrogator Steven Stefanowicz , known as “ Big Steve . ”
The suit claims he directed some of the torture tactics .
Phone messages left for Arlington , Va. - based CACI and New York City - based L - 3 Communications , formerly Titan Corp. , were not immediately returned Monday .
There was no phone number listed for Stefanowicz at his Los Angeles address .
The lawsuit , filed in Los Angeles because Stefanowicz lives there , seeks unspecified monetary damages .
The firms provided interrogators or interpreters to assist U.S. military guards at Abu Ghraib , which became notorious when photos made public in early 2004 showing U.S. soldiers abusing and humiliating detainees .
Military investigators later concluded that much of the abuse happened in late 2003 – when CACI and Titan ’s interrogators were at the prison .
CACI and L - 3 were accused of abusing Abu Ghraib prisoners in earlier lawsuits .
In November a federal judge in the District of Columbia dismissed the suit against L - 3 but allowed the one against CACI to proceed .
In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday in Istanbul , Turkey , al - Janabi said he hopes the lawsuit sheds light on what happened to him and other detainees .
“ God willing the righteousness will emerge and God willing the criminal will receive his punishment , ” al - Janabi said .
Al - Janabi , 43 , said he was detained by U.S. troops during a late - night raid in which he and his family were beaten by their captors .
He said he was taken to a military base where he was stripped naked , a hood was placed on his head and his hands and legs were chained .
“ They ( U.S. troops ) did not tell me what was the reason behind my arrest … during the interrogation , the American soldier told me I was a terrorist … and I was preparing for an attack against the U.S. forces , ” said al - Janabi , who denied the accusation and claims he was forced to give confessions under “ savage ” intimidation .
The lawsuit also claims the contractors conspired in a cover - up by destroying documents and other information , hid prisoners during periodic checks by the International Red Cross and misled military and government officials about what was happening at Abu Ghraib .
Al - Janabi was released in July 2004 and was n’t charged with any crime , according to the lawsuit .
He also was forced to form a human pyramid in the nude with other prisoners , according to the lawsuit , but his Philadelphia - based attorney Susan Burke said it was n’t known if he was in the infamous photo that became public .
“ Most of this conduct was repeated on more than one occasion , ” Burke said .
At one point after passing out , al - Janabi said , he was told by an L - 3 translator “ welcome to Guantanamo . ”
He said he even asked a cellmate whether he could see the ocean from a window .
“ I lost the sense of time after the prolonged hours of abusive interrogation and thought that I was transported to Guantanamo , ” al - Janabi told the AP .
The Abu Ghraib photos drew international criticism about the way detainees were treated and damaged the U.S. military ’s image in Arab countries .
Eleven U.S. soldiers were convicted of crimes at the prison , which was closed and transferred to Iraqi control .
Associated Press writer Omar Sinan in Istanbul , Turkey , contributed to this report .
Police said the policing of the target areas would be intelligence led Police will be using more stop and search powers to prevent knife crime in London , following the " horrendous events over the last 48 hours " .
From Tuesday officers will make use of searches under section 60 of the Public Order Act which allows police to search people without reasonable suspicion .
The first team of 15 officers will be deployed to an unnamed London borough .
It follows a rise in fatal knife attacks in London , including that of Steven Bigby , killed in the West End .
The 22 - year - old died from a stab wound to the chest in Oxford Street on Monday .
' Most stubborn '
Figures show 68 people aged under 25 have been killed in London since the beginning of 2007 .
Of those , 13 were teenagers - nine of whom were stabbed .
Among them is Lyle Tulloch , 15 , who died after being stabbed in a stairwell in Borough , south London , earlier this month .
Assistant Commissioner Tim Godwin said the carrying of weapons had contributed to the murder rate of young people and extra measures needed to be taken .
' In your face '
He said : " The one ( area of crime ) which is most stubborn for us and is our area of most serious concern is in fact the fatalities and the stabbings that have been going on , predominantly in central London but across London . "
Police had planned the deployment of the stop and search teams for some time but it was also " the natural reaction " to the " horrendous events over the last 48 hours , the increased number of stabbings " , he said .
He described the measure as being " fairly in your face " but said the tactic would be handled sensitively and appropriately .
The teams will target areas where intelligence suggests youths are more likely to be carrying weapons .
After the first team is deployed to a key area , another five to 10 teams will take to the capital over the next week to 10 days .

Britain ’s GCHQ spy agency has confirmed the fact that Chinese People ’s Liberation Army agents posing as monks staged violent riots in Tibet in order to justify a brutal crackdown , but that the demonstrations have now escalated beyond Beijing ’s control .
According to a report in today ’s Epoch Times , " GCHQ analysts believe the decision was deliberately calculated by the Beijing leadership to provide an excuse to stamp out the simmering unrest in the region , which is already attracting unwelcome world attention in the run-up to the Olympic Games this summer . "
Fearing that legitimate demonstrators would become more active in the months leading up to the Beijing Olympics , Chinese authorities planned to create a pretext to crush the movement by instigating violence that would sour global opinion towards the Tibetans .
According to the report , GCHQ ’s geo-positioned satellites in space were able to obtain images proving that the Chinese had infiltrated agent provocateurs into Lhasa .
PLA agents posing as monks were responsible for setting fire to buildings and killing non-ethnic Chinese citizens as well as police in an attempt to demonize the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan freedom movement .
However , according to the report , " What the Beijing regime had not expected was how the riots would spread , not only across Tibet , but also to Sichuan , Quighai and Gansu provinces , turning a large area of western China into a battle zone . "
Though the report seems to explain why images showed supposed Tibetans protesters inexplicably burning their own villages , it has to be cautioned that Epoch Times is a traditionally pro-Tibetan news outlet and there ’s no doubt that propaganda is being used by both sides .
It ’s probable that Chinese PLA agents instigated some of the violence but the fact that young Tibetans are engaging in violence completely of their own accord is largely accepted .
As the report points out , many of the Dalai Lama ’s supporters are " young , unemployed and dispossessed and reject his philosophy of non-violence , believing the only hope for change is the radical action they are now carrying out "
On a personal note , having visited Tibet myself and experienced some less than cordial interactions with the Tibetan people , it has to be said that they are certainly not deserving of the angelic tag some quarters of the media lavish upon them – being tribal , aggressive and spiteful towards foreign visitors as well as hostile towards tourists from the Chinese mainland .
As we reported on Monday , former Chinese Communist Party official Ruan Ming was the first to accuse China of staging the violent riots in order to demonize Tibetans in the eyes of the international community , justify a brutal paramilitary police crackdown and force the Dalai Lama to resign .
" The demonstration on March 10 was meant to be peaceful .
You can see from the pictures that the demonstration was all monks , " he explained , adding that the CCP carefully introduced violent unrest in order to " deceive the world " .

An Italian senator and top aide to Silvio Berlusconi has been forced to deny reports linking him to an alleged Mafia - run plan to hand Berlusconi 50,000 fraudulent votes , as voting gets under way today in the Italian elections .
Marcello Dell ' Utri , who is appealing against a sentence for consorting with Mafia clans , has admitted helping to enrol on Berlusconi 's election campaign a man whom prosecutors suspect teamed up with the Calabrian Mafia to fix votes .
But the Sicilian senator , who helped to launch Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in 1994 , described reports of his possible links to the alleged vote fraud as ' lies and garbage ' , adding that he had not been told he was under
investigation .
With a tight race in the senate expected as voters head to the polls today and tomorrow , the overseas vote could prove to be decisive in the battle between Berlusconi and centre - left leader Walter Veltroni to take over from Romano Prodi , whose government collapsed in January .
Just over 1.2 million votes have been cast overseas .
Investigators believe the scam was set to take place in South America , where expatriate Italians handed in their votes to Italian consulates last week .
Aldo Micciche , a businessman who moved to Venezuela after being convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy in Italy , is suspected of planning with the Calabria - based ' Ndrangheta to fill in 50,000 blank ballot slips obtained from corrupt officials , Corriere della Sera wrote yesterday .
Micciche denied the allegations .
The Interior Minister , Giuliano Amato , confirmed he had been alerted by investigators in Reggio Calabria , capital of the Calabria region , about possible electoral fraud in South America .
He added that controls had been tightened .
Dell ' Utri confirmed on Friday that he had been contacted by Micciche , who told him he could help to promote Berlusconi's Freedom Folk party to expatriate voters in South America .
' I put him in touch with our representative , Barbara Contini , ' Dell ' Utri told Il Giornale .
' That was the end of the matter .
This person was interested in organising the vote of Italians abroad , as are many people who are linked to all parties and in all parts .
I do not see what the problem is .'
Barbara Contini , who was governor of the Iraqi town of Nasiriyah when it fell under the responsibility of Italian troops , said that no candidates for Berlusconi 's party abroad were involved in electoral fraud .
But Corriere della Sera alleges that police wiretap transcripts show Micciche told Dell ' Utri on the phone : ' It will be enough to pay a staffer ...
Those responsible for the vote will shut both eyes when one of our people retrieves all the unfilled slips and puts a cross in the Freedom Folk box . '
The fee asked was € 200,000 , the newspaper added .
Italian newspapers said investigators believe that Micciche was working with members of the Piromalli clan , part of the Calabrian ' Ndrangheta Mafia , which has recently overtaken its Sicilian and Neapolitan counterparts thanks to drug trafficking and its ties to Colombian cartels .
Quoting leaked police documents , Corriere della Sera claimed that Micciche asked two leading members of the clan to visit Dell ' Utri at his Milan office .
Dell ' Utri was taped after the meeting , the newspaper wrote , complimenting Micciche for introducing him to two ' good picciotti , ' a Sicilian word for youngster used to describe low - level mafiosi .
Dell ' Utri has risen through the political ranks after running an advertising firm owned by the media magnate .
At the end of his second term as Prime Minister , between 2001 and 2005 , Berlusconi changed the electoral law to allow Italians resident abroad to elect six senators and 12 parliamentary deputies .

" Mondo Joe " at DU came up with the following little gem of a screenshot from Conservadepia , which bills itself as " An encyclopaedia with articles written from a conservative viewpoint " or " The Trustworthy Encyclopedia " ...
Hilarious enough on its own .
But not one to run something without checking it first , we stopped by the statistics page ourselves last night just to verify it .
And while it looks like the " Most viewed pages " have changed slightly , the latest batch of Wingnut faves , as seen in the screenshot below , is no less telling ...
UPDATE : Looks like this observation of the amusing obsessions of Conservapedia denizens ( albeit , sans the new Hitler addition ) has made it's way around the ' sphere at various times over the past several months .
The earliest found example , so far ( hat - tip RAW STORY's Ron Brynaert ) seems to be Andrew Sullivan 's coverage last November .
None of which makes any of it less amusing , of course .
When Stanley J. Seeger gave Princeton $ 2 million for Hellenic studies nearly three decades ago , the gift ’s income paid for two courses in modern Greek and trips to Greece for five .
But the Seeger money , which must be spent only on matters Greek , is now worth $ 33 million , multiplying through aggressive investing like the rest of Princeton ’s endowment .
So the university offers Greek , Greek and more Greek  13 courses this semester , including “ The Image of Greece in European Cinema ” and “ Problems in Greek History : Greek Democracy , ” as well as trips to Greece and nearby areas for more than 90 students and faculty members last year .
The history department recently hired its second Byzantine specialist .
And the fund paid half the cost of a collection of 800 rare coins from medieval Greece .
“ Institutions do get shaped by the interests of donors , ” said Robert K. Durkee , vice president and secretary of Princeton .
As the nation ’s wealthiest colleges and universities report on their finances to Congress , seeking to head off federal requirements that they spend at least 5 percent of their endowment assets each year , new attention is being paid to how endowments are structured , and on the restrictions imposed by donors .

Explanation : Even if the Moon really were made of green cheese it probably would n't look this bizarre .
Still , this mosaic of 53 images was recorded by the Jupiter - bound Galileo spacecraft as it passed near our own large natural satellite in 1992 .
The pictures were recorded through three spectral filters and combined in an exaggerated false - color scheme to explore the composition of the lunar surface as changes in mineral content produce subtle color differences in reflected light .
Familiar to earthdwellers , the lunar near side is on the left , but the space - based view looks down on the Moon 's north pole located in the upper half of the image near the shadow line .
Blue to orange shades indicate volcanic lava flows .
The dark blue Mare Tranquillitatis at the lower left is richer in titanium bearing minerals than the green and orange maria above it .
Near the bottom of the image and to the right of Tranquillitatis is the dark oval - shaped Mare Crisium surrounded by shocking pink colors indicating material of the lunar highlands .

Repealing America 's blue laws not only decreased church attendance , donations and spending , but it also led to a rise in alcohol and drug use among people who had been religious , according to a new study by economists Jonathan Gruber of MIT and Daniel Hungerman of the University of Notre Dame .
Blue laws , or Sunday closing laws , refer to statutes that restrict certain activities on the Christian Sabbath .
By the end of the 19th century , nearly every state had at least some law prohibiting certain activities on Sunday .
The 1960s saw the beginning of push to repeal these laws in favor of commerce , although a few still remain on the books .
In their study , which appears in the May 2008 edition of The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Gruber and Hungerman show what happens when religious services must compete with shopping , hobbies and other activities .
To measure that competition , they studied the large number of states that repealed their blue laws over the past 50 years .
( Massachusetts , for example , repealed its blue laws in 1994 . )
" That policy - driven change in state laws allowed us to identify secular competition , as opposed to interreligious competition , which had been studied before , " Gruber says .
" We wanted to find out how people spent their time and money . "
The economists used data from the General Social Survey on religious attendance and from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to show a very strong reduction in religious attendance and a decline in religious contributions once the blue laws were repealed .
They found no change in other charitable activity , Gruber notes .
To confirm their findings and to complete the economic portrait , the authors also analyzed budget data for four major Christian denominations over the past 40 years .
Church expenditures declined significantly since the repeal of the blue laws , they found .
Gruber and Hungerman did more than track how individuals chose to allocate their resources on Sunday once the malls were opened , a change widely celebrated from the early 1960s onward as freedom from old - fashioned ways .
They considered the negative consequences for individuals or society from loosening secular constraints and they found those consequences in behaviors associated more with Saturday night than Sunday morning .
Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ( NLSY ) on consumption of alcohol and illegal drugs , the economists found that repealing the blue laws did lead to an increase in drinking and drug use .
What 's more , they found that individuals who had attended church and stopped after the blue laws were repealed showed the greatest increase in substance abuse , Gruber notes .
Those effects have significant economic and social implications , the authors say .

It might have been the greatest lost weapon of World War II .
Major - General JFC
Fuller , the man credited with developing modern armored warfare in the 1920s , called failure to use it " the greatest blunder of the whole war . "
He even suggested that British and American tank divisions could have overrun Germany before the Russians – if it had been deployed , that is .
I 've been looking at a new range of strobing weapons , which use flickering lights to subdue criminals and insurgents .
But it turns out that the disorienting power of such lights was discovered decades before .
The secret weapon Fuller was referring to was the Canal Defence Light – a powerful searchlight mounted on a tank , with a shutter allowing it to flicker six times a second .
The 13 - million candlepower searchlight – intended to illuminate the battlefield and dazzle the enemy – was described in a fascinating article on the CDL Tanks of Lowther castle :
The angle of the beam dispersion was 19 degrees which meant that if the CDL tanks were placed 30 yards apart in line abreast , the first intersection of light fell about 90 yards ahead and at 1000 yards the beam was 340 yards wide by 35 feet high .
This formed triangles of darkness between and in front of the CDL's into which could be introduced normal fighting tanks , flame - throwing Churchill Crocodiles and infantry .
A further refinement was the ability to flicker the light .
On the order given for ' Scatter ' , an armour plated shutter was electrically oscillitated back and forward at about six times a second .
When first produced it was thought that this flicker effect ( similar to the modern disco strobe lights ) would have a damaging effect on the eyes of any observer and might cause temporary blindness .
It was the flickering aspect that made the CDL special .
The makers found that when it was employed , it was impossible to locate the vehicle accurately .
In one test , a CDL - equipped vehicle was driven towards a 25 - pound anti-tank gun .
Even as it closed from 2000 yards to 500 yards , the gunners ( firing practice rounds , one assumes ) were unable to hit the tank .
When asked to draw the route taken by the CDL tank , the observers drew a straight line , while in fact the tank had been crossing the range from side to side .
Spraying the area with machine - gun fire would not work either ; the armored reflector of the searchlight kept functioning , even after being hit repeatedly .
Although the CDL did not have the kind of disabling effect that the light - based personnel immobilization device currently being developed by Peak Beam for the US Army has , the type of disorientation seems quite similar .
If it had been used at much closer range then more dramatic effects – dizziness , loss of balance and the infamous nausea – might also have been observed .
However , with its mechanical shutter , the technology was much more primitive than the strobing Xenon light developed by Peak Beam .
It produces a ' squarer ' pulse and is significantly more effective than earlier strobes .
Over three hundred CDLs were built – using Matilda , Churchill and Grant tanks – and might have played a major role after D - Day .
But instead , they remained unused .
There seem to have been two reasons for this .
On the one hand , the power of the CDL was kept extremely secret .
" Even the Generals who should have used it did not know what the tank could do , " complained its inventor , Marcel Mitzakis .
And those that had heard of it had trouble believing that a simple flickering light could have any effect .
Fuller was one of the few who appreciated what the CDL might have achieved .
Another use of flickering lights in World War II was the proposal by Jasper Maskelyne , a stage magician employed by the British military .
( A very colorful account of Maskelyne 's role is given in the book The War Magician - reading it you might think he won the war single - handed . )
The magician was given the task of making the Suez Canal invisible to enemy bombers .
When the idea of constructing an illusion using mirrors was rejected as impractical , another plan was formulated , as this site on Maskelyne describes :
Maskelyne came up with the unorthodox idea of constructing 21 ' dazzle lights ' along the length of the Canal .
These powerful searchlights , containing 24 different spinning beams , projected a swirling , cartwheeling confusion of light up to nine miles into the sky .
A barrage of light to confuse and blind the enemy bombers , which Maskelyne dubbed Whirling Spray .
Fisher claims that this radical defensive shield of light was highly effective and was a major reason why the Suez Canal remained open for the duration of the war .
However , in spite of the book 's claims , the dazzle light were never actually built ( although a prototype was once tested ) .
Is the power of strobe lights just an illusion based on hype , like Maskelyne 's whirling spray ?
Or a significant new weapon that will be ignored or shelved because people are either ignorant of it or do n't believe ...?

Google on Monday stood its ground against demands from Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) that videos by Islamic radicals be removed from YouTube .
Google was responding to a letter in which Lieberman suggested that by allowing such videos to remain on the site , Google was assisting in terrorist recruitment and training .
But while Google did remove some videos depicting violence and " hate speech , " the company reiterated its support for free speech and refused to remove videos espousing radical ideas but not depicting or advocating violence .
In his Monday letter , Lieberman asserted that " Islamist terrorist organizations rely extensively on the Internet to attract supporters and advance their cause . "
He said that there were dozens of videos on YouTube that are officially branded as belonging to Islamist organizations .
And he said that many of these videos depicted or advocated violence , which are already prohibited by the YouTube 's existing terms of service .
But Lieberman demanded that Google go further , explicitly banning content from government - designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations , regardless of the nature of the content .
Lieberman suggested that this would be a " straightforward task " because Islamist organizations have not been shy about branding their own materials .
Sen. Lieberman
In its response , posted to Google 's Public Policy blog later that same day , Google expressed its appreciation to Lieberman for raising concerns about terrorist material on YouTube .
Google said that it had reviewed the videos identified by Sen .
Lieberman 's office and had removed those that depicted or advocated violence or featured " hate speech . "
But it also emphasized the enormous logistical challenges involved in filtering the hundreds of thousands of videos that are posted to YouTube every day .
Because it 's not possible for Google to individually review that many videos , Google relies on its users to flag inappropriate videos for review by Google staff .
Google rejected Lieberman 's demand that all videos from designated terrorist groups be removed from YouTube .
The video - sharing site " encourages free speech and defends everyone 's right to express unpopular points of view , " the blog post said , and reiterated Google 's stance against removing videos simply because of their source .
Lieberman 's staff on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee did not return our calls requesting comment , but after posting this story , we received an e-mailed statement from the Senator 's office .
" In response to my letter , Google apparently has taken 80 videos off YouTube that violated the company ’s own guidelines against gratuitous violence .
That is a start but it is not enough , " reads the statement .
" Videos produced by al - Qaeda and al - Qaeda affiliates showing attacks on American troops remain on YouTube ’s website and violate YouTube ’s own community guidelines .
Those videos should be taken down immediately ...
No matter what their content , videos produced by terrorist organizations like al - Qaeda , that are committed to attacking America and killing Americans , should not be tolerated .
Google must reconsider its policy . "
Lieberman 's letter Monday pointed to a report by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs , which Lieberman chairs , on the increasing use of the Internet for terrorist recruitment and training .
As Richard Koman notes , only one YouTube video is referenced in the report : a music video featuring inflammatory lyrics like " Peace to Hamas and the Hezbollah / OBL pulled me like a shiny star / Like the way we destroyed them two towers ha -ha , " but it 's plainly not a terrorist training video .
It does include news footage of violent events like the September 11 attacks , the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981 , and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But these can't be sufficient grounds for taking down the video ; such events are regularly depicted in the mainstream media , and videos of these events are readily available on YouTube .
Google is understandably reluctant to set a precedent by removing videos simply because they express a favorable opinion of violent acts .
151 Congressmen Derive Financial Profit From War
Blood money stains the hands of more than 25 % of members of the U.S. House and Senate
By Ralph Forbes
Who profits from the Iraq war ?
More than a quarter of senators and congressmen have invested at least $ 196 million of their own money in companies doing business with the Department of Defense ( DoD ) that profit from the death and destruction in Iraq .
According to the latest reports , 151 members of Congress invested close to a quarter - billion in companies that received defense contracts of at least $ 5 million in 2006 .
These companies got more than $ 275.6 billion from the government in 2006 , or $ 755 million per day , according to FedSpending.org , a website of the watchdog group OMBWatch .
Congressmen gave themselves a loophole so they only have to report their assets in broad ranges .
Thus , they can be off as much as 160 percent .
( Try giving the IRS an estimate like that . )
In 2004 , the first full year after the present Iraq war began , Republican and Democratic lawmakers - both hawks and doves - invested between $ 74.9 million and $ 161.3 million in companies under contract with the DoD .
In 2006 Democrats had at least $ 3.7 million invested in the defense sector alone , compared to the Republicans ' " only " $ 577,500 .
As the war raged on , so did the billions of profits - and personal investments by Congress members in war contractors , which increased 5 percent from 2004 to 2006 .
Investments in these contractors yielded Congress members between $ 15.8 million and $ 62 million in personal income from 2004 through 2006 , through dividends , capital gains , royalties and interest .
Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Rep. James Sensenbrenner ( R - Wis. ) , who are two of Congress 's wealthiest members , were among the lawmakers who garnered the most income from war contractors between 2004 and 2006 : Sensenbrenner got at least $ 3.2 million and Kerry reaped at least $ 2.6 million .
Members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees which oversee the Iraq war had between $ 32 million and $ 44 million invested in companies with DoD contracts .
War hawk Sen. Joe Lieberman ( IConn . ) , chairman of the defense - related
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , had at least $ 51,000 invested in these companies in 2006 .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , who voted for Bush 's war , had stock in defense companies , such as Honeywell , Boeing and Raytheon , but sold the stock in May 2007 .
Of the 151 members whose investments are tied to the " defense " ( war )
industry , as far as we know , not one of them offered to donate their bloodstained profits to the national treasury to offset the terrible debt they have imposed .
Has one of them even offered to donate one cent of their war profits to lessen the debt that increases more than $ 1 million a minute ?
When our boys and girls are wounded the government bills them to return their reenlistment bonus .
They have to return any pay they received while they were hospitalized .
They have to pay for their helmets and uniforms that are destroyed in the hell of war .
But they keep on fighting for these politicians ' right to keep their war profits .
• Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) $ 3,001,006 to $ 5,015,001
• Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) $ 250,001 to $ 500,000
• Rep. Kenny Ewell Marchant ( R - Tex . ) $ 162,074 to $ 162,074
• Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) $ 115,002 to $ 300,000
• Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R - N.J. ) $ 115,002 to $ 300,000
• Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. ) $ 100,870 to $ 100,870
• Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. ( R - Wis. ) $ 65,646 to $ 65,646
• Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) $ 50,008 to $ 227,000
• Rep. Sam Farr ( D - Calif . ) $ 50,001 to $ 100,000
• Rep. Stephen Ira Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) $ 45,003 to $ 150,000
There never was an exit stategy only lies & war profits .
While they profit we pay in higher taxes , cut services & higher gas prices .
We now have an exit strategy & it is called : General Strike 9/11/08 .
" Sooner or later all freedom loving Americans will realize that the only way to stop those who would bleed our nation dry , dismantle our constitution , and dissolve our national sovereignty is to say I will not work for you , buy from you , fight for you , or die for you , until the criminals are gone from the halls of our government .

Life Hell Hath No Fury Like the Seattle Symphony ’s Pacific Northwest Community Orchestra Scorned

Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa strolled to the microphone , his jacket slung over his shoulder , a broad smile on his face .
“ What a wonderful day , ” he said to the reporters and American Lung Assn. members gathered in Echo Park .
“ All these cameras , all these good people here to celebrate good news .
Put a smile on your faces , everybody .
. . .
“ Today I ’m proud . . . to say for the first time , it feels good to be No. 2 . ”
After nearly a decade at the top , the Los Angeles region has been “ bested ” by the Pittsburgh metropolitan area for the No. 1 spot on the “ Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short - Term Particle Pollution . ”
From 2004 to 2006 , the area from Los Angeles east to Riverside and south to Long Beach had far fewer 24 - hour periods of unhealthy particulate readings than the Steel City .
But the region still was the worst offender in the nation for ozone levels and yearly overall particle pollution readings , according to the American Lung Assn .'s annual “ State of the Air ” study released Wednesday .
Advertisement
“ But we ’re still on the list , ” said Villaraigosa , who mentioned that he recently suffered a bout of bronchitis , one of the ailments the Lung Assn. cited in its “ F ” grade for nearly all of Southern California .
“ Moving forward , we still have our work cut out for us , ” he said .
The study tracked ozone as well as daily and annual readings for small particles in cities and counties across the country .
The rest of the state did not fare well , either :
Five of the eight metropolitan areas listed as most polluted by all three measures used by the association were from California .
These included Los Angeles - Long Beach - Riverside and the Central Valley areas of Bakersfield , Fresno , Visalia - Porterfield and Hanford - Corcoran .
The San Diego metropolitan area made the list of top 25 most ozone - polluted cities at No. 12 .
In all , 26 of the 52 counties monitored in the state received “ F ” grades , for having the most unhealthy high - ozone days or particle - pollution days .
Nineteen counties , primarily coastal , received “ A ” grades .
And Salinas , Redding and the San Luis Obispo region were among the top 25 cleanest U.S. cities for long - term particle pollution .
Advertisement
An “ F ” grade is equivalent to nine or more days of air quality at the level defined as “ unhealthy ” by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Ozone is the primary ingredient in smog and is formed when sunlight and heat react with chemicals released from tailpipes , smokestacks or other things burning fossil fuels .
The effect of ozone on the lungs can be severe .
“ Imagine putting acid right on your eye , ” said Dr. Tony Gerber , a volunteer with the lung association .
“ It is that corrosive . ”
Particle pollution refers to a mixture of tiny solid and liquid particles in the air that get released , for example , from diesel exhaust , coal - fired power plants and burning wood , fields or forests .
These particles can get trapped in the lungs .
Both ozone and particulate pollution have been linked to serious respiratory ailments and premature deaths .
About 8,800 deaths in California can be tied to ozone and particle pollution , according to Dr. Sonal Patel , an allergist and pediatrician with White Memorial Medical Center in East L.A. .

San Bernardino , Riverside , Los Angeles and Orange counties all received failing grades for unhealthy ozone and particle - pollution days .
San Bernardino County , the worst offender in high - ozone days in the country , averaged 90 per year , followed by Kern with 83 , Riverside with 77 , Tulare with 68 , and Los Angeles with 65 .
Orange County , which did not make the top 25 list , averaged seven unhealthy ozone days .
The failing grades for ozone were improvements over last year .
The study did not use newly tightened EPA standards for ozone exposure , which would have added to tallies of unhealthful air days .
Over the last decade , California particle pollution levels have dropped by nearly a third .
The association credited that drop primarily to tighter engine and emission standards at the state and federal level .
“ As the Los Angeles metropolitan area really continues what has been our tradition -- aggressive air pollution control -- sooner or later other cities that have not been so aggressive are going to start popping up as No. 1 from time to time , ” said Sam Atwood , a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District .
Advertisement
If the trend continues , Pittsburgh will top Los Angeles in both long - and short - term particle pollution lists next year , said Janice Nolen , assistant vice president of national policy and advocacy for the American Lung Assn .
Villaraigosa touted the Clean Air Action Plan , passed in November 2006 and which addresses port - related pollution , as key to continuing the progress , as well as a city effort to invest in renewable energy .
“ In a city known for smog and sprawl , we ’ve made some significant progress , ” Villaraigosa said .
“ But we still have work to do . . . so in the coming years Los Angeles is completely off the list . ”

Introduction
When Apple launched its MacBook Air , it was rumored that Lenovo would follow up with a 13 " ultra- portable laptop .
Lenovo did just that in February when it launched its X300 .
We focus on the X300 , but include comparisons with the MacBook Air .
Lenovo ’s high - end portable PC is comparable with the MacBook Air in two ways : its price , which is well over $ 2,500 , and its 13.3 " size .
But that is where the comparison between the two systems ends as the X300 clearly targets a different market than Apple ’s machine does .
That being said , it still did n’t seem unreasonable for us to compare the two .
Our article focuses on the technical aspects of the X300 , a later article on Tom ’s Guide will concentrate more on ergonomics and the machine ’s operating system .
A professional demographic
The X300 targets a different crowd than the one that the MacBook Air does .
While Apple ’s machine is more geared for the general public ( it is based on Apple ’s classic style ) , Lenovo ’s laptop was designed more with professionals in mind .
The X300 ’s design is sober and much less in - your - face than Apple ’s is .
Some of the X300 ’s features also indicate that the machine was n’t designed for the general public but for users with work - related application needs .
Still , the X300 should appeal to non-professional users as well , with its 13.3 " screen and light weight of 3.5 lb .
The X300 puts its Intel Core Duo 2 processor to use for power savings and offers an abundance of features .
That ’s what the organizers say anyway .
Welcome to the world of lunatics and masochists – that ’s what it says when you visit the “ About ” page on the official site of Le Marathon des Sables .
And I do n’t think they ’re just saying that , I think they mean it .
After all we are talking about 243 km of desert over a period of 6 days .
That ’s 5 and a half normal marathons of running through the sand , with a backpack on , in a temperature of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit .
You have to prepare your own food , so be careful what you bring with you as well as set up a tent to camp out over night in the unwelcoming Sahara desert .
Food is rationed and handed out at specific checkpoints , so you have to reach them in order to get some water .
Equipment is apparently very important as the rough terrain can do irreparable damage to your feet ( you ’ll be running on uneven , rocky , stony ground as well as sand dunes ) .
Now comes the crazy part , if you ’re crazy enough to register for Le Marathon , you ’ll need to come up with $ 5000 to pay the entrance fee , not to mention all the money you have to spend on equipment , traveling and training .
They should ’ve said most expensive race too !

Today , a satellite was involved in your life .
Whether you checked a weather report , watched SportsCenter or looked for your mom's house on Google Maps , you did something that would have been impossible without an automated spacecraft orbiting hundreds of miles above your head .
But how many of these satellites do you know by name ?
Here are the top ten you need to know , because they make modern life possible .
Advertisement
First , two caveats : most of these satellites are representative of an entire class of satellites .
There may be others that serve similar functions , but the satellites listed are exemplars .
Also , the list is obviously U.S.- centric .
If you live in Europe or Asia , there are likely different satellites that fill the roles of these all - star orbiters .

Hubble Space Telescope -
By taking thousands of breathtaking photos unhindered by the blurring effects of Earth 's atmosphere , the Hubble has brought the beauty and mystery of space to more people than any other observatory , not to mention the massive amount of scientific research accomplished with it .
Galaxy 14 - This communications relay carries digital TV signals for much of the east coast , including ESPN , Lifetime , Sci-Fi , CNN , A&E and my personal favorite , the History Channel .

GOES - 12 - From its high - altitude geosynchronous orbit , GOES - 12 keeps a constant watch on weather conditions in most of North America .
The Moon - Tides , werewolves , the Apollo Program : without our natural satellite , we'd have none of these things .

KH -13 - This U.S. spy satellite is so secret , even the name is probably wrong ( the government started giving them random names after people caught onto to the KH numbering system ) .
Who knows what black budget , cutting edge satellite intelligence gathering devices are capable of these days ?
GPS IIR11 - The U.S. government 's NAVSTAR program brought global positioning abilities first to the military , then to the general public .
It takes a constellation of these things for the system to work , so IIR11 is just one cog among many .
Without it , there 'd be no geocaching !

GoldenEye -
With the ability to fire an EM pulse that could have wiped out an entire nation 's financial records , GoldenEye is typical of fictional satellites and representative of our fears of orbiting weapons .
International Space Station -
It 's a symbol of international cooperation and a frontier outpost in the quest to colonize space .
The low orbit maintained by the ISS makes it one of the easiest satellites to spot with the naked eye .

NOAA 17 - Unlike the GOES satellites , the NOAA satellites have asynchronous orbits , spinning around the globe to spot developing weather patterns that affect billions of people .
LANDSAT 7 - NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey teamed up in the 1970s to create a catalogue of Earth images shot from space .
Since then , not only has the data improved with huge advances in digital photography , but numerous companies ( including Google ) have licensed the images for their mapping software .

“ Autonomous Spheres ” is Nashville indie artist , Wen Tilley ’s , third solo record .
So many influences abound in Tilley ’s compositions that it ’s hard to define what genre they belong .
From the ironic jazzy complexity of “ It ’s Not Complicated ” , to the rock laden apocalyptic manifesto of “ Johnny Countdown ” , there ’s truly something for everyone in this eclectic 13 song collection .
Wen Tilley sings and plays most of the instruments on his records .
Guest appearances on his latest record , “ Autonomous Spheres ” , include New Orleans monster drummer , Terence Higgins , ( Ani Defranco , Warren Haynes , Don Was ) , Dan Dugmore on pedal steel , ( Linda Ronstadt , James Taylor ) , Mickey Raphael on harmonica , ( Willie Nelson , U2 ) , and Marc Broussard keyboardist , Andy Bourgeois .
This will be Wen Tilley ’s third solo record .
Tilley ’s music falls into the Alternative / Roots genre .
His influences are varied not hard to hear :
As an exceptional guitarist , one hears Hendrix , Pat Metheny , along with rock guitarists like Jimmy Page and Clapton .
But his songwriting verges into artists like Elvis Costello , Squeeze , and folk artists like John Prine .
With avid music lovers as parents , Tilley admits he grew up listening to all kinds of music .
It would not be unusual for his parents to have Bach on one minute , then Led Zeppelin on next .
Tilley feels his own compositions are a reflection of all those many influences , trying to glean the most loved aspects of those artists into his own amalgamation .
Though originally from south Louisiana – and yes , one hears the sound of New Orleans in a few of his tunes – Tilley now resides in Nashville , working as an independent producer there .
He began playing guitar at age 11 and was playing professionally by age 13 .
He graduated from the Baton Rouge High Magnet School program winning All - State Jazz Guitarist two years in a row his junior and senior year .
Later , he formed the rock group , Func Haus , who were picked up by Chrysalis Records .
He then began a career in music production opening a studio in Baton Rouge , La. , Kingfish Recordings Inc. , where he produced and mixed hundreds of artist recordings and composed and produced three film scores .
Moving to Nashville in 2001 , Tilley has been mostly a “ gun for hire ” as a producer / mixer / guitarist for various artists .
“ Autonomous Spheres ” is the artist ’s third solo record .
“ It ’s an album of personal reflection .
Many areas are covered – death , marriage , children , politics , and heartbreak to name a few . ”
As an artist , Tilley ’s only hope for the record is that there will be those who take something away from it .
Maybe gather a perspective they had n’t seen before .
Experience an epiphany or two .
But , peace to everyone is the overall message .
Tilley plans to tour wherever possible in support of the record .
Tour dates can be found at his website : www.wentilley.com
I 've been working on a few major projects lately and each time I 'm nearing completion of one , something even more tempting comes my way .
I 've got part 2 of the HTPC build process coming along , despite serious advances in hardware acceleration and mature platforms like AMD 's 780G there 's unfortunately no perfect HTPC setup at this point .
I 'll explain more in the article .
Hothead sent over a couple review copies of On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness , both Jarred and I have finished the game and it's just a matter of writing the review up .
Then there 's OCZ 's nia , the gaming input device that uses your facial muscles to control in - game actions like jumping and shooting .
I would be working on all of these things except that today an early sample of ASUS '
Eee Box arrived at my doorstep :
The Eee Box is the desktop brother of the The Eee Box is the desktop brother of the Eee PC
Like its mobile counterpart , the Eee Box is designed to be a low cost desktop that wo n't break speed records , but should be fast enough for basic tasks .
Opening the Eee Box Opening the Eee Box
The machine I received features a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor paired with an Intel 945G chipset , 1GB of DDR2 - 667 memory ( a single SO - DIMM module is installed ) and a 160 GB Seagate Momentus 5400.4 2.5 " SATA hard drive .
There is no optical drive but the machine has built in Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n wireless .
Bluetooth is also built in so you can setup the machine to only have two wires coming out of it ( DC power and DVI out to your monitor ) .
At the top we have the Intel 945GMCH , the sliver of a CPU in the middle is the Atom , to the left of it is a standard Core 2 Duo E7200 and to the right is the 802.11n card .
Above the 802.11n card is the sole SATA / power ports on the motherboard .
At the top we have the Intel 945GMCH , the sliver of a CPU in the middle is the Atom , to the left of it is a standard Core 2 Duo E7200 and to the right is the 802.11n card .
Above the 802.11n card is the sole SATA / power ports on the motherboard .
ASUS will be shipping three models of the Eee Box and unfortunately I do n't have pricing or availability information on any of them at this point .
I expect to have more details by the time the review is complete .
I do have some early impressions though :
My sample shipped with Windows XP , and the Atom processor is surprisingly quick .
I have n't tried putting Vista on it yet but so far this thing is more than sufficient for web surfing , email and basic office work .
And yes , YouTube / Hulu work just fine on it .
I 'm extremely impressed with the size and design of the machine , ASUS did a tremendous job here .
It feels fairly well built and comes in a form factor that 's quite similar to the Apple TV .
Ever since the release of the Mac mini I 've yet to see a PC maker really come close to introducing a competitor , but ASUS has finally done it with this thing .
There 's no optical drive but the machine is fairly well connected thanks to integrated Gigabit Ethernet , 802.11n and Bluetooth .
The system is n't passively cooled although I suspect it could be .
Unfortunately the fan is fairly noisy for the size of the system , at least in this early machine .
I 've already passed along the feedback to ASUS so we 'll see if any changes can be made before the thing ships .
Like most modern ASUS motherboards , the Eee Box can boot into Express Gate ( splashtop ) which gives you instant access to IM ( via Pidgin ) , Skype , a web browser or a photo browser .
While the Eee Box is fast enough to decode DivX / Xvid , it does n't have the horsepower to do full 1080 p H.264 .
I 've found that low bitrate 720 p H.264 is possible but with CPU utilization at around 90 % .
I would 've preferred if ASUS had used the mobile Atom processor as its chipset has full H.264 decode acceleration , although I get the impression that it 's not quite ready .
It all comes down to price .
At the right price , the Eee Box could be a very good machine to have in rooms around the house .
What would you all pay for something like this ?
I 'm working on performance testing now and I 'll keep you posted on how this thing stacks up .
I do n't have any VIA C7 based platforms in my lab so my first performance comparisons will unfortunately only be to Intel CPUs .
On a side note , after using Windows XP all day on this thing I 've completely forgotten how light the OS feels compared to Vista .
Celestial Impact is a free multiplayer - only game available for PC .
Celestial Impact is a team based multiplayer first person shooter ( FPS ) taking place on various asteroids floating in space .
But Celestial Impact is not your average team based multiplayer FPS .
What makes this FPS really special is that the landscape is fully deformable in all directions , each impact on the landscape affecting it differently depending on the weapon used .
But it is not limited to destruction ; the players also have the ability to add terrain to the landscape in the middle of combat using a special tool called Dirtgun .
With the Dirtgun , players can add or remove terrain during combat as they see fit , simply by aiming and firing the dirtgun .
Depending on the chosen action , this will either add or remove a chunk of dirt from the landscape .
So as the teams are battling , the landscape receives vast changes opening up for various tactical approaches each team can use .
The maps of the game
Each landscape ( map ) is a sphere - like asteroid with gravity pointing towards the center of the asteroid .
This means that players can take round trips around the asteroid assaulting the enemy from any direction .
Since the landscape is fully destructible , players could even approach from underneath by digging tunnels through the asteroid .
Game modes
Celestial Impact features several game modes such as a classic CTF ( Capture The Crystal in this case , CTC ) , a regular deathmatch mode ( DM ) and Crystal Rounds ( CR ) .
Crystal Rounds will prompt the players to defend one of their team - members alternatively assault one of the opposing team - members depending on which team currently has the crystal in their possession .
Build and dig your way around the landscape in various strategic ways as you seek out and steal the crystal from your opponents .
Weapons and tools
Apart from the regular weapon arsenal ( a minigun , a shotgun , a grenade launcher and a high - energy precision weapon ) each player is always equipped with the Dirtgun .
This tool has two modes .
The first is the dig - mode .
When using dig - mode the Dirtgun removes large chunks of terrain from the landscape in front of the player making it excellent for digging tunnels or breaking barriers .
The second mode is the build - mode .
When using build - mode the Dirtgun adds terrain in the form of a pre-selected shape in front of the player .
The shapes could be a simple cube , a part of a bridge or even a defensive wall .
The players are also always equipped with a melee weapon in form of a large portable drill - saw combination .
Game mode strategies
Since the attackers can come from any direction the teams will most likely spend a lot of time using the Dirtgun in build - mode to bolster their defence ( during CTC ) by building some sort of base around the crystal and repairing holes made by the opposing team .
When playing CR , the team currently having control of the crystal will want to stay close to the player holding the crystal and try to escort him / her away from the attackers , or build a small shelter and hold the area around the crystal carrier .
When playing DM the players will most likely want to use the Dirtgun as a means of transportation , by building bridges between pillars , digging tunnels towards the action on the other side of the wall or fire dirt right underneath their feet boosting them upwards .
Celestial Impact will keep the players engaged in a potentially fast - paced creative team battle where the players can exploit the strong and weak points of their own constructions as they battle for the crystal .
No round of the game will be similar to another due to the many amounts of ways the landscape can be deformed .
Just donâ€™t forget to shoot some at your opponents too .
If Ben Stein really wants to convince us all that evolution is a crock , he does n't need to make a documentary and play semantic games with Richard Dawkins .
He just has to sit us down and make us watch this episode of Star Trek : Voyager , where traveling at super - warp speed causes Janeway and Paris to super - evolve into lizards ( and make lizard babies . )
But it 's not just Voyager — science fiction provides a ton of evolution theories that make intelligent design seem downright sensible .

7 . When one person displays a new and bizarre ability , that 's the work of evolution , because survival of the fittest is making only the strongest genes survive .
Actually , if there 's only one person in the entire world who can shoot cherry - colored death rays out of his eyes , that 's not evolution — that 's a mutation .
It 's evolution if the cherry - eyebeam guy has a easier time mating with Famke Janssen than anyone else , and thus makes tons of babies , all of whom can do the red- eyeblast thing .
Mutations are only the building blocks of evolution , not the result of evolution .
Go back to school , Mohinder .

6. Evolution is puberty .
In the X - Men , for some reason , bizarre powers always manifest themselves whenever they first start getting hair in new and unusual places .
And it 's always treated as though the person 's development as an individual is a form of , or a manifestation of , evolution .
It 's like puberty goes hand in hand with the sudden emergence of weird new genes , and your changes as an individual is confused with the transformation of your whole species .
I also love the idea that there 's one X - gene , which somehow activates a whole range of powers , from heat - vision to being a chicken - man .

5 . Creatures with totally different ancestors will end up looking sorta the same , just because .
Biologist and science fiction author Joan Slonczewski says a big problem with most science fiction is that it depicts convergent evolution as happening all the time — that 's why aliens look sort of human , and aliens and humans can inter - breed .
In fact , divergent evolution is way , way more common than convergent evolution .
Divergent evolution is when creatures who share a single ancestor — like , say , mammals — evolve to be very different from each other over time .
You 're not likely to get just one unique creature in an ecosystem , like the great worm in Dune .
Instead , you 're likely to get a diversity of creatures from one ancestor .
Convergent evolution , when creatures with different ancestors evolve to be similar because they 're filling a similar evolutionary niche , is much rarer .
( An example of convergent evolution , says Slonczewski : birds , bats and flying fish . )
4 . Your children will inherit your body - mods .
Maybe the earliest evolutionary theorist was Jean - Baptiste Lamarck ( 1744-1829 ) who believed in the idea of " soft inheritance , " where you pass on your acquired characteristics to your kids .
If your body adapts to circumstances during your life — for example , if a particular organ gets smaller because you use it less — then your children will inherit it .
( That organ will be smaller in your kids . )
In fact , only genetic changes are passed on .
But that does n't stop science fiction from presenting changes to a creature 's body , or non-genetic adaptations that you make in the course of your life , as being heritable .
( Lamarck 's ideas are sometimes mischaracterized as , " if you lose a leg , you 'll have one - legged children , " but he was n't that silly . )
In David Cronenberg 's 1979 classic The Brood , a cutting - edge psychotherapy causes patients to manifest their darkest emotions in their own bodies — and one transformed woman gives birth to monster children that she can control telepathically .

3 . Humans could evolve overnight into a new species in just one generation .
In Greg Bear 's Darwin's Radio , humans ' junk DNA suddenly starts expressing , and certain people are strongly sexually attracted to each other .
These chosen people 's children , the ones who survive , are a radically different species from homo sapiens .
And Bear shows how this is just like when homo sapiens suddenly sprung up overnight , nearly 200,000 years ago .
The new breed of humans are super - intelligent and mega- awesome .
But it 's pretty unlikely that super - rapid evolution would happen within only one generation .
2 . It 's possible to de-evolve people with rayguns or whatnot .
Because evolution is a straight line and always happens in totally predictable ways , it 's also a reversible process .
You just need the right " de-evolution " device , like in the totally radical movie Mario Bros. , where Dennis Hopper 's King Koopa , who turns anyone who opposes him into a primordial sludge .
Or , in the Next Generation episode " Genesis , " a mutated T - virus from whiner - in - chief Reg Barclay causes everybody on the ship to start devolving — including Captain Picard , who starts turning into a lemur / pygmy / marmoset hybrid .
Because Picard 's too multi- faceted a guy to devolve into just one type of creature .
Something similar also happens in the Doctor Who episode " Ghost Light , " where an evolution - doubting clergyman is somehow de-evolved into an ape .

( Which reminds me : How exactly did " Ghost Light " 's interplanetary explorer / surveyor character travel all the way across the galaxy to survey Earth , but manage to be unaware of evolution ?
Is Earth the only planet where creatures do n't just stay the same forever ? )
1 . We can predict evolution and accelerate it with technobabble .
Random weird things , like going really really fast , or getting exposed to weird radiation , or just eating some weird fish , will cause you to evolve 1,000,000 years into the future , like in that Voyager clip above .
And then there 's the totally AWESOME Voyager episode where the crew meets the long - distant descendants of Earth 's dinosaurs , who are spacefaring and intelligent .
Janeway deduces they 're the great - great - great - great - grandkids of the dinos by asking the computer to predict dinosaur evolution millions of years ahead .
Because , of course , evolution is completely predictable in a vacuum , and you do n't need to know anything about enviornmental factors .
FLINT , Michigan
-- Will Foster never has too much trouble getting a parking spot for his second vehicle .
After all , who 's going to argue with a guy driving a half - scale Panzer tank complete with a working air cannon ?
Flint Journal extras
Tank details :
For the basics on Kettering University student Will Foster 's tank , check out the artillery rounds , er , bullet points below .
• Size : half - scale Panzer replica powered by three - cylinder diesel engine
• Cost : current parts total around $ 2,000 but Foster estimates more than $ 10,000 was spent on trial - and - error engineering .
• Top speed : 20 mph
• Additional features : camouflaged wooden shell , working tread system , air cannon on a 360 - degree turret that shoots varied munitions including golf balls and empty Red Bull cans .

" I took it home , driving it around in this white picket fence neighborhood and one of the neighbors called the cops on us , " said Foster , a Kettering University student who began building the tank from scratch nearly two years ago .
" ( Police ) came and they just told us to head back home , but they were also laughing at it because they had never seen anything like that before . "
That 's an understatement .
Roughly the size of a small car , Foster 's tank can reach speeds of around 20 mph with its three - cylinder diesel engine .
Just like the real thing , the tank runs on treads and has a 360 - degree cannon powered by compressed air from a scuba tank .
Its camouflaged plywood exterior has become a curious fixture at Foster 's Theta Xi fraternity house , where it is often parked next to a shed with a sign that reads " Panzer parking .
Violators will be totaled . "
A builder and tinkerer since he made his first tree house at age 9 , the Annapolis , Md. , native came up with his first designs for the tank when he was 14 .
But , he did n't have the money or manpower to pull it off .
Seeing golf carts dressed up as tanks in paintball competitions rekindled the idea and it gained momentum when he arrived at Kettering in the summer of 2006 .
" I said to the guys at the house , ' Can I build a tank in the parking lot here ? ' because lots of guys have their projects that they 're working on , " he said .
The whole house has had a hand in building the tank .
" It 's been a lot of trial and error .
As it is now I 've probably got $ 2,000 worth of parts on it , but about $ 10,000 total has gone into it because I 'd buy a $ 200 part that did n't work , then go to a $ 300 part that did n't work before finding a $ 50 part that did , " he said .
An early version based off the drive system of a lawn mower failed quickly , sending Foster and his cohorts to studying the hydraulic systems of Bobcat - style construction equipment .
It was a step in the right direction , but still there were problems .
Two more drive systems failed , and it took four major alterations to the tread to keep the tracks from slipping off the drive wheel .
Through it all Foster stayed intensely focused on solving problems as they crept up , impressing his fellow engineers to be .
" He 's a genius when to comes to visualization of a problem , seeing what needs to be done and figuring out every step along the way that needs to happen , " said Steve Sankey , 27 , a fraternity brother who pitched in on the tank 's construction .
" We 'd all work on it and there were lots of those lightbulb moments when we were trying to figure out a problem with it .
The tank has kind of become a part of Theta Xi . "
Aside from being a fun problem and curiosity -- " Kids run after us like we 're the ice cream man when we take it out , " Foster remarks -- the tank has given Foster valuable job experience .
After listing it on his resume Foster was recruited by armored vehicle maker Force Protection Inc. for a summer co-op job that he starts this month .
" They asked me a lot about it and that 's the kind of engineering job I 've always wanted , so it 's great , " he said .
" I 've always been a builder but not someone with all the book smarts , so I love stuff like this rather than being one of the people at school with great grades who can't turn a wrench . "
Foster 's predilection for tinkering -- his 1986 Chevy Silverado was rescued from a junkyard and now has a 10 - inch lift and 37 - inch wheels -- is endearing to girlfriend Heidi Clark , a recent Kettering graduate who has also helped problem solve and build the tank .
" When there 's a problem with it that 's all he 'll think about and he stays really , really focused on it until he can figure it out , " she said .
" It 's funny because he gets all these stares from people because they do n't know what this thing is or who would have something like that . "
He 's getting used to the stares -- even the frequent interest of police , especially when towing the tank on a trailer between Michigan and Maryland .
Usually , Foster said police just ask for his license and registration before sending him back on his way .
" I tried to not mention that it had a working cannon on top . "

Orphan works legislation has returned to Congress , and the controversy surrounding the bill is just as heated as it was the last time around , in 2006 .
While a broad coalition of libraries , museums , independent filmmakers , public interest groups , and commercial arts organizations such as the RIAA and the MPAA back the bill , several prominent visual artists ’ organizations have been rallying their members in opposition .
( For a discussion about orphan works , listen to the latest episode of EFF's Line Noise Podcast . )
EFF strongly supports the legislation .
Orphan works reform will dramatically expand the cultural commons , easing access to and use of a wealth of historical works that are presently locked away from public view .
It should help create a system in which artists get paid , the public sees more works , and unlawful infringement continues to be punished .
But the current legislation could be better , which is why we urge Congress to consider some small but significant changes that should alleviate the concerns of the visual arts community .
For those who have n’t been following this battle , here ’s a quick primer on the problem that this legislation is trying to fix .
Orphan works are those whose owner cannot be located .
Others who would like to use and share these works may hesitate to do so out of fear that they could later be found liable for copyright infringement because they did n’t get permission .
Consider the following examples :
A library has a vast archive of photos and music from the Depression Era .
It would like to put this archive online , so people who are n’t able to visit the library can use the works for pleasure , research , making art , etc .
But the library is unable to locate owners for twenty percent of the works in the archive and is afraid that if it displays the works online without permission , it would be sued for copyright infringement if those owners emerged later .
A documentarian stumbles upon an album full of photographs from the 1960s and is keenly inspired -- it 's a treasure trove of local history , with photos of politicians , celebrities , and events .
He asks if the thrift store can identify the person who brought the photo album in , but they simply do n't remember .
The documentarian wants to use some of the photos in a film , but he 's aware that use of the images could infringe someone ’s copyright .
By using the photos without permission , he could be opening himself up to thousands of dollars in damages , per photo , if the original photographer ( or his or her estate , or any legitimate owner of the copyright ) steps forward and sues him for copyright infringement .
The Orphan Works legislation would help resolve those fears and , in the process , encourage the display and re-use of these “ lost ” works .
Under the proposed law , individuals who would like to use an orphan work must put diligent effort into searching for the owner of the copyright in the work , based in part on best practices to be outlined by the Registrar of Copyright .
If that search comes up empty , they can use that work .
And , if at some future time the copyright owner comes forward to demand payment , the legislation requires the second author to negotiate with that owner in good faith to determine reasonable compensation for the use , and promptly pay that compensation .
And if the second author does n't follow the new rules under the law and simply uses the work without making a diligent search ?
The copyright owner can sue them under the current rules and potentially obtain statutory damages of up to $ 150,000 per work -- just as they can now .
Congress also plans to certify searchable databases for visual works like photographs , graphic arts , and textile designs that will collect information about works and contact information for the related copyright owners .
There are not “ formalities ” associated with these databases .
No artist will be required to “ register ” with the databases , and failure to register will not result in it being considered “ orphaned . ”
The legislation prioritizes the search for the copyright owner .
One of the proposed law 's strengths is that terms like “ diligent effort ” and “ reasonable compensation ” would allow the courts , the Copyright Office , and owner and user communities to adapt the requirements over time and address the needs and concerns of a variety of artists and rights holders .
By providing guidelines for what constitutes a “ qualifying search , ” the legislation would have a positive effect on artists by helping to provide a legal standard that can be used to hold bad faith infringers accountable .
While the legislation proposes changes that are sorely needed , some small but significant modifications would make the bill even more effective at enriching our culture .
First , the copyright databases must be free for everyone to use .
No one should be penalized for doing the right thing -- namely copyright owners for making themselves easier to contact about works and artists seeking copyright owners before making use of orphan works .
Second , the notice of use requirement included in the House version of the legislation should be jettisoned — it will add a layer of bureaucracy to the process , potentially invite “ copyright trolls ” and add an additional ( possible prohibitive ) expense to second users .
Ultimately , the Orphan Works legislation represents an extraordinary good faith effort on the part of the Copyright Office , technology policy groups , rights holders and our elected representatives .
While some changes are in order , this legislation gives Congress a crucial opportunity to revise the copyright law enrich the community at large and providing avenues of revenue and inspiration to generations of artists to come .
Here ’s hoping our elected officials take advantage of it !

“ A little learning is a dangerous thing , ” wrote Alexander Pope .
Daily , our 43rd president testifies to Pope ’s point .
Addressing the Knesset on the 60th anniversary of Israel ’s birth , Bush said those who say we should negotiate with Iran or Hamas are like the fools who said we should negotiate with Adolf Hitler .
“ As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared , ‘ Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement . … ”
Again , Bush has made a hash of history .
Appeasement is the name given to what Neville Chamberlain did at Munich in September 1938 .
Rather than fight Germany in another great war — to keep 3.5 million Germans under a Czech rule they despised — he agreed to their peaceful transfer to German rule .
With these Germans went the lands their ancestors had lived upon for centuries , German Bohemia , or the Sudetenland .
Chamberlain ’s negotiated deal with Hitler averted a European war — at the expense of the Czech nation .
That was appeasement .
German tanks , however , did not roll into Poland until a year later , Sept. 1 , 1939 .
Why did the tanks roll ?
Because Poland refused to negotiate over Danzig , a Baltic port of 350,000 that was 95 percent German and had been taken from Germany at the Paris peace conference of 1919 , in violation of Wilson ’s 14 Points and his principle of self - determination .
Hitler had not wanted war with Poland .
He had wanted an alliance with Poland in his anti-Comintern pact against Joseph Stalin .
But the Poles refused to negotiate .
Why ?
Because they were a proud , defiant , heroic people and because Neville Chamberlain had insanely given an unsolicited war guarantee to Poland .
If Hitler invaded , Chamberlain told the Poles , Britain would declare war on Germany .
From March to August 1939 , Hitler tried to negotiate Danzig .
But the Poles , confident in their British war guarantee , refused .
So , Hitler cut his deal with Stalin , and the two invaded and divided Poland .
The cost of the war that came of a refusal to negotiate Danzig was millions of Polish dead , the Katyn massacre , Treblinka , Sobibor , Auschwitz , the annihilation of the Home Army in the Warsaw uprising of 1944 , and 50 years of Nazi and Stalinist occupation , barbarism and terror .
In that same speech to the Knesset , Bush dismissed the idea we could ever successfully negotiate with Hamas , Hezbollah or Iran :
“ Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them that they have been wrong all along .
We have heard this foolish delusion before . ”
But did not Ronald Reagan ’s negotiations with the Evil Empire , as he rebuilt America ’s military might , bear fruit in a reversal of Moscow ’s imperial policy and an end to the Cold War ?
Richard Nixon went to China and toasted the greatest mass murderer of them all , Mao Zedong , when Maoists were conducting a nationwide purge : the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution .
Yet , Nixon ended a quarter century of implacable U.S. - Chinese hostility .
Was Nixon ’s trip to China useless ?
Three years after Nikita Khrushchev drowned the Hungarian revolution in blood , Ike had him up to Camp David .
John Kennedy ended the most dangerous confrontation of the Cold War , the Cuban missile crisis , by negotiating with that same Butcher of Budapest .
Were Ike , JFK and Nixon all deluded fools ?
For the dictators they negotiated with — Khrushchev and Mao — were far greater mass murderers and enemies of America than is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Bush ’s father negotiated with Syria ’s Hafez al - Assad , the Butcher of Hama , and made him an American ally in the Gulf War .
Was President Bush ’s father a deluded fool ?
The president ’s own diplomats negotiated an end to the nuclear program of Col. Gadhafi , who was responsible for the air massacre of American school kids over Lockerbie .
Bush ’s own diplomats are negotiating with Kim Jong - il ’s North Korea , a state sponsor of terror .
Ambassador Ryan Crocker is negotiating with Iranians in Baghdad .
Egypt is negotiating on behalf of Israel with Hamas to retrieve a captured Israeli soldier .
Are they all deluded fools ?
Bush refused to talk to Yasser Arafat because he was a terrorist .
But four Israeli prime ministers negotiated with Arafat .
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin shared a Nobel Prize with him .
“ Bibi ” Netanyahu ceded Hebron to him .
Ehud Olmert offered him 95 percent of the West Bank .
Were all four Israeli leaders deluded fools ?
True , the Chamberlain - Hitler summit at Munich proved a disaster , as did the FDR - Churchill - Stalin summits at Tehran and Yalta , and the JFK - Khrushchev summit in Vienna .
But JFK ’s diplomacy in the missile crisis may have averted a nuclear war .
And Eisenhower , Nixon , Gerald Ford and Reagan all met with foreign dictators with blood on their hands , without loss to America , and sometimes with impressive gains .
What has Bush ’s refusal to talk to Hamas , Hezbollah , Damascus and Tehran done to make either Israel or America more secure ?

The Best of Patrick J. Buchanan
Her hands draped around a friend 's shoulders , Dawnette Dockery vowed revenge yesterday on the people who killed her husband , taking his life in the living room while their family slept upstairs .
" Tell them I said it 's not over , " she said .
" Ask them why they have to do it .
He 's a good guy , a hard - working person .
They killed my husband for nothing .
Nothing . "
Dockery returned to her home near Victoria Park Ave. and Eglinton Ave. E. just hours after her husband O'Neil Dockery , 35 , was gunned down inside .
Barely able to stand by herself , she shuffled past police tape that still cordoned off four units in her family 's townhouse complex .
Until this weekend , residents said , it was a peaceful stretch of homes in an otherwise crime - riddled neighbourhood .
Shootings are commonplace , they said , in this close - knit , but rough housing project ; two years ago a man was killed a couple of streets away .
Neighbours were jolted out of bed around midnight Friday when police cars screeched to a halt before their bedroom windows .
Sounds of a woman crying brought them to their doors , residents said , before officers cautioned them a gunman was on the loose and to stay inside .
Dockery was shot around 11:47 p.m. , shortly after his wife found him sleeping on the living room couch .
She woke him to say goodnight before retiring to bed .
She peeked downstairs a few minutes later when she heard arguing , said her husband 's brother , Spurgeon Dennis , and she ran back to her room when she realized that a gun was fired .
Dennis , who described his brother as pleasant and quiet , found out about the shooting early yesterday morning .
A cousin called to tell him his brother was dead .
" I could n't believe it , " he said .
" He 's my younger brother . "
Dennis said O'Neil Dockery , one of eight children and originally from Jamaica , was a loving father to his 18 - month - old daughter Channelle and a good step - parent to Dawnette 's three girls , Sandrine , 14 , Serena , 16 , and Nicole , 19 , from a previous relationship .
Married to Dawnette for three years , his brother worked as an appliance deliveryman , Dennis said .
With no criminal record and no history of drugs or tangles with police , detectives are sifting through information to try to figure out how this man ended up Toronto 's most recent homicide victim , after a violent week that saw the lives of two others claimed by gun violence .
Nearby residents congregated outside various homes yesterday .
Michelle Brown , 46 , who said her children play with the Dockery kids , said if it had n't been for the rain , people would have been outside and could have spotted , maybe even warded off , the perpetrators .
" Maybe if we were sitting outside we could have prevented it , " she said .
" Now there 's a man dead and we 're going to have to bury him . "
Most Expensive U.S. Home Sold by Trump for $ 90 Million ( Photos , Video )
Donald Trump bought a seven - acre oceanfront property for $ 41.25 million in 2004 in an auction at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in West Palm Beach .
The previous owner , Abe Gosman paid $ 12.1 million for just the land in 1986 , county records show , and later had the estate built on the property .
The Donald has reportedly flipped the property and has more than doubled his original investment .
The new owner plans to bulldoze the never occupied structures and subdivide .
The French Regency mansion , Maison de L'Amitie has 80,000 square feet of space .
Features include an eight - car garage , pool house , 475 feet of oceanfront ; 18 bedrooms ; 20 - to - 40 - foot ceilings ; ballroom ; 4,100 square - foot conservatory with Venetian - style moldings and eight skylights ; media room ; art gallery ; carriage house and two guest houses .
Says Trump :
It 's just a fantastic piece of property , the biggest site , the biggest oceanfront , the best location in Palm Beach .
And Palm Beach is the richest community in the world . "
Trump claims to have spent $ 25 million on renovations before flipping the property back on the market for the asking price of $ 125 million , later reduced to $ 100 million .
Word is that a deal has been struck to the tune of $ 90 million .
The owner remains unnamed at this point and must have deep pockets indeed if he would sacrifice the palatial structures in order to subdivide the land .
Seems criminal .

Girl , 7 , who defied doctors to beat deadly brain cancer twice cheats death a THIRD time
Maya Perrin - Skippen is battling a rare form of brain tumour
A seven - year - old girl who is the only person who have survived a rare cancer twice has cheated death for a third time .
Maya Perrin - Skippen defied doctors ' grim predictions to become the only person in the UK to survive the aggressive brain tumour .
She travelled to America for specialist treatment but then caught an infection which left her in a coma .
Her father Steven , 28 , said : ' It 's been a traumatic week for us .
I did n't realise how close we came to losing her . '
The schoolgirl from Romford , Essex , almost died when her temperature peaked at 39.2 degrees Celsius .
Her anguished parents also face a huge financial struggle because they have been unable to find a company willing to give Maya health insurance .
Medical bills , drugs , and the hospital stay have so far cost Maya 's family £ 25,000 .
The hospital bed alone costs a staggering £ 1,000 per night .
' The bill is crazy , ' Steven told his local newspaper .
' How are we expected to pay for this when the fundraising was meant to help cure Maya , not to cure an infection ?
' It 's out nightmare situation . '
Despite doctors fearing the worst brave Maya has fought off the infection and is preparing to start pioneering treatment to fight the cancer , called malignant Pineoblastoma .
Her mum Natasha Perrin , 27 , and father Steven , who kept a bedside vigil are delighted their daughter has pulled through .
When Maya was diagnosed with the rare brain tumour in September 2006 she was only given a 50 per cent chance of surviving , but after a course of intensive chemotherapy and a seven hour biopsy the tumour disappeared .
A year later doctors discovered the cancer had returned and decided the best chance of saving Maya was to operate to remove the tumour - an operation which carried the real risk of blindness and death .
Surgeons successfully removed 95 per cent of the tumour but months later the cancer returned again and the only chance of treatment is at the specialist centre in Texas .
Her parents raised £ 77,000 to fly the family to a specialist centre in Houston - the only place which will treat the schoolgirl .
Her father said : " She is due to finally start the treatment on Monday and the doctor has said he is very hopeful . "
Maya 's father said British doctors have told him they cannot operate on his daughter and that chemotherapy would prolong her life but not cure her .
But after trawling the internet the family found a doctor in America willing to treat her .
" Two years ago , I found the Burzynski Clinic after many hours of online searching , " he said .
" I could n't believe what I was reading .
Dr Burzynski has cured many recurrent brain tumours with his pioneering Antineoplaston Therapy , which targets cancer cells without destroying normal cells .
" Tragically , this ground - breaking therapy has not been embraced by the medical authorities . "
The treatment works by flooding the body with amino acid and peptides which doctors hope will attack the cancer but leave healthy tissue unaffected .
" Dr Burzynski 's clinic is in Houston and is truly Maya 's only hope .
The treatment costs £ 50,000 per year .
This is such a small amount of money to save a life .
But is such a vast sum compared to my family 's means .
" I am certain it will cure my little angel of the cancer that has taken her over . "

The furious moans and groans about gasoline and heating oil prices have been met with a public - be - damned attitude from the oil industry -- and nothing is being done to rectify the problem .
Prices continue to sky - rocket .
Why not designate oil companies as public utilities ?
A public utility has been defined as " a business that provides an everyday necessity to the public at large " -- such as water , electricity , natural gas , telephone service , transportation , cable TV and other essentials .
Because of the need for and dependence on these commodities and products , the business of supplying them is readily subject to abuse .
Without regulation , price gouging can become rampant in a time of great demand and economic turmoil , such as this .
A public utility regulated by the state or federal government , or the two working together , is entitled to charge reasonable rates for its products and services .
It also is entitled to earn a reasonable profit .
But that 's far less than what Big Oil is making .
Public utilities are corporations that distribute dividends to their shareholders amounting to perhaps 5 percent a year of the stock 's value .
Oil energy fits squarely into the criteria for a public utility .
How can it be distinguished from electricity and natural gas ?
It ca n't be .
But right now , it 's a political " untouchable . "
The oil industry recently posted record earnings for 2007 , as it had for the previous two years .
Exxon Mobil , known as the industry gold standard , had a net income of $ 40.6 billion , attributed to surging oil prices .
For every blink of a second in 2007 , that amounted to $ 1,287 .
Exxon Mobil 's sales exceeded $ 404 billion , which was more than the gross domestic revenue of 120 countries .
Chevron and other big oil companies also announced the largest profits in history .
" Congratulations to Exxon Mobil and Chevron -- for reminding Americans why they cringe every time they pull into a gas station , " said New York Sen. Charles Schumer .
Some members of Congress have supported an excess profits tax .
Others have said the tax breaks accorded two years ago to encourage domestic production should be rescinded .
Advocacy groups say the profit margins are unjustifiable .
The oil industry 's defense relies on the economics of the market place and the mounting difficulties of competing with subsidized foreign oil companies -- PetroChina , Petrobras in Brazil , Gazprom in Russia .

The lack of domestic refinery capacity also has been cited as a reason for escalating prices .
What is left out of these various assessments and ripostes is , most importantly , the consumer .
The consumer 's only recourse is to reduce consumption .
But consumption most often is an economic necessity -- the most harmful effects falling on those who may be the neediest and who can least afford the price increases .
What is a less - than - wealthy person who must drive to work or pay for home heating oil to do ?
None of the proposals , such as an excess profits tax or a retraction of tax incentives , will directly benefit the public or make up for the overrides paid for oil products in the last several years .
On 9/11 , the price of a gallon of regular gasoline was about $ 1.25 .
It has climbed almost vertically since then .
In the past year , it has more than doubled and is now close to $ 3.50 .
Part of the problem is that the United States has no comprehensive energy policy or oversight .
For example , the war in Iraq for the last five years has placed a great demand on the availability of oil products -- both because of their use for military purposes and the lack of the predicted production of Iraqi oil .
Neither of these down sides have been quantified or publicized .
Both are important contributors to the high cost of oil energy .
And while our government wrings its hands , what is it really doing , geopolitically , to bring down prices ?
Given the political implications and the strength of the oil industry 's influence , the chances of regulating it are presently nonexistent .
However , the inordinate profits in the past several years , regardless of the explanations , cry out for demanding that oil be treated as a public utility .
It is an indispensable commodity , and the opportunity for abuse at the public 's expense is undeniable .
The industry has demonstrated that it will not regiment or control itself .
If the industry were confronted with even the mere possibility of becoming a government - regulated utility , gasoline and heating oil prices would come tumbling down in a hurry .

The Farc has been causing misery for decades , Washington says
Washington has poured billions of dollars of aid into Colombia to fight the rebel insurgency .
It was no surprise , then , that the US state department spokesman , Tom Casey , said the United States supported Colombia in its efforts to respond to what he called the " threat and challenge " of the Farc , which he described as a terrorist organisation .
Mr Casey said the Farc rebels " have been making life miserable for the people of that country for more than 20 years , and certainly there should be no one out there under any illusions as to what kind of organisation they are " .
Mr Casey also questioned the involvement in the affair of Venezuela , which like Ecuador , has ordered troops to the border with Colombia .
The US has sought to curtail the influence of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the region , and would like to cast the problem as a bilateral affair between Bogota and Quito .
But Washington is unlikely to be a major player in any solution to the crisis - that role will almost certainty be taken by leaders from Latin America .
They will have their chance on Tuesday , at an emergency meeting of the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) .
Brazil as mediator ?
Border sovereignty in Latin America is a sensitive issue , and its leaders will be under no illusions about the seriousness of the situation .
The last time there was a regional dispute involving a border , between Ecuador and Peru in 1995 , more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in the resulting hostilities .
Peru is among the countries which have lined up to criticise Colombia 's actions , while more still have urged restraint .
But the prospective leader of the diplomatic offensive is Brazil , the largest country in South America , a supporter of regional co-operation , and one which has mainly cordial relations with the three presidents involved .
A sign of Brazil 's likely strategy comes from its Foreign Minister , Celso Amorim , who says the OAS should set up a commission to investigate the facts .
" The territorial violation is very serious and needs to be condemned , " said Mr Amorim on Monday , adding that it was up to Colombia to make a positive move .
" A more explicit apology to Ecuador for the territorial violation would help contain the crisis . "
That may be the only generally accepted way to get all sides to step back from the edge .
Yet at today ’s oil prices , there is no shortage of companies coveting a contract in Iraq .
It is not only one of the few countries where oil reserves are up for grabs , but also one of the few that is viewed within the industry as having considerable potential to rapidly increase production .
David Fyfe , a Middle East analyst at the International Energy Agency , a Paris - based group that monitors oil production for the developed countries , said he believed that Iraq ’s output could increase to about 3 million barrels a day from its current 2.5 million , though it would probably take longer than the six months the Oil Ministry estimated .
Mr. Fyfe ’s organization estimated that repair work on existing fields could bring Iraq ’s output up to roughly four million barrels per day within several years .
After new fields are tapped , Iraq is expected to reach a plateau of about six million barrels per day , Mr. Fyfe said , which could suppress current world oil prices .
The contracts , the two oil company officials said , are a continuation of work the companies had been conducting here to assist the Oil Ministry under two - year - old memorandums of understanding .
The companies provided free advice and training to the Iraqis .
This relationship with the ministry , said company officials and an American diplomat , was a reason the contracts were not opened to competitive bidding .
A total of 46 companies , including the leading oil companies of China , India and Russia , had memorandums of understanding with the Oil Ministry , yet were not awarded contracts .
The no-bid deals are structured as service contracts .
The companies will be paid for their work , rather than offered a license to the oil deposits .
As such , they do not require the passage of an oil law setting out terms for competitive bidding .
The legislation has been stalled by disputes among Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish parties over revenue sharing and other conditions .
The first oil contracts for the majors in Iraq are exceptional for the oil industry .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Laura Neuman was raped when she was 18 years old .
It took nearly 20 years to identify her attacker , even though he'd been arrested six times before her attack and at least six times afterward .
Rape victim Laura Neuman pushed authorities to reopen her case and expand the DNA database .
Alphonso Hill pleaded guilty in September 2002 to raping Neuman and was sent to prison for 15 years .
A DNA sample , taken in prison , led to charges in six other rape cases .
Police say he's also a suspect in at least 20 rapes in the Baltimore , Maryland , area .
Hill denies raping any women besides Neuman , and his lawyer would n't comment .
If Hill is eventually proven guilty , Neuman believes that he could have been stopped .
" He could have been caught sooner if DNA had been taken and he had been matched to the cases that were unsolved , " she said .
" For me , it would have made a profound difference in having the case solved sooner and for many of these women , their cases would have been solved sooner . "
So she went public with her story , lobbying fiercely in her home state , Maryland , for a law that would require police to take DNA samples from everyone arrested for a violent crime .
She testified before the state Legislature .
Watch Neuman talk about her quest »
On Tuesday , Maryland 's bill was signed into law .
In January , the state expanding its DNA database , collecting samples from people arrested for murder , rape , and assault instead of just collecting DNA from convicted criminals .
Maryland is joining a dozen other states in expanding its database , and walking straight into controversy .
To supporters , building DNA databases with samples from the unconvicted is no different from collecting fingerprints .
Critics say it 's a complete violation of civil rights .
" This is information that leads to all sorts of basic data about who we are , our entire physical makeup , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union .
" That is really different than a few fingerprints . "
DNA and the states
These states require DNA from people arrested for some felonies :
Alaska , Arizona , California , Kansas , Louisiana , Minnesota , New Mexico , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas and Virgina .
Next year , California and North Dakota will require DNA from all felony suspects .
Source : National Conference of State Legislatures
Fredrickson added that there are already too many examples of racial profiling and innocent people being rounded up in police dragnets .
" Our privacy is a critical factor and we can't assume that everybody is guilty until they are proven themselves innocent , " she said .
Like it or not , it 's a trend that is gaining popularity .
At least 21 other states are considering proposals similar to Maryland's .
Changes are coming at the federal level as well .
The government soon will begin collecting DNA samples from anyone arrested or detained by the feds , including illegal immigrants .
" I think there is a valid public policy for doing that because there are many people who have committed crimes but who have never been convicted but have been arrested and without their DNA in the system we are not solving those crimes , " said Associate Attorney General Kevin O'Connor .
Most states with the new DNA arrestee laws require the police to automatically destroy the samples if suspects are found not guilty or the charges are dropped .
But federal authorities require a formal request before they 'll destroy a specific DNA sample .
Critics worry the data could be misused , a charge O'Connor disputes .
" Congress has passed a provision that says anybody who abuses this information , or uses it for non-law enforcement purposes such as to look at someone 's family history of diabetes or whatever the disease might be ... will be prosecuted , " he said .
Justice Department officials estimate when the expansion is fully implemented -- as soon as December -- information from about 1.2 million people a year could be added to the national DNA database .
It 's another cause of consternation for critics -- who say backlogs remain a major problem .
The FBI estimates that about a quarter of a million DNA samples have yet to be processed in its lab and says it did not receive any new funds to deal with the backlog , which is sure to grow even larger .
Many states are facing similar issues .
Critics worry that as workloads increase , catastrophic errors could be made .
" We have seen examples of crime labs that have not been able to get to the DNA testing that has ultimately led to finding a criminal , " the ACLU 's Fredrickson said .
" That is what we need to do , focus our resources on where they are actually going to make a difference . "
But proponents like Neuman say that criticism is shortsighted .
" Is it worth the risk to make sure that we get these cases solved and keep people behind bars who should be behind bars ? " she said .
" Those who are innocent have nothing to fear "
All About Crime • Maryland • U.S. Department of Justice
If these freaks of nature actually exist ( and we really hope some of them do n't ) , it proves beyond doubt that the whole world is just one big pile of bat - shit blithering fuckcrazy .
Every country has its own Bigfoot .
Some are terrifying , some are awesome , and some are just plain ridiculous .
We 've found the seven creatures that manage to be all three .
7 Tanzania : Popobawa
Tanzania is the perfect holiday destination for people who enjoy hot weather , beautiful sunsets and being sodomized in their sleep by an ethereal , bat - winged penis ogre .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Legend says that the beast known as Popobawa has been menacing the Tanzanian island of Pemba in his own unique style ever since the '70s .
He can be identified by his smell ( reputed to be quite pungent ) , and also by the fact that he is a one - eyed flying ogre with his spam javelin lodged in your rectum .
He attacks only men , sneaking into their houses at night and buttburgling them for up to an hour , then -- in an oddly familiar twist to anyone who reads superhero comics -- demanding that they tell all their friends about him .
Crime has a new enemy .
His name is PenisOgreRapistMan .
Popobawa has one eye , which is one more than this artist .

We know what you 're thinking , that this legend got started because some dude 's wife expressed curiosity about the odd grunts and slaps she heard when she came home unexpectedly one day .
The dude quickly threw out a story about an implausible marauding fuckmonster while the gardener hid in the closet and quickly put on his trousers .
That would not however explain the actual hysteria that surrounds the Popobawa , and the many alleged sightings .
What would explain it is their country being full of flying rape ogres .
How Do We Kill It ?
There is no silver bullet for the Popobawa in folklore .
However a mob did successfully hack a Popobawa to death once , though at the time the creature had taken the form of a random mentally ill villager .
It is entirely possible that when the man confessed to being the Popobawa , he was in fact speaking figuratively .
Long Duration Love Affair
That cylindrical object you see pictured above is a roughly school - bus sized structure which was deployed into space in 1984 .
It orbited the Earth for five and a half years with nothing expected of it other than to float there , getting battered about by whatever the great black yonder saw fit to throw at it .
You see , every inch of its outside surface was covered with Science .
57 separate experiments , mounted in 86 trays , involving the participation of “ more than 200 principal investigators from 33 private companies , 21 universities , seven NASA centers , nine Department of Defense laboratories and eight foreign countries . ”
Its purpose was to study the effects of space on a multitude of materials .
Its name is the Long Duration Exposure Facility ( LDEF ) and I am deeply in love with it .
As longtime readers are no doubt painfully aware , when it comes to certain items I have the tendency to objectify , to glaze over purpose and function and context and just splash about in the shallows of aesthetics .
The recent post on microscope slides is a good example .
Well , I should warn you straight off that I ’m about to indulge that tendency yet again , because every bit of practical and thoughtful background information I plan to relay was contained in that first paragraph .
Believe it or not LDEF , somewhat humble punching - bag though it may be , is gorgeous .
More specifically the neatly arranged trays which cover every inch of its surface are , as a group and individually , some damned handsome items .
Visually they represent the confluence of so many things I ’m partial to that the LDEF might in some ways represent the perfect object for my ogling pleasure .
For me it brings to mind the abstraction of certain painters , a gridded and measured minimalism in graphic design , failed utopian architecture , and the shapes and surface textures of every science fictional interior ever put on film .
Add to that the subtle color palette peppered here and there with super saturated counterpoints , the unintentional , almost accidental , nature of its beauty , and ( having been well battered during its 32,422 Earth orbits ) the indelible stamp of decay … and , well , what can I say ?
The images which follow are each of individual sections of the LDEF ’s exterior .
I have cropped them where I thought necessary but they are otherwise exactly as they were photographed in 1990 .
Have a look .
Beautiful no ?
Now , imagine all that visual goodness , and a whole lot more just like it , packed onto a 30 foot by 14 foot cylindrical surface , hurtling silently 275 nautical miles above the Earth , and our heads …
Yup , that ’s the stuff .
I hope you enjoyed these even a smidgeon as much as I do .
If you ’d like to know more about the mission , the craft , the experiments , or the results of those experiments you can view NASA ’s page here .
Trains gaining as sensible alternative to cars Californians , fed up with congestion and gas prices , leave cars behind - and train ridership is booming
Passengers getting off the Capitol Corridor in Sacramento , Calif. , on Thursday , May 29 , 2008 .

The car may still be king in California , but with drivers tiring of traffic congestion and feeling the pinch of high gas prices , the train is quickly gaining popularity .
Ridership is booming on three intrastate Amtrak lines that are primarily managed and paid for by the state : the Capitol Corridor from the Bay Area to Sacramento and Auburn , the San Joaquin from Oakland to Bakersfield , and the Pacific Surfliner from San Diego to San Luis Obispo .
" In the last three months , we 've seen a phenomenal increase in all three corridors , " said Bill Bronte , chief of Caltrans ' division of rail .
" Particularly on the San Joaquin and Capitol Corridor . "
For the first seven months of this budget year , which ends in September , ridership is up 13.6 percent on the Capitol Corridor , 11.1 percent on the San Joaquin and 4.7 percent on the Pacific Surfliner compared with last year .
The Surfliner , the state 's busiest train , carried 2.7 million passengers in the 2007 budget year , while the Capitol Corridor hauled 1.45 million and the San Joaquin carried 805,000 .
While some of the trains still offer passengers plenty of room to stretch out , all of the routes carry standing - room - only crowds at times .
The Surfliner often carries crowds of as many as 100 standees on weekends .
Eastbound weekday evening trains on the Capitol Corridor line are getting increasingly crowded , and the San Joaquin trains are often full on Fridays and Sundays .
" You used to find some empty cars on weekends , " said Vernae Graham , an Amtrak spokeswoman .
" But those days are long gone . "
Trains have seen year - over - year increases exceeding 9 percent for each of the past 18 months .
Eugene Skoropowski , who manages the Capitol Corridor service , says the boom in ridership can be credited to an increased frequency of service as much as to rising gas prices and a desire to escape the tyranny of traffic .
In the past nine years , the Capitol Corridor has increased the number of trains running in each direction on weekdays from six to 16 , with four additional trains each way in the past four years .
That makes it a more viable option for commuters , tourists and other travelers , he said .
" The service is available when people want to travel , " Skoropowski said , " and people have discovered that they have a travel choice now .
Before , there really was n't a choice . "
Riders ' perspective
Aboard Capitol Corridor trains between Oakland and Sacramento on Thursday evening , a pair of fashion students , a couple of Oakland A's fans , a UC Davis professor , a Silicon Valley financial analyst and a teen traveler agreed that the train saved them money and stress while allowing them to work , sleep or relax .
" It 's too expensive to drive , " said Vanessa Munoz , 23 , who lives in Woodland ( Yolo County ) and takes the train twice a week from Davis to San Francisco , where she studies at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising .
" And it helps save the environment .
It 's a better way of commuting - especially if you 're a starving student . "
Sitting at a table with fellow fashion student Ximema Davalos , 20 , of Sacramento , working on sketches , Munoz said she wished the fares were a little lower , or that a student discount were offered .
She buys 10 - ride tickets , which bring the price to about $ 13 each way .
Zac Zacarias , 40 , works for Cisco Systems as a financial analyst from his home in El Dorado Hills , near Sacramento , most days .
But about twice a week he commutes to Santa Clara for meetings and to show his face .
Riding the train not only spares him the frustrations of a long drive through some of the Bay Area 's worst chokepoints , it allows him to get some work done .
While on his way home Thursday , Zacarias sat at a table in front of his laptop computer , pecking away and waiting to call in and join a conference call .
" I have a Prius , but I would rather just sit on the train and work - or sleep , " he said .
" It just depends on what 's important to you - time to work , time to sleep or being able to leave when you want . "
The frustration for Zacarias is that the trains , which often have to yield to freight trains and occasionally have to stop when there 's something on the tracks , are sometimes late - usually , he said , on the trip home .
" The biggest problem is being late , " he said , " because everyone wants to get home .
Three hours on the train is enough . "
On Thursday , the train was running about 25 minutes behind schedule when it departed the Fairfield / Suisun station .
But it pulled into Sacramento just 10 minutes late .
Jeff Magnin , a Berkeley resident , teaches writing at UC Davis .
He gave up driving to campus a few months ago and decided to try the train .
On Thursday , as the sun gleamed off San Pablo Bay , he leaned back in his seat and looked out the window .
" It 's so pleasurable , " he said .
" Look at this view .
Look at this sun . "
Expanding service
But the growing popularity of the trains is driving the need for more railcars - and perhaps more routes .
Proposition 1B , the $ 20 billion transportation bond measure voters approved in November 2006 , set aside $ 400 million for intercity rail improvements , including $ 150 million for cars and locomotives .
But the measure required the state Department of Finance to determine when new cars are needed , then release the money .
Rail officials say the time is now , especially because it takes three to five years to get new railcars built and delivered .
Bronte said this year 's state budget is likely to allow Caltrans to decide for itself when new trains are needed .
He 's hoping to order 36 cars and six locomotives - enough for six more trains .
" If this growth continues and people continue looking at intercity rail as viable , we do n't want to discourage them by having the trains look , at times , like the ( notoriously overcrowded ) India national railroad , " he said .
Rail officials expect the trains ' popularity to continue .
Bronte said they 've started studies on the possibility of running trains down the coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco with early - morning departures in each city .
And there 's interest in running trains north of Sacramento , perhaps as far as Redding .
" We 've been hypnotized to believe that we can't live without our cars , " said Skoropowski , " and in some ways we can 't .
But even here in the car capital of the world , there are people who do n't want to make that long , mundane drive in their car . "
Remember that woman from the debate last night who the moderators showed videotape of asking whether Barack Obama “ believes in the flag ” ?
Her name is Nash McCabe .
I remember thinking it was sort of odd to have a couple one - off uses of ordinary voter questions when it did n’t really seem like it was part of the format .
But I was too distracted by the general inanity of the debate to focus on this issue too closely .
Well , it turns out TPM Reader JL did give it some thought .
And he came up with something very interesting ( see JL ’s post at the DrexelDems blog ) .
He did a little googling and found out Nash is pretty popular with the traveling press now in Pennsylvania .
It turns out McCabe was featured in an April 4th story in the Times which begins like this …
Ask whom she might vote for in the coming presidential primary election and Nash McCabe , 52 , seems almost relieved to be able to unpack the dossier she has been collecting in her head .
It is not about whom she likes , but more a bill of particulars about why she cannot vote for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois .
“ How can I vote for a president who wo n’t wear a flag pin ? ” Mrs. McCabe , a recently unemployed clerk typist , said in a booth at the Valley Dairy luncheonette in this quiet , small city in western Pennsylvania .
Mr. Obama has said patriotism is about ideas , not flag pins .
“ I watch him on TV , ” Mrs. McCabe said .
“ I keep looking for that lapel pin . ”
Now , it does seem like McCabe is not a fan of Sen. Obama’s .
And I think we can assume that it ’s not a coincidence that McCabe managed to show up featured in the Times and also as the sole outside questioner in the ABC debate .
Presumably , a researcher for ABC or Gibson saw the piece in the Times , figured , hey , this lady hates Obama and is seriously ginned up about the lapel issue .
Let ’s send a camera crew and film her slamming Obama to his face .
It ’ll be great in the debate .
Now , as JL noted in his email to TPM , I ’m not sure precisely what ’s any less ethical about finding Nash at random to come on and slam Obama about whether he believes in the flag versus seeing her in the Times and saying , ‘ Wow , this woman clearly has it in for Obama .
Would n’t that make for great TV giving her a chance to crap on Obama ’s head in front of a nationwide audience ?
I think there ’s something wrong with it .
And part of it is that you usually assume that these citizen questions come from people who are at least partly conflicted about their support if not undecided .
But it does reinforce my sense that the disgraceful nature of the debate was n’t just something that came together wrong , some iffy ideas taken to far , but was basically engineered to be crap from the ground up .
( ed.note : Remember , there was also Tom Rooney from Pittsburgh who said he ’d been a Clinton supporter up until the Bosnia flap and asked what she could say to get back his vote .
In that case , this was at least someone who ’d been a Clinton supporter at one point and suggested he could be again .
But it ’s still basically , “ Hillary , can you apologize to me for being a liar ? ”
Not exactly a question .
Anyone have more details on Rooney ? )
Late Update : Turns out McClatchy is on this case and has plenty of details about how ABC tracked McCabe down .
It was at the end of the 19th century when a German scientist , Hans von Pechmann , discovered a waxy residue at the bottom of his test tube .
He had little idea of the material 's significance ; he was not to know that the substance was an early form of what we now use to bottle our shampoo , cocoon our sandwiches and wrap our wires .
He had , completely by accident , made polythene , one of the world 's most widely used and controversial materials .
The product Von Pechmann made that day in 1899 was virtually identical to the modern chemical and a pair of his colleagues – Eugen Bamberger and Friedrich Tschirner – called it polymethylene .
But unlike polythene , which is versatile enough to make hardy and filmic plastics , this waxy resin was not useful in practical terms ; and so little was made of it .
Like future volumes of plastic , the Von Pechmann experiment was duly buried .
It was not for another 34 years that the people who are officially credited with inventing polythene chanced upon it .
But tomorrow , on the 75th anniversary of this discovery , there will be no ticker - tape parades for any inventor of the woebegone plastic .
Due to the recent push to eradicate plastic bags , people are more likely to want to forget the occasion .

" Polythene seemed a great boon , not least to the food industry , when it was first invented .
But it is now increasingly being seen as a mixed blessing .
It has helped improve food hygiene at the cost of environmental degradation .
It is a classic example of a short - term fix now unravelling , " said Professor Tim Lang , a commissioner for natural resources and land use at the Sustainable Development Commission , of polythene 's discovery .
Polythene 's innovation – in the form that we now know it – in fact occurred in 1933 .
It was the work of ICI 's Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson , who , after waking up one morning and deciding to experiment with gases under high pressure , spotted that part of their apparatus looked like it had been dipped in paraffin wax .
Gibson 's simple notes , made at the time at the company 's base in Northwich , Cheshire , belied their importance : " Waxy solid found in reaction tube . "
Two years later ICI developed the means for making polythene on an industrial scale , and shortly afterwards it was used for the first round - the - world telephone cable .
During the Second World War , it won near - heroic - status as a vital radar component .
It was not until the rise of the British supermarket in the 1950s that it really came into mass use .
These stores ' indulgences have since been freely criticised .
The substance is made from crude oil through a process known as " cracking " , and the resultant product essentially comes in two forms : " hard " and " soft " , the former being used to bind our pipes and contain our fuel in tanks , the latter to shrink - wrap our sausages and insulate our television cables .
In Britain we get through a combined 1.6 million tonnes of both types every year .
The results create mountains of landfill .
This environmental problem is epitomised by outrage surrounding the disposal of the plastic bag .
In an average 12 months , 13 billion of them are dished out to consumers .
They are generally employed for a mere 20 minutes before being discarded , and take a gargantuan 1,000 years to rot to nothing .
Recent reports have highlighted plastic bags as pollutants which maim birds , and annihilate vast numbers of seals , turtles and whales .
Now , the national consciousness appears to be shifting away from the use of polythene packaging to more reusable alternatives .
Diane Gaston , the National Consumer Council 's spokeswoman , said : " I think there needs to be much more done on the plastic bag front .
And in more general terms when stores overuse packaging it drives me mad .
The use of polythene is so ingrained in people 's lives .
But we need to consider how damaging it all is to the environment . "
But trade industry bodies are unwilling to let polythene 's birthday pass without a fight .
Philip Law , a director at the British Plastics Federation , said of the discovery : " It is being seriously misinterpreted .
Recent campaigns have taken a very emotional stance on drawing attention to the causes of plastic damage in the sea and possible effects on wildlife .
But we need to verify what is being reported .
Is it true that wildlife is being impaired on a large scale ?
And you 've got to look at the environmental benefits of polythene .
" If you 're going to have a bag , you 're much better having a polyethylene bag than any other material because of the amount of energy that goes into their manufacture ; which is minimal .
And they can be recycled .
It 's not the fault of the product that things are dumped in large quantities at sea . "

Beginning this crop season , farmers will be able to receive text messages on their cell phones from their plants saying whether they are thirsty or not .
Accent Engineering , Inc. , of Lubbock , Tex. , developed the SmartCropTM automated drought monitoring system based on a patent held by the Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) .
They are offering it for sale in time for this growing season .
Battery - operated infrared thermometers placed in irrigated fields monitor leaf temperatures and relay that information to a computerized base station .
A cell phone modem can be hooked up to the base station to download data to a personal computer .
This modem can also send text messages to a farmer 's cell phone .
ARS plant physiologist James Mahan at the ARS Plant Stress and Germplasm Development Research Unit in Lubbock is one of the original theorists of the idea behind SmartCropTM .
Each plant species has a fairly narrow range of internal temperatures it prefers for best growth .
When leaf temperature goes above the upper limit or threshold of that range for too long , the plant needs water , as much for cooling down as to quench its thirst .
In the Texas High Plains area , for example , Mahan found that cotton begins to suffer from drought if cotton plant leaves stay above 82 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 6 - 1/ 2 hours .
Farmers can choose the time - temperature threshold at which they would like to receive an alert , and adjust it at any time .
US lawmakers tell Kadhafi of interest in gas , oil
TRIPOLI  A delegation of US lawmakers told Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi that US firms were keen to work in the North African country , particularly in gas , oil and infrastructure projects , Libyan news agency JANA said on Thursday .
Led by Republican Congressman John Boehner , the lawmakers met Kadhafi on Wednesday and stressed to him " the desire of American firms to contribute actively in realising development projects , notably in the areas of gas , oil and infrastructure , " JANA said .
It added that the visitors also " saluted the efforts of the Guide of the Libyan revolution in consolidating peace and stability in the world , " and affirmed their " commitment to develop friendly and cooperative relations " with Libya .
Diplomatic relations between Washington and Tripoli were broken in 1981 but restored in 2004 after Kadhafi announced that Libya had renounced efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
Relations were normalised last year with the exchange of ambassadors and with Libya being removed from the US list of states supporting terrorism .
Libya offered gas exploration contracts to foreign firms for the first time in December and US fuel giant Occidental Petroleum was among those granted permission to test for gas .
OPEC member Libya has natural gas reserves estimated at 1,314 billion cubic metres and is the African continent 's second largest oil producer at 1.7 million barrels per day .

A few years back , Randy A took a contract as a maintenance developer on a wretched abomination of an application .
Like those who've stared into the heart of the Great Codethulhu , Randy 's retinas are forever burned with code from the system .
One line that continues to haunt his dreams is as clear as the day he first encountered it ...
return ( test == true ) ? ( ( test == false ) ?
false : true ) : ( ( test == false ) ? false : true ) ;
When he first stumbled across it in a treacherous debugging session , he resorted to a truth table to figure out what exactly that line did ...
return test ;
It might not have been as bad , except for the fact that , minutes later , he stumbled across a slightly altered version of it again .
And , minutes later , another one .
All told , the same perverted logic was repeated nine different times in that module .
He pleaded with his lead to simply replace the code with " return test " .
But , like so many others who feared tempting the beast , Randy 's boss replied " I 'm not sure why it 's in there , and it 's probably best we keep it in there . "
Who Will Try George W .
Bush for Murder after He
Leaves the White House ?
By John F. Miglio
Vincent Bugliosi , the L.A. district attorney who became famous for successfully trying Charles Manson for murder and subsequently writing the best - seller , Helter Skelter , has written an explosive new book that not only lights a fuse under our criminal justice system but challenges the next attorney general of the United States to blow the Bush administration to smithereens .
The book is called The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , and Bugliosi -- who has never been accused of mincing his words ( or being an advocate for liberal causes ) -- makes a thorough and compelling case against George W. Bush and his inner circle of advisors , who helped him sell the war in Iraq to the American public .
The major premise of Bugliosi's case against Bush is that the former Texas governor , who unapologetically executed more death row inmates than any other governor in the country ( and joked about killing one of them ) , intentionally lied and deceived the American public while he was president about the reasons for going to war in Iraq , which has caused the deaths of over 4,000 U.S. service men and women and over a 100,000 Iraqis .
But how can Bush be prosecuted and convicted of murder if he personally did not kill anyone ?
Bugliosi asks , and then answers his own question : " ... it is not necessary for a criminal defendant to have physically committed a murder to be guilty of it .
For example , I convicted Charles Manson of the seven Tate - La Bianca murders even though he himself did not participate in any of the killings , nor was he present at the time . "
Interesting comparison .
Bush and Manson -- two twisted sociopaths who revel in death and destruction .
But Bugliosi goes further : " I was able to obtain this conviction because of the vicarious liability rule of conspiracy , which provides that each member of a conspiracy is criminally responsible for all crimes committed by his coconspirators ...
Necessarily , ( Bush ) conspired with certain members of his inner circle , co-conspirators like Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice . "
That 's the ticket !
Send them all up the river !
The whole lot of them !
Of course , the question immediately arises :
If Bugliosi is so convinced a prosecuting attorney could get a conviction for murder against Bush and company , why has n't an attorney already brought charges against them ?
Bugliosi gives us the simple answer :
It is generally accepted by legal scholars that while still in office , the president and vice president are protected from criminal prosecution by the Constitution as interpreted by Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers .
In other words , the only way to bring criminal charges against the president or vice president is to first impeach them and remove them from office .
But thanks to the spineless Democrats in Congress , Bush and his partners in crime have escaped impeachment and continue on their merry way , telling more lies and sending more soldiers to their deaths in Iraq .
Perhaps the new revelations by Scottie McClellan about the lies of Bush and Cheney will finally get the Congress to act on impeachment , although I would n't count on it .
In any case , once Bush and Cheney are out of office , they are no longer immune from prosecution .
And as soon as this happens , Bugliosi claims the next U.S. Attorney General would be the most logical person to charge them with the crime of murder and bring them to trial , but he adds that any state attorney general can do the same -- as long as the state in which he or she presides has soldiers who have died in Iraq .
The question is , who will have the guts to do it ?
If it were up to private individuals or citizen action groups , there would be a line long enough to circumvent the planet Jupiter , but for a federal or state attorney general , i.e. , a pragmatic politician with a career at stake , to bring charges against a former president , who represents the most powerful business interests in the country , is another story .
It would take an exceptional individual , someone courageous and smart and unflappable , someone willing to stand up to the right - wing hate machine that inevitably would bring up every piece of dirt they could find on that person and do everything in their power to intimidate him or her .
In short , it would take a hero , or a saint .
And even if an attorney general were willing to rise to the challenge and get a conviction of murder against Bush , would the next president allow the conviction to stick , or would he or she pardon him ?
For example , if McCain wins the presidency , we can almost assuredly count on a quick pardon of George W. and friends , the same way old man Bush pardoned Cap Weinburger and the rest of his pals who carried out the Iran / Contra affair .
What about if Hillary became president ?
Would she let Bush and company off the hook ?
One would hope not , but it would n't surprise me if she pardoned them , since she was willing to play ball with the Bush administration from the beginning , not to mention her newfound alliances with Rupert Murdoch and Fox News .
And Obama ?
He would be the most likely of the three to let the conviction stick .
But even he would be under enormous pressure to show mercy .
Have n't they suffered enough !
Where is your Christian charity ?
I thought you were a uniter , not a divider !
Blah ...
Blah ....
Blah ...
To say the least , it would be a real test of character for him , and a decision that would be discussed for decades , if not centuries .
Let 's hope someday in the near future he has that decision to make .
If not , it means that George W. and his gang were never brought to trial and they got away with everything -- including murder .
That would just wash out your image .
because the color comes from the lcd , and adding leds outside the lcd would be no different than trying to watch it in a brightly lit room .
Senior British police officials are talking to the FBI about an international database to hunt for major criminals and terrorists .
The US - initiated programme , " Server in the Sky " , would take cooperation between the police forces way beyond the current faxing of fingerprints across the Atlantic .
Allies in the " war against terror " - the US , UK , Australia , Canada and New Zealand - have formed a working group , the International Information Consortium , to plan their strategy .
Biometric measurements , irises or palm prints as well as fingerprints , and other personal information are likely to be exchanged across the network .
One section will feature the world 's most wanted suspects .
The database could hold details of millions of criminals and suspects .
The FBI is keen for the police forces of American allies to sign up to improve international security .
The Home Office yesterday confirmed it was aware of Server in the Sky , as did the Metropolitan police .
The plan will make groups anxious to safeguard personal privacy question how much access to UK databases is granted to foreign law enforcement agencies .
There will also be concern over security , particularly after embarrassing data losses within the UK , and accuracy : in one case , an arrest for a terror offence by US investigators used what turned out to be misidentified fingerprint matches .
Britain's National Policing Improvement Agency has been the lead body for the FBI project because it is responsible for IDENT1 , the UK database holding 7 m sets of fingerprints and other biometric details used by police forces to search for matches from scenes of crimes .
Many of the prints are either from a person with no criminal record , or have yet to be matched to a named individual .
IDENT1 was built by the computer technology arm of the US defence company Northrop Grumman .
In future it is expected to hold palm prints , facial images and video sequences .
A company spokeswoman confirmed that Northrop Grumman had spoken to the FBI about Server in the Sky .
" It can run independently but if existing systems are connected up to it then the intelligence agencies would have to approve , " she said .
The FBI told the Guardian : " Server in the Sky is an FBI initiative designed to foster the advanced search and exchange of biometric information on a global scale .
While it is currently in the concept and design stages , once complete it will provide a technical forum for member nations to submit biometric search requests to other nations .
It will maintain a core holding of the world 's ' worst of the worst ' individuals .
Any identifications of these people will be sent as a priority message to the requesting nation . "
In London , the NPIA confirmed it was aware of Server in the Sky but said it was " too early to comment on what our active participation might be " .
The FBI is proposing to establish three categories of suspects in the shared system : " internationally recognised terrorists and felons " , those who are " major felons and suspected terrorists " , and finally those who the subjects of terrorist investigations or criminals with international links .
Tom Bush , assistant director at the FBI 's criminal justice information service , has said he hopes to see a pilot project for the programme up and running by the middle of the year .
Although each participating country would manage and secure its own data , the sharing of personal data between countries is becoming an increasingly controversial area of police practice .
There is political concern at Westminster about the public transparency of such cooperation .
A similar proposal has emerged from the EU for closer security cooperation between the security services and police forces of member states , including allowing countries to search each other 's databases .
Under what is known as the Prum treaty , there are plans to open up access to DNA profiles , fingerprints and vehicle registration numbers .
I got the chance to browse one of those mega - sized book stores the other day .
I walk in with a chip on my shoulder , daring the place to have a game or a book or a magazine that catches my interest .
I just find myself drifting further and further out of the mainstream as “ normal ” and “ regular ” things pale in the face of my own private obsessions .
The computer book section had shrunk since my last visit .
It ’s like its slowly dawning on the owners that they do n’t make enough money selling them to cover the costs of having to put obsoleted editions into the dumpster every couple of years .
I used to could spend hours browsing the shelves , but things look strangely mundane now .
Then my eyes rest on a fat shiny Apress book on Ruby .
I want that book .
I want everyone to go away and I want a weekend where I can just sit and read it cover to cover .
But I do n’t have a single project that I need Ruby for .
I do n’t even really want to make a project in Ruby .
I want to know what Matz did and why .
I want to get the gist of it so I can understand blog posts by people that write in Ruby for no other reason than that I like those guys and feel like they care about the same things that I care about .
It ’s crazy , of course .
Lisp deserves at least another six months of attention and experimentation .
Just the other day I was thinking that it deserved three years : one for Common Lisp , one for Scheme , and one for elisp .
I was even dreading the thought of picking another language for the whole “ learn one language a year ” thing .
Never mind the fact that I ’m already procrastinating my SICP problems .
Why do I want that Ruby book all of a sudden ?
Ah but my head is swimming with ideas .
What I really want is to apply them in a creative way to make something cool .
It ’s time for a pet project … but what to do ?
A scan of the job boards confirms my suspicions .
Lots of C# jobs sprinkled here and there .
Tons of them to choose from down in the big city .
But only a couple of Ruby jobs for the entire state– and no Lisp jobs .
Am I wasting time ?
Should I hedge my bets ?
On the one hand I should accept the fact that the inertia of my previous work experience means I should settle for a C# job .
The postings for the offbeat stuff all want super - geniuses or something .
I ’m just an “ average ” developer .
And besides , if I go with C# , I can have more options in terms of where I live and what kind of environment I have to work in … right ?
Or have I turned a corner now that I ca n’t go back on ?
Which is it ?
It ’s too big a question .
I need a pet project so I can explore these issues and test them in code .
Talk is cheap .
Code is the only real test of the ideas .
Or rather , working applications , to be even more specific ….
But I know how these projects work for me .
I start with a sense of elation : new tools open up a door to solve a problem I ’ve always wanted to solve .
It looks so easy .
I charge in and make inspiring amounts of progress in the beginning .
Then I start to come up against the limitations of my abstractions .
The pressure to get some semblance of working code is so great that I push things as hard as I can anyway … but then the muck starts to creep in .
Code that looked brilliant one week becomes an embarrassment the next .
And then there ’s the unanticipated hard problem that saps my will to continue .
It ’s like that every time .
My mental vocabulary increases from one project to the next – but even powerful “ new ” abstractions have their limitations and blind spots so I ’m always having to learn more .
And while a “ hard ” problem that stopped me in my tracks years ago is no longer that big of a deal , there ’s always more ready to come along because the scope of my ambitions is always rising faster than the rate at which I master new ideas .
In other words , there ’s only trivial problems … and ones I ca n’t do .
There are trivial abstractions … and ones that I ca n’t even imagine a need for .
So no matter how good I get , I still feel like an “ average developer ” .
The things I ’ve mastered seem trivial– only an idiot would fail to understand them .
And it ’s those unanticipated problems – the ones that I least suspect– that are going to force me to expand my scope of what I consider to be trivial .
But I ’ll assume the tools to solve those problems are irrelevant ivory tower academic garbage until I find myself in a situation where they are the only way to get out of an ugly coding nightmare .
But when I ’m in the nightmare , I wo n’t necessarily know what tool I need to master to get out of it .
I might not even know what I need to google for !
If that ’s the case , then the only way forward is to work on projects that are more on my level so that I can expand my imagination to the point where I ’m able to even ask the right questions .
( This is why the line between doing and talking in programming is so difficult to pin down . )
Anyways … I ’ve got two ideas for pet projects .
One is a Common Lisp non-application application to solve problem that ’s not really a problem … but really is just a piece of problem for a lot of only marginally related problems .
I ’ve solved enough “ hard problems ” for it at this point that it should be trivial to make a single - case solution ( especially if I munge just a little bit from Peter Seibel ’s code examples . )
The challenge would be to take that single case … and then write a few macros that are capable of generating all of that code .
I ’d end up with a language for solving a certain class of problems … and an application that cheats by using the REPL prompt as the primary user interface for using it .
( In the process of writing it , I ’ll surely end up accidentally writing my own version of some existing Common Lisp feature .
I do it every time I write in Lisp . )
The resulting solution will look silly to any expert Lisp user and advocates of other programming languages will tell me how they can do the same thing using some other tool .
The other is a C# application that I was working on last year .
I ’d solved enough “ hard problems ” to convince myself that I could take it on , but got stalled by an unanticipated “ hard problem ” that was n’t compelling enough for me to want to tackle on my own .
The project was written as a single - case solution .
What I want to do is vivisect it until it becomes a tool for solving the general - case solution .
I want to use every single functional technique I learned this year to get the abstractions right this time and eliminate the muck that had crept into my bloated object model .
I want to write my own scripting language for it so that it ’s possible for people to do unanticipated things with my solution .
Success would be a working application that ends up being used by anyone other than me .
( Unbelievable success would be that my solution is used by someone else to solve the “ hard problem ” that killed the project the year before — not at the code level , but at the meta level ! )
Which one should I choose ?
Or should I do something else ?
What do you think ?

Robert Mugabe was accused last night of preparing a war against Zimbabwe 's people , in an attempt to overturn the opposition 's presidential election victory .
Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , who has already claimed outright victory in last Saturday 's election , even though the official count has yet to be released , said the government was reviving the war veterans and party militias to bludgeon the opposition into submission and terrorise voters before a run-off ballot .
' Violence will be the new weapon to reverse the people 's will , ' he said .
' Militants are being prepared .
War vets are on the warpath . '
Tsvangirai called Mugabe a lame - duck President and said he ' must concede to allow us to move on with the business of rebuilding and reconstructing the country ' .
He said the MDC was reluctant to take part in a second round of presidential elections because of the mounting climate of fear - although he stopped short of threatening a boycott .
Tsvangirai said : ' It is unfair and unreasonable for President Mugabe to call a run- off . '
He reiterated his claim that taking such action was unnecessary as his party claims he won 50.3 per cent of the vote .
Opposition officials said the party would launch a new court effort today to force the official election commission to publish results , after armed police prevented lawyers from entering court yesterday .

The 8 Most Ridiculous Dance Crazes Mar. 5 by Chenda Ngak
Every few years a song or a movement inspires us to get up and do the most ridiculous dances .
Sure , there are a few that are cute like The Twist , but in the dark shadow of Pop Culture Hell lies some of our worse Dance Craze skeletons .
Some say that dancing is a language of its own .
Well , if that is true these dance crazes are all screaming out one thing : " Shoot Me ! "
Here is our list of the eight most ridiculous dance crazes .
8. The Limbo
All of the ocean air and island sun is probably what caused the citizens of Trinidad to take a stick and start dancing under it .
Unfortunately for us , it caught on and stuck , with even the likes of The Hoff cashing in on the craze .
Now every drunken person at a party with a stick and a penchant for sticking out his or her genitals wants to limbo .
7. The Running Man
There are many dances that came out around the time that The Running Man hit it big : Cabbage Patch , Roger Rabbit , Kid'N Play , and others .
But this one was the coolest to know -- I remember because , sadly , I was there .
Talk about taking an aerobic workout and making it a hip dance move .
That is the power of Hip Hop music in the 1980s .
6. Lambada
Just because you have an excuse to bump 'n grind in public does n't mean that you should .
I 'm looking at you , R. Kelly .
This dance and hit single of the same name made even Patrick Swayze 's leotards blush .
While the song and dance originated in Brazil , it was n't until a French pop group released " Lambada " that it became a sensation .
The craze went on to inspire two B- movies -- Lambada and The Forbidden Dance - - before fizzling out .
5. Electric Slide
If you were unlucky enough to grow up in the 1980s , then you have been subjected to the horror also known as the Electric Slide .
It is the " hip " version of line dancing for the middle - aged .
Another embarrassing activity for your family and friends to do together , this dance was invented by a guy named Ric Silver , who has an official website for the dance .
The rumor mill tells us that Ric is so crazy about his dance that he had YouTube take down videos of people doing it incorrectly .
Really ?
4. Tootsee Roll
Children of the 1990s have no excuse !
This is absurd .
The 69 Boyz 's hit single Tootsee Roll went Double Platinum in 1996 ( Double ! ) and with that success the dance became staple for nightclubs all over the land .
Before we knew it we were all going to the left , to the left ... and we dipped , baby !
3 . The Hustle
2. Conga
As if we did n't already have enough material to make fun of the 1970s with , this dance craze is like nuts on a sundae .
It 's always some song that sparks the fires of embarrassing dances , in the disco - loving year of 1975 , it was Van McCoy 's hit song " Hustle . "
This dance has been embarrassing us at family parties for decades .
Originating from Cuba , the dance is actually called Comparsa , but it did n't catch on in America so they just renamed it after the instrument at the heart of the dance -- the conga drum .
Hitting its peak in the 1930s , this is a craze that still has n't gone away .
Although you 'll be hard - pressed to find a Conga line at a school dance , watch your back at the next family reunion .
1. The Macarena
1996 was a dark time in pop music .
Although The Spice Girls and Britney Spears were n't big yet , there was still a bunch of eardrum - destroying " musicians " to keep us on the brink of going postal .
Top hit - makers included the likes of Toni Braxton , Quad City DJs , and these guy-s : Los del Rio .
This song and dance of the same name radiated through all airwaves and ended up at weddings and quincineras all over the world .
Thank God those days are behind us ... but with Hannah Montana on the loose , are we really safe ?
Prepare to Read the Fine Print in Your ISP Agreement
If Rep. Darrell Issa has his way , you 'll need to read the fine print carefully before signing up with an Internet Service Provider :
Issa suggested that Internet providers could get " consent from every single person who signed up to operate under their auspices " for federal police to monitor network traffic for attempts to steal personal information and national secrets .
Issa 's plan would give the FBI yet another mechanism for invading your privacy .
" That 's very troubling , " said Greg Nojeim , director of the project on freedom , security , and technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" It could be an effort to achieve , through unknowing consent , permission to monitor communications in a way that would otherwise be prohibited by law . "
Do you really want to consent to an an " FBI - can - monitor - everything clause " when you sign up with an ISP ?
Since most of us would balk at such a blatant invasion of our privacy , and since people who send us email ( particularly from another country ) may not themselves have consented to sharing their thoughts with the FBI , Issa has a back - up plan which , unsurprisingly , is even worse .

It was 1990 .
Christ , what a year .
My good friend Phil died of a rare bone cancer in December of ' 89 .
From Russell Crowe look - alike to emaciated man in constant pain in 16 months .
And then , three months after being Phil 's pallbearer , it was my only brother .
My brother called from San Francisco in January , a month and a half after I carried Phil 's casket into church .
I need your help , he said , I 'm getting bad .
Got a call a few days later from a mutual friend , Debbie .
Fly out right now .
I did .
Rented a car .
Drove to Twin Peaks , noticed the Pacific fog drifting so slowly over the hilltops .
It would have been a beautiful milieu under any other set of circumstances .
When you walk up to a dying person 's house , you always take a deep breath and turn the knob before you go in .
His friends Daniel and Bob were there .
It was Bob 's place .
My brother could n't manage his own apartment any more .
They gave a warm greeting and smiled , and I felt better knowing he was with good guys .
He was in bed , propped up , with fresh brightly printed bed linens with tan and blue stripes .
My beautiful blonde brother , a high school wrestler and weightlifter was down to less than a hundred pounds .
The beautiful San Francisco sunlight streamed through the window , falling on his bed .
He got up slowly , so slowly .
His legs were shockingly skinny .
All of those hours in the gym doing squats and leg presses , all of those bicep curls , all of those stomach crunches , for naught .
He led us to the back porch , where he lovingly watered and fertilized his plants .
We sat on the warm back porch , he drinking water , wearing his bulky sweater .
He wanted to know how his nieces were doing .
They are young and full of sweetness and love .
They are everything we love in girls .
Although he would want more than anything to see them again , it is not a pleasure he would permit himself .
He would n't want their last memories of him to be like this .
He had a fine doctor , a young doctor who understood the psychological trendlines of dying AIDS patients .
My brother did n't need false cheerful optimism , he wanted facts .
He wanted the honest clinical truth about how he was going to die .
He wanted to know his doctor 's challenges in keeping him alive .
" AIDS is a fascinating disease .
Dr. Mark explained it to me , and it is so fascinating .
It would be a lot more interesting if I did n't have it , of course . "
He volunteered for experimental drug regimens .
It was too late for him , but his experience may have helped others .
The cocktails he was given were brutal ; in many ways they were worse than the disease .
But he did n't give up .
In a certain Christian sense , it was a redemptive thing for him .
He must suffer so that others may have better lives .
He understood this , and willed his body to accept his decision .
It was not easy .
He did not fear death , but he was angry that he had to die so young .
So many ideas .
So many unaccomplished goals .
We wanted to grow old and compare notes when we were old .
We were twin halves of one august event , growing up close in age and outlook .
After high school graduation , like an iceberg that was split in two , we split apart and began leading separate lives , I going off to college first , choosing engineering and the hard sciences , and he following later , equally conversant in the arts and the sciences , but choosing a different course , one with plants and arts and beauty .
We always assumed that in our dotage we would re-merge and learn from the other .
He feared separation of a different sort when we were younger .
In our younger adolescent days , I inveighed against fags , queers , sexual perverts , and homosexuals .
I quoted Scripture .
He remained silent .
Whatever natural love he felt for his older brother must have been gradually eroded by my mean - spirited diatribes .
God forgive me , for I know not what I say .
He died by degrees , perhaps , back then , when we were still living together .
He learned that he had to hide what he was .
But somehow in his great capacity for love , he still cared about me enough to worry how I felt about him as a gay man .
We spent a weekend renting a cabin together up in Big Bear Lake when he told me .
He was living with a man .
On the drive up I asked if he was gay , dreading the answer , but knowing it too .
He said yes .
We drove on in silence .
Do you have HIV ?
He said yes .
And here is the great cosmic joke : I , ostensibly the Christian , learn the meaning of " long - suffering " from my gay brother .
I , the hetero , learn that within my own family , my other - half brother is gay .
Same mother , same father , same house , same neighborhood , nothing different .
He 's gay , I 'm not .
It was n't his choice .
Choice had nothing to do with it .
No one would choose to grow up with that kind of abuse .
But I had a choice .
Could he still count on his brother 's closeness ?
Would his brother walk away ?
When you are confronted with this question , a heart of love speaks more powerfully than a thousand Bibles .
You can not deny your own flesh , your own blood .
Your brother will always be your brother .
He did n't want to be gay , but there it is .
It was time for me to grow up and say fuck it , here we are , you 've been dealt a shitty hand , let 's stick together .
I will never leave you or forsake you .
So here it was , a few years later , when his T cell count was alarmingly low , and cryptosporidiosis was claiming him one meal at a time .
Eat. Vomit . Eat. Vomit .
The parasites never let him digest his food enough to permit proper digestion .
They were not treatable by any drug .
He wanted control over his death , no matter how painful , no matter what the cost .
He did not want to go to a hospital or a nursing home .
He did not want to give up his beloved San Francisco to come live with us on the East Coast .
He and his doctor worked out a plan .
Like Socrates , he was going to die by his own hand .
I was but a bit player in the drama .
Three or four large syringes of potassium chloride , injected into his arm , would stop his heart .
Brain death would occur a few minutes later .
That afternoon , we made him a meal he loved : baked chicken , mashed potatoes , gravy .
He ate it , enjoyed it , and threw it up .
Our mother was there with us .
At four in the morning I was to set the quiet alarm , and wake up and see his wishes through .
He made me promise that if he could n't finish , I would finish for him .
He stared into my eyes .
I wanted to deny the reality of the situation , but he would n't let that happen .
He needed to see steel in his brother 's eyes , as there was in his own .
There was no steel in my eyes , there were only tears .
Of course I will help you .
All night long I dreamt strange dreams .
What my brother must have dreamed can only be imagined .
At three a.m. a strange sound woke me fast .
It was coming from my brother 's bedroom .
His small night - table alarm clock was quietly but insistently beeping .
My brother was n't turning it off .
My heart pounded as I tiptoed to his room , not wishing to wake my worn - out mother .
As in some horror movie I walked down the small hallway to the half - open door , and remembered seeing my arm opening the door , even though I knew only unhappiness lay there .
In the moonlight , his body lay sprawled across the bed , his ribcage showing through his pellucid skin .
He had been sitting at the side of the bed and injected himself .
He fell back when his heart stopped .
Two syringes emptied .
He had started an hour early .
I was his insurance policy , but none was needed .
Years later , I wonder and marvel at his courage .
His final act was a triumph over death .
Oh death , where is thy sting ?
Oh grave , where is thy victory ?
I 'll tell you , that was his victory .
The Iraqi Red Crescent Organization reports that despite Dear Leader ’s military surge to increase security in the country , the number of Iraqis fleeing their homes because of the violence has increased dramatically , with over 400,000 leaving since the beginning of the year .
The number of displaced Iraqis shot upward from 447,337 on Jan. 1 to 1.14 million on July 31 , the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization said Saturday .
… ” Does this surge have anything to do with it ?
We do n’t know , ” said Saeed Haqi , head of the Iraqi Red Crescent — the local partner organization of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
“ But they ’re leaving because of the security situation in general . ”
In addition to those who have fled their homes but have stayed within the country , some 2 million Iraqis have fled , with many now living as refugees in neighboring Syria and Jordan .
In its midyear assessment last month , the Geneva - based International Organization for Migration also reported a spike in internally displaced people , saying the trend started with the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in the city of Samarra , which sparked fierce sectarian fighting .
It said 63 percent of those assessed reported that they fled direct threats to life , and that more than a quarter had been forcibly displaced from their property .
Ninety percent said they were targeted because of their religious identity .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The United States said on Wednesday six world powers had no plans to offer Iran security guarantees to encourage it to suspend nuclear activity , hours after Russia floated the idea .

The six -- the United States , Britain , France , Russia , China and Germany -- last week updated and enhanced a 2006 packet of incentives to be offered Iran to shelve uranium enrichment , which the West fears Tehran might use to build atom bombs .
Iran repeated that it would not stop enrichment , which it says is for generating more electricity only .
Analysts said Tehran was unlikely to be moved by the new offer because it kept a precondition that Iran shelve the program first .
Russia , which along with China has prodded Western powers to agree more in the way of “ carrots ” for Iran and rely less on “ sticks ” , or sanctions , said on Wednesday they should give Tehran security guarantees to relieve Middle East tensions .
“ Security guarantees are not something we are looking at the moment , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in Israel as President George W. Bush launched a Middle East visit .
“ As we ’ve been saying , details ( of the incentive package ) are still being worked out and will be presented to the Iranian government soon .
The one who needs to give security guarantees is Iran , because they keep threatening to wipe Israel off the map , ” Johndroe told reporters when asked about Moscow ’s idea .
The six pressing Iran to halt nuclear activity are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov did not specify what security guarantees might be offered .
But he said a combination of negotiations and incentives could defuse the stalemate over Iranian enrichment and wider conflict in the Middle East .
NEW MECHANISMS
“ I think the ‘ Six ’ could make the following step : directly put concrete offers on the negotiating table , give Iran security guarantees and ensure a more distinguished place in negotiations on the situation in the Middle East , ” he said .
“ I am convinced that this is an effective way of relieving tensions in the region and regulating the situation surrounding Iran ’s nuclear problem , ” he told reporters in the Russian Urals city of Yekaterinburg where he met his German counterpart .
An Iranian counter - proposal on world security presented to the European Union sidestepped concerns over Tehran ’s nuclear ambitions , taking a catch - all approach to international problems that made clear Iran was not prepared to yield on enrichment .
The proposal text , obtained by Reuters , dwelled on cooperation to combat “ common security threats ” such as terrorism , “ militarism ” and drugs and called for uranium enrichment consortiums in various countries , including Iran , to foster nuclear energy for development .
Iran has suggested such a consortium on its soil before , ostensibly to defuse fears it might covertly divert enrichment technology to bombmaking .
But Western powers rule this out , mistrusting Iran over its record of nuclear secrecy .
In a letter to the U.N. secretary general attached to the proposal , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki called it a “ strategic ” and “ comprehensive ” formula for long - term world solutions and urged big powers to “ deal with it constructively ” .
Western diplomats said Iran ’s initiative mostly rehashed known positions , lacking substantial new ideas for ways out of the nuclear impasse , and seemed like little more than a distraction that would not be constructive .
“ It covers familiar ground ...
There ’s no shift on substance , ” one senior Western diplomat told Reuters .
The West suspects Tehran of seeking to derive nuclear weapons capability from its campaign to refine nuclear fuel , defying Security Council resolutions calling for the suspension of enrichment - related activities .
Three rounds of relatively mild U.N. sanctions have been imposed on the Islamic Republic , the world ’s No. 4 oil producer .
Incentives Iran refused in 2006 included civil nuclear cooperation and wider trade in civil aircraft , energy , high technology and agriculture .
Russia had pushed hardest to refresh the earlier offer while the United States made no secret of its skepticism , saying it saw little reason to expect Iran to change course .

Admittedly , the video here is not of great quality and the person shooting did not have a steady hand , but you get the general idea : the San Francisco cops did n’t take kindly to people gathering in opposition to the neocon “ war ” in Iraq — more accurately described as invasion , mass murder , and occupation .
It is difficult to tell what happened precisely , but toward the end of this video a cop jabs his baton in the stomach of a woman while other likewise disposed cops begin rushing the crowd , grabbing people .
All and all , with the exception of a few people apparently sitting in the street , the crowd seems rather non-threatening , passively milling about , not ready to throw rocks and Molotov cocktails or engage in other “ anarchist ” — read : agents provocateur — behavior .
Of course , the corporate media did its level best to marginalize people actually motivated enough to go out in the street .
“ More than 200 people were arrested across the United States on Wednesday as protesters marking the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq obstructed downtown traffic and tried to block access to government offices , ” reports Reuters .
“ In San Francisco , long a centre of anti-Iraq war sentiment , police arrested more than 100 people who protested through the day along Market Street in the central business district , a spokesman said . ”
It was said these activists had blocked traffic , although the woman on the receiving end of the cop ’s baton in the video was on the sidewalk and not blocking anything , although she may have said something discourteous to the cop .
Ditto the folks on the sidewalk .
None of this was mentioned by the corporate media , of course , because they were too preoccupied “ reporting ” that the “ droves of protesters common earlier in the war did n’t turn out , ” probably because they realize protesting is more or less futile , especially with a war crimes complicit corporate media .
It is a sorry state of affair when the only viable antiwar candidate , Ron Paul , gets a scant 6 percent of the vote — due to voter fraud and the corporate media generally refusing to cover his campaign — while unabashed warmongers are expected — excuse me , arranged — to win the Oval Office .
It seems to strike few as sincerely surrealistic and demented that one of this hand - picked crop , John McCain , wants murder and mayhem for a hundred years and is obviously insane , unable to discern crucial religious differences between the people he wants to kill with depleted uranium .
Meanwhile , Hillary and Obama hardly mention the “ war ” at all , too busy going tit - for - tat at each other over complete and utter irrelevancies while the corporate media churns over and over the same story about a racist preacher ad nauseam .
Come November and the ascension of Hillary - Obama contra Obama - Hillary , one wonders if anybody will bother to protest at all or in such paltry and insignificant numbers that the corporate media will not even bother mentioning it .
Of course , a lot of blissed - out Dems , mesmerized by the trilateralist candidate Obama , will claim the war is over , if you want .
In fact , for all practical purposes , the “ war ” is over , as the corporate media does not report on it much anymore .
“ This week marks the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq , but you would n’t know it from what you see on TV , ” writes Paul Rieckhoff .
“ With all the scandal - mongering coverage of the Democratic primary , the media ’s been too busy to spend much time talking about the two wars we ’re still fighting .
In fact , just 3 % of the news in February was dedicated to the war .
That ’s down from 15 % of news coverage last July . ”
Rieckhoff wants Americans to sign an open letter demanding “ the major networks increase their coverage of the Iraq war . ”

A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent , increasing the brainpower they had at birth .
Until now , it had been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience  what psychologists call fluid intelligence  is innate and cannot be taught ( though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing ) .
But in the new study , researchers describe a method for improving this skill , along with experiments to prove it works .
The key , researchers found , was carefully structured training in working memory  the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it .
This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence , according to background information in the article , and appears to rely on the same brain circuitry .
So the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence .
India and Brazil have filed appeals against the adoption of the Microsoft - sponsored Office Open XML ( OOXML ) document format as an international standard .
Their appeals join one from South Africa , filed last Friday with the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) , the two standardization bodies responsible for the technical committee which approved the OOXML standard .
" By the deadline last night , we had received three appeals , from Brazil , India and South Africa , " said Jonathan Buck , spokesman for IEC .
" The Indian appeal was not lodged in the correct procedure it was not send to the CEOs of the two organizations but nonetheless it has been received , " Buck said , adding that it will be treated in the same way as the Brazilian and South African appeals .
Members of ISO / IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 ( JTC 1 ) adopted OOXML as a standard in a vote that closed on March 29 .
The so - called Fast Track process leading up to that vote has been widely criticized by participants and observers as too rushed .
If a draft standard going through that process is rejected in an initial vote because it requires further work , a ballot resolution meeting ( BRM ) is called to discuss the criticisms made and improve the draft .
Delegates at the February BRM for OOXML had just five days to deal with over 1,000 editorial changes and technical criticisms .
Since that meeting , in which many of the changes were put to a vote without discussion , the process has slowed down , and the final version of the text has still not been circulated to national standards bodies over a month after the deadline for publication set by JTC1 rules .
The rushed meeting and the delayed publication are among the grounds for appeal cited by South Africa and Brazil , according to copies of the letters posted by lawyer and standards blogger Andy Updegrove .
Officials at the Bureau of Indian Standards ( BIS ) and the Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas ( ABNT ) , Brazil 's national standards body , could not immediately be reached for comment .
The CEOs of ISO and IEC each have one month to examine the appeals and to try to reach a compromise with the national standards bodies .
If that fails , the appeals are passed to the Standards Management Board at IEC and the Technical Management Board ( TMB ) at ISO for resolution .
ISO will not say how many appeals it has received until after the TMB meeting on June 6 .
IEC 's Buck expects to have more to say about the appeals process next week , but noted that the situation is unusual .
" This is the first such appeal after a BRM process in ISO / IEC JTC 1 , although appeals occur regularly in other technical committees , " he said .
The importance of the OOXML standard is fast diminishing : Microsoft said last week that it does not expect to make its current generation of office productivity software , Office 2007 , compliant with the ISO / IEC version of the OOXML standard .
Instead it will issue a patch allowing that software to read and write files compatible with the rival OpenDocument Format , which has already been adopted as standard ISO / IEC 26300 .
That file format is used by the open - source OpenOffice.org , Sun Microsystems ' StarOffice and IBM's Symphony , among others .

Before African Visit , White House Cuts U.N. Troop Funds
Most of the Shortfall Will Hit Peacekeeping Missions in Africa
On the eve of President Bush 's trip to Africa , his administration has decided to drastically cut money for United Nations peacekeeping missions in war - torn countries there .
According to White House figures quietly released this week , more than $ 193 million for U.N. troops would be cut for missions in Liberia , Sudan , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Cote d'Ivoire and elsewhere .
A State Department official who would not be named confirmed to ABC News Monday that the cuts could be even worse .
For the record , State Department officials disputed cuts would be as deep as what the administration 's documents showed .
" We do n't yet know what the overall [ funding ] figure is for 2009 , " said State Department spokeswoman Jessica Simon .
Though its official budget says funding will be cut , the administration may ask Congress for more money through a supplemental bill later this year , she explained .
" America 's reputation and standing are not helped when we call and vote for -- but do n't pay our fair share of -- new and bigger U.N. peacekeeping operations in places like Darfur and Chad , " Deborah Derrick , executive director of the Better World Campaign , told ABC News .
" Great nations pay their bills . "
Derrick 's group and others say the administration 's figures understate the cuts .
Because the United States has already been underfunding U.N. peacekeeping operations , next year 's belt - tightening will actually mean the U.S. government will fail to pay more than $ 600 million it will owe .
More than $ 500 million of that shortfall will hit peacekeeping projects on the African continent , according to BWC and Refugees International , which conducted the study .
But privately , a State Department official said that no one could say whether there would be peacekeeping money included in any supplemental , and added that if spending this year increases , the shortfall in next year 's spending could appear even more dramatic .
The U.N. did not respond to a request for comment .
Year after year , the United States has failed to pay its assessed share of dues for U.N. peacekeeping efforts -- so - called " blue - helmet " missions to pacify hotspots that might otherwise require U.S. military intervention , as politicians from both parties have noted .
Total arrears are now nearly $ 1.2 billion , the advocacy groups said .
News of the proposed cuts come at an inconvenient time for the White House , which is preparing for a rare seven - day trip to Africa beginning Friday .
In preparation for the visit , White House officials have presented the image that , as one unnamed official recently told a reporter , " The president really cares about Africa . "
The trip is " an opportunity to demonstrate American commitment to the people of these countries and to Africa , " top Bush security official Steven Hadley said in a speech last week .
Hadley noted that the Bush administration has committed the United States to hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for education , health and finance projects in Africa .
Bush 's 2009 budget , Hadley said , " will ensure that our nation keeps its promise to our international partners and to the people of Africa . "
In war - torn Liberia , which President Bush will visit on his trip , the White House has proposed spending $ 56 million less on the U.N. peacekeeping mission there than it did last year .
Bush will also visit Rwanda , which is still struggling to right itself after a devastating , years - long civil war took the lives of millions .
His administration 's budget proposes cutting $ 5 million from the U.N. peacekeeping mission there , more than a quarter of the U.S. contribution to that effort .
The administration 's 2009 budget also cuts millions for U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Sudan ; Democratic Republic of Congo , where a decade - long war still claims thousands of lives a month ; Chad , where rebels attempted a violent overthrow of the government Feb. 2 ; and Cote d'Ivoire , whose stability the Bush administration says " is a critical element in restoring peace to the entire West African region . "
This post has been revised .
An earlier version stated the U.N. has a peacekeeping mission in Rwanda ; it has a tribunal .

An international panel set up to review whether economically - developed countries are keeping their promises to Africa said this week that progress in talks on a new global trade deal could help combat the current rise in food prices .
Peter Draper explains how the two are linked .
The causes of rising food prices are reasonably well - established .
The consequences are daily becoming more apparent , especially in Africa .
What is less well - understood is the implications a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization 's Doha Round of negotiations on a new trade deal might have for African agriculture and consumers of food .
The basic cause of rising food prices is a growing mismatch between supply of food and demand for it .
Rising energy prices feeding through energy - intensive supply - chains ; diversion of grains to biofuels production in response to concerns over global warming ; drought in key producing countries ( and the prospect of future " climate shocks " ) ; and declining productivity in food production ( accompanied by decreasing stocks ) are the main factors inhibiting supply .
Demand is rising in tandem with population growth in Asia particularly , within which rapidly growing urban middle classes in China and India are consuming more grain - fed meat products .
The consequence has been a sudden and sustained rapid rise in prices of key grain products .
The ongoing decline of the U.S. dollar has exacerbated this situation .
Poor , especially urban , consumers worldwide are caught in a rapidly escalating inflationary spiral encompassing food and transport prices , with second - round price spirals beginning to take hold in a range of countries and central banks powerless to reverse the trend .
Stagflation ( cost - push inflation combined with stagnant economic growth and rising unemployment ) , long thought banished to the 1970s , is now back on the radar .
Unfortunately the drivers will remain in place for the foreseeable future meaning that food price increases may be with us for some time – until demand and supply move back into a sustainable balance .
Whilst there are tentative indications this may be happening already , the question is whether this would be at higher price levels than the norms of the early part of this millennium .
Since it is very difficult , and inadvisable , to manipulate demand the key is to increase supply .
This entails a host of measures , including but not limited to trade policy .
Most notable is the need for a " New Green Revolution " – promoting dramatically increased yields .
Consequently the World Bank and others are gearing up for major investments in agriculture in poor countries , and especially in Africa .
What role do trade instruments play in this broader puzzle ?
And what impact could a Doha deal have ?
In the short - term trade taxes are the most effective trade instruments .
A number of countries have unilaterally reduced or eliminated tariffs on imported food products in order to minimise price increases .
Assuming domestic producers are not displaced by subsidised imports this is a critical policy tool .
Unfortunately a number of major exporters have imposed export taxes in order to keep supplies available domestically .
This is a terrible response : it discourages domestic producers from producing more , and it withdraws product from global markets thus raising prices further .
Somehow the use of this instrument needs to be disciplined , although I am not optimistic it will be .
Regarding Doha , start with subsidies .
These keep prices artificially low .
Two broad kinds are typically paid by developed country governments : domestic support ( price supports ; production payments ; environmental payments ; etc. ) ; and export subsidies .
In the Doha round the former will be capped and generally rendered " less trade distorting " whereas the latter are slated for elimination by 2013 .
In both cases if subsidies are removed prices for the products concerned will rise .
What about quotas ?
Those countries lucky enough to have quotas giving them preferential access into developed country markets can , in principle , restrict supply and raise prices .
Expanding those quotas may therefore have a damping effect on prices through introducing new competitors .
As tariffs are reduced the potential for greater competition in those markets will increase further .
Hence the end result could be substantial price reductions .
Much depends on the products concerned and the interplay between quota expansion , tariff reduction and subsidy removal .
Subsidy reductions would be good for African farmers and in principle should encourage more commercial production for export markets – as currently high food prices are now doing .
Offsetting this , tariff reductions and quota expansions may not suit some African farmers : they benefit from preferential access into European markets especially ; reduced tariffs and expanded quotas mean the margin of preference will diminish .
Overall , the major beneficiaries from such reforms , at least in the short to medium term , are likely to be major agricultural exporters in North America , Latin America , Southeast Asia , and Australasia .
In the medium to long - term , as African farmers ' litany of constraints are addressed and hopefully removed , and assuming climate change adaptation is adequately managed , they too should benefit .
There is growing international interest in Africa 's obvious comparative advantage in the international trading system : land abundance .
The longer the food crisis endures , the greater the pressure on African governments ( at least those in control of fertile lands ) to release land to commercial producers , domestic and foreign , for food and biofuels production .
This will pose substantial political challenges regarding land control and ownership , and in time will usher in sweeping changes to the stewardship of land across the continent .
Given the centrality of land and urbanization to African politics , in the context of generally weak institutional states this could mean a rocky ride ahead – or major opportunities , depending on one 's perspective .

What implications does this analysis hold ?
Major changes are afoot in the management of land and agricultural production ; African states need to prioritise this sector in partnership with donors in order to build capacities to meet the challenges ahead .
And whilst reform of the global agricultural trading regime is long overdue and pressing , it should not be conducted in a big - bang fashion .
A product - specific approach may be appropriate – for example remove cotton subsidies whilst reducing those on wheat .
Each country needs its own assessment of the political possibilities and the balance of interests at play here .
Hopefully such processes are well under way .

Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Hyde Editor ’s Note :
Whenever the Republicans have a touchy national - security scandal to put to rest , their favorite Democratic investigator is Lee Hamilton .
Over the years , Hamilton has developed a reputation as a very reasonable fellow who knows how far he can go without ruffling too many important feathers .
Hamilton ’s carefully honed skill for balancing truth against political comity has elevated him to the status of a Washington Wise Man .
In this guest essay , however , Jerry Meldon suggests that attendees at a Tufts conference on the Middle East might want to ask Hamilton about his past compromises with history .
( Plus , at the end of the essay , you may want to read an addendum from reporter Robert Parry on two questions that might be posed to Hamilton about decisions he made in wrapping up the so - called “ October Surprise ” case ) :
When former Rep. Lee Hamilton gives the keynote address – entitled “ Iraq : Today , Tomorrow , and Beyond ” – at a Tufts University symposium on March 27 , he may be thankful if he does n’t have to discuss “ yesterday . ”

He probably would prefer not to revisit fateful decisions he made while chairing investigations into Republican dirty work , especially those that let George H.W. Bush off the hook and cleared George W. Bush 's path to the White House .
As veteran journalist Robert Parry has persuasively argued at Consortiumnews.com , the Bush family name squeaked through the 80’s and early 90’s essentially mud-free , only because : -- On Christmas Eve 1992 , lame - duck President George H.W. Bush pardoned six of his earlier co-conspirators in the Iran - Contra affair ( the Reagan - Bush White House ’s diversion of profits from illegal arms sales to Iran to bankroll Nicaragua ’s contra terrorists in defiance of a congressional ban ) .
Until he was pardoned that day , former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger might have bought clemency by testifying against co-conspirator Bush .
--
After Bush left office on Jan. 20 , 1993 , President Bill Clinton ( along with other senior Democrats , including Hamilton ) cut short a congressional inquiry into Bush ’s secret billion - dollar loans to Saddam Hussein and did nothing to help Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh penetrate the Iran - Contra cover -up .
-- Hamilton also soft - pedaled two key congressional inquiries .
The first investigated the Iran - Contra scandal in 1987 and the second examined allegations that the 1980 Reagan - Bush campaign team had struck a treasonous deal with the hostage - holding Iranian government while Jimmy Carter was still president .
Conventional wisdom has attributed the target - friendliness of those latter investigations to Mr. Hamilton 's celebrated spirit of bipartisanship .
After all , what else could have persuaded Hamilton to narrow the scope of the Iran - Contra investigation in order to placate Dick Cheney and the rest of the committee 's Republicans , if not his desire to appear bipartisan ?
And how else to explain Hamilton ’s ill - advised decision to join with the panel ’s Republicans ( in defiance of all but one other Democrat ) and immunize the testimony of a man on whom it had the goods , Marine Lt. Col .
Oliver North ( whose operations in the Old Executive Office Building had been exposed by reporter Parry in 1985 - 86 ) ?
Thus emboldened , the cocky Col .
North proceeded to cover up for then - Vice President Bush , and North was spared a felony record because his later criminal conviction was reversed because of his immunized testimony , which Hamilton had helped arrange .
Hamilton ’s Iran-Contra performance was troubling .
But he went several steps further when he chaired the October Surprise Task Force and handed the Reagan - Bush administration a deck full of get - out - of - jail - free cards .
In the lead - up to the 1980 election , Republicans feared that Jimmy Carter would pull off an " October Surprise " and talk the Iranians into releasing 52 American hostages .
Carter 's failure to do so led to Reagan ’s landslide victory .
However , over the next several years , a parade of individuals alleged that Carter failed only because the Republicans had secretly agreed to arm Iran in exchange for a delay in the hostages ’ release .
Heated Republican denials notwithstanding , the fact remained that the Iranians chose to end the hostages ’ 444 - day ordeal within hours of Reagan ’s inauguration .
To put the nasty rumors to rest more than a decade later , the House Foreign Affairs Committee formed a task force under the leadership of Henry Hyde , R- Illinois , and … Lee Hamilton .
The task force was charged with examining allegations that in the summer and fall of 1980 Republican heavyweights , notably the vice presidential candidate , former CIA director George H.W. Bush , and the campaign director , future CIA director William J. Casey , had secretly flown to Europe to strike the fateful deal .
The key issue was the veracity of Bush ’s and Casey ’s alibis .
In the heat of his 1992 re-election campaign , an angry President Bush accused the task force of waging a “ witch hunt . ”
Obligingly , Hamilton and Hyde disclosed that partially redacted Secret Service records backed Bush 's alibi , thus clearing him of suspicion .
However , Spencer Oliver , chief counsel to the House Foreign Affairs Committee , objected , asking why key sections of those records were blacked out ; why one crucial entry asserted a trip to a Maryland country club that Bush never took ; and why the identity of a person who supposedly met with Bush was withheld from the task force .
Oliver charged that the Bush administration was stonewalling : “ They have sought to block , limit , restrict and discredit the investigation in every possible way … President Bush ’s recent outbursts [ about ] his whereabouts in mid-October of 1980 are disingenuous at best since the administration has refused to make available the documents and the witnesses that could finally and conclusively clear Mr. Bush . ”
Journalist Parry adds : “ The Bush administration flatly refused to give any more information to the House task force unless it agreed never to interview [ Mr. Bush 's ] alibi witness and never to release [ that person ’s ] name .
Amazingly , the task force accepted the administration ’s terms . ”
Hamilton ’s treatment of Mr. Bush was outrageously deferential .
But it was pit - bull - like compared to how he handled the attempts to provide the late Mr. Casey with an alibi .
The Republicans first insisted that Casey could not have flown to meet with the Iranians when it was alleged that he did , because on that particular weekend he had attended a historical conference in London .
But that alibi had to be ditched when historian and conference attendee Robert Dallek reported that Casey had missed a strategically timed morning session .
No problem .
A new alibi was introduced that instead placed Casey at California ’s Bohemian Grove retreat .
As it turned out , Casey had indeed stayed at the Bohemian Grove , only not on the decisive weekend .
Unfazed , Hamilton ’s task force acted as if Casey 's alibi remained solid and issued a report that exonerated both Casey and Bush .
Not long afterward , task force co-chair Henry Hyde acknowledged that Casey ’s 1980 passport had vanished along with key pages in his personal calendar .
Unperturbed , Lee Hamilton penned a New York Times Op - Ed in which he cited Casey ’s so - called alibi in insisting that the House task force ’s report “ should put the controversy to rest once and for all . ”
Only later did journalist Robert Parry rummage through the task force ’s records to discover a photograph of the 16 men who had been at the Bohemian Grove on that notorious weekend in the summer of 1980 in the company , it was claimed , of William Casey .
Casey was not in the photo , a fact that the task force had conveniently neglected to report .
[ For more details on the October Surprise mystery , see Parry ’s 2004 book , Secrecy & Privilege : Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq . ]
So , on March 27 – as Mr. Hamilton participates in the Fares Center ’s symposium , “ The United States and the Middle East : What Comes Next After Iraq ? ” – the Tufts community will have the opportunity to ask Mr. Hamilton exactly why he has repeatedly kept Americans in the dark about critical episodes of their nation ’s history in dealing with the Middle East .

He can be contacted at jerry.meldon@tufts.edu
Addendum from reporter Robert Parry :
If someone does get to ask Hamilton a question or two on the October Surprise case , there are two new points worth pressing him on :
One , task force chief counsel Larry Barcella told me in an interview that so much incriminating evidence was pouring in to the task force at the end of 1992 that he recommended to Hamilton that the investigation be extended a few months so the new material could be evaluated .
Hamilton refused and instead ordered the report to be issued exonerating the Bush - Casey crowd .
Barcella said Hamilton cited the complexity of getting the task force re-authorized heading into a new Congress .
But should n't evidence of such a serious political crime and of such an important historical event take precedence over clerical matters like getting an extension approved ?
Two , on Jan. 11 , 1993 , just two days before the House task force issued its debunking report , Hamilton received a classified report from the Russian Duma 's national security committee revealing what Moscow 's intelligence files showed about the U.S. October Surprise controversy .
The Russian report confirmed that Casey , Bush and CIA officer Robert Gates had attended meetings in Europe with senior Iranian officials regarding the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 .
However , the House task force did nothing with this remarkable report , besides stick it in a box with other papers from the investigation .
Two days later , on Jan. 13 , 1993 , Hamilton presided over a press conference dismissing the October Surprise allegations , but he made no reference then or at any time since to the Russian report , which I later recovered from the files .
Barcella told me that the task force did n't want to be bothered with trying to get it declassified .
So they stuck it in the box .
( He envisioned it ending up in a giant government warehouse , like in “ Raiders of the Lost Ark . ” )
But why did n't Hamilton ( who took over as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1993 ) arrange for the Russian report to be declassified and shared with the American people ?
I know these may not be exactly topical questions , but they do relate to U.S. dealings with the Middle East , especially given Iran 's current role in Iraq .
Many of the same Iranians from the October Surprise case ( such as Karrubi and Rafsanjani ) are still active .
Thanks .

The Navy recently restarted the program , inviting the two companies to submit fixed - price proposals for three additional ships .
Lockheed , still hoping to win the entire prize , said the problems encountered with the Freedom would not be repeated , now that the company has a finished design .
“ It will be great , the next time around , ” said Mr. North , the program manager .
“ Lead ships are truly hard . ”
Navy and industry officials say blame for the program ’s rocky early history has to be shared .
“ It ’s easy to lay all the blame at the foot of the government , and the Navy was naïve , but the companies bear some of the responsibility , ” said a senior industry official who asked not to be identified because of his involvement in the project .
“ They were playing the game to get the contract , not owning up about all the issues until well into the game , hoping to make some recovery downstream . ”
Mr. McCreary , the Marinette general manager , said that while the shipyard might not have fully mastered the Navy ’s accounting system , it had given the Navy frequent progress reports showing problems mounting .
Mr. Winter , the Navy secretary , complained that the Navy bureaucracy had failed to alert him to rising costs .
The Pentagon , he said , was bedazzled by the idea of saving money and time with commercial technologies .
“ It got oversold , ” he said .
“ The concept was just abused . ”
He lamented the Pentagon ’s eroding expertise in systems engineering  managing complex new projects to ensure that goals are achievable and affordable  and faulted the notion that industry could best manage ambitious development projects .
“ Quite frankly , industry is not good at doing this , ” he said .
Recently , Mr. Winter said , he instituted new procedures to ensure tighter supervision of all shipbuilding projects .
He says he is confident that the coastal - ships program will produce a fleet of fine , affordable vessels .
But as he contemplates the Navy ’s long - range rebuilding plans , he says he stands behind a scorching critique that he delivered at a convention in Washington last year :
“ If we do not figure out how to establish credibility in our shipbuilding programs and plans , and restore confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments , we cannot expect Congress or the nation to provide us with the resources we so urgently need . ”

I went to a session today on financial innovation .
The panelists were :
Micha el Milken , Chairman , Milken Institute ; Chairman , FasterCures / The Center for Accelerating Medical Solutions
Lewis Ranieri , Prime Originator and Founder , Hyperion Private Equity Funds ; Chairman , CEO and President , Ranieri & Co. Inc .
Richard Sandor , Chairman and CEO , Chicago Climate Exchange ; Senior Fellow , Milken Institute
Myron Scholes , Nobel Laureate , 1997 ; Chairman , Platinum Grove Asset Management
Moderator : Andrew Rosenfield , Managing Partner , Guggenheim Partners LLC ; Chairman , Gugge nheim Investment Advisors
These are some of the architects of the mortgage backed securities and other innovative financial instruments .
The people on stage still very much believe in financial innovation .
They see financial innovation as a means of solving the world 's major problems , e.g. making it possible to trade property rights for water and air , as a way to save endangered species , as a way of lifting the poor out of poverty , as a solution ( rather than a cause ) of the problems we are having today in mortgage markets .
It is very much in their own financial interests to believe these things , and these are people who know how to sell an idea or product or they would n't be where they are , and it was clear from a variety of sessions they were there - in part - to argue against regulation that would inhibit their ability to create new financial instruments .
So all of their comments should be taken in that light .
They have convinced themselves that they hold the keys to the drivers of world growth and the solutions to the world 's problems , and they do not want anything standing in their way .
In fact , one of their biggest regrets from the crisis is that other countries will no longer hold our financial system in such high esteem and will shy away from financial innovation that could be very helpful to their development ( and the panelist 's pocketbooks ) .
Their creations are now viewed as imperfect , and that seemed to bother them .
In their defense of financial innovation , they said something I 've said too , so I have some sympathy for the argument .
They said that it was n't the financial vehicles themselves that were the problem , it was the way that they were used , and the way that warnings of impending trouble were ignored .
And the biggest problem in the way they were used was to give people free ( zero price ) options .
People could purchase a house with zero money down , realize the gains if the price goes up , and since the loans are non-recourse , walk away relatively unscathed if the price turns downward .
Giving people free options was the problem , it was n't the financial instruments themselves ( in fact , they thought that since they distributed the losses all over the world , the new financial instruments probably saved US banks who could not have absorbed the losses on their own ) .
Another problem that was cited was bond agencies , though Milken argued that any investor ought to do their own rating and not trust anyone else ( to which Scholes replied why should we duplicate the same effort thousands of times - would n't it be better if the market could do this for us and save the duplicated effort ? ) , so his was another area they cited as needing attention .
But notice that , once again , it 's not the financial instruments , it 's the lousy ratings agencies .
What is their solution to our financial market problems ?
They say , unsurprisingly , that this is not something the government needs to solve , or can solve , the government needs to get out of the way and let the private sector solve the problem .
I 'm supportive of the idea that we should be careful about getting in the way of financial innovation , but I do n't think the solution is for the government to get out of the way , there are market failures ( e.g. moral hazard from lack of capital requirements ) that will not correct themselves .

British scientists have unlocked one of the secrets behind how cancer spreads around the body .
The breakthrough , carried out at Manchester University , could help pave the way for a generation of drugs that would halt up to 90 per cent of cancers in their tracks .
Such drugs could be particularly effective against breast and lung tumours - two of the biggest killers .
More than 150,000 Britons a year are killed by cancer , and breast and lung tumours account for almost a third of those deaths .
The disease spreads when cancerous cells break away from the original tumour and are distributed around the body by the bloodstream .
Further tumours develop where these cells eventually end up and start multiplying .
Researcher Dr Chris Ward said : " Understanding how cancer cells spread is tremendously important for cancer research .
" It is the ability of tumours to invade other tissues and spread around the body that makes them so dangerous .
" The cancer just overwhelms the body . "
Dr Ward used embryonic stem cells to study the mechanism cancer cells use to spread around the body .
He showed that a protein called Ecadherin is essential to keeping cells stuck together .
When levels of E - cadherin fall , other proteins move to the surface of the cells and they are able to break away and spread .
Researchers now aim to create drugs that interfere with this process .
Dr Ward said : " Potentially , our findings can be applied to the most common form of cancer , carcinoma , found in the breast , lung and gut for example , which makes up 80 to 90 per cent of all cancers . "
Norman Barrett of the Association for International Cancer Research , which funded the study , said : " Dr Ward and his team are pursuing research which could change the lives of tens of thousands of people in the UK and many more across the world . "
E - cadherin is one of several elements involved in cancer spread - known as metastasis - to have been identified in recent months .
Research at the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York appeared to suggest that loss of three short pieces of genetic material aids the spread of breast cancer to the lungs and bone .
The researchers , whose work is reported in the journal Nature , said : " These findings may enhance our ability to come up with more effective drugs . "
Dr Mark Matfield , scientific coordinator at the AICR , such studies identified potential targets for new drugs .
" We are in a golden age of cancer research , " he said .
" By no means all of these targets will develop into useful drugs but if only a proportion of them do , there is still going to be a lot more new treatments for cancer . "
They 've travelled all over the globe but if they could return to just one special place which would it be ?

Colin Thubron
Khotan , China
What appeals to me about revisiting Khotan is that it 's like jumping back in time , like going back to the still heart sitting at the centre of Asia .
It 's a little - known oasis city in the middle of north - west China with the Taklimakan Desert to its north .
The Taklimakan is the deadliest desert on earth - its name means ' once you go in you never come out ' .
You have to be rather determined to get to Khotan .
There 's no railway .
You have to take a bus from Kashgar , which is several hundred miles to the north - west .
It 's been closed to foreigners until fairly recently and I first went a couple of years ago .
It has a great history .
It was on the 2,000 - year - old southern Silk Road between China and the West so it has a feel of ancientness about it .
You can wander off into the desert on a day 's camel ride and find ruins and the tombs of holy men sitting in this very strange and very dead desert .
They still manufacture hand - spun silk in the old - fashioned way .
You can wander about the rivers that come down from the Tibetan plateau and find jade in them .
The city appeals to me because it escapes any strong sense of belonging to a particular nation or even to a particular period of history .
It belongs to a world when national boundaries and identities did n't really exist , when people identified themselves more by religion or city or clan .
That 's part of its appeal .
What I think you gain from visiting it is a sense of proportion .
The urgency of the modern is not present .
You gain a sense of quietude .
It 's a multicultural city in that it's a little bit Chinese , a little bit Indian and it's Islamic .
The effect is of a multi- layered city which is so ethnically diverse that you feel like you 're meeting the world there .

Jan Morris
Trieste , Italy
I determined long ago that I would spend much of my afterlife haunting my favourite foreign city .
I first set eyes on Trieste at the end of the Second World War when the British Army took me there , and the feelings I had about it then are precisely the feelings I have about it now , more than 60 years later .
They are feelings not of nostalgia exactly , but of what the Welsh call hiraeth - a longing for something , but I 'm not sure what ...
I was 19 when I first saw the place , and for one of my sensibility the timing was perfect .
Trieste was in limbo .
It was like a sort of nowhere .
Once it had been the prime sea outlet of the Austro - Hungarian empire , one of the great ports of the world .
By the time I got there it was a backwater , wistfully uncertain of itself , unsure even of what nationality it was going to be when the muddle of war resolved itself .
I loved this .
I loved the great blue empty bay of Trieste , with the little castle of Miramare on its peninsula and the harsh limestone mountains of the Karst region all around .
I loved its ethnic confusions , where Slavs , Latins and Teutons mingled , its pompous imperial architecture and its anomalous Viennese cafe culture , down there at the head of the Adriatic .
I loved its literary associations - James Joyce , Italo Svevo , Richard Burton .
I even liked the fact that it was a disputed city , with Marshal Tito 's hostile Yugoslavian armies always watchful on those hills .
Most of all I liked its sweet melancholy , and that 's still what I like the most .
Today 's Trieste is not really melancholy at all - it 's often very lively , in fact .
In my own mind , though , as I loiter on the waterfront , or sit in one of those Franz Josef - era cafes , or catch an evening at the opera , or wander along pathways of the Karst , or just look out across the water at Miramare , where Archduke Ferdinand spent his last happy days - in my mind this kind city seems to bask in its own tristesse , as I do myself .
For the truth is that I love Trieste because I see myself in it .
It is separate , on its own , bittersweet , a bit enigmatic , neither quite one thing nor another - in short , my kind of town !

Pongo de Mainique , Peru
The stretch of the Urubamba River north of Machu Picchu is difficult to get to but it is amazing .
Rafting north , towards the Amazon , you navigate a series of rapids which take you into the most wonderful , magical place I 've been in all my travels : the Pongo De Mainique ( Pongo meaning a ravine or gorge ) .
It 's about a half a mile long and lies at the transition point between the Andes and the Amazon plain .
At the end of the gorge , almost as though they were created by a designer , stand two great blocks of granite , on either side of the river .
Once you go through them you 're in a different world and there is this extraordinary transition into the Amazon basin as the clay and the sandstone turn the river red .
The Pongo itself is very calm and the canyon is probably only about a hundred feet deep .
The sides are sleek black basalt and because it rains so much there , on the edge of the Amazon jungle , the water streams down the sides , making the rocks shine like black marble .
After the noise of the rapids , the serenity of the place makes it a sort of lost world .
I felt as though I could live there very happily for the rest of my life on a little bit of beach , eating the local fruit .
Giant black butterflies flutter about and fantastic yellow - necked vultures fly overhead .
It really is like being in an antediluvian paradise .
My travels are motivated by the desire to see new places .
But I want to go there again simply to remind myself that it was real .

Tim Morre
Asbyrgi , Iceland
I 'm not quite sure why abandoned industrial structures should lure me so magnetically , and would rather not confess my unedifying fascination with violent natural catastrophe .
Yet no place on earth satisfies these twin passions more rewardingly than the canyon known as Asbyrgi , in Iceland 's lonely north - east .
Viking settlers attributed the mighty , sheer - sided horseshoe - shaped depression they discovered near the coast to the stamping hoof of Odin 's charger .
Barely less abrupt and profound was the geological calamity now considered responsible : 8,000 years ago , a volcanic eruption beneath Europe 's largest glacier , far away in the south , unleashed a stupendous torrent of meltwater that stripped away bedrock as it roared northwards , ultimately cleaving out a vast canyon , crowned by a waterfall of Niagara - belittling potency that was a kilometre wide and 100 metres high .
All this , it is believed , occurred in a single day .
As the angriest flood to have coincided with man 's tenancy on Earth receded , the river it created shifted tack .
Today , all that remains at Asbyrgi is an apologetic trickle spattering onto the jagged , shed - sized boulders tossed nonchalantly over the precipice in those shattering 24 hours and left stacked up in the former waterfall 's plunge pool .
Perhaps it is this that gives the scene its poignantly forsaken , post - industrial quality - no gentle , age - smoothed decline and fall , just the sense of a plug suddenly pulled on some fearsome process .
Silence is n't hard to come by in Iceland , but there 's something different about the silence in Asbyrgi .
The towering walls of rock have kept the steadily battering Arctic winds at bay , in the process allowing a jolly little forest to colonise the canyon floor .
Strolling among the shoulder - high birch trees and conifers it 's difficult to imagine that this place of bird - twittering calm was ever home to such a ferocious scene .
Though trying to get to sleep in a poxy Glastonbury dome - tent at Asbyrgi 's campsite during a thunderstorm makes it easier .

William Dalrymple
Delhi , India
I first went to Delhi as a backpacker in the early Eighties .
The city is woven in and out of all my books .
I just find it endlessly fascinating .
What I love about it is the layering of the city - as in Rome or Cairo you get this feeling of living on successive periods of history , and it crops up in the most weird places .
Old Mogul tombs sit on roundabouts , and get in the way on the golf course .
People just can't avoid the sheer accumulated rubbish of the ages .
Each layer adds to the last .
You still find old colonels from the Thirties walking around , bumping into modern software processors , and on the same street Sufis are reciting poems from the 14th century .
There are new suburbs with huge skyscrapers coming out of nowhere in land that was billowing with winter wheat four years ago .
I plan to continue living in Delhi .
It has an impossible climate for four months of the year during which I come back to Europe .
It 's pretty perfect the rest of the year .
In Delhi everything is much slower than in London , I get much more reading done , much more writing .
It 's a quieter life - anyone will tell you that Delhi is not one of the world 's liveliest of cities for nightlife - but there 's any number of compensations for that .
I can get a flight to the beach on weekends .
Rather than going to some damp cottage in Wiltshire you can be sitting in a palace in Rajasthan .

Venice , Italy
My ideal place , rather predictably , would be Venice .
I finished the Second World War there when I was about 21 .
I 'd had two years of fighting , but as I had been late into the army , I was late out .
So to keep me happily occupied I was made editor of the British Eighth Army newspaper , Union Jack .
It was the perfect job .
I had a vast Italianate office , Venice was uncrowded - the only people there were the Venetians , which does n't happen these days - and everyone was thrilled to still be alive .
Venice was blossoming : Harry 's
Bar was the place to be ; the girls were gorgeous ; Venice was lovely and undamaged .
I stayed nearly a year and had to be dragged kicking and screaming back to austere London where the lights went out and there was petrol and food rationing and terrible weather .
I 've been back to Venice many times since .
I was there in March last year in the freezing cold .
Instead of tourists , there were crocodiles of Italian schoolchildren marching through the alleyways chanting and brushing you aside .
I stayed at the Gritti Palace on the Grand Canal , but I have rented an apartment in the past too .
I like the idea of renting , but the problem with Venice is that it is such a rabbit warren it takes you days to find out how to get back to your apartment .
It 's a triumph when you finally recognise somewhere .
I thought I knew Venice but suddenly you 're in the middle of that kaleidoscope of people and places and little bridges and little canals , and you do n't know where the hell you are - especially after a party at one in the morning when there are n't many people about .
I 'm not a great walker normally but in Venice you have to walk and its perfect .

Jenny Diski
South Georgia , Antarctica
I 'd go back to South Georgia and Antarctica like a shot because it 's so beautiful and empty .
I was there in 1999 .
I went on a Russian oceanographic boat .
It had not been fixed up as a cruise ship so was quite basic .
There were only about 60 travellers and all the crew were Russian , so it had a strange otherworldliness .
It did have a sauna , though , which is good when you 've been on a very cold beach .
And it had a bar where the barman made Manhattans with ice from passing glaciers .
We went to various places around the Antarctic continent peninsula , but it was South Georgia I really loved .
It 's a thousand miles from the tip of South America and in the middle of nowhere .
It 's part of the Falkland Islands and used to be a great whaling station .
Now it 's the most beautiful , desolate place with rusted old equipment and half - sunk boats the rust has eaten away .
And there 's a museum run by a nice Englishman with a red face and a thick jumper .
I have been back to some places twice and it's never as good the second time .
But I would love to do another cruise or be left on South Georgia to stew a bit .

Ilha de Mozambique
Hidden away among the mudbanks and mangroves of the Mozambique Channel lies a small tropical island containing an exquisite 16th - century European city .
I chanced upon it during the civil war , turning up with a TV crew and finding that the abandoned capital of Portugal 's African empire , a miniaturised version of old Lisbon , was now home to 10,000 refugees .
Squeezed into decaying , once - grand houses ( every time it rained , another fell down ) subsisting on shellfish and seaweed , they treated us courteously , showing us around the extraordinary government buildings with their grand audience chambers and state apartments .
Then - being country people governed by the inflexible rules of country hospitality - they threw a welcome party .
Beside a crumbling pink palace fires were lit for men to warm their drums .
Ululating women with clay - daubed faces began to shuffle and stomp .
Gradually everyone joined in , all the hungry and dispossessed jubilantly dancing with us until , shortly before daybreak , [ rebel ]
Renamo militia turned up and chased us foreigners away .

It was only discovered in the 20th century and it's not really on the usual tourist route .
It is 300 miles from civilisation , way out in the middle of the desert , so it is quite an adventure just getting there .

Hunza Valley , Pakistan
The first glimpse you get of the Hunza Valley is incredible .
The town sits right below this vast , white mountain , Mount Rakaposhi , and the valley is beautiful , with poplar trees .
The area is famous for its dried apricots and as you go into the valley you get a weird optical illusion .
At first sight it seems like everything is orange .
As you get closer you realise that every square inch of every rock around the town has got a hard apricot on it , drying in the sun .
I 've only been there once but I remember it as somewhere very magical .
Hunza was self - governing in a sort of medieval way , ruled by a leader known as the Mir who lived in a palace at the top of the valley .
It was not until the Seventies when they built the Karakoram Highway through Hunza , linking it to China , that it opened up .
This valley , which ought to be a dead end , actually has a well - built , two - lane tar road running through it built by China and Pakistan for military purposes .
The journey north from Hunza on the Karakoram Highway is spectacular .
It takes you up over the westernmost part of the Himalayas .

Black Rock Desert , Nevada , Usa
I first went to the Black Rock Desert in 1993 .
There was this endless expanse of flat white nothingness .
It was the emptiest landscape I had ever seen .
There was nothing there but distance .
I assumed I would never set foot there again but between 1999 and 2005 I returned five times , to the annual Burning Man festival , to a temporary city of 25,000 people .
Every time I went back to Black Rock City - always to be greeted with the words : ' Welcome home ' - my eyes would blur with tears .

Turkey
My first visit to Turkey was to Istanbul , then a crazy , frightening - looking place .
It 's changed a great deal since .
I first went in 1956 on the way to the Hindu Kush with my friend Hugh Carless who was in the Diplomatic Service .
We arrived in Istanbul late in the evening and there were campfires burning all around so it was an incredibly romantic situation .
I enjoyed Turkey .
It 's a wonderful country and its population was very nice .
Southern Turkey was an absolute ruin - fancier 's heaven .
The Observer provided me with a Land Rover and I toured the country putting together a guidebook for the newspaper .
I did n't find Turkey particularly difficult to travel in - no more than anywhere else really .

Well , because it was there , as someone once said .

Franklin River , Tasmania
The Franklin River is one of the last wilderness areas on earth and until you 've walked earth that other Homo sapiens have n't trodden , you do n't know what you 're missing .
I spent six days drifting downstream past ancient huon pines that were alive when Christ was crucified .
There is a rhythm between complete calm where the river is carrying you along - when cliff faces , trees and the sky are reflected in the water - and the rapids , when your life flashes past you .
It was an extraordinary experience .
I would love to go back and do the full 12 - day trip from the source in the Cheyne
Mountains down to where the Franklin comes out into Macquarie Harbour .
One of the highlights was when we came to the Kuti Kina cave .
It was the farthest south man got during the last Ice Age and it's where the Aboriginals holed up for 8,000 years .
Going down this river offers the possibility that you will see species thought to have vanished .
While we were there a German tourist about 50 miles east of us had taken two photographs of what he claimed was a Tasmanian tiger .
If the images are real it will have been the first time one has been spotted since 1936 .
The novelist James McQueen said of the Franklin that ' for me it is the epitome of all the lost forests , all the submerged lakes , all the tamed rivers , all the extinguished species ' .
That really sums it up for me .
It 's a wilderness that stands for all wildernesses .

Bamiyan , Afghanistan
I think Bamiyan is so poignant because of what has been lost .
I 've only been once - two - and - half years ago .
I was quite lucky to get through with the ' Pax Americana ' ; the Americans had just taken Afghanistan and there was a hiatus during which the trail had been opened for the first time in a generation .
The Iranians closed it in 1979 with their revolution and then when the Russians went into Afghanistan it stayed closed , so it was really only three years ago that the original route reopened .
It would be crazy to go into Afghanistan by land now .
I arrived in Bamiyan at sunset .
Flaxen light was spilling down along a lentil - red valley , glancing off the sheer sandstone cliffs .
It was an amazingly beautiful sight .
The mountain face is peppered by gunshot , the arches and painted ceilings all destroyed , the frescoes all blackened by smoke , but at sunset something quite magical happens .
Because of the way the sun falls when it 's setting it does n't light the inside of the alcoves where the Buddhas once stood so you get this trompe l'oeil - a trick of the light which creates an impression that something is still there .
The paradox is that we know the Buddhas have been destroyed and it's a terrible loss but really they were quite ugly .
They are almost more beautiful now , since their destruction , than they were before .
And at dusk when the shadows are deepest , there 's this trick of the light which seems to trace something much more refined and ethereal in their place .
I would go back to see this again .
There is something very spiritual and moving about the Bamiyan valley .
To sit on the top of the Buddha cliff surrounded by spectral peaks beyond the sandstone cliffs - with the occasional Apache helicopter to bring you back down to earth - is incredible .
It gives me a sense of hope .

Peninsula Valdes , Patagonia , Argentina
Once you have seen an elephant seal in full burble , you know you have to come back !
This small , windswept peninsula has not only elephant seals , but fur seals , right whales and killer whales ; and penguins a few kilometres to the south .
What I remember most is how hard it was to get there in 1974 , when our budget was $ 10 a day for two people .
We spent five or so hours trying to hitchhike in a dust storm before giving up and hiring a car .
We could afford the basic hire but not the mileage surcharge so drove part of the 150 km in reverse .
By driving 10 km forward , and then 10 km in reverse the mileometer did n't change - highly dishonest and I 'm not proud of this .
We got our just desserts when we reversed into a huge hole and had to be lifted out by helpful locals who then kindly waited to see us safely on our way - unfortunately the wrong way since we could n't explain that we were driving backwards .
If I went back , I would contribute more to Argentina 's economy , and spend a few days revisiting Punta Norte and its wonderful elephant seals which , to me , look and behave like rugby players .
I never saw the famous killer whales last time , so I would be sure to include those and the huge colony of Magellanic Penguins at Punto Tombo to the south .

Obama camp blasts ' dangerous ' McCain proposals Nick Juliano
Published : Monday June 2 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama 's presidential campaign is forcefully denouncing Republican nominee John McCain 's speech to a pro-Israel group Monday , calling his proposals little more than a continuation of President Bush 's foreign policy and claiming the Arizona senator is distorting Obama 's position on Iran .
" Why should anyone expect that ( McCain ) will have better results than this president has ? " asked Rep. Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) , during a campaign - sponsored conference call Monday .
McCain spoke earlier in the day at a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington , where he panned Obama for saying he would meet with leaders of Iran and other US enemies .
" It 's hard to see what such a summit with President ( Mahmoud ) Ahmadinejad would actually gain , except an earful of anti-Semitic rants , and a worldwide audience for a man who denies one Holocaust and talks before frenzied crowds about starting another , " McCain told the AIPAC crowd .
Obama 's campaign released a quick statement slamming McCain for offering little beyond Bush - redux .
 John McCain stubbornly insists on continuing a dangerous and failed foreign policy that has clearly made the United States and Israel less secure , " Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said in the e-mailed statement .
 Instead of recognizing reality , John McCain continues to run on a platform of doubling down on George Bush 's failed policies , while carrying on his divisive brand of politics .
The United States and Israel cannot afford four more years of an unwillingness to change course .
Obama foreign policy adviser Denis McDonough reminded reporters on the afternoon conference call that even as McCain and President Bush demagogue Obama 's call for more diplomacy with Iran , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates also is advocating engagement .
The presumptive GOP nominee also said -- erroneously -- that Obama was against declaring Iran 's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
While Obama did miss the vote on one resolution offered by Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) and John Kyl ( R - AZ ) , he co-sponsored another measure that would 've declared the Iranian Guard a terror organization .
Obama 's resolution , unlike the one McCain cited , did not lay out conditions that could expand the mission of US troops in Iraq to include fighting in Iran , McDonough said .
" We think that was mission creep , " he said .
" We think that was a mistake , and that 's why Barrack strongly opposed it . "
Obama , who has struggled to attract Jewish voters , will be speaking to AIPAC on Wednesday , and the speech will allow him to amplify his support for Israel and stress his proposals to change course from the Bush administration , Schiff said .
The Illinois senator has been holding more events to meet Jewish voters face - to - face , including a recent town hall meeting at a synagogue in Boca Raton , Florida .
Scurrilous e-mails spreading untrue rumors that Obama is a Muslim have proved to be a stumbling block among these voters , Schiff said , and the outreach is an attempt to correct those mis-impressions .
" A lot of what people have heard about him , particularly in the jewish community , " he said , " have come from these e-mails . "
Addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) today , Republican presidential nominee John McCain called for a global campaign of divestment from Iran .
He might want to start with his own campaign manager , Rick Davis , whose work on behalf of Ukrainian mogul Rinat Akhmetov included business dealings with Tehran .
McCain used his wide - ranging address to target Iran for the kind of worldwide sanctions regime applied to apartheid - era South Africa .
( Unsurprisingly , the self - proclaimed " foot soldier in the Reagan revolution " neglected to mention his hero 's opposition to South African divestment . )
Monday morning , McCain declared :
" We should privatize the sanctions against Iran by launching a worldwide divestment campaign .
As more people , businesses , pension funds , and financial institutions across the world divest from companies doing business with Iran , the radical elite who run that country will become even more unpopular than they are already . "
Sadly for McCain , that sweep would net his long - time adviser and campaign manager Rick Davis .
As Talking Points Memo detailed just this past Friday , Davis ' extensive lobbying operation prominently features clients doing deals with the Iranian regime .
At the same Davis was heading up John McCain 's so - called Reform Institute , his firm was representing the Ukrainian oligarch Akmetov and his businesses in Tehran :
Davis Manafort was helping Akhmetov 's conglomerate , System Capital Management Holdings , to develop a " corporate communications strategy " between the beginging of 2005 through the end of summer 2005 , the company said .
The company 's subsidiary , Metinvest , a steel company , has one of its 11 offices in Tehran .
And another subsidiary , Khartsyzsk Pipe Plant , sells large pipes to Iran .
As of Friday , the McCain camp was pleading ignorance .
According to TPM , " a McCain aide told us Davis did not work on that account while he was heading up the firm .
And he was unaware of the company 's ties to Iran . "
As it turns out , John McCain is following Mitt Romney and Dick Cheney as just the latest hard - line Republican to run afoul of his own plans for Iranian disinvestment .
But only John McCain is still in the running to be President of the United States .
The only question now is whether he 'll obey his own call for action against organizations doing business with Iran and divest his own campaign manager .
UPDATE : Huffington
Post reports that McCain senior adviser and GOP uber - lobbyist Charlie Black 's firm represented CNOOC , the Chinese national oil conglomerate , which also happens to have business dealings with Iran .
Meanwhile , the Obama campaign notes that John McCain failed to support Iran sanctions legislation sponsored by Obama in 2007 , a bill currently rumored to be " on hold " by Alabama Republican , Richard Shelby .
Take the AOL Hot Seat Poll below the fold :
Talks between Mr Kibaki ( L ) and Mr Odinga have been difficult A deal has been agreed between Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga to form a cabinet - ending a long - running political crisis .
The new cabinet would be announced on Sunday , political sources said .
The crisis was sparked by controversial presidential election results in December , triggering violence in which some 1,500 people died .
A power - sharing deal was agreed in February but had been hampered by a row over the division of cabinet posts .
Displaced
The deal was struck after hours of closed - door talks at the Sagana State Lodge , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) north - east of the capital , Nairobi .
A political source close to one of the leaders told AFP news agency : " The two leaders held talks [ Saturday ] and agreed on a new coalition cabinet that will be unveiled around lunch time [ Sunday ] . "
KENYA PARLIAMENT
Orange Democratic Movement ( Odinga ) MPs : 102 Party of National Unity ( Kibaki ) MPs : 46 Pro-ODM MPs : 5 Pro-PNU MPs : 61 Vacant seats : 6
Difficult tasks await MPs Q&A : Power - sharing pact A Western diplomat confirmed to the agency a deal had been signalled and that the leaders wanted a cabinet in place " before parliament resumes on Tuesday " .
The BBC's Adam Mynott in Nairobi says there have been apparent solutions before , so sceptics will refuse to accept that there has been a genuine breakthrough until they see firm evidence .
Talks seemed to have broken down this week as Mr Odinga held out for the 50 - 50 split in cabinet posts he said he was promised by the accord to end the post - poll violence .
In addition to those who died , another 600,000 were displaced in January and February .
Many thousands have yet to return to their homes .
Mr Odinga will become prime minister but there were no immediate reports on the make - up of the cabinet .
The cabinet will work on framing a new constitution that will tackle long - standing grievances over land , wealth and power .
The two leaders had come under intense international pressure to achieve a breakthrough following the February deal that was brokered by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .

( Back story : our local government has banned Grand Theft Auto 4 , but this was never publicly announced .
I put up a sign that said in big letters “ GTA IV IS BANNED AND IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SALE ” . )
Me : “ Good evening , how can I help you ? ”
Customer : “ I wanna buy Grand Theft Auto 4 . ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry , sir , but that game is unavailable as it is banned in Dubai . ”
Customer : “ So… how much ? ”
Me : “ It ’s banned .
You ca n’t buy it in the country . ”

Sorry , I did n’t notice it before … ”
( He spends several minutes studying the sign intently . )
Customer : “ Can you reserve a copy for me or what ? ”

If I even had a copy and sold it to you , it would be illegal … do you understand ? ”
Customer : “ So , I ca n ’t buy it ? ”
Me : “ That ’s correct . ”

When people think about the best financial advice they have ever received , it usually comes from a family member , a close mentor or a financial guru .
So it ’s with a bit of embarrassment that I must admit that the best financial advice I ever received came from a call girl I slept with in my younger days .
Even more surprising , it was n’t intended to be financial advice , but what seemed to be almost an afterthought that she shouted back at me on he way out the door :
“ Do n’t marry her if she is n’t great in bed . ”
While her comment always stayed in the back of my mind , I never looked at it as financial advice until I realized where I am in my marriage and where many of my friends are .
What I realize is that great sex has made me a happier person , saved our family a lot of money and kept me from falling into situations that have cost my other friends a lot of money .
Let me first state that I do n’t see great sex as having anything to do with sexual prowess or stamina , but everything having to do with compatibility .
Great sex is n’t an individual performance , but a combined performance between two partners that leaves you both exhilarated .
Having great sex with your partner is certainly not typical financial advice that you will hear in any of the personal finance magazines that you read , but that little gold nugget of advice has made me a lot more wealthy than most of my peers and advice that you should take to heart .
Here are some reasons you should consider it a lot harder than you have :
Great sex reduces your entertainment costs
I ca n’t remember the last time I have seen a movie with my wife .
This is n’t because either of us is cheap or do n’t enjoy movies , but because there is never a question of what we ’d rather choose to do .
If you had the choice of a movie or a night of passionate love , which would you choose ?
Neither of us sees any reason to change this choice even after 15 years of marriage .
Great sex keeps you out of the malls
There is no need for retail therapy when you have a good sex life .
You already know what makes you happy so there is no need to go searching for it in the latest gadget that will supposedly make you feel better .
Nothing will fulfil you on a daily basis the way a great sex life will .
Great sex means you do n’t eat out as much
Having a great sex life will mean you eat out a lot less than the average family .
Much like with movies , if you have the choice of going out or a dinner in together with extra curricular activities , the dinner in almost always wins .
Great sex keeps you organized
When you are constantly looking forward to being with your partner , you do n’t want other things to get in the way .
You learn to get organized so that when you get home , there is nothing left over from work that needs to be done that could get in the way of the evening activities .
Being the once unorganized slob and constant procrastinator that I used to be , I can tell you that having a compelling reason to be organized and get things finished early will ensure that you do .
great sex is one of those compelling reasons .
Great sex makes you healthier
According to a study of 90,000 American adults done by Dr. Ted Mcllvenna , from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco , sexually active people take fewer sick leaves , are more gregarious and enjoy life more .
That means less doctor visits , lower insurance premiums and no need to pay for a gym membership .
Except for the unexpected heart attack ( that appears to have been more genetic than anything else according to my doctors ) , I have been in great health during my marriage .
I have taken exactly 3 days of sick leave in the 15 years I have been married and I find it hard to believe that many married men look forward to coming home as much as I do .
Great sex means that vacations are less expensive
When you and your partner have great sex together , the focus of a vacation changes dramatically .
Most people choose vacations to be entertained , but when you have great sex , you choose vacations for the mood that they create .
Time is n’t spent going from tourist attraction to tourist attraction , but spending time together enjoying the time and the atmosphere .
Even when we pay extra to create a more romantic mood , the vacations are still far less than friends who vacation to be entertained .
Great sex means that you have no reason to cheat on your partner
A lot of people cheat on their partners for a lot of different reasons , but if the two of you have great sex together , it takes away the biggest reason for either of you to cheat on one another .
Having affairs can be an expensive habit that can drain money from your overall wealth , especially when money is being hidden in order to maintain the affair .
Great sex can keep you from ever making this costly mistake .
Great sex means you ’ll stay married
That affair can become a lot more costly if it ends up resulting in divorce .
If you want to keep your net worth secure , you do n’t ever want to get divorced .
I ’ve seen first hand what it has done to a number of my friends financially , and it ’s not a pretty sight .
There is a reason why people say that divorce is like taking all the money you have to the top of a tall building and then throwing handfuls of hundred dollar bills out of the window as fast as you can because that is essentially what happens .
If you have great sex together , there is a lot less likelihood that either one of you will see divorce as something that you want or need .
What this all means is that our savings and net worth are a lot healthier than most of the friend that I ’ve known over the years .
It is n’t that we make more money , but that we have found a way to spend time together that costs little money and which we both enjoy immensely .
Spending our time having great sex instead of spending money on other things means that we will retire with plenty of money without ever having to have struggled they way most people do .
So I pass along the best financial advice I have ever received from a call girl who did n’t even realize she was giving such important financial advice :
“ When you choose a partner , make sure that you have great sex together . ”

Games consultant
Can games make the office a more stimulating place I 'm insufferably lucky : for the last few years I 've made my living playing .
First as a games journalist and now as a consultant , my work is - partially at least - a game .
Yesterday , alongside e-mails and reports and statistics , my work included playing five games - one old Dos ( Disk operating system ) game , one Wii , and three Flash games .
For now , I 'm in a minority , but within a few years , many - if not all of us - will be able to say the same .
Soon we 'll all be playing at work .
The first signs of the shift may come when you apply for a job .
Already , the rising reputation of gaming has changed how people handle it on their CVs .
Once a taboo amongst all those impressively fraudulent hobbies listed at the bottom of the page ( " Orienteering , wetlands conservation , daguerreotyping and blow - fish preparation " it says on mine ) gaming now takes pride of place .
It 's becoming increasingly common for gamers to list things like running World Of Warcraft guilds in their applications , and increasingly common for employers to recognise the organisational , managerial and inter-personal skills such experience brings .
Employers are already looking at Facebook profiles
And , just as employers are now routinely checking applicants '
FaceBook pages to gauge their characters , there 's no reason for them not to check their online gaming identities .
A seemingly innocent Xbox 360 GamerCard widget on a personal blog will give a future employer a great deal of information on how much time someone spends gaming , how skilled they are , how obsessive , how collaborative , how determined .
High scores
How long before you find yourself proudly appending your Brain Training data or your Hexic high scores to an online application form ?
And even once you 're in the interview , the games wo n't necessarily stop .
Psychometric tests - widely used , but also widely criticised for being too formulaic and too easy to cheat - seem a poor and clumsy tool compared to the kind of insight a well designed game can give you into someone 's ability and character .
Should your GamerCard be scrutinised to assess your skills ?
Any online gaming veteran knows how quickly games reveal whether someone 's a risk - taker or a banker , impetuous or strategic , obedient or rebellious - and how hard it is to fake your responses in the heat of the moment .
And , as the population becomes ever more game literate , there 's less and less reason to rely on the old - fashioned , inert interfaces that so many psychometric tests require .
So say your CV and your performance in Battlefield : Office Combat pass muster .
In the future there 's no reason that what 's waiting for you at your desk on your first day wo n't be a game .
More and more we 're finding that game mechanics , and game presentation , can make otherwise difficult or tedious tasks more palatable .
The pioneer in this field was The ESP Game , which uses an online game mechanic to coax human players into labelling pictures for image - based search engines .
Great success
Its great success has produced a stream of similar projects , not least the cluster of word and image based games now housed at Carnegie Mellon 's Gawp .
Projects like the Firefox plug - in PMOG show how the application of tried and tested gaming incentives - experience points , levels , medals - can change how people interact with software they use for work every day .
Similar projects to make e-mail management more playful are also underway .
Fold
It uses a graphical gloss and high - score hunger to lure ignorant oafs like me into spending an hour on some cutting - edge bio-chemical research we would n't otherwise be qualified for .
So are we heading towards a utopia ?
And an end to boring spreadsheets , and a new dawn where the ugly repetitiveness of much of the work we do can be masked with adventure , achievement , and excitement ?
Not entirely .
A hallmark of all of the projects listed above is that they use the entertainment inherent in play to convince people to work for free .
For now , all of them are running for fun or for research or charity purposes , but that trend wo n't last .
Google has already adapted The ESP Game to help up its commercial advantage , and has enlisted an army of unpaid players in the process .
PMOG 's user - created missions currently award medals for visiting much - loved sites a particular number of times a week , but there 's no reason a commercial equivalent could n't use a similar tactic to encourage traffic to advertiser 's sites .
And while the idea of call - centre work being enlivened by a gaming ethos is an appealing prospect , the notion of employers offering lower wages to those being enabled to play at working is all too easy to imagine .
Will we be so comfortable with the idea once it's all play , no pay ?
We may be some years off play becoming that closely integrated into our working lives , but make no mistake that gaming has already had an enormous impact on many of our jobs .
How enormous ?
The inspiration behind the ESP game came from creator Luis von
Ahn 's calculation that we spend nine billion hours a year playing Window 's Solitaire - and most of it , I 'd wager , while at work .
Couple that with recent estimations that the entirety of Wikipedia took only 100 million hours to create , and that means we could be making around a 100 Wikipedias a year if only Solitaire was a shell for something worthwhile , rather than a deliciously infuriating waste of time .
How long do you think employers will keep ignoring stats like that ?

When the fading TV heartthrob Park Chul accused his actress wife of infidelity , he ignited an undignified row that has transfixed South Korea and probably mortally wounded the careers of two of the country 's top stars .
But the best might yet be to come : could Korea 's rawest celebrity scandal end a half - century - old law banning adultery ?
The scandal began in true tabloid style last October when Park went public with a tirade against his wife , Ok So-ri , who he said had slept with an Italian chef and an opera singer .
The accusation was accompanied by lurid stories that the jilted husband , who filed for divorce , had filmed his wife 's trysts in a love hotel .
Then the spat took a turn for the worse .
Ok stunned Koreans by calling a press conference in which she denied sleeping with the Italian – who she said had only given her English and cooking lessons – but admitted to a short affair with the singer .
She then aired intimate details of her sham marriage , leaving her husband feeling , in his words , like a " pedestrian hit by a car " .
Park responded by filing a criminal suit against his wife for adultery , which is illegal in South Korea .

The offence , which conservatives say is designed to protect the family , carries a two - year prison sentence , although just 47 of the 1,200 people convicted last year served jail time ( most were given suspended sentences ) .
It has stayed on the statute books since 1953 despite at least four legal challenges , but many are wondering if it can survive the fiery Ok , who has petitioned the Constitutional Court to scrap it .
A win would be a milestone in a country where women have , until recently , enjoyed much less sexual freedom than men .
Ok and her supporters , including liberal commentators , lawyers and judges , say the state no longer has the right to infringe on sexual relations .
" Adultery is an issue , more about sexual desire , to which law cannot be simply applied , " said Do Jin - gi , a judge from Seoul , in a statement to the court .
Some of the strongest supporters of the law in the past were feminists , who used it as leverage against adulterous men – most suits are still filed by wronged wives .
But some of South Korea 's largest women 's groups say times have changed and they want it off the books .
An official from the Korean Women 's Association told The Korea Times this month that the law was increasingly used by men to take revenge on unfaithful wives .
They are pitted against conservative judges and politicians , including the Justice Minister Kim Kyung - han , who said that it was needed " to protect the family and to maintain sex morality and the monogamous system " .
Park met
Ok on the set of the hit 1994 drama Hero Diary and they quickly earned the popularity of a Korean Posh and Becks .
The union produced a daughter , now eight , one of the few times the two made love , if Ok is to be believed .
" I had a very lonely and unsatisfied marriage because of a loveless husband , " she said .
" We only had sex 10 times in our 11 years of marriage . "
Not everyone backs the starlet 's struggle against the state .
The adultery law is popular with the public , many of whom see it as a bulwark against " Western " permissiveness , and even some of Ok 's natural supporters , such as young educated women say her behaviour is unacceptable .
It 's a fair bet that no high - powered American law firm will lend a caring hand to the relatives of the seven Iraqis murdered last month by a suicide bomber named Abdullah Salih Al Ajmi and two accomplices .
That 's too bad , seeing as how Ajmi was himself a beneficiary of some of that high - powered legal help .
Ajmi is a Kuwaiti who was 29 when he blew himself up in the northern city of Mosul in April .
But before that he had spent more than three years as an enemy combatant at Guantanamo , where he was known as " Captive 220 . "

Blu - Ray homepage | DVD homepage
Computer - Animated : Cars
Kids fall head over heels for computer - animated films à la Pixar , so they deserve a title for showing off your HD set .

NEW YORK 
Stocks were mostly lower Monday as investors digested news of weak reports on manufacturing and construction spending as well as another surge in oil prices .
Investors trying to determine whether recent pessimism about the economy has been well - founded or overwrought examined the Institute for Supply Management 's index of U.S. manufacturing activity .
The reading came in at 48.3 — stronger than the 48.1 the market expected , according to Thomson Financial / IFR .
However , the Commerce Department reported that construction spending in January fell by the steepest amount in 14 years .
" The two economic numbers that came out today were still rather on the negative side and they point to further weakness in economic activity , " said Peter Cardillo , chief market economist at New York - based brokerage house Avalon Partners .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.49 , or 0.06 % , to 12,258.90 .
In the broader market , the Standard & Poor 's 500 index rose 0.71 , or 0.05 % , to 1,331.34 , and the Nasdaq composite index fell 12.88 , or 0.57 % , to 2,258.60 .
Monday 's decline comes after a sizable pullback Friday amid an unwelcome mix of economic and corporate reports .

The dollar hit a fresh low against the euro , while gold prices neared $ 1,000 an ounce .
Silver set another 27 - year high and platinum set a record as did soybean and corn futures .
Besides the increase in commodity prices , investors also had to contend with a Commerce Department report showing that construction spending fell 1.7 % in January , more than twice economists ' forecast of a 0.8 % decline .
Billionaire Warren Buffett said in a CNBC interview Monday the U.S. economy is essentially in a recession .
Most economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product .

They are among the toughest creatures known to science , and species like them could make up two thirds of all the living material on the planet .
Researchers have discovered living microbes in rock 1.6 km under the sea bed , which itself has 4.5 km of seawater above it .
The bacteria - like creatures , which were found in sediment cores extracted by a ship off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada , are able to survive extreme pressure and temperatures of up to 100C .
The previous record for life was 842 m underground .
The creatures are single - celled organisms called archaea which are able to thrive in an ecosystem where sunlight never penetrates .
The researchers who discovered them are unsure exactly how they do this , but one possibility is that they effectively eat oil .
The heat cooks hydrocarbons in the sediment , said Prof John Parkes at Cardiff University in the UK , who led the study , breaking them down into methane and other chemicals .
" It 's an intuitive guess that they might well be using these compounds , but we can't be sure , " he added .
How they got there is also a mystery .
One possibility is that a population of bacteria has remained in the rocks ever since they were formed at the surface 111m million years ago .
Another is that they migrated there in underground water currents .
Bringing the creatures to the surface will have killed them , but the scientists believe they thrive in their own extreme environment .
" All the evidence suggests they are viable , active organisms , " said Parkes , who reported the discovery in this week 's issue of the journal Science .
The team analysed DNA from the microbes and found that it had not been broken down into small pieces , as would be expected at high temperature .
They were also able to see the cells in the process of dividing when they peered at them down a microscope .
DNA analysis suggests that the microbes ' closest relatives live in deep - sea hydrothermal vents .
The discovery of life - forms so deep underground strengthens the notion that most of the organisms on the planet are in fact hardy , single - celled creatures that live in the rock beneath our feet .
Researchers estimate that two thirds of all the biomass on the planet is underground .

of May 11 , 2007 , Staff Sergeant Michael Hensley made a radio call to Lieutenant Matthew Didier .
Didier was at the American Patrol Base in Jurf as Sakhr , a Sunni town on the Euphrates forty - five miles south of Baghdad .
Hensley was out in the field with four of his snipers .
He 'd left the base around midnight , and Didier had been waiting to hear from him .
Hensley and his men had gone out in support of an early - morning raid being conducted by Apache Company ; now , at nearly 1100 , Hensley was calling to say that he had eyes on an Iraqi male scouting the banks of the Euphrates and heading in the direction of the place where Hensley and his men were hiding .
Fifteen minutes later , Hensley called again .
He thought the Iraqi had spotted them and was still coming toward them .
Fifteen minutes later , Hensley again : The Iraqi was drawing closer and had his weapon at the ready .
Hensley asked Didier 's permission to kill him .
It was an odd courtesy .
For one thing , Hensley did n't need Didier 's permission to kill in self - defense .
Second , he and Didier were often at odds .
Hensley had taken over the snipers a month and a half earlier , while Didier was on leave , and since Didier 's return , he 'd struggled to establish " command and control " of his NCO .
The kill Hensley was proposing was not even the kind of kill that snipers specialize in .
It did not involve distance , or even a rifle .
Hensley was asking permission for a close kill with a handgun .
Didier granted his permission .
Fifteen minutes later he heard from Hensley .
The Iraqi was dead an hour after Hensley reported spotting him .
In five minutes , a quick - response team dispatched from Jurf PB found him still warm .
He had an AK - 47 in his arms and a large hole in the back of his head .
He was small and skinny .
He had some gray in his black beard .
He was wearing a blue mandress and was wearing a checkered scarf around his neck .
He was a Sunni and a member of the al - Janabi tribe .
He was identified on - site as Genei Nasir Khudair al - Janabi .
He was once a sergeant in Saddam Hussein 's army .
Now he was a farmer and taxi driver .
He had a wife and six children .
He was forty - six years old and died about fifteen hundred feet from his home .
He was the snipers ' eighth confirmed kill since Hensley had taken over the unit six weeks earlier .
An Army battalion is a small town , and after each of the kills , the snipers heard rumors at the chow hall .
But the close kill was different .
" I 've been in the Army for a while , " says Lieutenant Colonel Craig Whiteside , who at the time , in the rank of major , was the battalion 's second in command .
" I 'd never heard of anyone getting killed with a 9 mil .
Believe me , we 've killed a lot of people , and we 've killed them in just about every way possible .
That was the only 9 - mil kill in the entire deployment .
It just does n't happen . "
As a result , Hensley was asked to write a sworn statement about the killing .
" I wrote it pretty fast , " he says .
" They had a small laptop and a small printer back at the base , and I had a statement configured by about three in the afternoon .
Then I read it to the guys .
I never told them , like , this is your story or anything .
I basically pulled in the four guys who were with me and said , ' This is my account of the events . '
And I asked if anyone had any questions .
There were no questions . "
In the statement , Hensley elaborated on what he had told Didier .
He wrote that he never told his men there was an insurgent coming .
He wrote that they were oblivious to the threat .
He wrote that he had hidden behind an earthen berm , and when the insurgent was within arm 's reach , he put him in " a rear naked choke , his hands still on [ his ] weapon , struggling to fire it . "
He also wrote that the kill was not his own .
The sniper Hensley instructed to " pull out his M9 9 mm pistol and quietly take the safety on fire and be prepared to use it " -- the sniper who then " placed 2 9 mm rounds in the insurgent 's head " -- was named Evan Vela .
It was his first kill , but it was Hensley 's story .
" I was like , I 've given them no reason to doubt me in the past , they 're gonna believe whatever I tell them .
If I tell 'em a guy walks into my hide site with an AK and I choke him down and shoot him in the head , they 're gonna buy it , they 're gonna believe it , because it 's me . "
But because it was Hensley , the story also never died .
It morphed .
First , members of the Iraqi police told an American intelligence officer the story of a Sunni who had been pulled out of his home , tied up , tortured , and executed by American soldiers .
Then there were the members of the battalion who were passing through Baghdad International on their way back from leave .
They were hearing about the close kill from other battalions , other units :
Hey , I hear Hensley climbed up on the dude 's back and shot him in the head .
. . .
Eventually , battalion command figured they'd have to do something about it .
They figured they'd have to start taking sworn statements .
" I had a talk with Major Whiteside about it , " says Major David Butler , now public - affairs officer for the brigade .
" I said , ' Maybe Hensley deserves an award for this .
Maybe we should give him a medal . ' "
The first time I heard Michael Hensley referred to as a natural killer was in a conversation with two of his snipers , Sergeant Anthony Murphy and Sergeant Richard Hand .
I had flown to Alaska shortly after the February 10 conviction of Evan Vela -- three months after the acquittal of Michael Hensley -- on charges of murdering Genei Nasir Khudair al - Janabi .
The snipers agreed to talk to me because they wanted to talk about Vela ; they wound up talking about Hensley .
It is a corollary :
They are snipers ; snipers talk about Hensley .
As different as snipers are supposed to be from most people , that 's how different Hensley is from them .
" I mean , it 's very self - evident when you meet him that he does n't conform to what and who you expect people to be , " Hand said .
" I mean , he 's a genius , but it 's like he 's so intelligent that he 's autistic or something . "
I said that I was going to meet him the next morning , and Murphy offered a suggestion .
" Why do n't you just walk right up to him and slap him in the face ? " he said .
" That would get his respect right away .
He 'd love that . "
They thought that the idea of me slapping Mike Hensley in the face was absolutely hilarious , and when I asked them why , Murphy said , " Well , he 's a natural killer , for one thing . "
Later , when I asked him what he meant by that , he said , " He 'd kill you and two minutes later he'd sit down and finish that piece of pie . "
In the morning , I drove north of Fort Richardson and went to Hensley 's apartment .
He met me at the door in a short little zip - up black leather windbreaker with skulls on the front and the word AFFLICTION printed on the back .
There were also skulls on the back pockets of his tight jeans .
There was also a bracelet of flaming skulls tattooed on his left wrist and a pentagram tattooed on his neck .
He was twenty - seven years old , about six two , and he wore black square - toed motorcycle boots .
When I suggested we go get something to eat , he said , " Right on , " in the deep voice of a radio cowboy .
At the same time there was something soft about him , something vulnerable , something even slightly effeminate , with his hair combed forward in little bangs and his boy - band sideburns .
Hensley was one of the most lethal snipers in the United States Army , and the most notorious .
But he seemed less a lethal person than a person trapped in some kind of lethal drag .
The rough - trade impression was accentuated by his hip - slung way of standing and by the shape of his body .
He was hippy .
He had gone from going to the gym three times a day to drinking pretty much all day .
His hips were wider than his shoulders .
He was also perfumed by the smell of alcohol working itself out of his body .
His hands sometimes shook .
So did everything else .
He was twitchy and ticky .
He could n't keep still .
He got up to go to the bathroom a lot .
He had a lot of " nervous behaviors , " he said .
He was apologetic about them .
His hands were a particular problem ; he did n't know what to do with them .
He jammed them in his pockets .
He drummed his fingers against any available surface .
He wiggled them in the air as though he were playing the flute .
When he forgot about them , they 'd curl up at the wrists until they looked palsied .
The rest of his body would follow suit , his shoulders hunching over his hands in a kind of protective gesture until his body language was that of a man in shackles .
It was the hands -- " the hand thing " -- that his men seized upon when they imitated him in Iraq .
They " did " Hensley , and though he tried to be a good sport , it hurt his feelings .
" It was embarrassing , " he said .
" I did n't think I acted like that .
I was trying to be perfect .
I was trying not to show them any flaws . "
In fact , he was acutely aware of his flaws , because he was acutely aware of his difference .
So were people who knew him .
His difference was what they remarked on .
That was where the idea that he was a natural killer came from .
It was n't just what people saw him do with a gun ; it was how he carried himself without one .
He struck people as a natural killer because he struck them as unnatural in other ways .
And yet they followed him .
The men who made fun of him in Iraq followed him in Iraq .
He was the most lethal sniper in the Army because he made them lethal .
His difference was communicable -- transformative -- and it eventually served to highlight the most ineffable difference of all in war : the difference between killing and murder .
" That 's the six - letter word that changes everything , " Hensley said .
It was ten o'clock in the morning and we were on our way to a bar in Anchorage to drink Bloody Marys .
He was , and is , still in the Army .
He still has a job , and was in the middle of being transferred to Fort Benning .
But because of the mortal taint upon him -- because , as he says , " I 'm looked at as a guy who got away with murder " -- nobody called him if he did n't show up .
It was better that he did n't show up .
Did he get away with murder ?
" You know , nobody thinks they 're a bad person .
You can talk to the worst murderer , the worst rapist in prison , and they 'll always try to find a way to justify what they did .
And that hits home for me .
I mean , when you look at things that way , maybe what I did was wrong .
I refuse to believe it , but who knows ?
In the end , it comes down to , When that guy walked in my hide site , I made a decision .
It was my decision .
Nobody else made it , nobody else could make it , because nobody else had the whole picture .
Evan Vela killed that guy because I ordered him to and because he had no reason not to .
Was it a good kill ?
It 's a good kill because I say it 's a good kill .
That 's why I was there .
That 's why the battalion put me there . "
The story of Michael Hensley is a story of the surge .
He deployed with 1st Battalion , 501st Infantry ( Airborne ) , 4th Brigade , 25th Infantry Division in October 2006 and came home to Fort Richardson in early December 2007 .
That Hensley spent nearly five of those thirteen months in captivity did not make him less relevant to his battalion 's cause or its eventual success .
It made him more so .
When did the surge begin ?
The official start date was February 2007 .
The start date for 1-501 came a few months later .
That 's because the surge started in Baghdad , and the Geronimos , as the parachutists of 1-501 are called , were operating in Babil Province , with its three - city cordon of sectarian strife called the Triangle of Death .
If the surge in Baghdad was about manpower , the surge in Babil was about money .
It was about convincing local tribes that it was in their best interests to stop feeding the insurgency and start dining off the American dollar .
By that standard , the surge began in the Triangle of Death when a local Sunni engineer began acting as a broker between the battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel Robert Balcavage , and Sheik Sabah , the head of the engineer 's al - Janabi tribe .
This occurred about halfway through 1-501 's deployment .
It also occurred a few weeks after the close kill of Genei Nasir Khudair al - Janabi .
And in the coincidence of the two events there is a demonstration of the blood ambivalence at the heart of the new American way of war .
" My soldiers are paratroopers , " Balcavage says .
" And when paratroopers come to a country , all they want to do is kill and break stuff .
Well , you can do that all day long without any progress .
You 've got to do it with the Iraqis .
You can't win a war just by killing people . "
But then , you can't win a war just by paying people , either , or else it would n't be war .
And Balcavage was at war before the surge took hold .
His men were being shot at by snipers and blown up by IEDs .
They were taking mortar fire .
In the IED attack that gave the battalion its first combat fatality , on December 20 , 2006 , one of the survivors lost not only his legs below the knee but also his penis , and the soldier who died was electrocuted by a power line transformed by the blast into a lethal whip .
A month later , in Karballa , death arrived in the form of insurgents who came to a city - council meeting dressed as American soldiers , then killed one of ours and kidnapped and killed four more .
In the first few months of 2007 , Balcavage says , there were attacks on his men almost daily , and what was most disturbing and dispiriting about them , most dangerous to morale , was not their frequency but rather their air of impunity .
The Geronimos were getting killed without killing back , and as Balcavage says , " We were questioning how much success we were having at the time . "
More to the point , he 'd realized that " money was n't going to work without pressure . "
He 'd become " absolutely convinced that you cannot succeed if you do n't have a hammer . "
He did not have a hammer .
Usually , snipers occupy that role -- they 're a " battalion - level asset , " like mortars , to be employed at the discretion of the battalion commander .
But Balcavage 's snipers had a leadership problem , and as a result they had what Balcavage calls an " acidic morale problem . "
They either were n't " putting themselves in position to get shots " or were putting themselves in position and discovering they did n't bring the proper weapons , like , say , sniper rifles .
They were letting guys get away .
They were either not pulling the trigger or pulling the trigger and , Balcavage says , " winging guys . "
Through the first five months of the deployment , October through March , they had one kill , and it was characteristic .
The platoon leader had to wait hours before he gave his snipers permission to take the shot , and then the shooter hit the target in the leg .
The man dragged himself thirty - five meters before bleeding out .
On another occasion , a sniper blasted away at two guys surrounded by livestock .
He slaughtered the livestock and spared the guys , hitting one in the leg and letting the other get away .
" How does that happen ? "
Balcavage 's sergeant major , Bernie Knight , asks .
" You 're a sniper -- how do you miss ?
I 'm a one - shot , one - kill kind of guy -- and these guys just were n't doing it . "
As one of the snipers themselves , Richard Hand , says : " We were looked at as kind of failures -- kind of a joke , in a way . "
Balcavage and Knight were after more than comic relief .
" We had to have something that said , ' Hey , if you 're coming at us , this is what we got , ' " Knight says .
In March , what they had was a job opening in the sniper section of the scout platoon .
And then they had Michael Hensley .
He was not officially a sniper , at least not in Iraq .
He was a squad leader in Apache Company .
But he was a prodigy .
The son of Christian missionaries -- he remembers his upbringing as " Amishlike " -- he 'd already been in the Army nine years .
With the help of an experienced and gifted spotter , he had won the Army 's international sniper competition in 2002 , when he was twenty - two .
He was a sniper in Afghanistan in 2003 .
He 'd helped train snipers at Fort Richardson .
And in the Triangle of Death , he was one of the first of the Geronimos to draw blood .
It was in February .
It was in Jurf as Sakhr .
It was during a town meeting .
There was mortar fire from across the Euphrates .
One of Hensley 's men , Cody Anderson , saw the flash of binoculars and said , " I think I see a guy . "
Hensley said , " If he pokes his head up again , I 'm going to take him out . "
He did not have a high - powered sniper 's rifle .
He had the basic rifle of the American infantry , the M4 .
It is basically a .
22 .
The guy across the river was anywhere from three hundred to four hundred meters away .
It is not the kind of shot typically made with an M4 .
" So Hensley says , ' I see him , I see him , ' " says Anderson .
" And I 'm like , ' Where ? '
And he 's telling me , ' He 's right fucking there , he 's right fucking there . '
So I start laying down suppressive fire , I start shooting in the general vicinity , and Sergeant Hensley , he 's like plink plunk . "
The natural killer had his first kill , with an M4 .
Imagine what he could do with a .50 - caliber sniper rifle .
Imagine what he could do with a dozen men .
Hensley had a girlfriend .
She was very beautiful .
She was also trouble .
He met her at the bar in Anchorage where he liked to ease his hangovers with Bloody Marys .
Her name was Tennille .
She had a thing about men with bald heads and tattoos .
He had a thing about women who emanated dark mysteries .
Tennille 's mystery was that she had been on and off heroin since she was eighteen .
Hensley 's was that he was Hensley .
He had gone through life knowing that he was " not like anyone else .
One day maybe someone can come down from another planet and explain me . "
But Tennille explained him to himself by being a female version of him .
She took him home to meet her parents .
He scared them to death , but then they saw his manners and heard the courtliness in his voice when he talked to their daughter and they loved him like a son .
When he came home on leave in January 2007 and Tennille told them of his intentions , they thought he had saved her .
He had n't killed anyone yet when he said goodbye to her and went back to Iraq .
Then in February he killed the man across the Euphrates with an M4 .
In March the Red Cross gave him an emergency message from Tennille 's parents .
They were asking him to come home .
Tennille was dead .
She 'd overdosed .
She died in the apartment she shared with Hensley .
She was found sitting against a wall , with no pants on .
She had been there awhile .
Her official date of death was March 1 .
He took emergency leave .
The apartment was full of the terrible residue of her decay .
He cleaned it himself .
He was not one to shirk missions .
Besides , he was angry at her stupid ass , and angry at the Army .
" Every relationship I 've ever had I 've sacrificed to the Army , " he says .
The cleanup helped him focus his anger .
He got the pentagram on his neck in Anchorage and then went back to Iraq in the third week of March .
On the way back he heard that he'd been selected to lead the sniper section .
He was at the airport in Iraq , waiting to get started , when he ran into a sniper who was also returning from leave .
It was Evan Vela .
Evan Vela has a wife .
Her name is Alyssa .
Her last name is not Vela .
Her last name is Carnahan .
So is Evan's .
His father , Curtis Carnahan , adopted him when he was a little boy , but Evan never changed his name on his social security card , and the Army would n't accept anything else .
His father has very long hair and a " Hippie Parking Only " sign planted in his driveway in Idaho .
Evan looks like a handsome Mexican boxer .
He 's always been pretty quiet .
He 's known Alyssa since eighth grade .
Back then he never said a word .
They dated in high school , but she got tired of dragging everything out of him , and they drifted apart .
When she was living in Portland , Oregon , she heard that he'd joined the Army , and he heard that she was free from her boyfriend .
He drove from Idaho to see her , and they talked for hours .
They got married on May 5 , 2006 .
Alyssa already had a son named Jarom , and Evan never called him anything but his son and planned to adopt him .
Alyssa was a Mormon , and in September 2006 , before his deployment , Evan was baptized in the Church of Latter - day Saints .
He was a scout in Iraq , but in December he became a sniper .
Alyssa was pregnant with Blair , and in March Evan came home for the birth .
He was very quiet , almost like the old Evan .
He was very happy when he held Blair for the first time , but also very sad because he felt unworthy of her .
He loved the Army , but he told Alyssa he was very uneasy with the prospect of killing .
He had n't killed anyone yet , but he knew he would have to .
He was a sniper .
Before he went back to Iraq , he met with his bishop , and his bishop read him some Mormon scripture and gave him a video called Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled : A Message of Peace for Latter - day Saints in Military Service .
The teaching was that if he went to war in the spirit of love , even for those whose blood had to be shed , then the shedding of blood would not be counted as sin .
He drove very slowly to the airport , trying to stop time because of what he was going back to .
He did not know that he was going back to Hensley .
Vela was not like Hensley .
Hensley was not like Vela .
But they 'd gone on leave at the same time , and now at the airport Vela heard that Hensley was going to be his boss .
With his bald head and his tattoo and his twitches , Hensley was the most recognizable NCO in the Army , and Vela approached him .
Vela had gone home to celebrate a life and Hensley to grieve a death , but what they talked about now was business .
Hensley asked Vela very detailed questions about the kinds of weapons the squad had and what each man in the section was capable of .
Vela understood that it was Hensley 's way of asking what he was capable of .
They never talked about home , and besides , once Hensley took over , Vela went on so many missions with him that he called home less and less and found that even when he did , there was less and less he could talk about .
The snipers got a kill right after Hensley took charge .
It was April 7 .
Hensley was n't there .
He was on another mission .
It was Murphy 's kill .
He had seen a man walking toward him with a weapon .
It was a hot day and the heat was causing the light to dance .
It was hard to see even through a scope .
Murphy pulled the trigger and shot the man through the head .
The weapon Murphy thought he was carrying turned out to be a length of plastic pipe .
Was the man an innocent ?
Nobody in Iraq was innocent .
But as Sergeant Major Knight liked to say , " He was innocent that day . "
Murphy went back to base knowing that he'd be investigated .
He was not surprised that the company commander , Major Butler , was there to meet him .
He was surprised by what Butler said : " I just want to tell you not to second - guess yourself .
You did your job .
You felt threatened , and you pulled the trigger .
That 's what you 're supposed to do .
That 's what we want .
Way to go . "
There was an investigation , and Murphy was found blameless .
It was a matter of intent .
Clearly his intent was not criminal .
Clearly his intent was to kill and not to murder .
The distinction was so important that there was a meeting about it .
The meeting was so important that Knight and Balcavage addressed the snipers themselves .
What they said was pretty clear :
If you have the shot , take the shot .
If you feel threatened , take the shot .
We 'll back you .
How what they said was taken was another matter .
Balcavage and Knight thought they were offering assurance .
They thought they were clarifying the rules of engagement .
They thought they were clarifying the ineluctable line between killing for cause and murder .
To kill , you need PID -- positive identification .
You need evidence of hostile action or hostile intent .
You need " reasonable certainty " that the human being you are about to dispose of presents a threat .
The snipers thought something different .
They had all been part of the scout platoon .
There used to be six of them , and they went out attached to scout teams .
Now there were a dozen of them .
Now there were half as many scouts and twice as many snipers , and the snipers were going out on their own , in small kill teams .
The restructuring was Hensley 's idea , and it was lethal .
Everything now was oriented toward the kill , and Hensley 's snipers looked at the meeting as a final restructuring of what was expected and what was allowed .
They thought instead of assurance they were being offered license .
They thought that Balcavage and Knight were revising the ROE instead of clarifying them , with perception of threat trumping evidence of threat as the rationale for pulling the trigger .
Most significantly , they thought -- and later , they testified in court -- that they were being pressured by Balcavage and Knight for more production , in the way of " increased kills . "
Balcavage denies this : " I never said , I want you to increase our kills .
Was that my intent ?
Absolutely .
The role of the sniper is to engage and destroy the enemy .
Do we want to do that more ?
Yes , as long as it gives us the overall effect that we were looking for .
And the effect that we were looking for was paranoia in the enemy .
We wanted to say , You either stop what you 're doing , or this is what we 're doing .
We do n't use snipers to make friends with people .
We use them to destroy the enemy . "
The snipers had no problem with Balcavage 's message , whether explicit or implicit .
" You hear that we were pressured to get more kills , " Anthony Murphy says .
" Well , what 's not politically correct is that we wanted more kills .
I mean , why would we not want to kill the enemy that 's killing us ?
Yeah , of course we want to kill them .
Legitimate targets , man . "
They were all in agreement on the subject of killing .
What they were not in agreement on was the subject of murder .
The difference was n't moral but legal , and Hensley was right .
It was the six - letter word that changed everything .
It was a reminder that the natural divide between officer and enlisted man could turn into a divide between accuser and accused , and so when Sergeant Major Knight said , at the end of the meeting , " Now , we do n't want to turn you guys into murderers or anything , " he believed he was saying what had to be said , and that neither he nor Balcavage nor anyone else ever encouraged the snipers to commit murder .
What Murphy remembers , however , was saying to himself : " Okaaaaay , what did he say that for ?
They 're up telling us to go out and kill people .
What 's he talking about murder for ?
Who the hell ever said anything about murder ? "
Hensley went out on every mission after that .
Between missions he was training his men .
When he was n't training his men , he was working out .
When he was n't working out , he was committing operational details to memory .
He was n't eating -- his men say he did n't need to eat .
He was n't sleeping -- his men say he did n't need to sleep and that he moved just as much when he was sleeping as he did when he was awake .
He talked just as much when he was sleeping as he did when he was awake , and about the same thing : missions .
Hensley had some ideas .
He had some objectives .
He had an agenda .
He wanted to show what his snipers could do and what he could do with his snipers .
" I did n't have a lot of guys who went to sniper school .
I had a lot of young guys I was training in the field .
I could n't kill the enemy from afar .
So I used more unorthodox , guerrilla - type tactics . "
Longer missions .
Longer distances .
Heavier rucks .
Smaller teams .
Smaller footprints .
More speed .
More stealth .
More invisibility .
More isolation .
More risk .
If he could n't turn his men into the classical ideal of snipers , he 'd turn them into something else .
He 'd turn them into stalkers , and so a lot of their kills would occur well within three hundred meters .
" A lot of our kills were close . "
The first real Hensley mission was against snipers from the other side .
They were in Jurf as Sakhr .
" They were really tormenting our guys , " says Sergeant Major Knight .
" They created a little bit of a morale problem .
We had some guys afraid to go out .
They went out , but they thought about it . "
But Hensley was a sniper .
Even when he was a squad leader in Jurf as Sakhr , he thought like a sniper .
So now he had an idea .
" I 'm like , Okay , they 're setting a pattern .
Why can't we put some snipers out there that they do n't know are there ?
We insert at nighttime .
We lay down in a hide .
We put on some vegetation .
We sit there .
Nobody knows we 're there .
I 'll even go in two days prior , so no one really knows I 'm there .
And I stay hidden .
I stay unseen .
And I use Apache Company as bait .
They come down , get shot at .
We shoot whoever 's doing the shooting .
And that 's exactly how the first mission went . "
It was on April 13 .
Sergeant Richard Hand and Sergeant Robert Redfern were the shooters .
They were hiding up to their necks in a canal full of black water .
They were there for hours .
Then four insurgent snipers engaged Apache Company and began running away .
They ran directly toward the canal .
Hand and Redfern rose up out of the water and shot each man at the dead run .
Shot them through the lungs , through the throat , through the head .
They had grenades on them and high - powered ammunition .
It was an outstanding kill -- " pivotal to our success in Jurf , " as Balcavage says .
The next day , Hensley went after a man he thought was laying IEDs .
There was a checkpoint outside Jurf as Sakhr called Checkpoint 312 .
It was a bad checkpoint for IEDs .
Hensley had seen a house near the checkpoint and had thought that if he were in the IED business , he'd be making use of it .
He decided to check it out .
He crawled around and thought he saw a man laying command wire .
He wound up stalking the man for hours , crawling around with a hundred - plus pounds of rucksack on his back .
He liked crawling .
He liked the mud , liked smearing it on his face .
He was ordered to go back and check the man one more time before he left .
He was advancing on him with his SR - 25 raised when the man bent down .
Was he reaching for a weapon ?
Hensley perceived a threat , in accordance with what Balcavage and Knight had told him .
He shot the man through the heart .
The man 's wife and children began screaming , " because I essentially shot him in his front yard .
I mean , right in front of his family .
So of course they 're going to be a little hysterical . "
The man was not carrying a weapon , but a search of the site turned up a spool of command wire .
It seemed like another good kill .
It was the natural killer 's second kill , and later David Petta , one of Hensley 's youngest snipers , would remember Hensley squatting near the body , saying , " I hate this part of my job .
No , I love this part of my job . "
Two weeks later , they went after the mortars .
It was up north , at a place called Fish Farms .
It was a little like Hensley imagined Vietnam to be , so green it was almost jungly , with black water all over the place , and grass up to your waist .
It was a big mission , involving more than just the snipers .
The Iraqi army was supposed to engage the mortars , and the snipers were supposed to shoot anyone they saw running away -- the " squirters . "
It went as planned .
There was an engagement , and Lieutenant Didier saw a squirter .
Then he lost him .
Hensley saw some guy swinging a sickle in the middle of the field .
He was cutting grass .
He was working .
But nobody worked in Iraq .
Hens - ley described the guy to Didier .
Was it the guy Didier 'd seen ?
Didier said it sounded like him .
He granted permission to engage .
Hensley was the spotter and Specialist Jorge Sandoval was the shooter .
The spotter is the leader on any sniper team ; the shooter is just , in Hensley 's words , " the monkey on the trigger . "
All he has to do is breathe , relax , and squeeze .
Hensley could have taken the shot himself , he says , " but I wanted Sandoval to get his kill .
He 's in the prone , down in the grass , and he 's saying , ' I can't see nothing , Sarge .
All I can see is the top of his head . '
I 'm like , ' Well , that 's all you got to hit . ' " Hensley called the shot , Sandoval squeezed the trigger , and the top of the man 's head parted like the Red Sea .
That was April 27 .
The next week there would be a firefight with insurgents inside a house , which lasted until Hensley called in fire from an Apache helicopter and the Apache obliterated the house and everyone in it , including , Hensley claims , women and children .
The week after that , there would be the close kill of May 11 , and that would be the sniper section 's last .
It was either a successful run or a deadly spree , and Hensley still believes it proves his point .
" I proved that we could have won this war a long time ago if we did what 's necessary to win .
I proved it !
I proved that just one squad -- one squad -- if allowed to use the right strategy , allowed to use the right techniques , could yield a result .
Did that in a few short months .
And if it could be done with my squad , it could be done with any squad .
It ai n't that we do n't have the tools .
It ai n't that we 're not smart enough .
It 's that there 's a certain risk factor that commanders refuse to accept .
They refuse to do what 's necessary to conquer .
They do n't think the juice is worth the squeeze . "
On May 17 , a 1st Battalion convoy got hit by an EFP .
It 's a nightmare weapon , a metaphor for the insurgency , a molten and molting thing made not to penetrate armor with force but rather to pass through it with heat .
It killed two soldiers , and one of them did n't know that he'd been passed through , that he'd been transgressed ; he was helping another soldier when he died .
One of them died in the arms of the company commander , who was coming in to take the place of Major David Butler , who was rotating out .
The new company commander was still soaked with blood when he stood before Lieutenant Colonel Balcavage and said , " Captain Charles Levine , reporting for duty , sir ! "
It was six days after the May 11 close kill , and it was the last day of Michael Hensley 's war .
Balcavage was set to go on leave , and right before he did , he received his first feelers from Sheik Sabah .
" He 's a bad guy , " the Sunni who acted as intermediary told Balcavage , " but we 're going to have to deal with him now . "
The sheik was , indeed , rumored to have connections to Al Qaeda in Iraq .
But Balcavage made the decision to deal with him .
The payments began in the wake of Hensley 's escalation , and the Geronimos never suffered another combat fatality .
Of course , there was fighting , hard fighting , still to be done .
But the kind of fighting that Hensley stood for -- the kind of killing that Hensley stood for -- became unnecessary , indeed a liability , especially in the eyes of Captain Levine .
Captain Butler ?
Captain Butler tried to be one of the guys .
Some of the snipers thought he wanted to be a sniper .
But Levine was a different kind of officer .
He did n't understand -- he objected to -- the " aura that these guys are supposed to have , as snipers .
Okay ?
It 's not Delta Force , it 's not the movies .
It 's just a job .
It 's not a calling , if you will .
These guys have a skill , and it 's long - range marksmanship .
But let 's not make them something they 're not .
Sniper is an E - 3 [ low - ranked ] position .
They 're like truck drivers . "
On June 12 , Michael Hensley was still a sniper , and he was all aura .
He was , in the words of one of his men , " a fucking badass . "
He was , in the words of another , " one lethal motherfucker . "
He was living in face paint by this time , as if he'd found , in camouflage , another tattoo .
He did n't take it off when he went to bed .
He put more on .
He was eating less , sleeping less , drinking a caffeinated nitric - oxide supplement called NO - Xplode like it was water , and sometimes instead of water .
He was working out more .
He was ripped .
He would go down to chow and play his metal on his headphones so loud you could hear it ten feet away , and his troublesome hands would be whirling with the drummer , beat for beat , as if he 'd finally set them free .
An IP -- a member of the Iraqi police -- called him the Painted Demon , and it stuck .
" I had everything under control , " he says .
He looked out of control , sure .
But he had everything under control because he had his men under control .
Later on , Sergeant Major Knight would say , " He had an agenda and was bringing them all in , one man at a time . "
It 's not too far from the truth .
He had given them their purpose -- in the coin of kills -- and they had given him their loyalty .
He was using them to fight his war against the Iraqis , and he was using them to fight his war against the Army , and he was winning both .
Steven Kipling , the platoon sergeant who had opposed him since he took over the snipers , had been relieved .
Hensley was acting platoon sergeant , and though Knight had decided he was n't ready and Didier had recommended against him , he was not only campaigning for the full - time job but proposing the expansion of the snipers into an entire platoon .
And as for Didier -- nobody listened to Didier .
On June 12 , the scout platoon was pulling security at a shrine that had been leveled by a car bomb .
It was a tense mission , and some of them wanted to engage .
Didier was there .
But the men -- one of Hensley 's snipers , and then two of Didier 's scouts -- asked Hensley .
Didier called a meeting .
He stood next to Hensley and said , " I 'm the motherfucking commanding officer here .
I 'm the one with the authority .
If any of you want to engage , you ask me . "
Then he turned to Hens - ley and told him that his men were n't wearing body armor .
He was right .
They were Hensley 's men , and Hensley 's men did n't wear body armor when it was like 130 degrees out .
They wore what Hensley wore .
They wore T - shirts and bandanas and paint .
They were cool .
But the standard for security situations was body armor , and Didier told Hensley to enforce the standard .
Hensley said , " You just said you 're the motherfucking CO .
You enforce the standard . "
Hensley walked away .
Didier followed him .
They went into a Humvee .
" Are you telling me that you 're not going to follow my order ? "
Didier asked .
" I 'm telling you that I 've been in the Army ten years and I 've worked too hard to listen to a punk like you , " Hensley said .
Didier told Hensley to get out of the Humvee and find a seat away from his men .
" Sergeant Hensley , you 're relieved , " he said .
Hensley sat alone .
Didier called his remaining NCOs together , his remaining team leaders , and said , " Are you going to follow my orders , or do I have a mutiny on my hands ? "
They answered that his orders would be followed .
There were MPs on hand , being used for transport , and they escorted Hensley back to the base .
He was no longer an acting platoon sergeant .
He was no longer sniper - section leader .
He was no longer even a sniper .
Suddenly , the Painted Demon was as anachronistic as some terra - cotta god of war .
On June 19 , Captain Levine approached Staff Sergeant Hensley outside the base .
It was a week after Hensley had been relieved of duty .
" I remember crouching down on the rocks with him , " Levine says .
" The first thing I asked him was ' How are you doing ? '
That 's the first thing I ask all the soldiers .
' How are you doing ? ' " Levine was a tall , physically imposing man with a tic .
He blinked a lot .
When he spoke , he both habitually asked for feedback -- " Are you with me ?
Do you understand what I 'm saying ? " -- and remained oblivious to it .
He was in his early forties .
He had come late to the Army and late to religious feeling , and so believed above all in the natural goodness of the American soldier .
Hensley disappointed him .
" I said , ' What 's up ?
What happened with Lieutenant Didier ? ' " Levine remembers .
" Hensley said , ' Sir , I do n't want to listen to anything he fucking has to say . '
I said , ' Well , some of your guys were walking around without body armor .
You yourself did not have on body armor . '
And he replied , ' Sir , I do n't really give a shit about body armor .
Anyone gets within three hundred meters of me , I 'm going to kill him . '
And when he told me that , that 's when I realized he is not fit to continue leading soldiers in combat .
That 's when I realized I had a soldier who was not right mentally . "
Hensley had thought that there was only one person in the world who was remotely like him , and that was Tennille .
He had just met another .
He called Levine " Blinky . "
He did not know that he had just found his perfect antagonist , and his inevitable accuser .
They all knew about the lie .
And because they knew about the lie , they knew about the kill .
A lie does something to a kill , even -- or especially -- in war .
It 's transformative .
It changes its very nature .
You can kill a man in war and never talk about it again .
But if you lie about killing a man in war , you can never not talk about it again .
A lie puts a kill in the realm of conscience .
And that 's what happened with the snipers .
Sandoval talked about the May 11 close kill .
He kept saying , " That was fucked up , that was fucked up . "
Finally , he told his friend Alexander Flores about it .
He said that they had n't seen a man with an AK - 47 approaching the hide .
They had n't seen anyone .
They were asleep -- Redfern , Hand , Sandoval , even Hensley , even Vela , who was supposed to be pulling security with the 9 mil .
It was so freaking hot , and they were all so freaking tired .
On May 8 , they 'd gone on a mission at 0400 .
They were out for a day and a half with no sleep .
They 'd gotten back to the base just before midnight May 9 .
They tried to rest on May 10 , but at midnight they had to be back out again .
It was mid-morning when the Iraqi tried going out to his pump house to turn his water on .
He climbed over an earthen berm and stumbled on the five sleeping soldiers .
When Sandoval woke up , Vela and the Iraqi were just kind of staring at each other .
Sandoval told Vela to get the gun in his face .
Then Vela woke up Hensley .
Hensley , in his own recollection , says that he woke up to see an Iraqi " in a squat , the traditional Muslim squat thing .
He had his hands up in the air . "
Hensley went behind him , yanked his head back in a choke , then knocked the wind out of him with a knee to the back .
The Iraqi was on the ground when Redfern said , " We 've got a boy . "
" Well , wave him in , " Hensley said .
The boy came in .
He was a teenager , but he was so slight , the Americans thought he was twelve .
He looked at the man on the ground .
" Father , " he said in English .
The degree to which Hensley had been keeping the snipers together by force of his own charisma and his own will and his own singular example was apparent as soon as he was relieved of duty .
The sniper section fell apart .
Or , to be more specific : On June 20 , Alexander Flores and David Petta fell asleep , and then it fell apart .
They were the only two soldiers in the section not deemed mission - ready .
They were supposed to be pulling security .
They fell asleep twice .
They had to be disciplined .
They objected .
They said that if they were disciplined , they'd go to the chaplain with what they knew about May 11 .
Of course , as Hensley says , " that never would have happened if I 'd been there .
I 'd have handled it . "
And even Petta agrees .
" I do n't think it would have all come out if Hensley was there .
Things would have kept going forward .
. . . "
But Hensley was n't there .
Vela and Hand were .
Vela was acting leader of the sniper section and Hand was the acting scout platoon sergeant .
Vela went to Hens - ley and asked him what to do about Flores and Petta .
Hensley said , " If you do n't follow through , they own you . "
Then he said , " They do n't have anything .
They were n't there .
If CID [ the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division ] comes around , do n't talk to them .
If you do n't give them a statement , they can't touch us . "
Flores and Petta went to Chaplain Dan Hardin at two o'clock on June 21 , 2007 .
Two hours later , Levine says , " I was coming out of the operations center at the base , and I saw the chaplain standing on the railing .
He said , ' Charles , I just spoke to two of your soldiers .
I think you should listen to what they have to say . ' " Levine did , and so did Sergeant Major Knight and Major Whiteside .
With Balcavage on leave , Whiteside was the commanding officer of the battalion .
" I called CID on the spot , " Whiteside says .
" They said , ' When do you need us there ? '
I said , ' Yesterday . '
They said , ' It 'll take a week . '
I said , ' No , you do n't understand .
It 's our own soldiers .
. . .' "
Levine keeps a list of what he did next .
For their own protection , he put Flores and Petta in a trailer .
He ordered his First Sergeant to go to where the snipers and scouts lived and secure -- confiscate -- their belongings .
He secured Hensley 's weapon , because " if what I was told was true , then we have someone whose criteria for killing another human being is different from yours and mine . "
He separated Hensley from the rest of the platoon , because he believed that he had already " gotten under these guys ' skins , " and that he would try to influence the investigation .
He was right .
" I had guys doing things for me , " Hensley says , " going to everybody 's computer and cameras , deleting pictures in bad taste , deleting possibly incriminating stuff .
I have my loyal band of men while I 'm being escorted around under armed guard .
. . . "
The platoon was separated from the rest of the battalion .
They were put in a big tent with wooden partitions separating the pallet beds .
And they were investigated for murder .
All the kills were investigated and all the men were investigated and all the men were made to feel like murderers .
" Once CID comes in , all they 're doing is fucking hitting on you , " Richard Hand says .
" They 're trying to prove that something went bad .
There 's no innocent until proven guilty .
It 's : You 're fucking guilty . "
If they were murderers , they might not have talked .
Even if they were natural killers , they might not have talked .
But they were n't either of those things .
They were American soldiers , whose job happened to be killing people .
Sure , they talked .
" It was every man for himself after a while , " David Petta says .
And to this day , it 's what gets at Hensley .
" I thought my men would stay loyal till the end , " he says .
" I was proven wrong . "
Hensley stuck to the statement he made on May 11 : They killed a guy who was carrying an AK - 47 .
Then the CID tried to break him .
They brought up Tennille .
" They misjudged my character , because they thought that would be something that would break me down , " Hensley says .
" They thought it would force some heavy emotion from me .
Well , it may have .
But it was n't anything that 's gonna make me admit to being the guy on the grassy knoll .
I 'm not that stupid .
So all it did was make me angry .
That 's basically where they lost me , and I invoked my rights .
I was like , All right , I 'm out of here . "
And Vela ?
He tried to be like Mike , he really did .
His first interrogation at the hands of the CID lasted seven hours .
He stuck to Hensley 's version of the close kill .
He was holding out on the second day when the CID 's lead investigator entered the room .
He asked everyone to leave and then closed the door .
As Vela later testified , " He told me I would never see my family again . "
After fifteen minutes , the door opened .
The investigator said that Evan Vela was ready to make a statement .
The CID misjudged Hensley , but it was Hensley who had misjudged Vela : " He turned out to be much more of a sensitive guy than he ever was when he worked for me , " he says .
" And that tells me he may have acted the way he acted around me to impress me .
And , looking back , I think a lot of guys were like that .
I think a lot of guys looked up to me and wanted to impress me . "
It is one of the few regrets he has , one of the few mistakes he 'll admit : " I thought I had everything under control because I trusted my men .
I was stupid .
They were weak .
It 'll never happen again . "
He let the boy go .
He does not know why .
He can be merciful .
That is even the word Anthony Murphy uses to describe him .
" He 's vicious but merciful .
You can see his mercifulness , surrounded by his spirit , and his weirdness . "
It was n't like he killed every person who crossed his path .
It was n't even like he killed everyone who compromised a hide site .
Vela and a few other snipers had been compromised in April ; Hensley told them to let the guy go .
Now he told the boy to go .
But , he says , " as soon as I released the boy , I knew the father was going to die . "
He did n't know it before then .
He did n't know it until he watched the boy leave .
Then he was like , Oh , that 's why I sent him away .
He got on the radio .
He started making calls to Didier .
The father was still on the ground .
He was still alive .
He did not speak English , so he could n't know what was being said .
But Hensley " had already made the decision .
I was committed at that point , you know ?
I was already in decisive mode .
So I set up a little scenario in my mind .
I was like , All right , I got a guy 200 meters out . . . then I got a guy 150 meters out . . . all right , I see a weapon . . .
I got a guy 100 meters out , I 'd like permission to do a close kill .
It 's like a tragic Shakespeare play .
I have the ending -- and I do n't have to do anything but sit and watch -- because I know . "
Nobody else did .
" Redfern and Sandoval are up in the pump house .
They keep turning around .
' Hey , what are we gonna do , Sarge -- what are we gonna do ? '
' Shut the fuck up and look that way .
You ain't concerned with what we 're gonna do .
Hand , you 're on the berm , shut the fuck up and look that way .
You ain't concerned with what we 're gonna do . '
And I was like , ' Evan , you got your pistol ? '
He 's like , ' Yeah . '
I was like , ' You ready ? '
Ready meaning :
Is there a bullet in the chamber ?
Is the weapon ready ?
Not ,
Are you ready mentally ?
And then I said , ' All right .
Shoot him . '
He pulled the pistol out and he shot the guy
once in the head , and then he started making some gurgling noises -- the guy was making gurgling noises like , aaaahhckkkkk -- a really loud noise , almost as if his blood were draining back into his body cavity .
I said something to the effect of , ' That 's freaky , shoot him again . '
And Vela shot him again .
Whether the bullet impacted him or not , I do n't know .
But I think it did .
Whatever . "
They had taken an AK - 47 with them on the mission .
It had figured significantly in Hensley 's stagecraft .
Now he put it on the body .
Or he directed one of his men to .
The killing , he said , " is legitimate to me ; it 's not legitimate to the law .
So I got two choices .
I can do something illegal , like put a gun on him , or I can go to jail for murder .
I do n't know where you stand ethically on all of that , but that is what it is .
And if doing something that is a little dishonest keeps me and my men from going to jail one day , I am going to be a little dishonest .
If the law causes my men to get killed , the law will be broken .
If lying prevents me from going to jail , I 'm going to lie . "
He broke the law .
He lied .
He did these things , he says , not " for pleasure " or " without motive . "
He did these things , he says , to save the lives of his men .
He did these things because he decided that if Genei Nasir Khudair al - Janabi lived , his men would die .
He did these things because Khudair al - Janabi " was making too much fucking noise . "
He did these things because Khudair al - Janabi " had no right to be there , he was a bad guy , he deserved to die . "
He did these things because he'd been deputized as the battalion 's " hired gun . "
He did these things because he acted as the " buffer between what needed to be done and what the battalion needed to know about . "
He did these things so that all his men would come home , and the terrible irony he lives with is his knowledge that because he did these things , one of his men did not .
Balcavage says it .
Knight says it .
Whiteside says it .
So does Levine and so does Butler .
They all talk about the American soldier .
The American soldier kills .
The American soldier sometimes kills innocents -- " It 's war , " as Balcavage says , " and things happen . "
The American soldier sometimes kills a lot of innocents .
But the American soldier never murders them .
What 's the difference ?
The difference is what makes us different .
The difference is what allows Whiteside to avow , " We 're Americans .
We 're still the good guys . "
The difference , says Balcavage , " is what allows us to walk away from chaotic conflict and still live with ourselves . "
The difference , says Butler , is that the Army , despite its lethal capacities , " tries to live by Judeo - Christian values . "
And that difference , all these officers say , is what Michael Hensley -- with his difference -- tried to erase .
It is one thing to kill an Iraqi .
It 's another to resort to what Balcavage calls " deliberate , well - thought - out murder . "
It is another still to lie about it and then , in Levine 's words , " twist the minds of a bunch of young American soldiers " in an effort to justify it .
Levine , then , had several interests to protect when he preferred murder charges against Sergeant Michael Hensley ( three counts premeditated , related to the killings of April 14 , April 27 , and May 11 , 2007 ) , Sergeant Evan Vela ( one count premeditated , related to the close kill of May 11 ) , and Specialist Jorge Sandoval ( two counts premeditated , related to the close kill of May 11 -- when he gave Evan Vela the 9 mil -- and also to his April 27 killing of the man in the field with the sickle ) .
For one , he had to protect the surge .
He had to demonstrate to the Iraqis that the Army was willing to do the right thing .
Indeed , when the May 11 close kill was just starting to be investigated , the engineer who was the go - between for Balcavage and Sheik Sabah went to Balcavage and told him that he had to go talk with the sheik and other local leaders about how the Army was handling the matter .
" So I met with them , " Balcavage says .
" And I told them the truth .
I told them we were investigating the accusations .
What I was surprised at was how well just telling them that we were investigating stymied the negative impact .
I thought the impact was going to be retributional attacks on our guys because of perceived injustice -- perceived injustice in a war of injustice over there .
Little did we know that the Sunni awakening in our area was just around the corner . "
Little did he know that in a month he would be paying Sheik Sabah and his tribe for every IED they removed from the roads his soldiers traveled .
Ultimately , though , the charge sheets that Levine signed were not about Iraqis .
They were about Americans .
They were about Hensley and his effect on what 's known in the Army as " good order and discipline . "
They were about what Balcavage calls Hensley 's " cult of personality . "
They were about the near - mutiny that Hensley inspired -- some of the charges preferred against him had to do with his disobedience and disrespect of Lieutenant Matthew Didier -- and the fact that the entire scout platoon , after being investigated , was then disbanded , and all but five of its thirty men scattered all over the battalion .
The Army had unleashed Hensley .
It unleashed a soldier who told me , " Hey , it was a business .
I had a quality product , and I was selling cheaper than the competition .
I do n't think anybody was disappointed . "
It unleashed Hensley as it unleashed death itself , and in its prosecution of Hensley and Vela and Sandoval it was trying to undo what it had done .
It failed utterly .
Not only because the Army made the mistake of underestimating him and his influence when it did put him on trial ; but rather because I have spoken with many enlisted American soldiers -- hell , many Americans -- in the course of reporting this story , and I have yet to meet a single one who says that Michael Hensley did anything wrong .
The first trial was Sandoval's .
It was held in September 2007 .
Evan Vela was given testimonial immunity and forced to take the stand .
He recounted the killing of Khudair al - Janabi in graphic detail and came apart emotionally while doing so .
He made it clear that Hensley had given the order .
He made it clear that he had pulled the trigger -- or at least that the 9 mil was in his hand while the trigger was pulled .
Sandoval was acquitted of murder but convicted of planting command wire in the April 27 kill .
The second trial was Hensley's .
It was held in November .
Hensley was aware of how Vela had testified in the Sandoval trial .
He was looking at life without parole , and he figured he'd have to take the stand to save himself .
But he says that while he and Vela were in pretrial confinement in Kuwait , they managed to do what they were forbidden to do , and communicate .
He says that before the trial , Evan got him a note , saying it was going to be all right .
And it was .
Before Evan Vela took the stand in the trial of Michael Hensley , he ripped all the patches off his uniform except the American flag ; in what his lawyer calls " a PTSD episode , " he went blank .
He testified that he had no memory of Hensley ordering him to shoot Khudair al - Janabi and does n't know if he did .
Hensley 's lawyer argued that Evan Vela shot and killed the man for reasons only Evan Vela knows .
Hensley was acquitted of all three counts of premeditated murder and convicted instead on charges of planting the AK - 47 and disrespecting a commanding officer .
He was sentenced to time served .
The final trial was Vela's .
It was held in February 2008 .
Hensley testified .
He had nothing to lose .
He had been acquitted .
So he was , as he says , " willing to play the monster " for Vela 's military jury .
He admitted giving Vela the order to shoot Khudair al - Janabi .
He also spoke , for the first time , of seeing armed Iraqis approaching the hide site and refined his argument that the close kill was a legitimate act of self - defense .
It is not only the one argument he offers ; it is also the only one he accepts .
Everything else he rejects , including the gist of Vela 's defense .
Extreme sleep deprivation ?
Dehydration ?
PTSD ?
The pressure to get more kills ?
No .
They 're excuses .
They 're apologies .
They 're explanations .
They make it seem like he and Vela and the rest of them did something wrong .
They did n't .
Vela followed an order .
How could he have possibly known it was an unlawful order when the person giving it was Michael Hensley ?
How could he have known it might be murder when the person asking him to kill had been given the power of life and death ?
He has no regrets , other than his " regret that some of my men might think they did something wrong , " and another one he voiced at the trial , after Vela was convicted of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to ten years in Leavenworth .
Hensley was angry .
And when he saw the boy he'd let go at the hide site on May 11 , he said , " Hey , kid , how 's your father ? "
Then he said : " I should have dumped him in the river , along with you and the rest of your family . "
Not quite a month after Evan Vela 's conviction for murder , his wife , Alyssa Carnahan , with her baby Blair in the car seat , picks up Michael Hensley at his apartment , and they drive together to Fort Richardson .
She picks him up because he does n't have a car that works , and because he 's been helping her out .
He has been helping her out , particularly , with the Army .
Alyssa does not like the Army .
The Army asked her husband to kill and then sent him to jail for murder .
She has asked the Army to keep paying Evan and to keep providing her family with benefits pending the outcome of Evan 's appeal .
The Army turned her down .
She has no money .
She is moving , however , to Leavenworth , to be closer to Evan , and the Army owes her moving expenses .
Hensley is escorting her to the base because he knows how to talk to these fucking people .
It seems like a bad idea -- the wife of a convicted murderer enlisting as an ally a notoriously unconvicted one -- but Hensley knows how the Army works .
He knows how to get things done .
He makes the Army uncomfortable , and he knows that if there 's anything the Army does n't like , it 's being uncomfortable .
Sure enough , once he shows up with Alyssa , in his black leather jacket and his sideburns and his boots , it 's a situation , and the Army has to stop it .
Alyssa gets paid .
Hensley wins .
He always does .
That 's why , later that night , he 's sitting in a hotel bar with Alyssa Carnahan and Josh Michaud , drinking White Russians in his black leather jacket .
Alyssa has every reason in the world to hate him ; it 's because of Hensley that her husband is in jail .
She does n't .
She trusts him .
Joshua Michaud , one of the youngest of Hensley 's snipers , has every reason to hate him ; it 's because of Hens - ley that he and the rest of the snipers were investigated and called murderers .
He does n't .
He idolizes him .
And it 's like this with everybody : Evan Vela 's father ; Evan Vela 's lawyer ; Sergeant Anthony Murphy ; Sergeant Richard Hand ; even the informer , the whistle - blower , David Petta .
Everybody likes Mike .
More to the point , everybody likes Mike , so nobody thinks that killing an Iraqi in a hide site was a crime worth prosecuting American soldiers for .
Everybody likes Mike , and to like Mike is to like him past a certain point of conscience .
It 's almost a continuation of Iraq :
He has them all on his side , against the Army .
There is only one of his men he 's worried about , and that 's Evan Vela .
He 's worried about him because he can't get to him ; he 's worried about him because someone else can .
It 's what haunts him , and now , as he switches from White Russians to Long Island iced teas , he tells Alyssa , tells us , his silent and rapt audience , what he told her husband before he went to jail .
Hensley was in Iraq to testify , but he stayed in Iraq -- he missed his plane home -- to have this moment with Evan as he was being led away to serve his time .
And what he told him was : " They 're going to try to change your mind in prison .
They 're going to try to make you say you did something wrong .
They might even make you say it in order to get parole .
So say it .
Do n't ever worry about what I think .
It does n't matter what you say , because I know what you really think .
You 'll never have to apologize to me . "

War Is …
According to the Yale Book of Quotations ( whose future editions are being improved by Freakonomics readers ) , war is : “ hell ” ( Napoleon Bonaparte ) , “ too serious a matter to entrust to to military men ” ( Georges Clemenceau ) , and “ a condition of progress ” ( Ernest Renan ) .
What follows below are 12 replies to the question “ What do you think about war in general ? ”
The replies all come from members of the same group .
After you read the replies but before you read beyond the list , try to guess the group .
1. Unfortunately war is necessary and has been for thousands of years .
2 . War is a tragic and hopefully unnecessary part of life .
I pray that militaries may become deterrent forces only .
3 . War is a necessary evil .
4 . While war may appear to be the least beneficial thing to mankind and society in general , there are numerous aspects of it which further our development .
Whether it be the liberation of oppressed people or simply the cooperation of two very different peoples , which results in new friendships between cultures , many positives are found amongst the tragedies .
5 . War is the most effective way to get things done .
6 . War is about protecting the innocent and fighting so others do n’t have to .
7 . Fear leads to hatred and hatred leads to war .
8 . It is a horrible and necessary thing .
We may as well be the best at it .
9 . I believe war is a necessary evil if there is a good enough reason ( e.g. , World War II ) .
10 .
War is that in which humans grow most .
11 . I think war is a way to strengthen our country .
It shows other countries that our country will not be stepped on and we will defend our country .
12 . War is a failure of diplomacy .
Care to guess what group these 12 respondents belong to ?
They are all West Point cadets — more specifically , members of the West Point Canterbury Club , whose answers to questions about war were recently featured in an edition of The Episcopal New Yorker .
( It ’s amazing what shows up in your mailbox sometimes ; I guess not all junk mail is worthless . )
The only answer I abbreviated above was No. 12 , in order not to give it away .
The rest of No. 12 ’s reply : “ As soldiers and officers we will manage and control the application of violence in order to protect the United States . ”
The 12 answers reflect the thoughtful , varied , and independent mindset that I have always encountered when dealing with folks at West Point , properly known as the United States Military Academy .
It is a truly remarkable institution , and I wish the rest of the world knew more about it .
I learned a bit once when writing a chapter about its historic cemetery for this book .
Zoo keepers at an Indian zoo were surprised to find that a python had helped itself to one of their deer .
The snake was unable to leave the scene because it was so heavy from its meal .
Keepers later removed the snake and it will be released into a forest reserve .

How Much Money Does Apple Get From Google ?
Om Malik wonders just how much money Apple gets from Google for search engine referrals from Safari .
When I reported last June that Apple ’s revenue from Google was around $ 25 million per year , that number came from , as they say , a source with knowledge of the situation .
But it ’s not hard to see how that number is easily possible given the Mozilla Foundations ’s financial disclosures .
Here ’s one way to form a rough estimate .
The Mozilla Foundation had revenue of $ 53 million in 2005 and $ 67 million in 2006 .
At that same rate of growth , they ’d have $ 85 million in revenue for 2007 .
Let ’s be conservative , though , and estimate 2007 revenue at $ 75 million .
85 percent of the Mozilla Foundation ’s revenue in 2006 came from Google ; let ’s assume that remained the same .
That ’s about $ 64 million in revenue from Google last year .
Here ’s a Wikipedia page with a bunch of different ( and , alas , differing ) estimates of web browser usage share .
Net Applications claims Firefox has 17 percent usage share , Safari a little under 6 .
If that ’s accurate , Safari has one - third the usage share of Firefox , and , presumably , sends at least a corresponding number of search referrals to Google .
( Perhaps more , since Firefox ’s search field is configurable to use other search engines , and Safari ’s is hard - wired to use only Google .
On the other hand , Firefox ships with a Google home page . )
That works out to around $ 21 million a year .
Other sources , such as TheCounter.com , pin Safari ’s usage share at about 20 percent of Firefox ’s , which would put Apple ’s revenue from Google at around $ 13 million for 2007 .
One might also presume — as I do — that Apple has better negotiators than the Mozilla Foundation , 1 and that Google pays Apple more per referral than they do Mozilla .
( E.g. , Apple may well argue that Safari users , as a whole , are demographically more appealing than Firefox users . )
Last.fm's free , ad - supported music streams have resulted in a 119 percent increase in music purchases through Amazon , the company said today .
The service , which launched just over two months ago , has also brought on a number of new users , although old users are contributing to the trend as well .
Last.fm believes that , while the service is still young , the proof is in the pudding : allowing users to have full - track previews drives music sales , both digital and physical .
When Last.fm launched its on - demand music streaming service in January , it made millions of tracks from all four major music labels ( plus a smattering of indies ) available for free .
The labels get paid every time a track is played , although there 's a limitation of playing a single track only three times before being shown an ad and links to affiliate partners where you can buy the music .
Those links are apparently paying off .
Although Last.fm has affiliate partnerships with iTunes and 7 Digital as well , the company did not release sales data for anyone but Amazon .
And while music purchases through Amazon more than doubled after an influx of new users joined the site , Last . fm says longtime members were buying more music too — there was a 66 percent increase in album and track purchases among existing users .
" In just over two months it 's become clear that people will buy CDs and downloads if they get access to the kind of service we offer , " said Last .fm co-founder Martin Stiksel in a statement .
Stiksel went on to tout Last.fm as the leader in offering free , streaming music from major labels , although other players ( like MySpace and imeem ) are getting in on the streaming music fun too .
Surely the music labels are happy , too , that the increase is affecting CD sales in addition to cherry - picked digital tracks , as CD sales have been a bit anemic as of late .
If music sales as a result of streaming offerings show growth over a longer period of time ( say , a year ) , then other services may also begin to push for full - track previews in hopes of increasing sales .
Imagine if Amazon MP3 or iTunes allowed full previews on their respective services before buying — digital music could take off even faster than it already has .
It shows how the very ideas that the music industry resisted for years have the potential to pay off financially .
Many of us grew up with the idea of the component audio system .
A receiver ( or a separate preamplifier and amplifier ) , tuner ( radio ) , record player , tape deck , and later on a CD player .
If you were into more fancy stuff , you had a DAT or MiniDisc deck as well .
While some of us cling on to this mindset like there ’s no tomorrow , the real world seems to favour a different method of consuming music .
According to Erica Ogg ( what ’s in a name ) , the component audio system is on its way out – thanks to the iPod and the commoditisation of music .
My own setup is anything but exotic .
I have a Sony STR - DE515 5.1 surround receiver , a Technics SL - PG420A compact disc player , a cheap EUR 75 Lenco record player , and two HiLo 60/90 W three - way speakers .
A fairly affordable set of components , most of which I snapped up at Marktplaats.nl , a Dutch eBay - like website .
From the looks of it there does n’t appear to be anything special about these components – but there is .
The CD player is well over 15 years old , and the speakers are most likely 20 - 30 years old .
And they still perform their intended functions in an outstanding manner .
In fact , the old CD player playbacks scratched and old discs a lot better than just about any modern CD player I ’ve ever used .
I ’m not entirely sure how old the device actually is , as there is little information to be found online , but I remember that the man who sold it to me stated it was from the early ’90s .
The speakers are more interesting : they are from HiLo , a company from the small Dutch town of Wormerveer .
The company is no longer in operation , and apart from a few online classifieds , the intertubes contain little information on the company .
Most of these classifieds refer to speakers from the ’ 70s , but I suspect mine are a little younger ( ’ 80s ) .
Still , considering the age of the speakers , it ’s extraordinary they still work perfectly .
I suspect the wooden speakers are hand - built – the craftsmanship is astonishing .
Anyway , this all appears to become a thing of the past .
As Erica Ogg puts it :
If you think about it , the equipment that has traditionally defined the audiophile is antithetical to the way we experience music today .
Speakers are clunky and immobile , and expensive shelf systems do n’t play easily swappable digital files .
Instead , stereo shopping nowadays often means picking up an iPod and a speaker dock .
The combination is cheaper , mobile , convenient , and , for better or worse , cool .
The sales of home audio equipment have been on a steady decline for the past ten years or so , with a sharp decline the past few years .
“ Home CD player sales totaled USD 36.2 million last year , but that ’s 35 percent below 2005 sales figures , ” Ogg cites from data from the NPD Group , “ Home speaker sales are down 2 percent , but home shelf systems sales are down 40 percent in the same time period . ”
Only the true audiophiles stick to the component , home audio market – the rest of the world is moving towards iPods and docks .
The industry is forced to consolidate ; JVC and Kenwood have merged into JVC Kenwood Holdings , hoping to cut down on costs .
D&M Holdings , the company behind high - end brands such as Denon , Marantz ( Marantz ! Marantz ! ) , McIntosh , Snell Acoustics , Boston Acoustics , and Escient , is also up for sale – Harman International and JVC Kenwood are interested .
Steve Guttenberg of Audiophiliac is concerned about these developments .
Audio today , as exemplified by the iPod , has become a mere commodity , most mainstream audio products are cranked out by anonymous subcontractors .
What part(s ) of an iPod was actually designed by Apple engineers ?
There ’s no there , there .
D & M Holdings products are different , they ’re designed and made by real people ; when I visited the McIntosh factory a few years ago I was impressed by their dedication .
McIntosh engineers still design McIntosh electronics , and the McIntosh workers do n’t merely assemble parts made by subcontractors , the make most of the things that go into a McIntosh in house .
These types of companies produce their equipment by hand , with an astonishing eye for detail and attention to customer service .
“ The products were made to last for decades , not just the length of a one - year warranty , ” Ogg writes .
I dislike the way people consume music these days – they do n’t take the time for it any more , they do n’t sit down on their sofas just to listen to music , to experience it , to revel in it .
Music merely has an additional value these days , instead of an intrinsic value .
It is no longer tangible – instead of a record cover or jewel case , you have a number of anonymous 1s and 0s .
And call me old - fashioned , but where ’s the soul in that ?
WASHINGTON —
The overdose of Reagan nostalgia to which we ’ve been subjected during the Republican presidential primaries is as understandable as it is misplaced .
Understandable , because each party has its icons .
Misplaced , because we have never really risen far from Reaganism at its most basic level , and there can be no nostalgia for a time that has not really passed .
The supply - side economic theory of granting enormous tax cuts to the wealthy in hopes that dribbles would “ trickle down ” to the rest was resurrected with President Bush ’s tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 .
They are more tragic in their result than even President Reagan ’s tax cuts were , as the Bush era has been marked by evidence that economic inequality is growing more and more extreme .
After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , Bush started one necessary war in Afghanistan and a tragically misguided one in Iraq , two conflicts that many Americans believe are responsible for a run-up in defense spending for which future generations shall pay .
They are only partly right .
Just as it did under Reagan , routine defense spending under Bush has been rising without restraint , gobbling an ever larger share of the federal budget and growing as a percentage of the nation ’s economic output , according to a new study by the liberal - leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Excluding the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as expenditures for the global “ war on terror , ” spending for defense and related security programs has gone up 4.8 percent per year since 2001 , after adjusting for inflation .
To understand the full measure of this number , analyst Richard Kogan compared it with spending growth in the big entitlement programs — Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security .
These are the programs we are incessantly being told are ballooning so far out of control that they are “ unsustainable ” and somehow driving the nation toward bankruptcy .
Kogan found that the three programs , averaged together , grew by only 3.8 percent per year since 2001 .
Even that figure includes spending that resulted from adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare , the largest expansion of the health - insurance program since its inception more than four decades ago .
The numbers are even more skewed when defense spending is compared with the growth in domestic discretionary spending , that portion of the federal budget that pays for such necessities as law enforcement , highways , air traffic control and so forth .
Kogan found that defense spending has grown 27 times as fast as discretionary domestic spending , when inflation and population growth are taken into account .
Quibbling with this or that way of parsing budget numbers is a political art form .
But an overarching point of agreement between Republicans and Democrats , one that cannot be disputed , is that since the Democrats took over both houses of Congress , they have not even nicked the Pentagon .
Indeed , Sen. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , chairman of the budget committee , boasted of this compliance in a floor speech delivered on Tuesday , as the chamber was deliberating this year ’s budget resolution .
Countering Republican claims that Democrats were shortchanging the troops , Conrad said : “ We have the identical amount in our budget for defense and the war as the president had in his budget — identical , not a dime of difference . ”
So there you have it .
The Democrats ’ political posture is that questioning Bush ’s runaway defense spending is such a loser that they dare not risk it .
Whether this allocation of scarce resources is actually in the public interest does not enter into it .
This framework , carried to its logical conclusion , means that even if the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were to end quickly — and no one is predicting that they will — there will be no “ peace divided . ”
Neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton , the two remaining candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination , has pledged any significant reordering of budget priorities , except that both say they intend to scale back that portion of the Bush tax cuts that flows mostly to the wealthy .
The Republican nominee , John McCain , harrumphs mostly about congressional “ earmarks , ” those for - my - district spending provisions that raise the public ’s hackles but account for a pittance of federal spending .
Eliminate every single earmark , and there would still be a huge budget deficit and an enormous imbalance in the way taxpayer resources are allocated between domestic and defense spending .
This is Reaganism at its worst , and we endure it now even without the comforting gloss of Reagan ’s rosy demeanor .
Marie Cocco ’s e-mail address is mariecocco ( at ) washpost.com .
Far from the glare of presidential politics , a serious debate is taking place on the future of U.S. space policy .
Speaking recently in Colorado Springs , where the U.S. Air Force Space Command is headquartered , Republican Sen. Wayne Allard and Democratic Rep. Mark Udall agreed that the next president , to quote Allard , will have to choose which direction to take . 
The options are both stark and clear .
Allard is among those who believe the United States needs missile defense weapons in space - weapons that also could be turned against other nations  satellites .
Udall , chairman of the congressional subcommittee that oversees NASA and a candidate to succeed the retiring Allard , opposes space weapons .
 My vision would be that all nations of the world share the high ground of space ,  he said , not engage in a new arms race  that results in the weaponization of space . 
Decision time
The next president will have to choose .
Decision time is rapidly approaching .
In January 2007 , China destroyed an aging Chinese weather satellite in an anti-satellite weapons test , roughly replicating a 1985 U.S. test .
Do we want China to dominate space ?
Of course not , leading some to argue that the United States needs to lay claim to space - and soon .
My view is that we shouldnt want anybody to dominate space ; we should do whatever we can to ensure that space remains free of weapons .
Whoever becomes the next U.S. president should lead that effort by calling on the nations of the world to update the 41 - year - old Outer Space Treaty .
The old treaty - inspired by President Dwight D. Eisenhower - took effect in October 1967 .
Even the Soviet Unions then ambassador to the United States , Anatoly Dobrynin , hailed the treaty as a landmark achievement , ensuring that space would be used only for peaceful activities - for the benefit of all mankind . 
To be sure , both the United States and Soviet Union worked on a variety of space weapons and anti-satellite systems during the Cold War , but neither country deployed a comprehensive space weapons system .
Ater the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , the floodgates opened in the United States and many influential space warriors  began to argue that the time had come for U.S. space dominance .
Advocates claimed that if the United States could dominate space in a time of conflict , no peer competitor would ever challenge us , ensuring lasting peace .
In October , former New York Gov. George Pataki , acting as a public delegate to the U.N. General Assembly , said the United States remains fully committed to the peaceful uses of space .
But , he added , discussions regarding the merits of treaties to prevent the so - called weaponization of outer space would be a pointless exercise . 
Pointless to whom ?
The United States has more to lose from a space - related arms race than any other country .
Of the 800 - plus commercial , scientific , and military - related satellites now in orbit , more than half bear the Made - in - America label .
That may be what the Chinese were trying to tell us last year when they conducted their anti-satellite test .
Chinese tests
For many years , China has attempted to get the United States to the negotiating table , without success .
The Chinese test may have been a wake - up call .
Its message : Lets get on with treaty talks ; otherwise , we will challenge you in space .
Military space dominance is a no-win proposition .
Rather than considering such ideas , the next president should push for a tough new space treaty , one that is verifiable and has teeth .
It s time for our country , which seeks to influence the world by example , to be visionary and bold .
And what could be bolder and more visionary - for a nation and a new president - than leading the world to a treaty that would ensure that space remains free of weapons and free of conflict ?

I have a hunch that is due to the google analytics javascript , which reads user information and displays a different page profile accordingly .
But I run No - Script , and AdBlock , block all cookies , and it still seems to change each time .
And curiously it has more than 50 different profiles ( yes I refreshed 50 times ) , the max google analytics supports .
The links page actually has some useful stuff , including an app for macs that meows every time you plug in your mouse .

WASHINGTON  Secret Service supervisors shared crude sexual jokes and engaged in racially derogatory banter about blacks , and passed around an anecdote about a possible assassination of the Rev. Jesse Jackson , according to internal e-mail disclosed in a federal court filing on Friday by lawyers for black Secret Service agents .
The filing includes 10 e-mail messages that were among documents the agency recently turned over to lawyers for the black agents as part of an increasingly bitter discrimination lawsuit .
The messages were written mainly from 2003 through 2005 , and were sent to and from e-mail accounts of at least 20 Secret Service supervisors .
The messages offer a glimpse into the darker recesses of an agency known for protecting presidents and other dignitaries but whose culture is regarded as one of the most insular in federal law enforcement .
The disclosure of the messages follows an incident last month in which a noose was found in a room used by a black instructor at a Secret Service training facility in Beltsville , Md. Agency officials said that episode was under internal investigation .

If you go into a good library , you will find thousands of books on globalization .
Some will laud it .
Some will warn about its dangers .
But they ’ll agree that globalization is the chief process driving our age .
Our lives are being transformed by the increasing movement of goods , people and capital across borders .
The globalization paradigm has led , in the political arena , to a certain historical narrative :
There were once nation - states like the U.S. and the European powers , whose economies could be secured within borders .
But now capital flows freely .
Technology has leveled the playing field .
Competition is global and fierce .
New dynamos like India and China threaten American dominance thanks to their cheap labor and manipulated currencies .
Now , everything is made abroad .
American manufacturing is in decline .
The rest of the economy is threatened .
Hillary Clinton summarized the narrative this week : “ They came for the steel companies and nobody said anything .
They came for the auto companies and nobody said anything .
They came for the office companies , people who did white - collar service jobs , and no one said anything .
And they came for the professional jobs that could be outsourced , and nobody said anything . ”
Facebook is the focus of a new complaint in Canada over its privacy policies and practices .
The Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic ( CIPPIC ) filed the complaint this morning , asking the Privacy Commissioner of Canada to review what the CIPPIC believes are various violations of Canadian privacy law .
There are 22 violations in all , says CIPPIC , making Facebook " a minefield of privacy invasion . "
Facebook 's policies and practices were analyzed by a " team of law students " over the winter , resulting in their discovery of what they believe to be numerous violations of the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ( PIPEDA ) .
Some of the issues raised in the complaint are a little benign : for example , CIPPIC takes issue with the fact that all of a user 's friends can see Wall posts ( comments ) left by other friends , and that it 's not easy to simply delete all Wall posts with a single click .
Other issues , however , are more serious , like a user 's inability to easily delete his or her account and all the data associated with it .
( Instead , users can choose to suspend their accounts , leaving their data dormant with Facebook — for potential reactivation — for an unspecified amount of time . )
CIPPIC points out a number of other violations that have raised the eyebrows of users for some time now .
Facebook fails to disclose why every third - party Facebook application must have access to every bit of a user 's personal data ( this is something that annoys me , personally ) , and requires the submission of a user 's date of birth upon registration even though there are no age guidelines for using the service .
Facebook also fails to obtain express consent to share users ' personal information by making all information partially public by default ( users can change privacy settings after saving the information first ) .
The same goes for photographs uploaded by the user , or photos uploaded and tagged by others that then show up on the user 's profile by default — whether they like it or not .
Of course , no privacy complaint about Facebook would be complete without a mention of Beacon and Facebook 's advertising practices .
Beacon is a system that allows partner sites — like Yelp , Blockbuster , Fandango , and 40 - some others — to communicate users ' off - Facebook activities to Facebook .
When it was launched late last year , Beacon caused a public outcry almost immediately , because it published people 's online purchases directly to their news feeds with little - to - no way to get out of it .
Facebook eventually reevaluated Beacon and changed a number of privacy settings so that off - Facebook activities would n't be published publicly by default .
The site still transfers user data from non-Facebook sites ( with absolutely no way for users to opt out of that behavior ) , which has resulted in at least one lawsuit so far .
CIPPIC 's issues with Beacon are the same as all the others — Facebook fails to give users an easy way to opt out of all Beacon activities , and fails to notify users that their personal information is being used for advertising purposes .
Those are just a few of the numerous points brought up by CIPPIC , but you get the idea .
At every turn , Facebook seems to do not quite enough to satisfy the concerns of privacy advocates — not to mention that Facebook 's activities tend to worry those who do n't want their data exploited for commercial purposes .
" We 're concerned that Facebook is deceiving its users , " said one of the law students behind the complaint , Lisa Feinberg .
" Facebook promotes itself as a social utility , but it's also involved in commercial activities like targeted advertising .
Facebook users need to know that when they 're signing up to Facebook , they 're signing up to share their information with advertisers . "

LES ULIS , France 
When their local bakery in this town south of Paris raised the price of a baguette for the third time in six months , Anne -Laure Renard and Guy Talpot bought a bread maker .
When gasoline became their biggest single expense , they sold one of their two cars .
Their combined annual income of 40,000 euros , about $ 62,500 , lands Ms. Renard , a teacher , and Mr. Talpot , a postal worker , smack in the middle of France ’s middle class .
And over the last year , prices in France have risen four times as fast as their salaries .
At the end of every month , they blow past their bank account ’s $ 900 overdraft limit , plunging themselves deeper into a spiral of greater resourcefulness and regret .
“ In France , when you ca n’t afford a baguette anymore , you know you ’re in trouble , ” Ms. Renard said one recent evening in her kitchen , as her partner measured powdered milk for their 13 - month - old son , Vincent .
“ The French Revolution started with bread riots . ”
The Bomb as illustrated in the report
If you have similar or updated material , see our submission instructions .
See here for a detailed explanation of the information on this page .
The summary is approved by the editorial board .
Any questions about this document 's veracity are noted .
Unless otherwise specified , the document described here :
The Penney Report ( 1947 ) , outlining the features of an atomic bomb based on the U.S. " Fat Man " pattern , and the tasks required to develop one for Britain , was declassified and made available to the the public under the Public Records Act .
The report , appearing in the UK Public Record Office File AVIA 65/1163 , " Implosion " ( covering the years 1947 - 1953 ) was then withdrawn from public access during 2002 and will not be reconsidered until 2014 .
The actual legal status of this file remains as a public record .
Its access condition has been changed to " Retained by Department under Section 3.4 " ( of the PRA ) which means that the file has been returned to the custody of the originating department ( Ministry of Supply ) or its successor .
This limitation of access does not constitute reimposition of a secret security marking , and no attempt appears to have been made by the UK government to contact people who had previously obtained photocopies copies of this file , until the " Fat Man " diagram appeared on Wikileaks .
The diagram and a HTML version of the text first appeared on http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/ in July 2007 but apparently remained unnoticed and unreported .
The diagram was removed from the Nuclear Weapon Archive site , for political , but accordingly to the sites owner , not for proliferation reasons , in March 2008 following requests from the British Government set off by the Wikileaks exposure .
The Head of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Counter Proliferation Department , Regional Issues , requested Wikileaks remove the material , stating :
Wikileaks considered the requests but did not find them to be credible .
A record of the correspondence can be found in the ' Note ' section of this page .
Wikileaks received the following correspondence from the British Government over diagram appearing as the first page of the document , which was released prior to the rest of the material .

Subject : Nuclear bomb design information Date : Wed , 19 Mar 2008 16:07:03 +0000 ( GMT ) Dear Wikileaks ,
We have recently been alerted to the fact that you have put censored nuclear bomb designs on your website .
Grateful if you could remove these as soon as possible , as I hope you agree that some censorship at least is in the public good .
These designs could aid countries wishing to develop nuclear weapons , hence the desire to keep them out of the public domain .
The page I am specifically referring to is : < http://wikileaks.org/wiki/First_atomic_bomb_diagram>
Please let me know if you agree with me , and if you have decided to remove them .

Subject : Re : Nuclear bomb design information Dear Ms McRaw ,
We take your concerns seriously .
However , the editors and a number of nuclear physicists are of the opinion , which is outlined in the article summary , that our release of the material will not contribute to the the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
If our argument is in error we would be happy to be corrected by a detailed response .

Subject : RE : Nuclear bomb design information Date : Wed , 19 Mar 2008 16:50:09 +0000 ( GMT ) Dear Mr Lim ,
Thank you for your prompt response .
I will talk to our experts here and do my best to work up a detailed explanation for you ( though some of the explanation may be classified ! ) .
I am glad to read that you have at least checked this with a number of nuclear physicists before putting it on your website .
I would just add that I do n't see that the information furthers your aims - i.e. reduc ed corruption , better government and stronger democracies .
Therefore , I would be very grateful if you could remove the information while I work up a detailed explanation fo r you .
I will try to do this as quickly as possible - I am away over Easter but if you could give me until 2 April , I 'll send you something then .
Kind regards , Isabella McRae

We will look into this .
The response does not have to be a thesis , but it should be of similar effort to the argument we gave .
The documents are a substantial piece of world history and have been released , then censored .
Implicit in our core mission is preventing censorship of such documents .
That said I do n't want this guide to blind us to doing what is right .
From our research I believe we have done the right thing , but as I said , we are happy to shown otherwise on an issue of such importance .

Thanks for your understanding .
If there is no proliferation sensitivity with this info then I can't see any problem in having it in the open domain .
I need to get an expert opinion first to be confident of that .
So in the mean time , to avoid doing any dam age , please do remove the info .
I 'll email you with a full opinion ( not a thesis though ) on 2 April .
Kind regards , Isabella

Jay , I have had an initial assessment from our experts .
They are extremely concerned by the drawing you have posted on your website and assess it is of serious proliferation concern , and possibly terrorism concern .
Please remove it as soon as possible - not to do so is deeply morally irresponsible .
As requested , I will work up a longer and more detailed case by 2 April .
Isabella

Subject : Re : Nuclear bomb design information
Without wanting to be uncharitable , if FCO 's experts believe this particular document to be of " terrorism concern " , we do not find them to be credible and may I suggest , neither will anyone else .
Similarly after consultations it strikes us as extraordinary that the FCO claims the Wikileaks documents are a proliferation issue worthy of censorship , but , apparently , not worthy of assigning a staff member to address the issue during its Easter break .
May I suggest that the FCO is engaging in busy work , pending some hyperthetical White Hall telephone call in response to the press attention our analysis of the document has received ?
The document has been available in one form or another since 2002 , and on the internet since 2007 .
What has the FCO being doing in the mean time ?
Or are we meant to believe that states seeking to become atomic powers only read the popular press ?
While we will always keep an open mind on such an important issue , until we see some clear indication that the FCO takes its request that Wikileaks engage in an unprecedented act of self - censorship seriously , by telling us why we should censor , this request will not be acted on by Wikileaks .

As of Tue April 8 , 2008 , no further response was received .
Despite claiming he can compete with United and Chelsea on the field over the next few years , Wenger has privately expressed fears that Arsenal will soon be too far behind the top teams in financial terms
Mathieu Flamini became the first to walk out when he agreed a move to AC Milan earlier in the week , turning down Arsenal 's £ 55,000 - a- week offer , and it is feared others may follow .
Alexander Hleb is determined to move to Inter Milan in the summer and Jens Lehmann has played his last game .
Adebayor , after suffering an initial knockback , is expected to make more noises following Sunday 's final game of the season at Sunderland
His agent Stephane Courbis said : ' Now is not the time to talk about his contract .
We 'll wait until next week . '
Hleb 's agent Nikolai Shpilevski said last night : ' Alexander is preparing to make one of the most important moves of his life .
He is leaving Arsenal even though they want to offer him a new long - term contract and better conditions .
There 's no way back now . '
Wenger claimed his current team could eclipse the 2004 ' Invincibles ' , but Arsenal are falling behind the top clubs in Europe in terms of transfer fees and salaries
Despite claims from former chief executive Keith Edelman that the manager has a pot of gold at his disposal , it is thought Wenger 's hands are tied in the transfer market , largely due to the crippling cost of their two - yearold Emirates Stadium .
All that could be solved if the club were to accept the help of Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov , but chairman Peter Hill - Wood and director Danny Fiszman say no .
Arsenal , along with Chelsea , have been offered the chance to sign Thierry Henry , but Wenger has turned down the opportunity
Henry was deemed a ' special case ' when he signed a contract worth £ 130,000 a week at the Emirates in the aftermath of the defeat in the 2006 Champions League final , but Arsenal are no longer in a position to pay that kind of figure .
A question increasingly asked is whether Google is becoming a dangerous monopoly .
It is a very serious question .
If we end up with one company controlling search - the gateway to information - it could be catastrophic if it abused its position .
Google is already technically a monopoly with nearly 70 % of US search and as much as 90 % in the UK on some surveys .
But it is highly unusual for two reasons .
First , it lacks the typical symptom - charging excessively for its products .
Nearly all of Google 's products from search to document storage are free .
What kind of monopoly is that ?
Second , Google is unusual in that unlike Microsoft , which controls over 90 % of PC operating systems and associated software , or even Cisco with over 90 % of enterprise routers , there are no insurmountable barriers for new entrants .
It is true that Google makes vast profits from search - linked adverts that it exploits ruthlessly - and the more it appears as the default search engine on users ' toolbars , the more it risks abusing its power .
But even so , you only have to switch to another bookmark .
For Yahoo , at least on my computer , simply type " Y " into the URL field and up it comes .
If you tried Yahoo in a blind tasting , could you tell the difference ?
I can't .
Type in part of a distinctive sentence from today 's Guardian and see for yourself .
Others , such as Microsoft 's revamped Live Search and Ask.com , seem less good .
So why is Google popular and is it dislodge - able ?
It all comes down to that frightful word " brand " .
But Google is unprecedented because it built up its brand without any paid advertising .
We did it for them .
It became a verb in record time .
It became one of the world 's most profitable brands in barely a decade .
Think Coca - Cola versus Pepsi ( leaving aside the hundreds of millions spent preserving their brands ) .
The story is that Coke 's ill - fated New Coke was planned to taste more like Pepsi which used to win in blind tastings - though Coke would win if samplers knew what drinks they were tasting .
There is a fatalism shared by the likes of Wall Street 's Henry Blodget that it is inevitable that internet companies gain market shares of over 90 % because they are " natural monopolies " .
Piffle .
New search companies do n't have to spend hundreds of millions on marketing and branding as they would for a soft drink or an operating system .
Google is more vulnerable than people think .
It is brilliant at displaying the answers most linked to - but not if what you want is buried deep in the search pile .
If a nimble startup delivers a more intelligent engine , people will soon change , as they did when they ditched AltaVista for Google a decade ago .
Yahoo , Microsoft and Google have all been upstaged in video and networking sites by brand new startups .
Why not search as well ?
Google could also be dented by paid - for ads or if it started abusing its monopoly enough to provoke coordinated opposition on sites such as Facebook .
The company 's " Do n't be Evil " motto is part of its brand despite its failure to stand up to Chinese censorship .
If it had , other companies might have followed its lead and eaten into Chinese obduracy .
Google is still a one - product company with search - related ads generating nearly all of its profits .
This could change if a better engine emerges or if it becomes the latest victim to Lord Acton 's dictum : " All power tends to corrupt . "
If that happened I could retain all the Google products I treasure ( maps , documents , Gmail etc ) and spend a few seconds changing my default search engine .
Is there a solution ?
Sooner or later , Google 's founders will hand over their fortunes to a foundation .
Americans do that .
Perhaps , since its leaders still have voting control , they should do it now .
It could carry on as a stock market company governed by an independent trust , mandated to ensure that " Do n't be Evil " is never abused .
Now where did I get that idea from ?

In the column above we implied that the controversial reformulation of the soft drink Coca - Cola introduced in 1985 was called Coca - Cola Classic .
In fact , the new product was branded New Coke ; Coca - Cola Classic was the name the Coca - Cola Company used to reintroduce its old formula several months later .
This has been corrected .
HOUSTON  A Texas appeals court ruled Thursday that state authorities and a lower court judge abused their authority by illegally seizing up to 468 children from their homes at a polygamist ranch in West Texas last month .
The rebuke threw the largest custody case in American history into turmoil , with some lawyers saying the children could soon be reunited with their families .
Many of the mothers have been criss - crossing Texas visiting their children in foster homes .
According to the court , the state did not establish proper grounds to remove the children from their families , who belong to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , or F.L.D.S. The F.L.D.S. broke off from the mainstream Mormon church after it had disavowed polygamy in 1890 .
The agency raided the Yearning for Zion ranch on April 3 after someone had called an abuse hot line and said that she was a 16 - year - old child bride being abused by her older husband in the church ’s compound .
The caller has still not been found .

No , not vagina and breasts , there 's plenty of those about , but juicy thespian bits for the female sex .
This summer is n't that different , with the usual slough of Batman , Ironman , The Hulk , Indiana Jones , etc. , on offer .
There is one gonzo gender exception however , when the four women of Sex and the City storm the cinema gates on Friday .
I do n't quite know what to think about this .
I like shoes as much as the next person , but the attendant hoopla is a little ridiculous .
The breathy frenzy over SATC has been ongoing for the last few months , and has reached a fever pitch of TV specials , Vogue Magazine layouts and interview after interview .
It 's a full on gorge of frothy femininity and label lust so slick , you might want to become a Carmelite nun afterwards , merely to rest your eyes on something severe and spare .
The whole conflagration has me thinking , " How does something become its opposite ? "
Affairs to forget
Once upon a time , a woman named Candace Bushnell wrote a book about a group of New Yorkers looking for love , and finding only sackcloth and ashes .
She writes : " The glittering lights of Manhattan that served as backdrops for Edith Wharton 's bodice - heaving trysts are still glowing -- but the stage is empty .
No one has breakfast at Tiffany 's , and no one has affairs to remember -- instead , we have breakfast at 7 a.m. and affairs we try to forget as quickly as possible .
How did we get into this mess ? "
Despite the sex , the cosmopolitans and the shoes , nobody seemed to be having a very good time .
The rituals enacted by the tribe of single women and men who had seemingly lost faith in love were often mean spirited and empty .
Within the guise of her alter - ego Carrie Bradshaw , sexual anthropologist and gal about town , Bushnell described how women became men , and men became scarce .
" We were hard and proud of it , and it had n't been easy to get to this point -- this place of complete independence where we had the luxury of treating men like sex objects .
It had taken hard work , loneliness , and the realization that , since there might never be anyone there for you , you had to take care of yourself . "
There really is n't much separating Wharton 's Lily Bart from Carrie Bradshaw , except that Carrie marries well at the end of the story .
Both women want love and luxury : one gets it , the other does n't .
Barbies in Disney York
Someone once said that nothing is as distant as the recent past , and even before they had to alter the show 's opening sequence to delete the twin towers , Sex and the City had become just another Disneyland version of New York , suitable for middle America to gawk at .
Bushnell 's salvos at '90s Manhattan dating culture seem almost as far away now as Edith Wharton's of the 1870s , or Mary Cantwell 's of the '50s and '60s .
This is a bit of an aside , but if you 're at all interested in the notion of fashion , New York , and what it meant to be a single woman trying to navigate these tricky waters , go find Mary Cantwell 's book Manhattan Memoir .
Long before Ms. Bushnell came to town , Mary Lee was busy crafting a portrait of a time and a place when the world still came to New York looking to make something of itself .
Heather Mallick recently took the spurs to the Sex and the City audience , but she 's a bit late to the party .
By the time the show had ended its run on HBO , it was already like putting lipstick on a corpse ; the flesh was willing , albeit a bit withered , but the spirit has long departed .
Not that there ever was much soul to begin with .
What is more curious than the evolution of the show into a cultural juggernaut , is the jettisoning of any reality , however slight , for a full - on Barbie 's Dream City , complete with four Barbies , and all the mix - and - match kooky outfits you could possibly want .
Cuteness really is a bit of a curse when you 're older .
It 's like patent maryjanes or frilly white pinafores , truly sweet only on a six - year - old .
Cute in your 40s and 50s looks a lot like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ?
I watched the show when it first came on air , mostly because it was a bit of novelty , frank talk about sexual matters , and the occasional shoe fetish moment .
Over the years I watched as the series quickly lost anything even slightly complex and genuine , and replaced it with cartoon versions of adult women .
Even if the latter episodes were obviously driven by the ego of one Sarah Jessica Parker , who seemed determined to frost Manhattan in pink tulle , and throaty giggles , the turn around was somewhat remarkable .
Marriage , babies and conventional morality were offered up in lieu of independence and self - determination .
I felt a little sick , but it was sort of like watching a car crash , you could n't really look away .
Still , I kept watching until Sex finally went off the air .
" At last , it 's over , " I thought .
But , of course , it was n't .
The main distraction
Mallick 's message in her column about the show , that women are idiots if they choose to partake of such stuff , is only partly right .
Certainly , the Sex and the City phenomena is a marketer 's power puff , but you could also view the film version as the equivalent of the '30s musical extravaganzas , movies that were supposed to distract people who were down on their luck , and simply needful of some glamour .
Even while outside the world went to hell , inside the movie theatre a bespangled blast of beauty and shine awaited , a place where marabou starlets , soft and downy as new born chicks , descended staircases , wafting Arpège and Evening in Paris .
There is some element of that glissando fantasy in Sex and the City , but of course , the modern version lacks any innocence of purpose .
The world is still apparently going to hell , it 's just a wee bit closer to the fiery pit .
Women still need their $ 800 shoes , or whatever Manolos cost these days .
If there were only a few cartoon women in TV and film , balanced by some other stuff , I suppose it would n't be so bad , but they 're everywhere .
Reality and fiction have an odd way of blending lately .
A recent article on the Cannes Film Festival brought it home .
But even the barest glance at the television reveals a very strange cultural collision .
It gives one pause when the only way women can apparently get their own TV show is by being complete and utter bitches .
Denise Richards ( It 's Complicated ) , Lindsay Lohan 's Mother ( Living Lohan ) , and Baby Phat Designer Kimora Lee Simmons , all resemble cartoon witches : grasping , greedy , screeching creatures that might make you loath to admit that you share the same gender .
It 's the collusion that makes you feel sick to your stomach , like Amos and Andy with breasts , or Stepin Fetchit for the next generation .
Debased glamour
It 's little wonder that in a recent BBC poll the most loathed celebrities were all women .
( The most beloved on the other hand , were all male . )
Maxim Magazine named Sarah Jessica
Parker number one on its list of ugliest women .
The sheer meanness of this should n't come as a shock , but somehow it still does .
Sometimes it feels as if we , as a culture , decided to go backwards .
One only needs to take a quick look at the cover of Vogue Magazine to see evidence of this notion .
Here is one Carrie Bradshaw -- AKA SJP as she is referred to throughout the accompanying article -- crouched at the feet of her man , actually pinioned between his legs , her head positioned exactly over his crotch .
It 's as if she 'd been caught in the middle of performing a sex act , and turned just in time for her head shot .
A picture is worth a thousand words supposedly , but this picture only brings up one word .
And it ai n't pretty .

One part news , three parts trash .
I find it quite healthy .
A former aide to James E. McGreevey said today that he had three - way sexual trysts with the former governor and his wife before he took office , challenging Dina Matos McGreevey 's assertion that she was naive about her husband 's sexual exploits .
The aide , Theodore Pedersen , said he and the couple even had a nickname for the weekly romps , from 1999 to 2001 , that typically began with dinner at T.G.I .
Fri day 's and ended with a threesome at McGreevey 's condo in Woodbridge .
They called them " Friday Night Specials , " according to Pedersen .
Pedersen described the encounters during an interview with The Star - Ledger .
He said he wanted to refute the innocent image that Matos McGreevey has projected - both during the couple 's ongoing divorce battle and in interviews she gave after New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned last week in a sex scandal .
He said he was also incensed by her portrayal of herself as an unsuspecting wife in her book : " Silent Partner : A Memoir of My Marriage . "
" I wanted to get this out now because it was so offensive to me that she goes on television playing the victim , " Pedersen said .
" She 's trying to make this a payday for herself .
She should have told the truth about the three of us . "
Peder sen did not say if he was gay or bi sexual and only described having contact with Matos McGreevey during the trysts .
He also said he never knew for sure if McGreevey was gay .
" I had heard the rumors in circles outside of work , " he said .
" In hindsight , there might have been light interest ( in me ) , but it did n't seem like he was gay .
It did en hance their sexual relationship hav ing me be a part of it . "
Neither of the McGreeveys re turned calls for comment .
Their lawyers declined to comment on Pedersen 's claims .
Pedersen , 29 , served as a driver and traveling aide for McGreevey during his gu bernatorial campaign and after he won office in 2001 .
McGreevey attended Pedersen 's graduation from Rutgers University in 2003 and Pe dersen accompanied the governor and others on a trip to China last year .
His assertions mark the latest broadside in a particularly public and searing divorce case that has brought back to life the seamy personal issues that erupted when McGreevey resigned almost four years ago .
Matos McGreevey alleges the onetime Woodbridge mayor duped her into marriage in 2000 to further his political career , and that she had no clue about his sexual preference until just before he resigned in August 2004 , when he announced he was gay and had an affair with an aide .
She has demanded full custody of their only child , Jacqueline , plus alimony and more than $ 600,000 in damages .
McGreevey has denied any fraud and , in court filings , countered that he fulfilled his du ties as husband because he gave his wife a child and companionship .
He has demanded equal time with their daughter .
A trial before state Superior Court Judge Karen Cassidy in Union County is scheduled to start in May .
Pedersen could be among the first witnesses to testify .
A Woodbridge resident , he be came embroiled in the case when Matos McGreevey asked the court for financial records and correspon dence between McGreevey , his partner Mark O'Donnell , and other friends , including Pedersen .
He gave a sealed deposition late last year .
Pedersen said he became friendly with the couple in 1999 , when McGreevey was preparing his second run for governor .
Pedersen , then 21 , said he often spent 12 hours a day accompanying McGreevey and became friendly with his girlfriend , Dina Matos , as well .
" The more we spend time with each other , the more we begin to trust each other with non-professional things , " he said .
" That rela tionship starts to progress , to transform into subtle hints , flirts . "
He described in detail the first Friday night encounter , which he said occurred sometime in 1999 and recurred " numerous times " over the ensuing months .
Then , Pedersen said , " Friday night specials developed into Saturday mornings . "
He said his sexual liaisons with the couple blossomed fully during a trip to Atlantic City , but that they stopped after McGreevey was elected governor in November 2001 .
McGreevey proposed to his wife during a 2000 trip to Montreal .
In her book , " Silent Partner , " Matos McGreevey wrote that she would not let Pedersen accompany them on the trip .
" She started talking about us three " in her book , Pedersen said .
" She should have continued it .
She should have told the truth about the three of us .
I am Dina 's Silent Partner . "
Pedersen 's revelations stand in stark contrast to the picture that has been painted in recent years by both McGreeveys .
In her memoir , Matos McGreevey says little about the sex life she had with her husband , except to say that it never gave her any reason to doubt he was straight .
" The sex was good , " Matos McGreevey wrote .
In his own memoir , McGreevey wrote of a moment in 2002 , two years after they were married , when Matos McGreevey directly asked him if he was gay .
The former governor wrote that he did not answer the question .
" I did n't have the nerve to tell my wife the truth , ' McGreevey wrote in " The Confession . "
" But instead I said nothing . "

Child traffickers are targeting the youngest and most vulnerable survivors of Burma 's catastrophic cyclone and two suspects have already been arrested , the UN said .
The children , among up to two million people struggling to survive without enough clean water , food or shelter in the aftermath of the storm , were approached last week in the main city Rangoon , it said .
" A broker came to a shelter and tried to recruit children , " said UNICEF 's chief child protection officer in Burma , Anne-Claire Dufay .
Interesting toy ,

In a panic , they tried to pull the plug .
It was too late : Skynet retaliated by launching millions of Lokulokus , pigs made out of a gelatinous plastic material that could be squashed against the floor , be completely destroyed , and magically regain their original shape in seconds .
And we got the proof , in video :
If this is not the most absurdly amazing toy I have ever seen , I do n't know what is .

TorrentFreak has received information which suggests that British police have made good on their claim that they would go after ex-users of OiNK .
Last week , several officers arrested at least one individual for the seeding of a single album .
It is believed police are in the process of arresting and questioning others .
When the OiNK tracker was shutdown in 2007 , a statement appeared on the site ’s homepage .
This time – and unusually for the UK – it would be the police investigating a file - sharing case , not some anti-piracy group flexing their muscles in civil action .
But even now , months after OiNK was shutdown , no - one – including OiNK admin Alan Ellis – has been charged with anything .
Would OiNK users really become a target for the police , despite the presumed civil status of sharing music on P2P networks ?
If so , why ?
Right from the start , there has been a concerted effort by various elements of the music industry to portray everyday citizens using OiNK – presumably including the likes of Trent Reznor – as hardened criminals out to ruin the industry .
At the time , BPI Chief Executive Geoff Taylor called OiNK a “ closed criminal network ” and unfortunately this type of comment set the general tone for many follow up news articles .
In reality , OiNK offered no music of its own but was the venue of an unofficial virtual party , where a limited number of people listened to music without fees or charges , in a modern take on pirate radio – but with a twist .
If people had some music to share with others then so much the better , they could bring it along , add it to the index ( and that ’s all OiNK was , an index ) and everyone could listen , to see if they liked it too .
Of all things , it was certainly not about money and a large proportion of the members would n’t even have considered that sharing music would result in police knocking on the door , any more than as a result of them using YouTube .
But knock they did .
Last week Cleveland Police arrested a user of OiNK in the Cheshire area , who was questioned and later released on police bail .
It is alleged that the individual – a normal user of the site who has no previous involvement with the police and no criminal convictions – uploaded a solitary album in early 2007 .
Furthermore , information suggests that the police will be arresting and interviewing more users in the course of this investigation but at this stage it is unclear exactly who they are targeting and why .
A one - off album uploader seems an unlikely target , particularly as legally in the UK , the fact that the album was allegedly pre-released – as opposed to released after retail – means little .
Going on previous cases , uploading ( sharing ) would be a civilly actionable offense – lawyers Davenport Lyons in the UK are happy to send out bills to those it claims uploaded its client ’s games and the police are n’t interested .
But for reasons no - one seems to fully understand , the police are involved in this case and have sent a car full of officers to make an arrest at the individual ’s place of work , all for sharing a few minutes of music .
Another issue up for debate is the big question mark sitting over the usefulness of site logs .
Stats are manipulated all the time for one reason or another and trackers have to rely on a user ’s torrent client reporting data correctly .
To be anywhere close to proving infringement it is necessary to track the transfer of data from within the swarm by directly receiving data from the uploader .
This is fairly trivial , does not require the site logs and importantly should ’ve been done at the time the album was uploaded .
Why there has been such a huge delay in taking further action is unknown .
Last year saw an unexplained shift in the way copyright actions are dealt with in the UK .
Out of nowhere , both OiNK and the popular TV - Links sites were taken down by police action where one would usually expect a civil lawsuit , leaving prominent legal experts intrigued as to the legal basis .
Uploading one album is not the world ’s most heinous crime , in fact , unless the UK legal system changed overnight , it ’s not a crime at all since there would ’ve been no commercial gain for the user .
So what route is this investigation taking ?
What is the significance of arresting this individual and investigating others over a seemingly small civil issue , and why has it taken so long to do so ?
As usual , there are more questions than answers .
The arrests have started , but it is unknown how many people are involved .
We contacted the Police department that was responsible for at least one arrest , however , they did not respond to our inquiries .
If you have any information , please contact Torrent Freak here , as we will post an update of the arrests later this weekend .
Preface
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere .
Martin Luther King Jnr
This is an important report .
It deals with our treatment of children in the most recent wave of boat people seeking refuge and a better life on our shores .
It does so in the knowledge that there is a tension created by the community expectation that the Government will defend Australia 's security while simultaneously upholding individual rights - the notion of the ' fairgo ' for all .
The report also challenges the argument that family unity within immigration detention centres is the only way that children 's ' best interests ' can be protected .
The findings of the report are the result of carefully balancing large volumes of solid evidence collected , mainly during 2002 , which was then interpreted in a cautious manner .
The Inquiry paid special attention to the principles of natural justice in reaching its conclusions .
The Inquiry greatly appreciates the time and effort put in by the large numbers of individuals and community organisations that made written and oral submissions to the Inquiry .
The Inquiry also thanks the Department of Immigration and Australasian Correctional Management for their assistance throughout the Inquiry .
However , I am especially grateful to those detainees , temporary protection visa holders and former staff members who generously shared their personal experiences with the Inquiry .
The primary focus of this report has been on the human rights that all children in Australia should enjoy .
The arrest , detention or imprisonment of a child shall be ... used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time .
Few people would disagree with these words from the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
In fact , most Australians would agree that all other options should be explored before a child is locked up .
The words from the Convention form the basis for the title of the report of the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention : A last resort ?
A last resort ?
talks about children who arrived in Australia to seek protection from despotic regimes like those of Iraq and Afghanistan where breaches of human rights were the norm .
Most of these children arrived with their
families , some were unaccompanied .
More than 92 percent of all children arriving by boat since 1999 have been recognised by Australian authorities to be refugees .
In the case of Iraqi children the figures are as high as 98 percent .
This means they left their homelands because they had little real choice .
Seeking asylum elsewhere was , for them , a last resort .
Yet , since 1992 , we have welcomed these children by taking them to remote facilities , detaining them there to wait for a visa .
Australia 's immigration policy makes the detention of these children the first and only option and it puts no limit on the time that they are held there .
Children wait in detention for months or years - one child spent almost five and a half years in detention before being released into the community as a refugee .
In fact , as at the end of 2003 , the majority of children in detention had been held there for more than two years .
This policy seems a complete departure from the principle of detention as a measure of last resort .
Australians do n't need a team of experts or dramatic media stories to convince them that detention centres are no place for children to grow up .
However , this Inquiry analysed evidence from an enormous number of sources in order to objectively assess whether this gut reaction was right .
The answer is conclusive even the best - run detention centre is no summer school or holiday resort .
In fact , they are traumatising places which subject children to enormous mental distress .
This confirms the need to ensure that children should only be locked up in this environment as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time .
The irony is that the long - term impact of this system on children is likely to be borne by Australian society as a whole , since almost all children in the detention centres eventually become members of the Australian community .
They will carry the effects of their experience with them throughout their lives .
However , even if we were to ignore these human rights concerns , what is the rationale for , or logic of , the current immigration detention system ?
Does this rationale withstand vigorous examination ?
Some have argued that mandatory detention is necessary to prevent floods of boat arrivals .
We must take a reality check here .
Even if we agree that between 1999 and 2002 the number of people arriving by boat was relatively significant , from a midrange time perspective the number of arrivals is small .
Over the past 14 years approximately 13,500 people have arrived by boat - this number of people would fill approximately 15 percent of the Melbourne Cricket Ground .
Compare this to the approximately 1.4 million new settlers who arrived in Australia over the same period .
In other words , ' boat people ' constituted roughly one per cent of our total intake over that period .
But even if these numbers were greater , the detention of one group of children to deter another group from coming to Australia raises the issue of the proportionality of our policy response .
Compare this with our treatment of children who commit a crime : such young offenders are only detained after prompt and careful consideration by a magistrate , the period of imprisonment is strictly limited and is reviewable at several levels .
Yet under our immigration laws , children who have not been accused of any crime are detained automatically and for indefinite periods and there is also no real opportunity to argue their case before an independent tribunal or court .
A comparison of the two regimes highlights the lack of proportionality of our immigration detention policy .
The international community must take into account the ' cause and effect ' nature of migratory movements when developing policies ; if one part of the globe is under pressure there is likely to be a corresponding increase in asylum seekers elsewhere .
The Australian experience with boat people is testimony to this reality .
People smugglers who risk children 's lives by taking them on a perilous voyage in an unseaworthy boat , should be appropriately dealt with through international policing co-operation .
However the answer to these issues lies more in international cooperation and planning than in the creation of ' fortress Australia ' .
Others have argued that in the post 9/11 - Bali world the terrorist threat requires a total embargo on unauthorised arrivals .
I am fully conscious of the threat posed by terrorism which , when all is said and done , represents the utter negation of human rights .
But in the case of boat people , these are the children who are the victims of the Saddam Hussein's of this world , not the perpetrators .
That is why most of them left their homes in the first place .
In any case , Dennis Richardson , the Director - General of ASIO , stated that not one person arriving by boat between 2001 and 2002 ' had received an adverse security assessment in terms of posing a direct or indirect threat to Australia 's security ' .
Finally , some have warned that without detention , children and families will disappear into the community and will not be available for removal if they are found not to be refugees .
This argument lacks supporting evidence and disregards the fact that , according to the Department 's own statistics , around 90 per cent of boat arrivals whether adult or child - are found to be genuine refugees .
While there is always some flight risk , since almost all children arriving by boat are given protection visas in the end , there seems little incentive for these refugees to go underground .
In any event , our domestic justice system deals with hundreds of children charged with a crime , who may also present a flight risk , but are released on bail .
We accept this system as a necessary hallmark of a ' civil society ' , yet fail to apply these principles to children seeking asylum in Australia .
Since the announcement of the Inquiry , there have been some positive measures to improve the environment in which children in detention live .
I commend the Department for introducing these changes without awaiting the formal outcome of this Inquiry .
The transfer of unaccompanied children to foster homes , increased access to education outside detention and the creation of residential housing projects are steps in the right direction - although the housing project still has the inherent weakness of restricting liberty and excluding fathers .
However , these measures ultimately represent a ' blu - tack ' approach to repairing a detention system that is fundamentally flawed .
While recognising the right of each country to protect its borders , I hope that A last resort ?
removes , once and for all , any doubts about the harmful effects of long term immigration detention on children .
It warns governments , in Australia and around the world , that mandatory , indefinite and unreviewable detention of children is no answer to the global issue of refugee movements .
Even if there is no child in detention when this report is tabled in Parliament , it is now time for our elected parliamentary representatives to amend our immigration legislation to ensure that it complies with Australia 's accepted human rights standards .
Let no child who arrives in Australia ever suffer under this system again .

Below , an open letter from more than 40 journalists lamenting the petty , nearly substance - free debate ABC hosted on Wednesday night in Philadelphia .
We the undersigned deplore the conduct of ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos and Charles Gibson at the Democratic presidential debate on April 16 .
The debate was a revolting descent into tabloid journalism and a gross disservice to Americans concerned about the great issues facing the nation and the world .
This is not the first Democratic or Republican presidential debate to emphasize gotcha questions over real discussion .
However , it is , so far , the worst .
For 53 minutes , we heard no question about public policy from either moderator .
ABC seemed less interested in provoking serious discussion than in trying to generate cheap - shot sound bites for later rebroadcast .
The questions asked by Mr. Stephanopoulos and Mr. Gibson were a disgrace , and the subsequent attempts to justify them by claiming that they reflect citizens ’ interest are an insult to the intelligence of those citizens and ABC ’s viewers .
Many thousands of those viewers have already written to ABC to express their outrage .
The moderators ’ occasional later forays into substance were nearly as bad .
Mr. Gibson ’s claim that the government can raise revenues by cutting capital gains tax is grossly at odds with what taxation experts believe .
Both candidates tried , repeatedly , to bring debate back to the real problems faced by ordinary Americans .
Neither moderator allowed them to do this .
We ’re at a crucial moment in our country ’s history , facing war , a terrorism threat , recession , and a range of big domestic challenges .
Large majorities of our fellow Americans tell pollsters they ’re deeply worried about the country ’s direction .
In such a context , journalists moderating a debate — who are , after all , entrusted with free public airwaves — have a particular responsibility to push and engage the candidates in serious debate about these matters .
Tough , probing questions on these issues clearly serve the public interest .
Demands that candidates make pledges about a future no one can predict or excessive emphasis on tangential “ character ” issues do not .
This applies to candidates of both parties .
She 's holding a warm cup o' Joe , so now 's the time to approach for a favor , at least according to new research suggesting when we hold warm objects we are more generous .

Editor ’s Note :
This article , originally published in 2013 , was updated in March 2016 to reflect the latest news , research and new facts .
1. Caffeine Can Kill You
( Image credit : Shutterstock )
Despite its known plusses , coffee can be deadly .
But you 'd have to drink 80 to 100 cups in a hurry , health experts say .
We advise not trying .
In September 2015 , the FDA warned of the dangers of powdered caffeine , a potent product that had recently burst into popularity .
2. Coffee Can Be Good For You
A plethora of separate studies in 2014 , 2015 and 2016 found coffee is good for your liver , may lower risk of heart attacks , might cut the risk of colon cancer and , as reported in the journal Circulation , one to five cups a day may generally reduce the risk of early death .
A study released in March , 2016 found coffee associated with a reduced risk of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
3. Caffeine Might Boost Female Sex Drive
It worked on rats anyway .
But researchers say in humans , coffee might enhance the sexual experience only among people who are not habitual users .
4. Caffeine Might Cut Pain
Moderate doses of caffeine — the equivalent of two cups of coffee — can cut post - gym muscle pain , a small study found .
But the research was done on people who were not regular coffee drinkers .
A study in 2012 found those who drink coffee before sitting down to work at a computer had less neck and shoulder pain .
There is not sufficient research , in big enough studies , to draw any firm conclusions on this possibility , however .
5. Caffeine Can Indeed Keep You Up at Night
( Image credit : Sleepless woman image via Shutterstock
Health experts advise avoiding coffee for 6 hours before bedtime , since the effects of caffeine can last hours .
A 2015 study found caffeine can confuse your body ’s internal clock , confusing the signals that tell you when to sleep .
Night shift workers may find coffee during work hours disrupts their daytime sleep , another study found .
Decaf coffee has caffeine !
6. Decaf Coffee Has Caffeine !

Hey , what ?!
Yep :
If you drink five to 10 cups of decaffeinated coffee , you could get as much caffeine as from one or two cups of caffeinated coffee , a study found .
7. Decaffeination Uses Chemicals
( Image credit : Zach Schroeder | Stock Xchng )
Beans are steamed , so that dissolved caffeine rises to the surface , where it is washed off using an organic solvent called methylene chloride .
8. Caffeine Is Not The Bitter Culprit
( Image credit : Morguefile.com )
Caffeine is not the main bitter compound in coffee .
Rather , the pungent perpetrators are antioxidants .
Next Up : It 's all in the roasting
9. Great Coffee Depends on Roasting and Brewing
( Image credit : sxc.hu )
When it comes to great flavor , coffee chemistry boils down to roasting and brewing .
During roasting , oil locked inside the beans begins to emerge at around 400 degrees .
The more oil , the stronger the flavor .
Caffeine content goes up as the water spends more time in contact with the grounds , so regular coffee often has more of it than espresso or cappuccino .
Darker roasts also yield more caffeine .
Finally :
Why goats are so important ( really ! )
10 . Coffee Was Discovered by Goats
A millennium ago on a mountainside in Africa , a herd of goats kept a shepherd up at night after feasting on red coffee berries .
The shepherd took his animals ' discovery to some monks , and very long prayer sessions ensued .
It 's a good story , anyway .
Bonus facts , since you made it all the way : A study shows that Americans get most of their antioxidants from their daily fix of java .
One to two cups a day appear to be beneficial .
Or , if you do n't like coffee , you could try black tea , the second most consumed antioxidant source .
Bananas , dry beans , and corn wrap up the top five .
Double bonus fact :
Yes , coffee can help you poop , but scientists do n’t really know why !
1 Asahi’s Beer Pouring Robot
Here ’s a match made in heaven : beer and robots .
For most of the world , it ’s a match we are left to simply dream of ( you know , slave bots bringing you a cold one , instead of the usual “ Get it yourself ! ” )
What do these lovely creatures do ?
Well , aside from stocking and cooling up to six cans of beer and two mugs , upon the press of a button , the machine will open up a can , and pour in into the mug with a perfect head every time .
2 PC Beer Dispenser
If a beer dispensing case mod is not the most incredible and delicious hack known to man , then we do n’t know what is .
3 Beer Launcher Fridge
Here ’s a do - it - yourself project where a guy has taken a small refrigerator and equipped it for automatic beer tossing .
Constructed for “ several hundred dollars , ” John W. Conwell ’s ‘s Beer - Launching Fridge consists of three limit switches , a 10 - beer - holding magazine that looks like it came out of a soft drink machine along with a few other assorted parts , and it ’s all controlled by a keyless entry system .
The result ?
It ’ll toss a beer to you 13 feet away , and it ’s perfectly accurate every time .
Even though that beer might have developed quite a head on it by the time it reaches your hands , it ’s still one clever piece of machinery .
4 The Booze Belt : beer supply for the handy man
You might remember a little show called Home Improvement , where Tim “ The Tool Man ” Taylor would always have his nondetachable tool belt with him at all times .
This is like the same thing , but for violent alcoholics .
The Booze Belt insures a constant supply of brew right at your fingertips .
It ’s the closest thing to intravenously pouring it into your system … but with none of those painful needles around !
5 Tinchilla : Cool Your Beer Cans in 60 Seconds
For those with no patience , the Tinchilla can chill a can of cola or beer 240 times faster than the average fridge , or in 60 seconds .
It works with the help of a little thermal conduction .
The Tinchilla will suspend the can around ice and cold water and begin spinning the can .
The ice and water inside will constantly be in contact with the can during spinning .
After the process is complete crack the can open ( it wo n’t spray because of the spinning , supposedly ) and enjoy .

6 R/C Cooler : Brings The Beer To You
There ’s something about summer that seems to bring out the lazy person in all of us .
When it ’s beautiful outside , there ’s little more that you want to do than sit out and enjoy the weather .
Unfortunately it gets warm out there , and you need to keep hydrated with a cool drink or two .
Rather than getting up to go get something , or even keeping a cooler sitting next to you , why not get a remote controlled cooler ?
This little cooler might not hold the most beer of any other in town , but it ’s likely the most convenient .
You can have it filled with six cans of your favorite drink , and call it over from 30 - feet away with the remote .
When it ’s empty just send it back inside and have someone refill it for you .
If you ’re truly lazy , then we ’re sure it will be a $ 70 well spent .
7 USB Cooler
When you have a big , drunken weekend planned , you want to get to the fun as soon as possible .
This USB beverage cooler will help get the party started even before you leave your desk on Friday …
Over the past few weeks , Georgia and Russia have traded accusations over the downing of Georgian drones .
Now , the Russian Ministry of Defense is claiming that military assistance to Georgia is destabilizing the region .
The Russian - language page " On military help for Georgia from other countries " details Georgia 's outside assistance ; the United States , not surprisingly , is the largest contributor , providing training and equipment for several years now .
Perhaps more interesting are details on Israel sales to Georgia of Hermes - 450 and Skylark unmanned aerial vehicles .
( Georgia 's Hermes - 450 drones are the ones that were shot down in recent weeks ; though how many drones were taken out is in dispute . )
Russia claims all this military help is to enable Georgia to force a military settlement on the breakaway region of Abkhazia .
( That 's an interesting claim considering Russia 's ongoing involvement with Abkhazia . )
Curiously , the page is in Russian only ; the English language version of the Russian Ministry of Defense site has only this recent press release about Georgia , claiming that the Russian Air Force " never shot down a Georgian surveillance drone . "
There is , however , one small kernel of truth in what is otherwise a rather self - serving argument :
In 2002 , when the U.S. began providing military assistance and training to Georgia , both the Washington and Tblisi claimed there was evidence of Al Qaeda hiding out in Georgia 's Pankisi region ( similarly , there were articles , like this one in Time , titled " Inside Al - Qaeda 's Georgia Refuge " ) .
Those early claims appear to have evaporated , however .
In 2006 , the Dallas Morning News ran an article repeating what many have come to believe in the years since : there never really was credible evidence of Al Qaeda in Georgia .
The article quote a Tbilisi - based analyst saying : " I personally would not link al - Qaeda with Pankisi in any way whatsoever . "
That said , there are perfectly legitimate reasons for the United States and other countries to provide assistance to Georgia , an independent country .
And Georgia has the right to seek military assistance – and alliances – with countries like the United States .

The Dalai Lama has spoken out against the violence in March Chinese officials and representatives of the Dalai Lama ended day - long talks without a breakthrough but agreed to more talks , Chinese state media say .
The two sides would to hold further dialogue at " an appropriate time " , Xinhua news agency reported .
The meeting - in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen - was the first since violent protests by Tibetans in March .
Beijing says the Dalai Lama incited the violence .
He denies this and accuses the government of human rights abuses .
The two Chinese delegates " answered patiently " questions raised by the two representatives of the Dalai Lama , Xinhua said .
But they told the representatives that recent unrest had created " new obstacles " to dialogue , it added .
The US welcomed the meeting .
" We have long encouraged the resumption of a dialogue between Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama , " said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
" We hope discussions can lead to better understanding . "

Q&A : Tibet and China Key events in Tibet unrest
The two sides have met several times since 2002 , but without any concrete results .
The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government - in - exile have been based in India since fleeing Tibet in 1959 , nine years after China sent troops into the region to enforce a territorial claim .
Anti-China protests led by Buddhist monks began in Lhasa on 10 March this year and gradually escalated into rioting .
China says at least 19 people were killed by the rioters - but Tibetan exiles say dozens of people were killed by the Chinese security forces as they moved to quell the unrest .
The unrest was the worst in the region in 20 years .
After the riots , pro-Tibetan protesters threw China 's global Olympic torch relay into disarray as it passed through several cities , including London , Paris and San Francisco .
The Dalai Lama has repeated his position that he wants increased autonomy for Tibet within China , not independence .

04/11/2008 Source : Carbonyte Carbonyte UK , creator of the world ’s first Ferrari ‘ limousine ’ has unveiled its latest canny conversion – the world ’s only stretched Smart Car , the Carbonyte Smaaart .
The Carbonyte team , led by MD and ex-McLaren man Chris Wright , took a Mercedes Benz Smart Fortwo and stretched its chassis by 2700 mm , to create a 17 feet vehicle ( 5100 mm ) .
Despite growing to over twice its normal length ( 2695 mm ) , the Smaaart ’s new lightweight alloy chassis allows the vehicle to be powered by its original 600 cc engine and still comfortably reach motorway speeds of 80 mph .
In all , the build process took just 300 man hours over four weeks from the initial chassis cut to the final paintwork .
The prototype Smaaart has been designed as a promotional vehicle , featuring a 20:1 scale fibre - glass replica soft drinks can , complete with ring - pull , which serves as van - like storage space for promotional items .
The Smaaart can be liveried to any client ’s design choice and hired on a daily basis – or bespoke vehicles can be manufactured for individual clients to lease or purchase outright at a projected cost of around £ 25,000 , with almost any theme in the centre .
Carbonyte is also looking to take the Smaaart into the funeral industry by using the latest electric technology to produce an individual yet environmentally - friendly hearse .
“ We think the Smaaart will make a great promotional vehicle – combining head - turning looks with the practicality of a van .
We ’ve already had incredible reactions on the road – the vehicle ’s almost stopped traffic , in fact the same reaction we had with the stretched Ferrari , ” said Chris Wright .

The new Zunes have a familiar design
The players - which come in 4GB , 8GB and 80 GB models - have wi-fi so users can automatically download music , photos , and video from their computer .
Microsoft is also launching a social networking site dubbed Zune Social to allow users to display and share music .
Last year Microsoft sold 1.2 million Zunes compared to 100 million iPods shifted since its launch in 2001 .
The new players go on sale in the US in mid-November .
There are no details yet as to when they will be released in Europe .
They will be priced at $ 149 ( £ 73 ) , for the 4GB player , $ 199 ( £ 97 ) for the 8GB player and $ 249 ( £ 122 ) for the 80 GB player .
It comes with a familiar circular touch - sensitive navigation button .
New songs
Bill Gates said the new players will take some years to bed in
Analysts are not convinced that the new - look Zunes will allow Microsoft to close the gap on Apple any time soon .
" This device with the all - too - familiar dial wheel compares reasonably favourably with last generation iPod players , " said Mark Mulligan , analyst with Jupiter Research .
" Microsoft needs to come at Apple from an unexpected angle but at the moment it is Apple with its new iPod touch and nanos that is shaking up the market , " he said .
According to data from the NPD Group , Apple controls over 80 % of the digital media player market with SanDisk in second place with 5.8 % and Microsoft in third , with 4.4 % .
Microsoft said at the launch of the new Zunes that it expected the devices to take three to four years to bed in and become a legitimate rival to Apple .
" Twenty years ago we bet the company on an integrated productivity suite of word processing , spreadsheets and presentations , and we changed the way people work , " Bill Gates said at the launch .
" Today we 're making big bets on games , music , video and connecting these entertainment experiences to help change the way people play , " he added .
The company also said that it would add more than one million MP3 songs free of digital rights management onto Marketplace , its digital music store which currently sells music videos and offers video podcasts free .
There were no more details about what music would be available .
Fuel price protests spread across Europe
By Kumaran Ira and Alex Lantier
2 June 2008
Growing anger over soaring fuel prices has prompted a wave of strikes and demonstrations across Europe that is fast becoming a major political crisis for the European bourgeoisie .
After fishermen in France went on strike , their counterparts in Portugal , Spain , and Italy began indefinite nationwide work stoppages on May 30 to protest against soaring oil prices .
Truck drivers , farmers , taxi drivers and ambulance workers across the continent also staged protests .
The rapid increase in oil prices internationally has affected industries such as fishing , trucking , and agriculture as well the life of ordinary people around the world .
Over the last five years , average prices per litre have increased by between 50 and 100 percent in most parts of Europe .
The French fishermen ’s strikes lasted for more than two weeks in May .
Fishermen in Spain , Italy and Portugal called for an indefinite strike last week , demanding government action to bring down fuel prices and grant subsidies to bridge the gap between high fuel costs and low prices for fish .
Fishing employs some 400,000 people in the EU and is particularly important in Spain , France , Italy and Portugal .
In France the cost of a litre of shipping fuel has risen from € 0.45 to € 0.70 in six months .
Though the French government has agreed to grant temporary fuel subsidies to get fishermen back to work , they continued their protests on Friday as a sign of solidarity with their European colleagues .
Oil refineries and storage facilities at Fos -sur - mer were occupied by fishermen on Friday .
Fishermen in Arcachon , Cherbourg , and Saint - Brieuc have voted to continue strike action .
On May 30 in Spain , which has the largest fishing fleet in Europe , trawlers and larger commercial boats remained docked across the country ; 5,000 demonstrators converged on Madrid and handed out 20 tons of fish for free .
The Associated Press wrote : “ The Spanish fishing confederation — which comprises 1,400 fishing companies employing 20,000 workers — says the crisis is the worst in a century .
It estimates fuel prices have gone up 320 percent in the past five years and claims many fishermen can no longer afford to take their boats out . ”
“ People ca n’t take it any more and are protesting because governments and the ( European ) Commission are not taking action , ” Javier Garat , the secretary general of the Spanish fishermen ’s federation Cepesca told Reuters .
“ In the next two weeks , I ’m convinced that there will be a widespread stoppage .
I expect that the European fleet will be tied up for the next 15 - 20 days . ”
In Italy , thousands more fishermen went on strike , shutting down the industry on both of Italy ’s coasts .
Nationwide 2,000 fishermen , or roughly a third of the national total , took part in the strike .
One fisherman told Italian television : “ If we do n’t get any results it will be open war .
We are tired , we are tired of working 80 hour weeks without earning a penny . ”
In Portugal , the large majority of fishermen went on strike .
“ Not a single boat has gone out , ” Antonio Macedo , leader of the national federation of fishing unions , told Agence France Presse .
The newly - formed Vigilance Committee of French Fishermen announced yesterday that French , Italian , Spanish , and Portuguese fishermen would travel together to demonstrate in Brussels on Wednesday and demand that EU authorities keep the price of shipping fuel at € 0.40 per litre .
The Committee ’s spokesman , Alain Rico , told Le Nouvel Observateur : “ The Italians and Portuguese have agreed to it , the Spanish will confirm on Tuesday but they agree in principle .
We have launched an appeal to all French ports for boats to stay docked or return to port , and for crews to travel to Brussels . ”
Demonstrations against costly fuel are rapidly spreading beyond the fishing sector , to include farmers and drivers in trucking and public transport .
In France , farmers blocked oil depots all over the country last week , including those near Toulouse , Sète , Frontignan and Marseille .
Thousands of farmers demonstrated in Lille on May 28 .
The oil depot in Villette - Vienna and two depots south of Dijon remained blocked yesterday by farmers , after riot police used tear gas and baton charges to clear blockades erected by farmers at the Toulouse depot and by fishermen at the Fos - sur - mer facility .
As with fishermen , dairy farmers throughout Europe are on strike .
Their basic complaint is the same as the fishermen : they are trapped between high energy costs and low prices paid by supermarkets and other food retailers .
There was panic buying of milk as farmers in Germany , Denmark , Holland , Belgium , and France fed their milk to calves or sprayed it over their fields as fertilizer , to protest low prices for milk .
One German farmer told the British Guardian : “ Our production costs are rising all the time .
If we do n’t want to incur losses , we need to be receiving at the very minimum € 0.33 per litre , but in spite of rising costs for feed , fertiliser , and energy , we ’re getting only € 0.30 . ”
Truck and taxi drivers have staged protests in several countries with more strikes planned in coming days .
On May 27 , Hundreds of British truck drivers blocked streets in central London , demanding government help over rising fuel prices .
French truck drivers staged a “ go - slow ” demonstration on major highways near Paris and in other parts of the country last week .
Truck , bus , and taxi drivers held protests in Bulgaria and blocked the main ring road around the capital , Sofia .
Bitter disagreements have emerged inside the EU over how to deal with the crisis , as several governments directly hit by protests have made calls for Europe - wide action to combat price increases .
On May 27 , Portuguese Economy Minister Manuel Pinho called for an emergency debate on fuel prices at the EU .
On the same day , French President Nicolas Sarkozy gave an unusual , hour - long morning interview on RTL radio and proposed an EU - wide reduction in value - added taxes ( VAT ) on fuel .
He faced sceptical questions from the interviewers , who pointed out that this would cut a major source of state revenue — at a time when France faces criticism inside EU for its budget deficit , which will not be balanced until 2012 , as opposed to 2009 as Sarkozy initially promised .
This proposal met firm opposition from other European governments , especially those less affected by the strikes .
The Slovenian government , which currently holds the rotating EU presidency , refused to call an emergency meeting as requested by Pinho .
Austrian Finance Minister Wilhelm Molterer warned of the long - term effect tax cuts would have on state revenues , asking : “ What will you do when prices fall again , reintroduce the tax ?
I ’d like to hear the political discussions then ! ”
The European Commission noted that tax cuts would signal to oil - producing countries and oil companies that European states were willing to absorb rising gas prices by cutting taxes and running higher budget deficits .
Its spokesperson said : “ Modifying the fiscality of fuel to fight the rise in oil prices would send a very bad signal to oil - producing countries .
We would be saying that [ they ] can raise oil prices and this will be paid for by the taxes of Europeans .
This would , in principle , be a very bad signal that we do not want to send . ”
At stake is the global division of the massive revenues generated by fuel sales in Europe .
Currently , the lion ’s share of these revenues goes to European governments , who collectively raise hundreds of billions of euros in fuel taxes .
In the UK in 2007 , fuel taxes raised £ 30.5 billion and accounted for 68 percent of prices at the pump .
In France in 2006 , taxes accounted for 70 percent of fuel prices at the pump and raised € 33.2 billion , or 13 percent of the national government ’s revenues .
Gasoline is taxed as heavily or more in most other countries of the euro - zone : € 602.3 per kiloliter in France , versus € 564 in Italy , € 654.5 in Germany , and € 664.9 in the Netherlands in March 2008 .
An agreement by European governments to cut taxes would potentially leave oil markets the option of further jacking up prices , thus distributing revenues away from the European governments and towards oil company profits and the revenues of oil - producing countries .
Oil companies are already realizing record profits thanks to high prices — with British firms Shell and BP realizing an extraordinary £ 7.2 billion in profits in the first quarter of 2008 , and France ’s Total announcing € 3.6 billion in profits over the same period .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican ’s chief astronomer says there is no conflict between believing in God and in the possibility of “ extraterrestrial brothers ” perhaps more evolved than humans .

“ In my opinion this possibility ( of life on other planets ) exists , ” said Rev. Jose Gabriel Funes , a 45 - year - old Jesuit priest who is head of the Vatican Observatory and a scientific adviser to Pope Benedict .
“ How can we exclude that life has developed elsewhere , ” he told the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano in an interview in its Tuesday - Wednesday edition , explaining that the large number of galaxies with their own planets made this possible .
Asked if he was referring to beings similar to humans or even more evolved than humans , he said : “ Certainly , in a universe this big you ca n’t exclude this hypothesis ” .
In the interview headlined “ The extraterrestrial is my brother , ” he said he saw no conflict between belief in such beings and faith in God .
“ Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth , there can be other beings , even intelligent , created by God .
This is not in contrast with our faith because we ca n’t put limits on God ’s creative freedom , ” he said .
“ Why ca n’t we speak of a ‘ brother extraterrestrial ’ ?
It would still be part of creation , ” he said .
Funes , who runs the observatory which is based south of Rome and in Arizona , held out the possibility that the human race might actually be the “ lost sheep ” of the universe .
“ There could be ( other beings ) who remained in full friendship with their creator , ” he said .
THE “ BIG BANG ” ?
Christians have sometimes been at odds with scientists over whether the Bible should be read literally and issues such as creationism versus evolution have been hotly debated for decades .
The Inquisition condemned astronomer Galileo in the 17th century for insisting that the earth revolved around the sun .
The Catholic Church did not rehabilitate him until 1992 .
Funes said dialogue between faith and science could be improved if scientists learned more about the Bible and the Church kept more up to date with scientific progress .
Funes , an Argentine , said he believed as an astronomer that the most likely explanation for the start of the universe was “ the big bang ” , the theory that it sprang into existence from dense matter billions of years ago .
But he said this was not in conflict with faith in God as a creator .
“ God is the creator .
There is a sense to creation .
We are not children of an accident ... , ” he said .
“ As an astronomer , I continue to believe that God is the creator of the universe and that we are not the product of something casual but children of a good father who has a project of love in mind for us , ” he said .

· Santa Cruz distances itself from capital and Morales · Poll echoes hostility to indigenous communities
Bolivia was locked in political crisis yesterday after Santa Cruz province declared autonomy and renounced the leftwing policies of President Evo Morales .
Another three provinces are expected to follow suit over the coming weeks in an open but so far peaceful rebellion which could cripple the federal government , a leading member of South America 's so - called pink tide .
Santa Cruz , the richest province in the continent 's poorest country , voted overwhelmingly to distance itself from the capital , La Paz , in a referendum yesterday .
The indigenous majority based in the western highlands still supports the government .
Complete results were not expected for several more days , but early official tallies from Santa Cruz , an opposition stronghold , said more than 84 % had voted for autonomy , underlining the polarisation .
Turnout was put at 64 % .
" Today we begin in Santa Cruz a new republic , a new state , " the prefect , Rubén Costas , told a victory rally .
" Today in Santa Cruz democracy has triumphed .
With your vote , we have begun the most transcendental reform in national memory . "
Pro-autonomy supporters draped in the province 's green - and - white flag celebrated under palm trees into the night .
The province stopped short of secession , but demanded the right to raise taxes , run a police force , protect land rights and control some revenues from its gas fields .
The vote also expressed hostility to the government 's championing of indigenous communities which scrabble for survival in the highlands , a very different Bolivia to Santa Cruz and the relatively prosperous eastern lowlands .
Morales , the country 's first indigenous president , used to be a llama herder , coca farmer and trade union leader .
" My family is voting for autonomy because the Indians want to dominate us , " said Olga Tordolla , a woman in a largely indigenous quarter of Santa Cruz city known as Plan Tres Mil .
" They are racist , they hate white people . "
The federal government rejected the referendum as an " illegal survey " and an attempt by greedy , paler - skinned Bolivians to continue the social and economic exclusion of indigenous people which dates back to the Spanish conquest .
In a televised address Morales , who had urged a boycott , said abstentions and reported incidents of fraud rendered the result illegitimate .
" The referendum failed completely , " he said .
The president thanked indigenous communities for sporadic protests yesterday , some of which turned violent , reportedly leaving one dead and 25 injured .
" I want to express my respect for the people of Santa Cruz for their resistance against this separatist referendum .
The people are wise to defend legality , constitutionality and the struggle for equality between Bolivians . "
With another three eastern states - Beni , Pando and Tarija - due to hold autonomy votes next month the scene would seem to be set for serious convulsions which could split the country .
His sidekick would be called “ Bacon - Bit . ”
Today ’s guest comic comes from Adam Levermore - Rich and C.A. Bridges from the comic “ Save Hiatus . ”
Save Hiatus is about a group of friends who just lost their favorite scifi show due to premature cancellation .
Sound familiar ?
If your coat is even the slightest bit brown , you will enjoy it .
You may also cry after unearthing repressed memories of petitions , and forums , and letter writing campaigns .
It ’s Ok .
Let it out .
It ’s good to cry .
Definitely check out their site and tell those guys thanks for helping me out in a big way .
Thank you all ( readers and comic contributors ) for allowing me this time to spend with my family .
New comics will be back on Monday .
Sunday , May 11th , is the 1 year anniversary of HijiNKS Ensue .
That ’s pretty cool , I guess .
Economist challenges government data PROFILE : John Williams

Oakland economist John Williams does n't seem like the kind of guy to pick fights with the government .
He 's slow moving and soft spoken , conservative in politics and personal habits , a pale and portly 59 - year - old who favors Oxford shirts , Rep ties and sensible shoes .
Williams is the sort who pays his taxes on time , waits when the signal says " Do n't Walk " and snaps to attention when the national anthem is played .
But do n't be fooled .
The New Jersey native is leading a one - man crusade to expose official economic data as grossly misleading at best and , at worst , a pack of lies .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
His Shadow Government Statistics Web site ( shadowstats.com ) has become a magnet for those convinced that official data put a happy - talk gloss on the nation 's economy .
The growing popularity of the site , which costs subscribers $ 175 a year , is testimony to the deep suspicion many Americans harbor about government information as the economy falls into a swoon .
" There 's something wrong with the numbers , " said ShadowStats subscriber Harry Seitz , a retiree in Davie , Fla .
" Over the years , ( Williams ) has essentially been proven correct . "
By Williams ' estimation , the government 's calculation that unemployment was 5 percent in April and that inflation was 4 percent and economic growth 2 percent over the last year , is fantasy .
It might even be disinformation .
An update e-mailed to ShadowStats subscribers at the beginning of the month warned darkly that " GDP ( gross domestic product ) and Jobs Data Appear Rigged " and " Despite Manipulated Data , the Recession Deepens . "
By his reckoning , the economy shrank 2.5 percent in the year that ended in March , unemployment is really 13 percent and year - over - year inflation is 7.5 percent .
Government economic data are " out of touch with common experience .
That 's why people used to believe the numbers but no longer do , " Williams said during an interview in his modest one - bedroom apartment near Lake Merritt .
ShadowStats , which started in 2004 , grew slowly at first , but has recently picked up momentum and now numbers subscribers in the " low thousands , " according to Williams .
They 're mostly individual and professional investors , including a fair share of conspiracy theorists and goldbugs , those who believe gold is the best place to put money because of supposedly imminent financial disaster .
Despite his gadfly role , Williams ' pedigree is mainstream .
A graduate of Dartmouth College , he once managed a family chain - saw import business .
He long ran an economic consulting firm that boasted Fortune 500 companies as clients , and he regularly appeared on television investment programs .
Mainstream is one thing he clearly no longer is .
Most experts scoff at his contention that economic data are grossly inaccurate .
And they say his claim that data are tampered with for political reasons is preposterous .
" The culture of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is so strong that it's not going to happen , " said University of Maryland Professor Katherine Abraham , who headed the agency that produces employment and inflation data during the Clinton administration .
Bureau bristles at charge
Steve Landefeld , director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the Commerce Department agency that prepares quarterly GDP reports , said in an e-mail that " the bureau rigorously follows guidelines designed to ensure its work remains totally transparent and absolutely unbiased . "
Indeed , it 's easy to write Williams off as a crank .
His views frequently veer toward the conspiratorial .
A Fox News interviewer once accused him of being a " grassy knoll theorist . "
He criticizes almost all the major changes made in data gathering and analysis in recent decades , most of which had wide support among experts of all political stripes .
" All of those methodological changes were made after academic economists did decades of research and said they should be done , " said UC San Diego economist Valerie Ramey , a member of the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee .
Still , even those who dismiss Williams concede he makes a few points worth considering .
Abraham rejects most of Williams ' arguments .
But , she said , " There may be grains of truth in some of what he 's saying . "
Williams produces his online newsletter in his living room , under the dour portraits of earlier generations of Williamses , one of whom was pilloried in London during the 18th century for publishing material that mocked the king .
Williams , who is divorced , moved to Oakland in October from New Jersey so he could be near his son .
According to Williams , government data are subject to two kinds of manipulation .
The first consists of technical changes in the way data are collected or interpreted .
These have been fully disclosed , discussed in advance and reviewed by outside experts .
" Although it might make academic sense , it does not reflect the real - world experience of ordinary people , " he argued .
" The effect over time is to give a more rosy scenario . "
For example , over the last 25 years , several technical changes have been made in the way the consumer price index is calculated :
--
In the 1980s , the Bureau of Labor Statistics switched from using house prices to equivalent rental prices in calculating homeowner inflation .
-- About a decade ago , the bureau shifted to a model in which consumers are assumed to switch some of their purchases within narrowly defined categories from items that have gone up in price to other items that have risen less , such as buying round steak instead of porterhouse .
--
The bureau has long adjusted prices for quality improvements .
If a product gets better or if useful features are added , its price is adjusted down .
Thus , with automobiles , additions such as antilock brakes have sometimes resulted in price decreases in calculating the CPI , even though the actual cost of cars went up .
In the late 1980s and 1990s , new quality - adjustment techniques were introduced for a range of products , including washers , dryers and televisions .
Each of these changes has had the effect of reducing the reported inflation rate , according to Williams .
The second kind of alleged manipulation is more sinister .
" It 's where a number is changed for specific political or financial market needs , " Williams said .
Williams said both Democratic and Republican administrations have carried out such trickery , citing supposed examples going back to President Lyndon Johnson .
He accused the current Bush administration of taking advantage of a switch to monthly instead of semiannual seasonal adjustment of job creation data to " bring the number in where they want it , " though he admitted he had no evidence .
Bureau officials said they were mystified by accusations that the agency falsifies data .
The 2003 shift to monthly seasonal adjustment of jobs data " was recognized statistically as a better way , " said Assistant Commissioner Patricia Getz .
In any case , she noted , payroll figures are matched once a year with tax records to produce an accurate tabulation of the number of jobs in the economy .
Williams arrives at his alternative GDP , employment and inflation statistics by reverse - engineering the data , backing out changes made over time .
In the same way that every change carried out by the government made the economy look rosier , each of Williams ' adjustments makes things appear worse .
Figure excludes the hopeless
With unemployment , for example , Williams takes the standard jobless rate - 5 percent in April - which consists of people who have looked for work within the last 30 days .
Then he adds in several other categories tabulated by the Labor Department , including those who say they have looked for a job in the last year but have given up and those who are working part - time but want a full - time job .
Finally , he throws in several million people who say they want work , but have n't looked in more than a year .
Voila - 13 percent unemployment .
His outlook has n't wavered over the years .
A 1989 USA Today article referring to Williams as a " gloom - and - doom economist " noted his prediction that the Dow Jones industrial average would crash below 1,500 by the end of that year .
It closed that year at 2,753 .
Most economists do n't buy Williams ' method of calculating unemployment .
In any case , they point out , the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the raw data , so all are free to use whatever measure they prefer .
When it comes to inflation , though , a few of Williams ' arguments get a sympathetic hearing , especially the idea that marking down prices for quality improvements does n't jibe with the way most people see inflation .
" If anything , the CPI understates inflation for the average household , " said Irwin Kellner , chief economist for the online investment news service MarketWatch .
" Car prices might be down 5 or 10 percent in the CPI , but in reality , when you go to the dealer , you 're paying more . "
And while there 's not much patience for Williams ' claim of outright falsification , the idea that politics influences government statistics is not entirely far - fetched .
In the 1990s , for example , Republicans wanted to make changes in calculating inflation along the lines recommended by a special commission , including more use of quality adjustments .
By lowering the official inflation rate , such changes promised to reduce the annual cost - of - living adjustments for Social Security and other federal programs .
Abraham , the Clinton bureau commissioner , remembers sitting in Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich 's office :
" He said to me , ' If you could see your way clear to doing these things , we might have more money for BLS programs . ' "
Barack Obama has dramatically narrowed Hillary Clinton 's lead in the superdelegate race , after winning a slew of endorsements in the last week .
The Illinois senator picked up four in the past seven days , pulling to within 30 of Hillary Clinton 's lead , according to an Associated Press tally .
As the Democratic primary season nears its end game , the competition for the superdelegates , who cast votes at the August nominating convention , becomes even more critical to the candidates ' chances of victory .
Obama has steadily been eating into her lead .
In December , according to an Associated Press tally , Clinton led Obama by 106 superdelegates .
In February , her lead had been cut to 87 .
Now she leads by only 30 .
Obama leads in the overall delegate count , with 1,634 to Clinton 's 1,500 .
A total of 2,024 needed to win .
But neither he nor Clinton , a New York senator , can clinch the nomination solely on the votes of the pledged delegates awarded in proportion to the results of the state contests .
About 255 of the 794 superdelegates have yet to publicly commit to a candidate .
Those include party leaders like Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , and former vice president and Nobel Prize winner Al Gore .
Former president Jimmy Carter has n't stated a definite preference , but signalled recently he would back Obama .
Since last Friday , Pennsylvania senator Bob Casey Jr , Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar , Wyoming governor Dave Freudenthal and former US senator John Melcher , a Democratic national committeeman from Montana , joined Obama 's corner .
Clinton 's last major superdelegate announcement came on March 18 , when powerful Pennsylvania congressman John Murtha gave her his nod .
Beginning in February , Obama racked up a string of victories in state contests , and with that momentum attracted more superdelegate endorsements than Clinton .
Although Clinton is ahead in opinion polls in Pennsylvania , where Democrats head to the polls on April 22 , she must now deal with the possibility that superdelegates who have committed to her will defect to the Illinois senator , particularly if he puts up a good fight in Pennsylvania .
" It 's a slow drip , drip , drip -- but it 's dripping the wrong way , " Joe Trippi , an advisor to former Democratic candidate John Edwards , told the Los Angeles Times .
" Psychologically , they 're playing defence with superdelegates , not offence . "
Georgia congressman John Lewis , an early Clinton backer , switched to Obama at the end of February .
Over the weekend , Clinton supporter Emanuel Cleaver , a Missouri congressman , told Candian radio that he would be " stunned if [ Obama ] is not the next president of the United States . ''
He insisted , however , that he would n't switch his allegiance .
The New York State Supreme Court has dealt a blow against Dell by ruling that the company and its affiliate , Dell Financial Services , engaged in fraud , false advertising , deceptive business practices , and abusive debt collection practices .
Justice Joseph Teresi ruled against the companies late last week , saying that Dell repeatedly misled customers and failed to live up to promises .
The monetary damages have yet to be determined , but New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said that Dell will eventually have to pay back customers .
The company will also have to turn over any " unlawfully earned " profits to the state .
" For too long at Dell the promise of customer service was a bait and switch that left thousands of people paying for essentially no service at all , " Cuomo said in a statement .
" We have won an important victory that will force Dell to live up to its responsibilities and pay back its customers for profits that were pocketed but not deserved .
This decision sends an important message that all corporations will be held accountable for the promises they make to consumers . "
The list of things that Dell did to deceive consumers is fairly long .
To start , the company lured in customers by running attractive promotions offering no-interest or no-payment financing options , but then only approved a very small percentage of those who applied ( only seven percent , according to the complaint submitted by Cuomo on behalf of New York residents , which is significantly lower than Dell 's typical approval rate ) .
That 's not all , though :
Dell did n't actually inform those who did n't qualify that they did n't qualify — in fact , the company even congratulated disqualified customers for qualifying — and instead signed them up for much less attractive financing rates behind their backs .
" Dell has engaged in prominently advertising the financing promotions in order to attract prospective customers with no intention of actually providing the advertised financing to the great majority of such customers .
Such conduct is deceptive and constitutes improper ' bait advertising , ' " wrote the judge in his decision ( PDF ) .
Next , Dell apparently engaged in deceptive and false advertising regarding its " next day " tech support service .
The company failed to disclose to customers that they needed to disassemble their machines on their own before such service could be provided — much more than any average consumer would be able to do properly .
Customers also complained of long hold times on the phone , frequent transfers to different departments , numerous disconnections , and the need for repeated calls .
In many cases , Dell refused to provide service because it had not yet determined which parts needed to be replaced over the phone ( due , in part , to customers ' inability to properly diagnose their own hardware after taking it apart ) .
Some customers complained that Dell eventually denied them service because their warranties had expired , even though they attempted to make the complaint before the expiration date .
Judge Teresi said that customers had sent affidavits saying that it took them weeks , months , and sometimes even years to receive Dell 's " next day " service .
The complaints go on .
Dell repeatedly refused to honor rebates in cases where customers submitted all of the required paperwork in a timely manner , reflecting an " alarming pattern , " according to the court .
Dell Financial Services also threatened numerous customers that it would report " late payments " to credit reporting agencies , even after customers had returned equipment to Dell for a refund .
Finally , DFS incorrectly billed customers for canceled orders in a number of cases .
" Dell has engaged in repeated misleading , deceptive and unlawful business conduct , including false and deceptive advertising of financing promotions and the terms of warranties , fraudulent , misleading and deceptive practices in credit financing and failure to provide warranty service and rebates , " concluded Teresi in his decision .
Dell , of course , maintains that it is committed to providing the best possible customer service .
The company also disagreed that the findings were as widespread as Cuomo would have us believe .
" We are confident that when the proceedings are finally completed , the court will determine that only a relatively small number of customers have been affected , " Dell spokesperson Jess Blackburn told CNN .

非常に頑張って欲しいので、ブログに書くことにしました。
今、中３で将来プログラム関係の仕事就きたいのですが 英語が苦手でプログラムを書くときのC言語(英語の部分)に四苦八苦しています。
そんな私でも頑張ったらプログラム関係につけますか?
英語は必要ではな い
現在は、C言語を勉強するのに英語はあまり必要ではありません。 今向き合っているC言語は、英単語が多く含まれているかも知れませんが、それは英語ではなくCという言語です。
英語よりもずっと素直で可愛い奴です。
恐らく、C言語の関数や構文に含まれる単語等を覚えるのが大変であるという意味だと思います。
確かに使い慣れないアルファベットが羅列してある物を扱うのはわかりにくいだろうと思います。
ただ、C言語よく利用する関数等はある程度決まっているので、英語の勉強ほど覚える単語数は多くありません。
そのため、ちょっと書き続ければ、苦労した時期が嘘のようにC言語の単語を覚えてしまうだろうと思います。
今は多少苦しいかも知れませんが、すぐに慣れます。
プログラム関係の仕 事
頑張ればプログラミング関連の仕事に就けます。 頑張ってください。
ただ、 「プログラミング関連の仕事に就くぞー！」といって気合を入れるよりも、書いて楽しい事や、やって楽しい事を発見してください。
そうすれば、自ずと自分の強みを作っていけると思います。
楽しい事は没頭できます。 没頭できる勉強は、勉強ではなく遊びになります。
( 他人から見ると勉強に没頭しているように見えるかも知れません。)
最初設定したゴールというのは時間と共に変化するものです。
当初はプログラマを目指していたのが、やっぱり違うものが目標になるかも知れません。
私も最初はテレビゲームが大好きで、ゲームプログラマになりたいと思ってプログラミングの勉強を始めました。
最初は単に画面上に線を描いたり、していました。
そのうち、簡単なレイトレーシングをするプログラムを書いてみたり、ビデオをネットワーク経由で転送してみたくなったり、マルチキャストに興味を持ったり、徐々にゲームとは違う方向に進んでいきました。
目標が変わったとしても、プログラムを書いた事があるという経験は必ず生かされるはずです。
プログラムを書くときに必要になる「考え方」は非常に有益です。
今のうちから経験できれば、将来の財産になると思います。
英語が必要になるこ と
20年前ならば、英語が出来なければプログラミングの勉強で苦労したかもしれません。
それは日本語で書かれた資料が非常に少なかったからです。
当時は、非常に基礎的な本はちらほらあっても、ちょっとした事をしようとすると途端に英語になったりということが普通にあったと思われます。
また、少年少女向けに簡単に解説した日本語の本は、今と比較すると非常に少なかったと思われます。
今は各種プログラミングの本が容易に入手できます。
価格も非常に手頃になっています。 「 プログラミングの勉強をしたい」と言えば本を購入してくれる親も多いと思います。
英語が本当に必要になるのは、日本語の文献が少なくなるほど専門的な分野に足を踏み入れ始めてからです。
( 最先端過ぎて日本語の本が出ていないという場合もあります。)
そこまで深入りした頃には、プログラミングに関してはある程度の知識が身に付いているはずです。
そうすれば、英語自体がある程度わからなくても、技術は知っているという状態が出来上がるので、英語で書いてある内容も理解しやすくなると思います。
英語は大の苦手だが、自分の専門分野に関する英文ならば理解できるという人は意外と多い気がしています。
英語が必要になるところまで学生時代に行けると幸せ
「 英語がないとプログラムを書くのに困る」という状態まで、学生のうちに行けると非常に幸せだと思われます。
何故ならば「英語が必要」になるからです。
受験のためだけに嫌々勉強していたかもしれない「英語」という科目が急に有益なものに見えるかも知れません。
多くの場合、学校を卒業した後に授業で習っていた事の重要性に気がつきます。
学生の間に心から特定の科目を勉強する意味を理解できることは恐らく幸せなのだと思います。
なお、英語ではなく数学や物理が勉強したくなったりすることもあるかも知れません。
頑張ってくださ い
未来のエンジニア様、頑張ってください！！！

Bookstores merchandise most books with the spine facing out .
Only new releases and best - sellers get the front - face treatment .
Merchandising books with the spine facing out allows the retailer to stock more books .
However , front - facing books gives a book greater visibility and results in higher sales .
Borders recently tested a front - facing display strategy where more books were stocked with their covers , not spines , facing customers .
Sales increased by 9.0 % .
The strategy was so successful , all Borders bookstores will be switching to the front - facing strategy in the next couple of weeks .
The drawback to a front - facing strategy is Borders will have to reduce its inventory by 5 % - 10 % .
This means the typical Borders store will reduce its inventory anywhere from 4,700 books to 9,300 books .
Execs at Borders are n’t too concerned about the loss of inventory since many of the books they stock only sell one copy per year .
On the other hand , Barnes & Noble has no intentions of reducing its inventory of books .
( The typical Barnes & Noble stocks 125,000 to 150,000 at its stores . )
Borders did some customer research at its front - facing prototype store and learned customers perceived Borders as having more books , not fewer , with this new display strategy .
( Interesting . )
Bold move by Borders .
We ’ll have to see if this works in the short - term AND the long - term .

‘ It ’s Not Funny ’ How Funny This Is
Learning English is difficult and sometimes we are tempted to laugh at the mistakes of someone who is trying to learn it .
It is normally considered rude to laugh at someone , but in this case it is Japanese comedians laughing at another Japanese man who has difficulty reading basic English .
Of course , they still make sure that the people understand how wrong it is to laugh at someones mistake , as they beat each of the comedians that laugh at the poor guy .
Watch as some of Japan ’s biggest comedians try their best to avoid punishment and not laugh at the man reading English texts .

The region has been hit by concerns over a US slowdown and rising risk aversion in the wake of the US sub prime mortgage crisis , with many investors seeing Asian markets as a high beta play on US Growth .
Foreign investors have consequently sold down Asia aggressively as a way to reduce risk in their portfolios .
Rising inflation has also negatively affected Asian equity markets .
Inflation , especially food inflation , is now at multi- year highs in most Asian countries , with inflation numbers in China , India and Indonesia particularly high .
The possibility of further monetary tightening around the region and the impact of rising input prices on corporate profitability have to be monitored closely .
Finally , valuations had begun to look stretched , sparking some profit taking .
After a 40 % run in 2007 , Asia ex Japan started 2008 with a PE ( price - to - earnings ) of 16 x , the first year since the start of the decade where Asia entered the New Year trading at a premium to most other global equity markets .
It is therefore perhaps not a surprise that Asia , particularly China and India , experienced the most profit - taking / foreign - led selling in the first quarter of 2008 .
The global economy is weakening and inflation in China remains a threat .
Therefore , Asian markets are likely to remain volatile over the next couple of months .
Several Asian markets , especially the Indian equity market , also remain vulnerable to changes in global risk appetite as foreign inflows have been the major driver of these markets .
We therefore continue to monitor fund flows and global risk sentiment closely , while cash levels in our portfolios have also risen marginally .
However , Asia should be supported by still strong corporate earnings growth , as there is no sign of any immediate impact from the US subprime crisis on Asian earnings .
In fact earnings growth in Asia remains strong , led by China and India , which are forecasted to grow earnings by around 20%2 in 2008 according to our estimates .
Read
As well as offering strong earnings growth , Asian valuations are looking much more attractive after the sharp recent correction .
Valuations are back down around 14 times forward earnings on many markets .
In particular , valuations in Korea and Thailand look very attractive at around 11 x forward PE , and these two markets remain among our preferred markets on an asset allocation basis .
Historically , Asia ’s status as a region that performs particularly well when the US economy is strong was warranted .
This was because the Asian equity universe was dominated by technology / export related stocks , while Korea and Taiwan , the two markets with the biggest technology weightings , dominated Asian equity indices .
A sharp US slowdown would hurt the whole world , and Asia would not be spared .
Nevertheless , Asia is less linked to the US than in the past , supported by increasing intra-regional trade .
In terms of economic decoupling , many Asian markets are less dependent on exports than before thanks to the growth of domestic demand .
Even in China , exports only make up a relatively small amount of over GDP , while less than 20 % of China ’s exports go to the US .
Instead , China ’s growth over the past several years has been led primarily by household consumption and investments rather than by net exports .
Continued strong investment spending to boost growth across Asia due to secular urbanisation and industrialisation trends that are not linked to the export - sector or to the US housing market .
There is the need to upgrade infrastructure ( India ) , to address the rising demand for housing ( China ) and to develop the resource sectors ( Indonesia , Malaysia ) .
In addition , incomes are rising strongly across Asia , particularly in China and in India .
This is translating to strong retail sales and consumption growth in these countries .
Portfolios are generally structured to gain exposure to these secularly growing sectors and countries .
Asia remains a compelling investment choice .
Although further volatility is likely in the short term as slowing US growth , rising inflation and volatile investor risk appetite impacts sentiment , we believe that , on balance , the outlook remains positive for
the Asia ex Japan region .
Although the global economy is weakening , Asia ’s growth still looks strong , corporate earnings are well supported and valuations look reasonable .
Also , over the longer term , we continue to believe in Asia ’s attractive fundamentals – strong balance sheets , high levels of savings , appreciating currencies , and positive demographics – as well as other long - term structural growth drivers such as urbanization and industrialization .
As a result of the emergence of these positive long - term fundamental factors , I also believe that Asia should weather the US slowdown better than it has in the past .
In fact , more than at any other time in the past , there is now a strong case for Asian economies and markets to slowly decouple .

1 General Television Corporation Pty Ltd has appealed against orders of a judge of the trial division of this Court made on 15 February 2008 , which in summary , prohibit the publication , broadcasting or exhibition of a television programme entitled ‘ Underbelly ’ until after the trial of ‘ A ’ has been completed .
Alternatively , the applicant , if necessary , seeks leave to appeal the order of the trial judge .
Background
2 The background to the making of the orders is as follows .
The trial of A for the murder of a person to whom we shall refer as ‘ B ’ is , and has been for some considerable period of time , fixed for hearing to commence on 31 March 2008 .
Amongst other witnesses , the prosecution intends to call as a witness a person to whom we shall refer as ‘ X ’ .
3 On Thursday 7 February 2008 , and at the request of the prosecution , a directions hearing took place before the judge who was listed to hear the trial of A .
The purpose of the hearing was to consider the effect that a foreshadowed broadcast by Channel 9 ( a television station operated by the applicant ) of the program Underbelly might have upon the fair trial of A .
The applicant had been informed previously of the nature of the directions hearing and was represented at the hearing of 7 February 2008 by senior counsel .
4 At the hearing , the information provided to the judge by counsel for the applicant was that Underbelly is a program of 13 episodes , one of which would be shown on Channel 9 throughout Australia each week for a period of 12 weeks .
It was intended by the applicant that the first and second such episodes would be broadcast throughout Australia on television on Wednesday 13 February 2008 .
Thereafter it was intended that the following episodes would be shown on a weekly basis .
In the course of the hearing the applicant , through its counsel , having at first declined to provide any material to the Court , offered to provide to the court copies of the first two episodes which it intended to broadcast on the following Monday 11 February 2008 .
However the applicant declined to provide the remaining 11 episodes , which were said to be ‘ uncut ’ .
The further hearing of the proceeding was then adjourned to enable the prosecution to issue and serve a subpoena upon the applicant seeking production before the court of copies of all 13 episodes of the program .
5 Upon the return of the subpoena on Monday 11 February 2008 , DVD recordings of each of the 13 episodes were produced before the court .
Counsel for the applicant informed the judge that episodes 1 and 2 were in the form in which they would be broadcast on the following Wednesday evening , but that the remaining 11 episodes were yet to be the subject of final editing .
The proceeding was then adjourned until the following morning , to enable counsel for the parties and the judge to view the DVD recordings .
6 The next day , Tuesday 12 February 2008 , the prosecution made application for an order that the ‘ showing of this program on television be stayed until after the trial . ’
It was submitted that such an order was necessary because the material in question would have an adverse effect on the right of the accused to a fair trial .
At the conclusion of argument , her Honour made orders prohibiting ‘ the transmission and publication of the television series Underbelly ... by any television channel , free to air or cable / pay television in the State of Victoria until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] ’ .
Her Honour also ordered that the television series referred to as ‘ Underbelly ’ not be published on the internet in Victoria .
7 On the following evening , Wednesday 13 February 2008 , Underbelly was broadcast by Channel 9 throughout Australia , but in compliance with the order , television stations operated by the applicant in Victoria did not broadcast the program .
It would appear , however , that some Victorians had access to the program either by way of videotape or through the internet .
On Friday 15 February , and as a result of a newspaper report that a Melbourne publican had exhibited the first episode to his patrons the previous evening , the prosecution made application before her Honour to widen her orders .
Two of those orders are the subject of this appeal .
They are as follows :
1 . The transmission , publication , broadcasting or exhibiting of the production referred to as ‘ Underbelly ’ be prohibited in the State of Victoria until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] .
2. Direct that the television series referred to as ‘ Underbelly ’ not be published on the internet in Victoria and the ‘ Family Tree site – inside the Underbelly , which looks at the evolving relationships between the key characters ’ be prohibited until after the trial and verdict in the matter of [ A ] .
The latter order related to a website operated by the applicant which enabled a person logging on to the website to understand the dramatis personae of both Underbelly and the so - called ‘ Gangland Wars ’ , and the relationship between various persons including the accused , the deceased and others relevant to the forthcoming trial of A .
8 The murder of B is the specific subject of episode 12 of the program .
Both A and X are referred to in episode 12 , and although they are not identified by name , a juror , having heard evidence in the trial of A , would have little difficulty in recognizing that both A and X are portrayed in the episode .
Her Honour was told by counsel for the applicant that although it was intended to commence broadcasting the program on 13 February 2008 , episode 12 would not be shown prior to the trial of A .
This concession appears to us to be based upon a sound understanding by the applicant of the serious risk that the portrayal of matters , the subject of the trial , would create in terms of the conduct of a fair trial .
Obviously the portrayal of the very events which are the subject of a criminal trial at a time contemporaneous with the conduct of the trial would raise a serious risk of interference with the trial .
However apart from episode 12 , it is apparent that the applicant intended , unless restrained , to broadcast all other episodes of the program .
Assuming that the program had commenced as intended , by the date of the commencement of the trial , episode 8 would be shown in the first week of the trial .
The program would have continued on a weekly basis throughout the conduct of the trial , which was estimated before her Honour to take approximately four weeks to hear .
As stated above , the applicant agreed that episode 12 would not be shown during the trial , but made no offer to refrain voluntarily from publishing the other episodes .
9 That said , however , episode 12 is not the only part of the television series which refers to B .
He and or members of his family are portrayed in eight out of the 11 episodes preceding episode 12 .
He plays a major role in those episodes and in particular he is portrayed as having an association with large numbers of notorious people .
These associations and the relationship between him and members of his family are the subject of various episodes of the series .
Of course those associations and relationships are unlikely to be the subject of evidence in the trial , being generally irrelevant to any issue in the trial .
Thus , if the other episodes are broadcast , irrelevant issues pertaining to the trial , be they fact or fiction , will be before both potential jurors and actual jurors during the course of the trial .
Jurisdiction of the Court to hear the Application
10 The first issue relates to the jurisdiction of this court to entertain an appeal from the orders of the judge .
The DPP argues that , by reason of the provisions of s 17A ( 3 ) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from the orders made by the trial judge .
Section 17A ( 3 ) of the Supreme Court Act is as follows -
(3) Except as provided in Part VI of the Crimes Act 1958 , an appeal does not lie from a determination of the Trial Division constituted by a Judge made on or in relation to the trial or proposed trial of a person on indictment or presentment .
11 It is submitted by the DPP that the orders made by the trial judge were a determination made on or in relation to the trial of A , and were in the nature of suppression orders .
It is argued that the nexus between the orders and the trial was immediate and apparent and was both temporal and evidentiary .
In the alternative it is argued that the orders made by the trial judge were interlocutory in nature and by reason of the provisions of s 17A ( 4 ) ( b ) of the Supreme Court Act the appeal cannot be pursued without the leave of either the trial judge or the Court of Appeal .
12 Section 17A ( 4 ) relevantly states as follows :
(4) An appeal does not lie to the Court of Appeal —
...
( b ) without the leave of the Judge constituting the Trial Division or of the Court of Appeal , from a judgment or order in an interlocutory application , being a judgment or order given by the Trial Division constituted by a Judge , except in the following cases —
...
13 On the other hand , the applicant contends that the orders made were orders which determined finally the question of whether the broadcast of Underbelly would be a contempt of court .
It is submitted that leave to appeal is thus not required .
In the alternative it is submitted that the orders made are injunctive and thus leave to appeal is not required by reason of s 17A ( 4 ) ( b ) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 .
14 In Herald and Weekly Times v A Maxwell P and Nettle JA gave consideration to the meaning of s 17A ( 3 ) .
[ 1 ]
In that case the trial judge had made an order that ‘ the publication of any reference to the antecedents , current charge , or pending charges , or any reference which reflects adversely upon the credit of [ A , B or X ] in any media outlet , newspaper , radio or television station is prohibited until further notice ’ .
15 Having considered Smith v The Queen [ 2 ] where the High Court held that the restriction in what is now s 17A ( 3 ) was not confined to determinations from which an appeal lay under Part VI of the Crimes Act , Maxwell P and Nettle JA nevertheless concluded that the Court did have jurisdiction to entertain the application to appeal the relevant order .
They said : [ 3 ]
Granted that we are constrained by the decision in Smith to give to s 17A ( 3 ) its ordinary meaning , it does not seem to us that an order directed to the world at large in terms of the subject order is one which , according to the ordinary meaning of language , is a determination “ made on or in relation to a trial or proposed trial ” .
It is not an order of the kind which is deemed by s 7 of the Crimes ( Criminal Trials )
Act 1993 to be part of the trial .
Nor is it closely related to the trial in the sense in which an order to provide legal assistance for a trial or an order staying a trial is related to it .
Nor is the subject - matter of the determination an integral part of the trial process , nor does it arise in the issue between the Crown and the accused formulated by the presentment .
Judged , therefore , by reference to these three “ helpful pointers ” , recognized in England as providing guidance as to whether a decision is a matter “ relating to trial on indictment ” within the meaning of s. 29 ( 3 ) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 ( UK ) , it is difficult to see why this order should be judged a determination “ in relation to a trial ” .
As Gummow and Toohey JJ said in PMT Partners Pty Ltd v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service , [ 4 ] the words “ in relation to ” – “ are prima facie broad and designed to catch things which have sufficient nexus to the subject .
The question of sufficiency of nexus is , of course , dependent on the statutory context . ”
Interpreting a statutory phrase by reference to its context is necessary so that effect can be given to the legislative purpose .
And it is the legislative purpose of s.17 A ( 3 ) which is significant here .
Its purpose , as the High Court recognised in Smith , was to avoid the fragmentation of criminal trials by appeals brought from rulings before or during the course of a trial .
This suggests that the phrase “ in relation to ” was intended to denote a quite direct nexus with the trial .
Nothing said by the High Court in Smith requires any other conclusion .
We think , moreover , that a privative clause like s.17A ( 3 ) should be strictly construed and that where – as here – there is a choice between a broader and narrower interpretation , the narrower should be preferred .
This is especially so where – as here – the application of the privative clause would render the determination in question wholly immune from appeal .
It is not lightly to be assumed that Parliament would have intended that result .
Accordingly , we conclude that s.17A ( 3 ) does not preclude an appeal from a suppression order of the kind in issue here .
No question of fragmentation of the proposed trial arises .
Framed as it is , the order lacks the direct nexus with the proposed trial which the phrase “ in relation to ” requires .
So to say is not to suggest that every form of suppression order may be appealed under s.17 ( 2 ) .
Nor is it necessarily to imply that an order like the subject order but expressed in terms tying it more closely to a particular trial or proposed trial , may not come within s.17 A ( 3 ) .
It may also be that the time at which such an order is made is relevant to the assessment of whether it is a determination within the meaning of the latter provision .
For the present we confine ourselves to the conclusion that the order the subject of the application is not a determination “ on or in relation to the trial or proposed trial of a person on indictment or presentment ” within the meaning of s. 17A( 3 ) .
16 On the same basis we conclude that the order the subject of the application before us is not confined by s 17A ( 3 ) and that the order made by the trial judge was not an order made ‘ on or in relation to the trial ’ of A .
17 We turn to the question of whether or not leave to appeal is required .
This is not a matter which it is necessary for us to determine .
We are of the view that taking into account the injunctive nature of the orders made by her Honour and other circumstances of the proposed appeal we would be inclined to grant leave , if leave to appeal is necessary .
18 We turn now to consider the grounds upon which the applicant relies .
Ground 1
The learned trial judge erred in making Orders 1 and 2 ( “ the Orders ” ) because :
(a) The orders exceeded the Court ’s jurisdiction to make a suppression order ;
( b) Alternatively , the orders were an improper exercise of any power the Court had to make a suppression order ; and
( c) The orders , being in the nature of a final injunction to restrain a threatened contempt , ought only to have been made in an adversarial proceeding properly brought in the Court in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Court applicable to a proceeding for that relief . ”
19 The applicant submits that the power to make a suppression order ‘ is essentially directed at restraining publication of evidence , submissions and material that are before the court or that form part of the court file or record ’ .
On this basis , it is submitted that although in her reasons the trial judge characterised the orders as being suppression orders they were , in substance , orders purporting to restrain an apprehended contempt of court by the applicant .
As counsel for the applicant points out it is true that at all times both the trial judge and counsel for the prosecution referred to the relief sought by the prosecution as being suppression orders .
20 We accept that the orders made by the trial judge were not orders made pursuant to the specific statutory power granted to the court by s 18 of the Supreme Court Act .
That section grants power , in the circumstances set out in s 19 of the Act , to make orders prohibiting publication of a report of the whole , or any part of a ( civil or criminal ) proceeding , or of any information derived from a proceeding .
Clearly her Honour ’s orders did not prohibit the report of a proceeding .
However her Honour did not purport to make the orders pursuant to that statutory power .
She said that she was making the orders because in all the circumstances considered by her it was ‘ not possible for a fair trial to be achieved for [ A ] ’ .
21 Sections 18 and 19 of the Act are not the whole repository of the power of the Court to make suppression orders .
In our view the judge held correctly that the Court has inherent jurisdiction to make orders necessary for the fair trial of an accused .
Clearly , the usual exercise of that inherent jurisdiction consists of orders suppressing the publication of a part or parts of a proceeding or of evidence given or to be given in a proceeding .
One usual example of this is the suppression of publication of the sentencing hearing of an accused who has pleaded guilty to offences shortly before his or her co-accused is to face trial .
Notwithstanding that the usual suppression order is based upon sections 18 and 19 of the Supreme Court Act , it is clear that a superior court has both the power and the duty to ensure that justice is done according to law and may make orders for the protection of those involved in proceedings before it .
[ 5 ]
No doubt , on occasions , the exercise of that power , and duty , will be by way of an injunction to restrain an apprehended contempt of court .
22 There is ample authority to demonstrate that courts have power to restrain publication of extrinsic material so as to avoid such an apprehended contempt .
23 In The State of Victoria & Anor v Australian Building Construction Employees ’ and Builders Labourers ’ Federation , Gibbs CJ said : [ 6 ]
A superior court which has power to punish contempts , and which has power to issue injunctions , may grant an injunction to restrain a threatened contempt .
24 The applicant accepts that this is so but points to the distinction between the power of a court to suppress a publication of its own proceedings and the power governed by the law of contempt .
The applicant submits that a suppression order is essentially a matter between the Court and the parties before it , and is an interlocutory order usually made in the course of proceedings based on the court ’s and the parties ’ knowledge of the proceedings and the issues therein .
By contrast it is submitted that an application for an injunction to restrain an apprehended contempt is an application for a remedy directed at particular persons and which is governed by the rules of evidence and the procedures of the court relating to such an application .
It is argued that the party seeking the injunction must produce evidence to support the application and the person against whom the order is sought has a right to respond to that evidence and to adduce his or her own evidence and to put submissions as to why there is no apprehended contempt .
25 It is argued on behalf of the applicant that the trial judge was in error in granting what was in effect injunctive relief , without complying with the procedures of the court applicable to a proceeding to restrain an apprehended contempt .
The applicant argues that the orders were made on the basis of material and evidence not known or disclosed to it , and thus it was not accorded procedural fairness .
The exercise of the Judge ’s discretion
26 It is true that the application made before her Honour was not made in the civil jurisdiction of the Court by summons , supported by affidavits .
The application came on before her Honour in circumstances of exigency .
Indeed , at the time that the issue first arose before her she was in the course of conducting a separate criminal trial in Geelong .
The matter arose in the context of whether the proposed publication of Underbelly in the weeks immediately before and during the trial created a real risk that publication would prejudice the trial seriously .
Time was of the essence as the proposed publication of Underbelly was to commence very soon thereafter .
In our view the fact that the process adopted did not follow the usual course in which a civil injunction might be sought must be considered in the light of all the circumstances , including the urgency of the matter and the fact that the power to be exercised by the judge was not merely to determine private rights between litigants , but was a power to ensure the right of the accused and the prosecution to a fair trial .
27 As Deane J said in Hinch v Attorney - General ( Victoria ) : [ 7 ]
The right to a fair and unprejudiced trial is an essential safeguard of the liberty of the individual under the law .
The ability of a society to provide a fair and unprejudiced trial is an indispensable basis of any acceptable justification of the restraints and penalties of the criminal law .
Indeed , it is a touchstone of the existence of the rule of law .
28 In our view it is apparent that the Court has inherent jurisdiction to make appropriate orders to ensure that right .
It may be that a suppression order under s 18 of the Supreme Court Act is sufficient and adequate to ensure that right .
It may be that a suppression order which goes beyond the circumstances contemplated by s 18 of the Supreme Court Act but exercised in the Court ’s inherent jurisdiction is sufficient and adequate to ensure that right .
It may be that a suppression order which is directed to the prohibition of publication of matters which have a significant risk of causing serious prejudice to the fair trial of an accused person is akin to an injunction to restrain a threatened contempt .
However that does not mean that the exercise of such power must follow the usual inter partes process of seeking an injunction .
The Court ’s power to suppress publication is not circumscribed narrowly .
It does not mean that the civil process of the issue of a summons supported by affidavits followed by application made to a Practice Court judge , is required .
Indeed , it appears to us to be clear enough that on occasions the exercise of the Court ’s power to protect the right to fair trial might be on the Court ’s own motion .
As Mahoney JA said in John Fairfax & Sons v Police Tribunal in relation to the power of a court to protect the identity of persons who were not parties or witnesses in the proceedings before it : [ 8 ]
The relationship which must exist between the proceedings and the necessity of the case on the one hand and the order made will depend upon the circumstances of the case .
29 However we accept that the Court does not have power to ‘ bind the world ’ by a suppression order made in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to ensure a fair trial .
As Maxwell P and Nettle JA said in Herald & Weekly Times Pty Ltd & Ors v A : [ 9 ]
For present purposes it may be allowed that the court does not have power by a suppression order made in exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to bind the world at large .
Ordinarily such orders bind in personam only the parties and other persons to whom they are directed .
But it does not follow that a suppression order is invalid or inutile simply because it is not in terms directed to anyone in particular .
Suppression orders of that kind are made every day of the week and they do bind parties and those who are in court and in effect those who receive notice of the orders .
As McHugh JA explained in John Fairfax & Sons v Police Tribunal :
“ Nevertheless , conduct outside the courtroom which deliberately frustrates the effect of an order made to enable the court to act effectively within its jurisdiction may constitute a contempt of court ... the conduct will be a contempt because the person involved has intentionally interfered with the proper administration of justice ... “
Spigelman CJ put the matter even more precisely in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court ( NSW ) when his Honour said :
“ In New South Wales a non-publication order made in the Supreme Court ... is communicated to the major media by the court .
The order may only formally bind persons who are present in court .
However , the media are on notice that the communication of the prohibited matter to the media for publication must come , directly or indirectly , from a person who has breached the order .
Knowledge of the order will be a material factor in any subsequent contempt proceedings against the media on the basis that the conduct intentionally frustrated a court order . ”
The same is equally true of a suppression order made by the Supreme Court of Victoria in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction .
( Citations omitted . )
30 The question therefore , is what do the circumstances require ?
Consideration of that question requires some consideration of the nature of the case before her Honour .
Upon the hearing of the application before us , in his written submission the DPP outlined the nature of the prosecution case against A .
We shall refer to it here in the barest detail .
The murder with which A is charged took place approximately four years ago .
A was committed for trial on 22 March 2007 .
The prosecution case is that X was approached by a person whom we shall call ‘ D ’ allegedly acting on behalf of himself and a person to whom we shall refer as ‘ F ’ shortly before the murder took place .
The prosecution alleges that D ‘ contracted ’ with X to kill B .
The motive for the killing is alleged to be related to enmities which had developed between D , F and B in the course of the so - called ‘ Gangland Wars ’ .
The prosecution contends that X recruited two others , E and A , to assist in the execution of B .
The prosecution case is that X was engaged to do the driving , E was to be the lookout and A was to do the shooting .
The Crown case is that the shooting took place as planned in premises frequented by B .
The Crown case is that one week later X was contacted by D . Soon thereafter F paid X a substantial sum of money .
The Crown case is that the shooting of B was captured by security cameras in the premises in which the shooting took place .
The prosecution intends to call X to give evidence against A .
31 Although the applicant submits that the trial judge proceeded on the basis of ‘ material obtained by the trial judge , but not otherwise in evidence before the Court , and not known ’ to the applicant , it was not suggested before us that the substance of the case to be advanced at trial , as set out above , is unknown to the applicant , nor could such a suggestion be made credibly .
It is apparent that the applicant was at all times well aware of the manner in which the Crown case was to be put before the jury .
It is clear from the ‘ credits ’ of episodes 1 and 2 that members of Victoria Police have acted as ‘ advisors ’ to those producing Underbelly . [ 10 ]
Furthermore , episode 12 of the series sets out in a detailed manner most , and more , of the circumstances alleged by the prosecution and referred to above .
In our view , it is beyond argument that the publication of episode 12 to prospective jurors , and more specifically the exhibition of that episode during the conduct of the trial has the potential to constitute a most serious contempt of court .
Indeed , it is difficult to conceive how the applicant ’s advisors could ever have thought otherwise .
Nevertheless , as stated above , before her Honour the applicant agreed not to broadcast episode 12 .
However her Honour did not consider that the deletion of episode 12 from the series would be sufficient to remove the risk of serious prejudice to the trial of A .
Having seen the 12 episodes she said : [ 11 ]
The series explains , to a very large degree , the reason why [ B ] was ultimately murdered .
That is really the subject of the trial of [ A ] .
In this case [ X ] is giving evidence on behalf of the Crown .
He is an accomplice and will have attached to that evidence , the very strong accomplice warnings that attach to such evidence .
This whole series has an unfortunate aspect to it in that it tends to corroborate the version that is given by [ X ] .
The victim [ B ] is also to a large degree made very human by this series and is shown as a grieving parent .
[ B ] appears in episode 1 and continues to appear throughout .
The murder occurs in episode 12 .
Episodes 10 and 11 prior to the murder have a significant impact in terms of [ X ] and [ A ] and their involvement with [ D ] and [ F ] which is of course exactly what [ X ] will be telling a jury , that is how he was contracted to become involved in this murder .
Channel 9 have offered to not show episode 12 until after the trial of [ A ] is complete .
It is unfortunate that I do not think that would be sufficient or even close to sufficient to prevent strong prejudice flowing to [ A ] in respect of his forthcoming trial .
32 In addition , her Honour found that Underbelly is based upon real events and is being promoted by the applicant as a factual account of those events .
She found that the dialogue in the series is a mixture of fact and fiction and that it would not be apparent to a viewer into which category a particular conversation falls .
She found that the series explains to the viewer why it is that B was murdered .
33 She found that episodes 10 and 11 deal with the motive of D to contract with X to kill B .
It should be observed that D is named and appears as a main character throughout the series .
Indeed D is portrayed in every episode of the series .
34 It should be observed that the trial judge is a most experienced criminal judge who has presided as the trial judge in numerous cases associated with the so called ‘ gangland killings ’ .
All of the above findings were open to the trial judge .
35 In our view , having made such findings of fact , her Honour was entitled in the exercise of her discretion to make orders prohibiting the broadcast of Underbelly in Victoria by the applicant , and that she had ample power to do so in the interests of justice and in order to avoid the risk of serious prejudice to a fair trial .
We shall return to the question of the width of the orders made by her Honour later in these reasons .
Ground 2
The learned trial judge erred in making the orders , being orders in the nature of a final injunction to restrain a threatened contempt of court , without a finding that the publication of the television series the subject of order 1 ( “ Underbelly ” ) , or any revised form of the series , would constitute a contempt of court .
36 Accepting for the time being that the orders made by the trial judge were in the nature of a final injunction to restrain a threatened contempt of court , the test for liability for sub judice contempt is whether , as a matter of practical reality , the publication is shown to have a tendency to prejudice or embarrass particular legal proceedings .
[ 12 ]
Although the trial judge did not find specifically that the publication of Underbelly would constitute a contempt of court , it is beyond argument that she found not only that there was a real and definite tendency for the series to prejudice the trial of A , but that the publication would do so specifically .
She said : [ 13 ]
It is my view that to have a series running on the Gangland Wars which will not relate to the persons who are witnesses , persons who are victims or victim , and the persons who are alleged to be those responsible for ordering the death of the deceased , running at the same time as the trial , makes it impossible for a fair trial to be achieved for A .
Clearly her Honour ’s findings in this regard were open to her .
There is nothing in this ground .
Ground 3
The learned trial judge erred in failing to accord the appellant natural justice .
(a) The learned trial judge proceeded on the basis that the orders were suppression orders and did not afford the appellant an opportunity to have access to the evidence and other material upon which the judge was acting , to adduce evidence in response or to address the factual and legal issue raised by the evidence and other material upon which she was acting ;
( b) The learned trial judge proceeded on the basis of material obtained by the judge but not otherwise in evidence before the Court and not known to the appellant ;
( c) The learned trial judge proceeded on the basis of the proposed trial evidence , which was not known or made available to the appellant ;
(d) The learned trial judge proceeded to make final orders wider than those applied for and , in part , on her own motion .
37 The applicant was represented before the judge by senior counsel .
No request was made to the trial judge for the provision of any material to the applicant .
The issue arose in circumstances of considerable urgency .
The Underbelly series was to commence being broadcast to the public within a matter of days after the matter was first drawn to the attention of the judge .
The suggestion that the applicant did not know the basis upon which the trial was to proceed , strains credulity .
As to this we make two observations .
First , the applicant had extensive knowledge of the relevant events as borne out by the contents of the series itself and the assistance provided to it by Victoria Police . [ 14 ]
Secondly , the reporting in the media of other gangland trials before her Honour was extensive and notorious .
It is inconceivable that the applicant was unaware of the factual basis upon which the trial of A was to proceed .
The applicant was about to broadcast a 13 episode television series which depicts in detail the parts allegedly played by the accused , the deceased and a major witness in the intended trial .
The television series makes clear the basis of the motive of those alleged to have arranged the murder of B .
The proposed publication goes to the very heart of the trial about to occur .
There is no basis to say that the applicant was not accorded natural justice or that the judge proceeded on any basis which was not obvious and known clearly to the applicant .
In our view she did all that she could in the urgent circumstances before her to give the applicant the opportunity to be heard and make submissions to her .
Ultimately , an experienced criminal judge determined to make orders in a very urgent context to protect the right of A to a fair trial .
The ground is not made out .
Ground 4
38 This ground was abandoned on the second day of the hearing before us .
However we observe that even if it was open to the applicant to rely upon the Charter in terms of the right of free speech , which we consider to be highly unlikely , then we would adopt the view of Richardson J in Gisborne Herald Co Ltd v Solicitor - General : [ 15 ]
The present rule is that , where on the conventional analysis freedom of expression and fair trial rights cannot be fully assured , it is appropriate in our free and democratic society to temporarily curtail freedom of media expression so as to guarantee a fair trial .
Grounds 5 and 6
The learned trial judge erred in not considering the public interest in receiving the information imparted by the broadcast of Underbelly or any revised version thereof .
The learned trial judge erred in balancing only the commercial interests of the appellant against the public interest in the proper conduct of the pending criminal trial .
39 It is appropriate to consider these two grounds together .
The applicant argues that the trial judge ought to have had regard to the public interest in ‘ receiving the information and the ideas imparted by Underbelly ’ .
The first matter that might be observed is that based upon fact , as the television series is , nevertheless it is a ‘ docu- drama ’ .
It is clear to us that the principal purpose of the series is that of entertainment .
This it does by the graphic portrayal of violence and the salacious behaviour of many of those portrayed .
The entertainment value of the program is enhanced by the music used as background and sometimes by humorous narrative .
40 Her Honour concluded : [ 16 ]
It is not a situation that I have to , in my view , balance the public right to know .
This is not the reporting of an event , this is a television series made for entertainment .
Channel 9 ’s interests are commercial in that they seek to air this at an appropriate ratings period to ensure they get good ratings .
From those good ratings they would hope to receive good advertising revenue .
In my view it is far more important that the criminal justice power works , than that a channel make a profit .
41 True , it is , that any exercise of the power to suppress publication involves balancing the interests of society in ensuring that a fair trial takes place against the competing interests of freedom of expression .
42 The balance to be struck was explained in the judgment of Jordon CJ in Ex Parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd ; Re Truth & Sportsman Ltd [ 17 ] as follows :
It is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a court of justice from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice .
But the administration of justice , important though it undoubtedly is , is not the only matter in which the public is vitally interested ; and if in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which may prejudice a party in the conduct of a law suit , it does not follow that a contempt has been committed .
The case may be one in which as between competing matters of public interest the possibility of prejudice to a litigant may be required to yield to other and superior considerations .
The discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of public abuses , actual or supposed , cannot be required to be suspended merely because the discussion or the denunciation may , as an incidental but not intended by - product , cause some likelihood of prejudice to a person who happens at the time to be a litigant .
43 It is submitted by the applicant that her Honour should have considered the public interest in ‘ information pertaining to the role of police in preventing and responding to organised crime ’ .
It is not correct to say that her Honour did not consider the issue of balancing the public interest with that of the right to a fair trial .
She did consider it and determined that the nature of the Underbelly program is such that it has no weight in the balancing exercise .
On any view the weight of Underbelly as a matter of public interest in such an exercise must be seen as being extremely limited .
As for the somewhat specious submission that the program imparts information to the public as to the role of police , it is difficult to see that Underbelly provides any information to the public significantly beyond that of any dramatized police television program .
In our view there is nothing in this ground .
Ground 7
7 . The learned trial judge erred :
( a ) in refusing to adjourn the pending criminal trial , as applied for by the accused and initially not opposed by the Director of Public Prosecutors ;
( b ) in failing to afford the applicant with an opportunity to broadcast in Victoria a version of Underbelly different from the version of Underbelly proposed to be broadcast elsewhere .
( c ) in failing to have regard to the risk of publicity being given by her orders to previous publications and other material dealing with the subject matter of Underbelly , including the book upon which Underbelly is based , and , as a consequence , that becoming public knowledge ; and
( d ) in making orders wider than those that were necessary or appropriate in al the circumstances .
44 With the exception of ground 7 ( d ) to which we will return , these grounds establish no error .
After viewing the subpoenaed DVDs , counsel for A did seek an adjournment of the proceeding .
When pressed , Counsel for A declined to undertake not to seek a permanent stay of the prosecution of A at a subsequent time .
Significantly , once the prosecutors viewed the DVDs they did not follow the adjournment path .
Yet there is a very significant issue that arises .
The accused is not the only party with an interest in the timing of his trial .
For a variety of reasons there is a public interest to be served in having criminal trials proceed as soon as possible after the events with which they are concerned .
These are of both a practical nature and as a matter of principle .
In this case the trial of A will commence approximately four years after the death of B . Her Honour gave appropriate consideration to the question of adjourning the trial .
She said :
It is important that persons who are charged with criminal offences have their trials heard as quickly as possible , that is recognised and enshrined in the Charter of Human Rights which came into force in Victoria at the beginning of this year .
There are many practical reasons for it as well .
If this trial was to be adjourned it would take an enormous amount of time , at least a year before one could contemplate re-listing the matter and in terms of re-listing this show would have been aired and possibly achieved what Channel 9 hopes of it and that is be in the lounge room of every person in Victoria not to mention around the country .
45 In our view her Honour was not in error in refusing to adjourn the trial .
46 In our view ground 7 ( b ) has no substance .
The trial of A was imminent .
The first episode was to be shown within days .
That episode portrays the deceased , B and members of his family in some detail .
The second episode which portrays both B , his family and D was to be broadcast together with episode 1 .
Her Honour had to make an immediate decision and draft orders swiftly to meet pressing circumstances .
It was not for her to suggest how to edit the series .
47 Pixelating faces and the use of anonymous names , as proposed by the applicant as a ‘ Victorian Version ’ would have achieved nothing .
The jury , once empanelled , would have had no difficulty in establishing from the evidence put before them in the trial , the identities of various characters portrayed in the Underbelly series .
In any event , the only concession made by the applicant before her Honour was not to broadcast episode 12 during the trial .
48 The suggestion that the trial judge should have had regard to the risk of publicity and controversy by reason of her orders and by reason thereof she should have adjourned the trial , is entirely without merit .
That publicity does not identify the accused , the deceased or the witnesses to be called .
The publicity was caused not by her Honour ’s orders , but by the total indifference of the applicant to the interest of the community in the fair trial of A .
Ground 8
The learned trial judge erred in not taking into account the changes proposed by the appellant to Underbelly for broadcast in Victoria and , in particular , the changes proposed to episode 12 of Underbelly .
49 Her Honour did take into account the offer of the applicant not to broadcast episode 12 .
She referred to that matter specifically but said it would not be ‘ even close to sufficient to prevent strong prejudice flowing to A in respect of his forthcoming trial ’ .
The material before us does not reveal what ‘ other changes ’ were proposed by the applicant other than the withdrawal of episode 12 and the ‘ Victorian Version ’ to which we have referred .
No error is revealed by this ground .
Ground 9
In the alternative , the learned trial judge erred in not limiting her suppression order to depiction of matters in , or likely to be adduced in evidence before her .
50 We have set out above [ 30 ] the basis upon which the prosecution puts its case against A .
The deceased B and the persons alleged to have contracted with X to kill him are depicted in almost every episode of Underbelly .
The dangers identified by the judge are clear .
The series is based upon real events .
The real names of a number of persons related closely to the events the subject of the trial are used time after time in the series .
The conversations in the series are based partly upon transcript recognized by the judge as having been discovered by the use of listening devices and partly upon the imagination of the writer .
Over a number of episodes the series explains the alleged motive for the murder of B . B appears throughout and is given a human face and personality by the actor portraying him .
The order which is suggested by this ground as being appropriate would have been most difficult to frame and is entirely unrealistic .
Had the judge ordered that any reference to A , B , his family , D , F and X be deleted there would have been little left of the series .
Her Honour was not in error as is asserted by this ground .
51 Before returning to the issue of the width of the orders made by her Honour , we think it is appropriate to review briefly the circumstances in which her Honour found herself .
Soon after the filing of the presentment on 22 November 2007 the date of the trial of A was fixed to commence on 31 March 2008 .
The applicant knew by at least 15 January 2008 that a criminal trial arising from the events portrayed in Underbelly was pending [ 18 ] .
As we have observed the applicant had assistance from the police in the making of the series .
It would be difficult to believe that the applicant was not alerted to the fact of the pending trial by virtue of the police advising it on the series much earlier in time and certainly by the latter part of 2007 .
52 In consequence of advance publicity about Underbelly appearing on Channel 9 and elsewhere in the media the matter was brought on for hearing before her Honour on 7 February 2008 .
The applicant had been notified of the hearing and was represented before her Honour .
Requests were made by the DPP on behalf of the applicant to provide the Office of Public Prosecutions with copies of Underbelly .
The applicant refused to do so .
At the hearing before her Honour on 7 February 2008 , the applicant offered to produce episodes 1 and 2 to the court on the following Monday but refused to provide the ‘ uncut ’ episodes .
The DPP subpoenaed all 13 episodes .
On Monday 11 February 2008 DVDs of those episodes were produced pursuant to the subpoena .
They were viewed by the judge and the prosecution and defence overnight and the parties returned to court the following day , which of course was the day before the applicant intended to broadcast episodes 1 and 2 .
In the course of that day , a day in which her Honour was otherwise conducting a criminal trial , she made her orders .
She had little assistance from the parties as to the drafting of those orders .
53 The circumstances in which the prejudice to the fair trial of A arose were unusual indeed .
As her Honour observed in the course of submissions :
I am unaware of a television show actually airing at the same time as a criminal trial about precisely the same event ...
54 This was not a circumstance of some prejudicial television program being shown to an audience containing potential jurors many months ahead of trial as in R v Yau Kim Lam ( No 1 ) , [ 19 ] nor was it the circumstance of some newspaper article dealing with events the subject of a trial some months before the trial .
Circumstances such as those are commonplace nowadays and judicial experience is that normally such circumstances can be dealt with by appropriate directions being given to a jury .
The judicial experience is overwhelmingly that the corporate integrity of juries can be relied upon and that juries do comply faithfully with directions given by judges to put aside prejudicial material and to consider their verdict on the basis of the evidence put before them .
As stated by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd and Another v District Court of New South Wales and Others : [ 20 ]
There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity ...
Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice .
Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted , again and again , that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take , that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them .
In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them .
Furthermore as Kirby ACJ , as he then was , said in R v Yuill : [ 21 ]
There is an increasing body of judicial opinion , lately expressed , to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists , jurors , when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom , differentiate between gossip , rumour , news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the court in the trial in which they are empanelled .
The experience of trial judges in Victoria accords with those observations .
In the light of that experience we turn to the circumstances before her Honour .
What was proposed in this case was that a 13 part series dealing with the background to the ‘ Gangland Wars ’ and portraying in graphic detail as central characters the very persons associated with the trial of A was to commence being broadcast approximately six weeks before the trial of A .
Not only was that so , but the intention of the applicant was that the television series would run contemporaneously with the trial .
In our view whilst the judicial experience is that juries do listen to and comply with directions to put aside prejudice , the particular and heretofore unexplored presentation of circumstances placed the trial judge in an impossible position .
By the time of empanelment , the series would have been at episode 8 .
The directions to be given to the jury panel would have been complex and would no doubt have resulted in large numbers of jurors being excused .
Although judicial experience dictates that the trial judge would have a reasonable prospect of managing the empanelment of a jury notwithstanding some viewing of Underbelly by members of the Victorian community [ 22 ] the situation would be impossible for the trial judge if the program went to air generally in Victoria so as to run at the same time as the trial of A .
55 Had a jury been empanelled the trial would have commenced with the prosecution case effectively being supported every Wednesday evening by the weekly ‘ docu- drama ’ .
The fact that the deceased , his family and the alleged ‘ employers ’ of X are depicted so graphically in the series would render it difficult for any juror to separate fact from fiction .
Certainly what was seen on television by any juror would contemporaneously put colour and drama into the evidence being led by the prosecution .
It would also introduce a mass of inadmissible material about B , D and F and their relationships with each other and others .
The police who were involved in the investigation of the ‘ gangland killings ’ are portrayed as being heroic figures in the series .
No doubt police will give evidence in the trial of A .
The effect of the television series is to enhance their integrity and professionalism .
Likewise the alleged victim of A is given a human face in the television series .
The contemporaneous effect of these matters upon a jury cannot be measured .
Her Honour concluded that those circumstances were such that it would make a fair trial impossible .
It was open to her Honour to reach such a conclusion .
In our view , and notwithstanding the great confidence the judiciary has in the integrity and fairness of properly directed juries , the insidious nature of such prejudicial and irrelevant material as would be likely to exist in this case in such circumstances , cannot be overstated .
56 Furthermore , it should be observed , as stated above , that not only is her Honour a most experienced criminal judge but she has a high degree of familiarity with and knowledge of both the background to , and the particular circumstances of the trial over which she is soon to preside .
It is her obligation to secure the fair trial of A .
In the particular circumstances of this case considerable weight must be accorded to her Honour ’s conclusion that a fair trial was not possible without her intervention .
Not only do we consider that it was open to her Honour to conclude as she did , but we have little doubt that the broadcasting of Underbelly in the weeks leading up to and during the trial would create a serious risk of prejudice to the conduct of a fair trial .
The contemporaneous and graphic nature of the portrayal of central figures in the trial , their relationships with each other and the relevance of these relationships to the alleged motive to murder B are the issues of most concern in this regard .
57 Although the applicant does not concede such a risk , except impliedly in relation to episode 12 , it is appropriate to note that the applicant submits before us that her Honour ’s orders should be set aside , and that it should be allowed to broadcast the first three episodes .
Counsel for the applicant informed us he had instructions to undertake to the Court not to broadcast any further episodes prior to 7 April 2004 and that seven days notice of intention to broadcast any further episodes would thereafter be given to the DPP in respect of each such episode .
In our view such a proposal is completely unworkable .
The prospect of the trial judge having to not only manage a complex and difficult trial and at the same time face the possibility of hearing applications related to the applicant ’s television show is totally unacceptable .
There would be a serious risk of interference with the orderly conduct of the trial in such circumstances .
58 We return to the issue of the width of the orders .
The first matter to be considered is whether , as is submitted by the applicant , no prejudice could arise by reason of the broadcast of episodes 1 to 3 of Underbelly .
Episode 1 is entitled ‘ The Black Prince ’ and involves matters relating to one Alphonse Gangitano .
It is set during the year 1995 .
The period of time to which the episode refers is thus temporally separate from the matters connected to the trial .
However , B and two of his sons are named and represented by actors in episode 1 , as is D .
This episode commences to describe the relationships which each of those parties has to each other and to other persons .
Those relationships are portrayed as being relevant to the events which lead in due course to the death of B . Likewise in episode 2 , B and members of his family and D are named and portrayed by actors .
F is represented in the program by an actor but not named and his face is pixelated .
Similarly , episode 3 is devoted principally to the family of B and their association with other alleged members of the ‘ underworld ’ .
It also refers in some detail to the alleged association between D and F .
59 Clearly the relationships between the deceased and members of his family and D and F , and the criminal activities in which they are portrayed engaging in as portrayed in episodes 1 to 3 are relevant to the manner in which the prosecution puts its case against A .
In our view , taking into account the proximity of the trial and that fact , the judge rightly considered that the dramatic portrayal of matters of mixed fact and fiction which directly relates to the trial of A was a matter of most serious concern .
60 In this regard it must be remembered that it was the trial judge who was to be burdened with the obligation of providing appropriate directions to both a prospective jury panel and to any jury finally selected .
In our view her discretion in relation to episodes 1 to 3 , as with her discretion in relation to the other episodes , did not miscarry .
61 We turn now to the final matter of whether her Honour ’s orders can be said to be too wide .
62 We accept that the jurisdiction to make such orders as those made by the judge extends ‘ no wider than is necessary ’ to secure the object of ensuring that justice is done . [ 23 ]
63 It should be observed that on 12 February 2008 her Honour made order 1 in the following terms :
The transmission and publication of the television series “ Underbelly ” be prohibited by any television channel , free to air or cable / pay television in the State of Victoria until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] .
64 Subsequent to the making of that order , the DPP requested the matter to be mentioned further before her Honour on 15 February 2008 .
The applicant was again represented but by different senior counsel on this occasion .
The prosecutor referred to a newspaper report that the first episode of Underbelly had been recorded interstate and played to the patrons of a hotel in Melbourne by the proprietor .
The prosecutor submitted that the order made previously should be widened .
After hearing submissions , the trial judge amended the order previously made by her to read :
The transmission , publication , broadcasting or exhibiting of the production referred to as “ Underbelly ” be prohibited in the State of Victoria , until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] .
65 In our view that order was too wide .
It purported to bind every person in Victoria . [ 24 ]
Whilst we consider it is clear that a suppression order made pursuant to the power granted under s 18 of the Supreme Court Act , and indeed other orders made in the interests of justice pursuant to the inherent power of the Court may be expressed in very wide terms , it was not necessary for order 1 to be as wide as that finally drafted .
In our view an order made against the applicant not to publish the program Underbelly in Victoria until after the completion of the trial was all that was necessary .
Clearly , however , any person who with knowledge of the order sought deliberately to frustrate the effect of the order could be liable for a contempt of court .
66 As McHugh JA said in John Fairfax and Sons v Police Tribunal : [ 25 ]
... conduct outside the courtroom which deliberately frustrates the effect of an order made to enable a court to act effectively within its jurisdiction may constitute a contempt of court ... the conduct will be a contempt because the person involved has intentionally interfered with the proper administration of justice .
67 We consider that order 1 should be recast in the following terms :
1. That General Television Corporation Pty Ltd and / or any related corporate entity be prohibited from publishing the television series ‘ Underbelly ’ or any part thereof in the State of Victoria until after the completion of the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] .
68 However , the fact that the above order is directed against the applicant only should not be misunderstood .
It should not be treated by persons other than the named applicant as giving them carte blanche to publish any part of Underbelly howsoever the same may have been obtained by them .
Obviously , any person with knowledge of the order who saw fit to publish Underbelly in Victoria prior to the verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] would run a grave risk of being found to have committed a contempt of court .
69 Likewise order 2 is too wide in our view .
It should be recast as follows :
2. That General Television Corporation Pty Ltd and / or any related corporate entity be prohibited from publishing on the internet in Victoria the ‘ Family Tree website – inside the Underbelly , which looks at the evolving relationships between the key characters ’ until after the trial and verdict in the matter of R v [ A ] .
70 It is appropriate to observe that order 2 above is directed at the applicant and specifically at one aspect of a website within its control .
We recognise that there is a considerable amount of material upon the internet which may be seen to relate whether accurately , or otherwise , to the matters which will be the subject of the trial .
Indeed it was acknowledged by Counsel for the applicant that Channel 9 appreciated that once the program was broadcast nationally on 13 February 2008 there is a high likelihood that it would be downloaded from the internet and available worldwide to those who could access it .
As observed by the High Court in Dow Jones v Gutnick [ 26 ] once an item is on the internet it is ’ available to all and sundry without any geographic restriction ’ .
This circumstance was entirely of the applicant ’s own making .
Obviously the immediate accessibility of such information will require clear directions from the trial judge to the jury .
As has been observed in other cases , this accessibility poses substantial challenges for the administration of justice . [ 27 ]
71 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court ( NSW ) [ 28 ]
Spigelman CJ suggested that legislative intervention may be desirable , and that in some cases the past practice of sequestering the jury may be necessary .
72 However , although there is on the internet a large body of material which relates in one way or another , whether accurately or not , to some of the issues which will be the subject of the trial , we have every confidence that the jury empanelled in this trial will abide by the directions of the judge .
73 Furthermore , even if some members of the jury panel have seen some episodes of Underbelly prior to the commencement of the trial , we have no doubt that suitable judicial directions can be given to both the panel and to the members of any jury so as to ensure a fair trial .
The issue of concern before the trial judge was not the issue of prejudicial publicity some time before trial .
The serious risk of prejudice arises by reason of the contemporaneous and graphic nature of Underbelly being available to jurors immediately before and during the conduct of the trial .
74 The appeal should be allowed in part so as to vary orders 1 and 2 of her Honour ’s order made on 15 February 2008 so as to accord with the recast orders set out in paragraphs 67 and 69 above .
It should otherwise be dismissed .

Would you be surprised to learn that the exact same investigators who headed up the government 's investigation into the World Trade Center collapses and the Pentagon attack on 9/11 also headed up the government 's investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing ?
The WTC collapses , Pentagon attack and OKC bombing involved assessments of entirely different kinds of structures inflicted with different kinds of damage .
And there are 1.5 million engineers in the U.S. , many of them highly - qualified to investigate attacks and their damage .
And yet the authors of the official report on the Murrah Federal Building -- Gene Corley , Charles Thornton , Paul Mlaker , and Mete Sozen -- were all among the initial team of the American Society of Civil Engineers ' 9/11 investigation .
Several of these individuals have strong connections to industries that benefited from the attack , and that would suffer if it were known that 9/11 was an inside job , such as armaments makers and oil and gas producers .
As if that is not bad enough , the same handful of people who came up with the unscientific " pancake collapse " theory for the Twin Towers while working for FEMA then moved over to spread unscientific theories for NIST :

Via
The Door this morning comes this commentary on mandatory liberal arts requirements from the Adjunct Professor of English " X " ( emphasis ours ) :
My students take English 101 and English 102 not because they want to but because they must .
Both colleges I teach at require that all students , no matter what their majors or career objectives , pass these two courses .
For many of my students , this is difficult .
Some of the young guys , the police - officers - to - be , have wonderfully open faces across which play their every passing emotion , and when we start reading “ Araby ” or “ Barn Burning , ” their boredom quickly becomes apparent .
They fidget ; they prop their heads on their arms ; they yawn and sometimes appear to grimace in pain , as though they had been tasered .
Their eyes implore :
How could you do this to me ?
The reason many colleges mandate that students take courses such as these that offer very limited , if any , utility to the academic path chosen by the students is because if they did n't , the academic disciplines in question would not be able to support themselves .
Only by subsidizing these academic departments by requiring that all students at a university take them can they justify continuing the level of funding needed to provide the payroll for these departments at the levels they do .
One way to measure the value of a given academic discipline is to examine the starting salaries of those who graduate with degrees in given fields , which we recently did for the graduating class of 2008 .
Here , we can see that the so - called liberal arts disciplines would appear to be less valued by employers than more practical or productive fields .
As a side note , we do recognize Daniel Hamermesh 's findings that a good portion of the discrepancy between the starting salaries of various academic disciplines may be due to certain fields drawing students with higher demonstrated levels of academic performance , as may be indicated by higher SAT scores when entering college , and also that many of these higher paying fields require greater levels of work from those entering them , in the form of longer hours and greater productivity , than those that typically correspond to the liberal arts .
In short , starting salaries tend to be proportional to a student 's innate abilities and willingness to execute and perform at the levels demanded by their employers , in addition to the value employers or society places upon the academic discipline itself .
So if we want to find out how valuable a particular discipline is with respect to another , we need to look beyond starting salaries .
And one way we might be able to do that is to see to what extent those majoring in one academic discipline are mandated to take classes in other academic disciplines .
Using this approach , we can see how university administrators themselves value the various academic disciplines .
For example , if an Engineering major is required to take two English classes , but an English major is not required to take any Engineering classes , we can verify that the engineering student is being effectively required to subsidize the operation of the university 's English department .
The more one - way the mandated class requirements are for outside - of - major courses , the less valuable the particular field is , otherwise campus administrators would not need to effectively subsidize it so heavily to support its continued operation .
Since Craig Newmark led off his post with a humorous complaint written to Arizona State University President Michael Crow , we thought we'd take a look at the undergraduate outside of major course requirements for students in ASU 's Engineering department , since Engineering majors often rank at the top for real - world starting salaries for college graduates .
The table below presents the out - of - major class requirements we identified for ASU 's general Civil Engineering program and ASU 's English degree .
To be included in this table , the out - of - major classes could not be a prerequisite for an in - major class .
Some may overlap with in - major elective offerings .
Out - of - Major Course Requirements Category Civil Engineering ( Credits ) English ( Credits ) Basic ( Lab ) Science 3
Recommended options applicable to Civil Engineering , but not mandated .
3 " Cultural Diversity " Awareness 3 3
May be satisfied by overlap with In - Major electives .

Mathematics In - Major 3 Second Language None 9 Social Behavorial Sciences 6
Economics ( 3 ) is required .
6 Total Out - of - Major Credits Required ( Adjusted for Elective Requirement Overlaps ) 24 27
If we exclude the second language requirement for ASU 's English majors , which does not apply for ASU 's engineering students , we find that ASU 's Engineering majors are required to earn far more credits outside their discipline than are English majors , at 24 credits as opposed to 18 .
This difference demonstrates that English majors do not have to go as far outside their discipline to fully satisfy their academic program 's degree requirements .
Altogether , these requirements would suggest that ASU 's academic administrators rank the school 's Engineering programs above its English program , with little requirement to subsidize the engineering programs by compelling students outside the discipline to take classes within it .
Going back to the second language requirement for English majors , we do find that , in effect , English majors have to " pad out " their schedules to support / subsidize the school 's second language programs , with nearly the equivalent of an extra semester of work .
Meanwhile , the school 's " Awareness " requirements for both Engineering and English degrees ( spanning course topics involving Global , Historical , or Cultural Diversity " awareness " ) would seem to be a strong indication that without such mandates from the school 's administration , students would not pursue classes focusing on these areas , recognizing they possess little real benefit for progressing toward their academic goals .
The university could , we suppose , discontinue its efforts to offer such lowly - valued degree programs , eliminating the need to subsidize these academic departments through forcing students outside these disciplines to take classes within them .
For many university administrators however , this would mean acknowledging that their vision of being a " world - class " institution is flawed , which we suspect makes this otherwise reasonable and realistic step unlikely to occur .
Never mind that sustaining such programs does at least as much damage , if not more damage , to their institution 's " world - class " aspirations .

But in all fairness , McCain is n’t very good at economics .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The Arizona Republican and presumptive presidential nominee today urged Congress to institute a “ gas-tax holiday ” by suspending the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.4 cent diesel tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day … .
Relief — or fewer jobs ?
According to a white paper circulated on Capitol Hill last week by the U.S. Transportation Department , every $ 1 billion of federal highway investment supports 34,779 jobs .
Many economists have also questioned the wisdom of suspending or cutting gas taxes ; doing so , they say , simply stimulates more consumption of gasoline .
Russia is reversing its population decline , which began before the Cold War ended , and accelerated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Births were up 14 percent last year ( to 1.6 million ) , over 2006 .
At its worst , a few years ago , the Russian population was declining 750,000 a year .
A growing economy , more health consciousness and more pro-family laws have all contributed to this .
Still , it will be another decade or two before the decline will halt .
By then , the Russian population will be under 140 million .
It went down 200,000 last year , to 142 million .
At this rate , it would be under 100 million by 2050 .
That , however , is being reversed .
Russia will not go to war if Georgia or Ukraine join NATO , but will be unhappy with such a move .
This could lead to more troops on the borders .
Russia does n't get it , that neighbors want to join NATO for protection from Russia .
Historically , being a neighbor of Russia has not been a good thing .
Russian oil production is declining , after peaking at 9.86 million barrels a day .
This came about because , during the re-nationalization of the oil industry over the last decade , there was a sharp drop in money spent on oil exploration .
Foreign banks were reluctant to invest the enormous amounts of money needed ( about a trillion dollars ) when Russia was so blatantly violating property rights .
Russia will either have to fund the exploration itself ( which will mean less money for other economic expansion projects ) or allow foreign investors more control of their Russian investments .
April 21 , 2008 : Georgia released video showing a Russian MiG - 29 firing a missile at a Georgian UAV over Abkhazia .
Russia denied it .
Russia has troops stationed in Abkhazia , a breakaway region of Georgia .
Relations between Russia and Georgia have not been good since the Cold War ended , and Georgia ( which is just south of Chechnya ) became independent .
April 4 , 2008 : The U.S. sponsored ballistic missile defense system in Eastern Europe is a done deal .
Russia is not happy , but has agreed to tolerate it .
The system is mainly to protect Europe from Iranian missiles .
April 3 , 2008 : In Belarus , pro-democracy demonstrations resulted in police raids on independent media that reported it .
Some 30 journalists were arrested , and the independent media got the message .
Russia is a little more subtle in this department , but not by much .
When you think about the archetypal science fiction story , chances are you think of the bold explorer , setting foot on a newfound planet in the name of a secure homeworld .
But possibly the most pervasive narrative in science fiction is actually the story of refugees .
They flee from planetary destruction , war , or just from overcrowding and ecological crappitude .
The refugee story is the flipside of the gung - ho explorer story , but it might actually be the most uniquely science fictional story of all .

The alien visitor from a doomed world :

The most famous refugee in science fiction is probably Superman , who gets sent to safety when his home planet Krypton is destroyed .
It 's no coincidence that Superman is also the posterboy for assimilation — his " real " family is the Kents of Kansas , and he thinks of himself as an American .
He gets to live the refugee 's dream , being totally accepted into a prosperous new world — plus he 's physically and mentally superior to everyone else around him , which is a plus .
He 's the embodiment of the melting pot , even as he has the power to melt you .
( And of course , his creators Siegel & Schuster were the sons of poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe , mainly Lithuania and Ukraine . )
Doctor
Who , meanwhile , has the same alien - world story as Superman , but without the assimilation .
The Doctor , in the early episodes from 1963 , drops hints about being on the run and in hiding , but does n't explain further .
The show 's creators had a vague sense , originally , that he was fleeing a space war .
But by the time it 's explained in 1969 , the explanation is much more benign : the Doctor 's species are dicks .
( No , not Terrance Dicks .
Just dicks . )

It 's not until the show 's 42nd birthday that we get back to the idea that he 's fleeing a space war ( upgraded to a time war . )
And his planet has been destroyed , just like Superman's .
But like I mentioned , he does n't assimilate with Earth / British culture — even though he constantly takes on weird British affectations like jelly babies or cricket , they only make him seem like more of an outsider .
He 's like those Indian immigrants in the TV show Goodness Gracious Me , who anglicize their names and try to be more British than everyone else , only to look more out of place than ever .
In many ways , the Doctor is the anti-Superman .

The protagonist who 's fleeing war or genocide :
There are also tons of characters who flee a doomed or destroyed Earth , including Arthur Dent in the Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy series .
And John Varley 's novels frequently take place in a universe where humans have been forced to flee an Earth invaded by aliens , and have colonized the rest of the solar system as a result .
Advertisement
And then there 's Hope Hubris , the hero of Piers Anthony 's Bio Of A Space Tyrant series .
As the first book 's title , Refugee , suggests , Hubris starts out as a humble refugee from the moon Callisto , fleeing to Jupiter , where his family gets killed horribly .
This starts him on his path towards becoming the " Tyrant of Jupiter . "
The rag - tag fleet of humans :
And then there are plenty of stories in which a straggling mob of people flees from a disaster or massacre in space .
Maybe the most critically acclaimed SF show right now — if not the most popular — is Battlestar Galactica , where the Cylons drive the humans out of their homeworld not once , but twice : on Caprica , and then on New Caprica .
At the end of season three , Lee Adama makes a huge speech in which he says this has changed humanity from a civilization to a " gang , " on the run and doing whatever it takes to survive .
Advertisement
Less organized rabbles also turn up , fleeing wars or political unrest , in books like C.J. Cherryh's Downbelow Station , where swarms of refugees pack into Pell Station in the wake of conflict between the Earth Company and outer stations .
And a mob of refugees from a disaster that befalls the H9 colony swarms aboard a cruise ship , only to be exploited by the media , in Eric Idle 's The Road To Mars .
The TV show Babylon 5 is also full of refugee crises , like the people fleeing the Vorlon attack on Ventari III in " Falling Towards Apotheosis . "
( We also see a ship full of refugees under attack in the first regular episode , " Midnght On The Firing Line . " )

Eco-refugees or disaster survivors on Earth :
Every eco-disaster narrative or post - apocalyptic story includes some kind of refugee motif , with people fleeing the destroyed cities or trying to find a safe haven .
Like The Day After Tomorrow , The Postman , Waterworld , or Mad Max .
Or Steven Gould 's novel Blind Waves .
The Martian attacks in War Of The Worlds spawn a huge fleet of refugee ships running away from the carnage .
Islanders flee rising sea levels , only to drown or wind up in horrible refugee boat camps , in the 2002 young adult novel Exodus .
And of course , there are tons of refugees from the collapsing nations of the world , seeking sanctuary in the U.K. , in Children Of Men .
Not to mention the Raft of refugees organized by telecommunications magnate L. Bob Rife in Neal Stephenson 's Snow Crash .

One of the most arresting moments in the TV show Jericho is when our heroes find the remains of a refugee train a mile wide , made by people fleeing the frozen north .
The refugees have left their icy dead where they lay .
( Not to mention the whole gaggle of refugees who settle in Jericho , only to face expulsion again . )
Advertisement
Survivalists :
And the survivalist narrative is a huge part of science fiction .
Robert Heinlein not only wrote the novel Farnham 's Freehold , about people surviving a nuclear war , but according to the source of all lies , he also wrote " How To Be A Survivor " and other essays on surviving nuclear war .
Frederik Pohl deals with similar themes in his story " Fermi And Frost . "
Also , Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle write about a group of survivors barricading themselves into a mountain retreat after a deadly comet strike , in Lucifer 's Hammer .
Plus there 's The Survivors , the TV show Terry Nation made between his work on Doctor Who and Blake 's 7 ( which is also a refugee show , sort of . )
Advertisement
And then there are the narratives about people going on the run from repressive regimes .
Like Logan 's Run , where Logan flees the non -stop beautiful - people orgy where they kill you when you reach 30 , in search of the mythical Sanctuary .
( And in the Logan 's Run TV series , he 's just on the run , every week , with a rogue android .
In Roger McBride Allen 's The Ring Of Charon , Marcia MacDougal can only escape from the repressive Naked Purple movement , which has taken over a lunar penal colony , by being declared a refugee when her house burns down .

Fleeing from the future :
And finally there are refugees in time — sort of like the Doctor , except they 're fleeing a particular oppressive future through time travel .
Just type " refugee from the future " into Google ( with the quotation marks ) and you get a bunch of weird stories — including various X - Men who have journeyed back to our time to escape one of those Mutants - in - concentration - camps dystopian futures .
Advertisement
I feel as though I 've just scratched the surface of science fiction 's nearly endless store of refugees here — this post could be twice as long .
But these seem to be the main types of refugees in science fiction , and I was somewhat surprised by how many of them I turned up when I started looking .
Advertisement
History is full of mass evacuations and displacements , and we 've gotten pretty used to the sight of streams of humans struggling across an unforgiving landscape with whatever they can carry , trying to escape from something or other .
But it seems pretty likely the 21st century will see more refugee crises than ever before , as the number of humans on the planet continues to skyrocket and there are more ecological disasters and wars over scarce resources .
There will be more and more refugees — possibly including you .
And science fiction is uniquely suited to tell the stories of these fleeing people , because the stark reality of the refugee condition is so awful , we need metaphors to cover it .
It 's easier to think about people running away from an exploding planet than it is to think about grabbing what you can and running from your home before you get ethnically cleansed .
A dollop of escapism — or , in the case of Superman , a truckload — helps us swallow the unthinkable .

Computer monitors in standby mode will soon save far more energy .
Fujitsu Siemens Computers has developed the world ’s first monitor that requires no electricity at all in idle mode .
The innovation is based on a new switch in the monitor that shuts it down entirely when the computer signal is absent and turns it on again when the signal reappears .
With this switch , the display saves several euros per year in power costs .
Beginning in the summer of 2008 , this “ zero - watt monitor ” will be sold for the price of a conventional monitor .
Computer monitors in standby mode will soon save far more energy .
Fujitsu Siemens Computers has developed the world ’s first monitor that requires no electricity at all in idle mode .
The innovation is based on a new switch in the monitor that shuts it down entirely when the computer signal is absent and turns it on again when the signal reappears .
With this switch , the display saves several euros per year in power costs .
Beginning in the summer of 2008 , this “ zero - watt monitor ” will be sold for the price of a conventional monitor .
At the end of a work day , the same routine occurs in most offices when the computer is shut down .
But the monitor usually stays on — it automatically enters standby mode when there is no signal from the computer .
Despite the minimal power consumption , this idle mode can entail tens of thousands of euros in additional power costs per year for large companies with several thousand computers .
The zero - watt monitor from Fujitsu Siemens Computers was chosen as “ Innovation of the Year ” at this year ’s CeBIT computer trade show .
The primary component is a circuit element in the power supply unit of the monitor that is switched by the PC .
As soon as the video signal of the computer subsides , a relay — an electrically powered switch — with two switching positions automatically interrupts the entire electrical circuit of the monitor .
When the computer signal returns again , the low currents that then begin to flow across the interface are sufficient to trigger the relay and thereby restart the monitor .
The zero - watt monitor , which will initially be marketed to corporate customers beginning in the summer of 2008 , adds to the range of “ green ” IT products sold by Fujitsu Siemens Computers .
This is another component of the long - term strategy of the company , which also stresses environmental compatibility in its laptops , PCs and servers .
Several years ago , for instance , some of the Esprimo Professional PCs were the first systems to be certified with the “ Blue Angel ” environmental label .
The Esprimo P Energy Saving Edition , uses as little as around 87 kilowatt hours in its standard configuration , less than half of the 183 kWh needed on average by nearly four - year - old office PCs .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq said on Friday it would not grant U.S. troops freedom of movement for military operations in a new agreement being negotiated on extending the presence of American troops on its soil .

Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih said the United States wanted its forces to operate with no restrictions , but this was not acceptable to Iraq .
The United States is negotiating an agreement with Iraq aimed at giving a legal basis for U.S. troops to stay in Iraq after December 31 , when their United Nations mandate expires .
The negotiations are the subject of heated debate both in the United States and Iraq , where thousands have answered anti-American cleric Moqtada al - Sadr ’s call for weekly protests after Friday Muslim prayers .
While the Iraqi government has confirmed there are major differences between the two sides in the negotiations , few details of the sticking points have been made public .
“ What I can confirm now , with no hesitation , is that there will not be freedom of movement for American ( forces ) in Iraq , ” Salih told Arabiya television .
U.S. officials said this week they would not comment on the content of the negotiations .
But Western diplomats say it is unlikely the Americans would agree to any deal that would require them to seek permission from the Iraqi government for every military operation .
“ If we reach an agreement ... any American military movements should be in the framework of Iraqi approval and decisions and through consultations with the Iraqi side , ” Salih said .
STATUS OF FORCES
The “ status of forces ” agreement is similar to pacts the United States has with many other countries , setting out rules for U.S. military activity .
The talks have angered many Iraqis who suspect the United States of wanting to keep a permanent presence in Iraq .
But U.S. ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker on Thursday rejected such suggestions as “ flatly untrue ” .
Salih said the United States had asked Baghdad to maintain the U.S. military ’s current status , which does not require a green light from the Iraqi government for military operations .
“ The U.S. side asked to extend the existing status and the Iraqi side did n’t see any use of that , ” he said .
The Iraqi government ’s room to manoeuvre may be limited , however , by its dependence on U.S. firepower to secure its borders and tackle armed groups that defy its authority .
While U.S. officials say the Iraqi army ’s capabilities have improved in recent months , it is still dependent on the U.S. military for logistical and aerial support .
Iraqi security forces control only half of Iraq ’s 18 provinces .
Thousands of Iraqis protested in Baghdad ’s Sadr City , Sadr ’s main stronghold , and the southern holy Shi’ite cities of Kerbala and Najaf on Friday against the negotiations .
Some protesters carried placards rejecting “ permanent occupation ” .
U.S. and Iraqi officials are also negotiating a strategic framework agreement that defines long - term bilateral ties .
In Washington , a bipartisan group of U.S. senators complained to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates over what they said was a lack of consultation over the long - term agreement with Iraq .
In a letter to Rice and Gates , the four senators said Iraq had proposed “ significant changes ” to the agreements and the Bush administration had not followed through on its commitment to consult with Congress about these changes .
The letter was signed by senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and John Kerry of Massachusetts as well as Republican Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska .
Boots , the high street chemist , is becoming the country 's largest seller of quack medicine , according to Britain 's leading scientific expert on alternative therapies .
Talking at the Hay literary festival today , Edzard Ernst , professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University , is to criticise the company for selling alternative medicines , in particular more than 50 homeopathic remedies , which are shown by clinical trials to be no more effective than sugar pills .
Boots , which has 1,500 stores across the UK , stocks 55 homeopathic therapies , 34 of which are sold under the company 's own brand .
Ernst accuses the company of breaching ethical guidelines drawn up by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain , by failing to tell customers that its homeopathic medicines contain no active ingredients and are ineffective in clinical trials .
" The population at large trusts Boots more than any other pharmacy , but when you look behind the smokescreen , when it comes to alternative medicines , that trust is not justified .
You can buy a lot of rubbish , with covert advertising stating things that are overtly wrong .
People are spending their money on stuff that does n't work , " he said .
" Boots seems to be fast becoming the biggest seller of quack remedies in UK high streets . "
The ethical code for UK pharmacists states that those selling or supplying homeopathic and other complementary medicines must help patients make informed decisions by providing them with necessary and relevant information .
It also calls on pharmacists to " uphold public trust and confidence " by acting with honesty and integrity .
" This can only mean that pharmacists should tell their customers that a homeopathic remedy they are about to buy does n't contain a single molecule of whatever it says on the label , and that there 's no clinical evidence that it works beyond a placebo effect , " Ernst said .
Homeopathic remedies are highly diluted solutions that often contain no trace of their original ingredients .
Instead , homeopaths claim the treatments work because " healing energy " is imprinted into the water when it is shaken .
In 2006 , Sir Martin Rees , president of the Royal Society , said the possibility of a medicine working in this way would " entail some fundamentally new scientific principle with amazingly broad ramifications " .
" Very few people are aware that the underlying principles of homeopathy are totally scientifically implausible , and even fewer people are aware that the trials show it does n't do anything , " said Ernst .
The UK market for homeopathic medicine was estimated to be worth £ 38 m in 2007 and is expected to reach £ 46 m by 2012 , according to a report by research firm Mintel .
There are nearly 4,000 homeopathic practitioners in the UK and five NHS - funded homeopathic hospitals .
Ernst and science writer Simon Singh will base their Hay lecture on their recent book , Trick or Treatment ?
Alternative Medicine on Trial , but will use the event to highlight what they view as unethical behaviour by the company .
Boots has previously funded a fellowship at Ernst 's department at Exeter .
" People could end up harming themselves if they think one of these products will help them or their child , when in fact it 's only a placebo .
It 's certainly a rip - off and they could be losing valuable time to see a doctor .
This makes a fool out of evidence - based medicine , it is back to the dark ages , " Ernst said .
Boots said that many of its customers believed that homeopathic remedies provide health benefits .
" Homeopathy is recognised by the NHS , and many doctors and other health professionals see it as a useful option for medical treatment , " said a spokesman .
" In addition , many of our customers also choose to use homeopathy .
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain issues guidance to pharmacists on provision of homeopathy and homeopathic preparations to ensure that the sale and supply is appropriate . "

Last year there was a bit of a fuss when comedian Joe Rogan accused Carlos Mencia of stealing jokes .
Amusingly , Mencia responded to the claims of plagiarism by using a copyright infringement claim to get Rogan 's video of the accusation taken down .
However , in a more detailed discussion of the issue , we pointed out how silly it is to claim a copyright on a joke .
There are a ton of joke books out there , many of which collect all kinds of jokes that have been told by many people , without bothering to find the originator and pay them ( or even credit them ) .
In fact , with most jokes , it 's not the joke that matters , but the delivery .
As I noted , I had recently read Isaac Asimov 's " Treasury of Humor " where he admits that almost all of the jokes are ones he heard from others -- and no one seemed to think it was infringing .
However , that did n't stop Jay Leno and some other comedians from suing a woman who published a recent joke book that included some Leno jokes .
Rather than go through a lawsuit , the woman and her publisher quickly settled the lawsuit paying an undisclosed sum and publicly apologizing .
This leads William Patry to put together some details of other court cases looking into the copyrights of jokes , noting that Jeff Foxworthy sued someone for using his jokes , even though he admits people send joke ideas to him that he uses .
All of this seems to be an unfortunate extension of the increasing use of copyright to " control " every last use of content .
Telling jokes is a social experience , often having little to do with the material itself , and quite a lot to do with the performance and delivery .
Witness the movie The Aristocrats , where the entire premise is getting a bunch of different comedians to all tell the same joke , and looking at the different performances and embellishments .
No one screamed about copyright infringement in that case -- and the comedians seemed to relish the chance to tell the same joke in many different ways .
It 's unfortunate that we 're now reaching the point that something that used to be a shared experience is also going down the path to being protected and limited .

Key molecule discovered in Venus 's atmosphere
Venus Express has detected the molecule hydroxyl on another planet for the first time .
This detection gives scientists an important new tool to unlock the workings of Venus ’s dense atmosphere .
Hydroxyl , an important but difficult - to - detect molecule , is made up of a hydrogen and oxygen atom each .
It has been found in the upper reaches of the Venusian atmosphere , some 100 km above the surface , by Venus Express ’s Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer , VIRTIS .
The elusive molecule was detected by turning the spacecraft away from the planet and looking along the faintly visible layer of atmosphere surrounding the planet ’s disc .
The instrument detected the hydroxyl molecules by measuring the amount of infrared light that they give off .
The band of atmosphere in which the glowing hydroxyl molecules are located is very narrow ; it is only about 10 km wide .
By looking at the limb of the planet , Venus Express looked along this faint atmospheric layer , increasing the signal strength by about 50 .
Hydroxyl is thought to be important for any planet ’s atmosphere because it is highly reactive .
On Earth it has a key role in purging pollutants from the atmosphere and is thought to help stabilise the carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere , preventing it from converting to carbon monoxide .
On Mars it is also thought to play a vital role in sterilising the soil , making the top layers hostile to microbial life .
The reactive molecule has been seen around comets , but the method of production there is thought to be completely different from the way it forms in planetary atmospheres .
“ Because the venusian atmosphere had not been studied extensively before Venus Express arrived on the scene , we have not been able to confirm much of what our models tell us by observing what is actually happening .
This detection will help us refine our models and learn much more , ” says one of the Principal Investigators of the VIRTIS experiment , Giuseppe Piccioni , from the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica in Rome , Italy .
On Earth , the glow of hydroxyl in the atmosphere has been shown to be closely linked to the abundance of ozone .
From this study , the same is thought to be true at Venus .
Now , scientists can set about estimating the amount of ozone in the planet ’s atmosphere .
Venus Express has shown that the amount of hydroxyl at Venus is highly variable .
It can change by 50 % from one orbit to the next and this may be caused by differing amounts of ozone in the atmosphere .
“ Ozone is an important molecule for any atmosphere , because it is a strong absorber of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun , ” says Piccioni .
The amount of the radiation absorbed is a key parameter driving the heating and dynamics of a planet ’s atmosphere .
On Earth , it heats the stratosphere ( layer of the atmosphere ) making it stable and protecting the biosphere from harmful ultraviolet rays .
Computer models will now be able to tell how this jump and drop in ozone levels over short intervals affects the restless atmosphere of that world .
“ Venus Express has already shown us that Venus is much more Earth - like than once thought .
The detection of hydroxyl brings it a step closer , ” says Piccioni .
He and his colleagues are only reporting the initial detection from a few orbits in their latest paper .
They are working on the analysis of data from about 50 other orbits and more observations will follow .
Not surprisingly , you get the nerdiest surfboard ever .
The " Shredder " surfboard was designed by a computer programmer named Mike Sheldrake after he decided to replace his old board .
Since he did not possess the skills necessary to make a board the traditional way , he decided to use 3 - D modeling software to design a snap - together deck built out of 400 pieces of computer cut corrugated cardboard then shellac it with fiberglass and epoxy resin .
Thanks to a mathematically sound triangular pattern , force is evenly dispersed throughout the board — making it incredibly strong .

Sheldrake has already sold one of his creations to a pro surfer and he plans on improving his technique to develop boards that are stronger , lighter and more flexible .
To that end , he hopes to have a product site launched in the near future where customers can custom design their own boards .
And , since they are made from inexpensive materials , it should make a day of surfing at the beach a lot more affordable .

Okay sports fans , what was Governor Mike Huckabee and Congressman Ron Paul doing in the presidential race even after the verdict was clear that Senator John McCain had won the Republican nomination ?
Answer ?
They were collecting names and addresses .
Sure , everyone said John McCain had won but Huck kept acting dumb and saying , “ Well , it is n’t over till it ’s over and he has n’t actually clinched it yet . ”
And that was all the rationale he needed to keep puttering along .
There was one big southern state left , Texas , a state with a ton of evangelical , Southern Baptist voters and he had to keep the train going that long , if possible .
And it was Ron Paul ’s home state .
By staying in the race both men were adding those Texas names and addresses to their data base for the future .
Well , you say , why did n’t candidates do that in the past ?
They tried .
They have always tried .
But not many candidates have a readymade , built in constituency .
Ron Paul has a political movement going for himself .
There has been nothing like it since Goldwater .
And Huck is the only choice for Evangelicals who are spurned by media and other candidates .
In years past , on the Democrat side , Black candidates have stuck around long after they should have pulled out , just to collect names .
There was a reason .
And in 1988 , Evangelical Pat Robertson kept hanging on in his effort to win the Republican nomination .
He wanted to stay in the race at least through California , with its population of born again Christians in Orange County , but he could n’t do it .
The Robertson Campaign had virtually taken over the Arizona State Republican Party and would have likely produced an effective late ambush in that state but it was too far off .
The nomination was decided early and Robertson ’s persistence would have looked divisive and stubborn .
The pressure was on .
He dropped out .
This election cycle was different .
So many primaries had been moved up , so early , including most of the voter rich states of the born again – conservative South , that both Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul were able to create a rationale to stay in and build a data base .
And what will they do with it ?
They will raise money , of course .
If Huckabee had had money this time , he would have arguably won South Carolina and the nomination .
Governor Mike Huckabee , like him or not , is the future of the Evangelical wing of the Republican Party because he now has “ the list . ”
And whatever anyone says about Ron Paul , his so called “ fringe , ” is the only political movement left with a systematic argument for the role of government .
He talks about strategic issues , while all the rest quibble over tactics .
There is no question that the Paulists now have the intellectual and moral power .
They are ignored or ridiculed because no one can answer their arguments .
And those arguments , left unanswered , will only cause their movement to grow .
Ironically , CNN , whose Wolf Blitzer - John King coverage was at times dead on accurate , and seemingly agenda free , was the only network to understand this .
They created real diversity and brought on a Black evangelical pundit who offered more sense on Huckabee in five minutes , than all the other BAF ( Born Again Free ) networks had done in two years of reporting .
But none of the networks did justice to Ron Paul simply because they could n’t find anyone to argue against his positions .
The public wanted data on the horse race , the issues be damned .
What ’s next ?
Sometime , when all of this settles down , after McCain has not picked Mike Huckabee as his running mate , Huck will announce his Political Action Committee .
We will hear a lot from Mike Huckabee next time around .
His is a personal campaign .
And Ron Paul ?
His is a campaign of ideas .
His enemies in the political arena and in the media will come to realize too late that they made a mistake by ignoring him this past election cycle .
His army was left unchallenged on the battlefield .
Now their ideas have taken root and they will grow .
After the years of Obmamania are passed and Huckabee ’s quixotic challenge four years later is exhausted , Ron Paul ’s movement will still be maturing .
Obama , Clinton , McCain and in four years , Huckabee , will own the headlines for now .
But Ron Paul owns the future .

Ms Skrlova faces serious charges of child abuse
A Czech woman charged with deceiving a children 's home into thinking she was a 13 - year - old girl has been found not guilty by a court in the city of Brno .
The court said Barbora Skrlova , who along with five others is believed to belong to a secretive cult , meant no ill - will towards the children 's home .
But Ms Skrlova , aged 33 , was immediately re-arrested to face more serious charges of child abuse .
Ms Skrlova went on the run after the child abuse case erupted .
She re-appeared months later in Norway , where she posed as a 13 - year - old boy .
The child abuse case is one of the most bizarre and sinister in modern Czech history .
The Czech media has been haunted by the face - or rather faces - of Barbora Skrlova for over a year .
Victim or participant ?
Initially , she appeared as a shy , 13 - year - old girl called Anicka , with thick glasses and brown hair tied up in pigtails .
Then there was the shaved head and dark , sunken eyes of Adam , the 13 - year - old Czech schoolboy who turned up in the Norwegian capital , Oslo .
And finally a pale , nervous - looking woman wearing a woolly hat and clutching a teddy bear , being led away by police at Prague Airport .
It is alleged that Ms Skrlova , a woman posing as her adopted mother , and four other adults are all part of a secretive cult founded by her father .
The cult theory might explain why Ms Skrlova - who appears to be a deeply disturbed young woman - keeps changing her personality .
It could also explain why her so - called adopted mother kept her two young sons locked naked in a broom cupboard and subjected them to terrible abuse .
One of the boys found in the broom cupboard had been beaten , tortured and forced to eat his own vomit .
The court must determine whether Ms Skrlova was , as she maintains , a victim of abuse or a willing participant .
The case is expected to begin in June .
( FORTUNE Small Business ) -- Craig Calfee realized the strength of bamboo while using a stick of the stuff to lift his 60 - pound dog , who had gripped it playfully in his jaws .
That experience led Calfee , a maker of elite carbon - fiber bicycles , to wonder whether bamboo could support human riders .
He spent a week cutting , smoking , and gluing the material into a bicycle frame , then rolled the prototype into a trade show .
That was in 1996 .
Today Calfee Design , based in La Selva Beach , Calif. , sells the bamboo bikes , whose frames weigh just four pounds , for $ 2,695 each .
They account for more than a quarter of its $ 1 million in annual sales .
" Serious bikers like them because they 're high - performance frames , " says Calfee , 45 .
" Environmentally conscious people like them because making them burns less carbon . "
This month he brings his bikes to Ghana , in western Africa , to teach local craftsmen how to utilize their abundant bamboo .
The endeavor is philanthropic , but Calfee hopes African framemakers will profit from his design .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Remember that big ah - ha moment in the 1939 classic " The Wizard of Oz ? " Dorothy wants to see the Wizard .
His voice booms : " Do not arouse the wrath of the Great and Powerful Oz !
Come back tomorrow ! "
Afraid , Lion , Tin Man , Scarecrow shake .
Dorothy 's dog runs up , tugs on a curtain .
She chases Toto , pulls curtain open :
" Who are you ? " Dr. Marvel stutters : " Well , I - I - I am the Great and Powerful , Wizard of Oz . "
Dorothy : " You are ?
I do n't believe you ! "
He replies : " No , it 's true .
There 's no other Wizard except me . "
Dorothy 's miffed : " Oh , you 're a very bad man ! "
Wizard : " Oh , no , my dear .
I 'm a very good man .
I 'm just a very bad Wizard . "
2009 Sequel : Script exposes diabolical cover - up conspiracy
Flash forward : Real life , Washington , new leaders , a new Congress , old wizardry .
Be forewarned :
No matter who 's elected president , America will soon see a massive statistical curtain pulled back , exposing a con game of historic proportions .
And when that happens , you and I will suffer another ear - splitting global meltdown , bigger than today 's housing - credit crisis , dragging us deep into a recession and bear market for years .
Cast : New ' leading man ' from old Nixon political machine
Yes , the lead character pulling back the curtain is none other than Kevin Phillips , a former Republican strategist for Nixon , and today America 's leading political historian .
Phillips just published " Bad Money : Reckless Finance , Failed Politics & the Crisis of American Capitalism , " everything you need to know about today 's credit meltdown .
Scene 1 : Numbers racket hiding behind Washington curtain
Opening shot : Phillips pulling back the curtain , exposing charlatan Wizards in a brilliant Harper 's Magazine article : " Numbers Racket :
Why the economy is worse than we know . "
Far worse .
Buy it , read it -- this is essential reading if you really want to understand the depth of today 's political as well as economic impending meltdown , and the harsh realities facing Washington , Wall Street , Corporate America , and Main Street in 2009 and beyond ... harsh because we cannot cover up the truth much longer .
Scene 2 : Statistics , Washington 's new WMDs , a time bomb
" If Washington 's harping on weapons of mass destruction was essential to buoy public support for the invasion of Iraq , the use of deceptive statistics has played its own vital role in convincing many Americans that the U.S. economy is stronger , fairer , more productive , more dominant , and richer with opportunity than it really is .
The corruption has tainted the very measures that most shape public perception of the economy , " especially three key numbers , CPI , GDP and monthly unemployment statistics .
Scene 3 : Backflash , ' It 's always the cover - up , stupid ! '
As I read further I could n't help but think about similar traps politicians get themselves ( and us ) into .
Remember nice guys like Scooter Libby and Bill Clinton :
The crime was n't their original stupidity , but their lying during the cover - up .
Here , Phillips reviews endless statistical cover-ups since the 1960s and concludes there was no " grand conspiracy , just accumulating opportunisms . "
I call it plain old greed .
And every step of the way the media went along with the con game played by politicians and economists .
Scene 4 : Real numbers torture us ... like water - boarding !
How bad is it ?
" The real numbers ... would be a face full of cold water , " says Phillips .
" Based on the criteria in place a quarter century ago , today 's U.S. unemployment rate is somewhere between 9 % and 12 % ; the inflation rate is as high as 7 % or even 10 % ; economics growth since the recession of 2001 has been mediocre , despite the surge in wealth and incomes of the superrich , and we are falling back into recession . "
Scene 5 : Most economists hushed , work inside conspiracy
Compare that to the phony stats Washington feeds the press and public : Unemployment 5 % , inflation 2 % and long - term growth at 3 % - 4 % ( actually more like 1 % ) .
For example , just last week the L.A .
Times reported that while " gasoline prices are up more than 20 % from a year ago and food prices have risen 5 % , " Washington says " inflation was fairly mild last month . "
A Wells Fargo economist shook his head in disbelief :
That report is n't " worth the paper it was printed on . "
Most economists are quiet , working for the conspiracy .
Scene 6 : No integrity , they can not be trusted to tell truth !
The same can be said of any government report , every speech made by today 's leaders :
All hype , lies and propaganda intended to deceive us .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's clearly playing the game : Remember what the former Goldman Sachs CEO told Fortune last July as our credit meltdown was metastasizing into a worldwide contagion : " This is far and away the strongest global economy I 've seen in my business lifetime . "
He has no credibility .
He knew the truth .
He knew the government 's " numbers racket ; " after all , he helped create the problems years earlier at Goldman .
Scene 7 : There 's enough Kool - Aid for everyone to drink
The plot 's unraveling :
The lies accumulate and compound one on top of the another ... get passed on ... keep mounting ... forcing successive new generations of politicians to drink the same poisonous Kool - Aid ... keep the lies alive ... going strong ... till everyone believes the lies are really " the truth , " or at least an inconvenient truth ... as the hoax becomes the conventional wisdom ... not only by Washington , Wall Street , Corporate America and the media , but also 300 million Main Street Americans .
Scene 8 : Inflation statistics are America 's new ' guillotine '
The biggest of all lies is with inflation .
Understating inflation " hangs over our heads like a guillotine , " says Phillips .
Yet if Washington told us the truth " it would send interest rates climbing and thereby would endanger the viability of the massive buildup of public and private debt ( from less than $ 11 trillion in 1987 to $ 49 trillion last year ) that props up the American Economy . "
So we keep sipping the Kool - Aid .
Scene 9 : Washington and Wall Street delusional in ' Land of Oz '
" Were mainstream interest rates to jump into the 7 % to 9 % range -- which could happen if inflation were to spur new concern -- both Washington and Wall Street could be walking on quicksand , " warns Phillips .
" The make - believe economy of the past two decades , with its asset bubbles , massive borrowing , and rampant data distortion , would be in serious jeopardy . "
Scene 10 : Cover - up failing ... king really has no clothes
Yet everyone still acts paralyzed , unable ( or unwilling ) to do anything to stop this lethal musical chairs charade ... till it 's too late , or a catastrophe wakes us .
Meanwhile , we act as if we had no choice but to put up with the crashes of 1987 and 2001 and 2007 .
Just " normal " bull / bear cycles .
So like lemmings driven over a cliff , we 'll blindly accept the next crashes , as each increase in frequency and intensity .
Next in 2011 ?
As war debt piles ?
As reforming health care , Social Security and Medicare are delayed ?
As we deny and deceive ourselves , perpetuate the lie ... except notice , out of the corner of your eye , at the edge of the screen , a curtain 's being pulled open , slowly , our once - mighty statistical king , the Wizard of Washington really has no clothes on .
Scene 11 : Millions of co-conspirators in massive cover-up
Still , we let ourselves be conned .
Why ?
" The rising cost of pensions , benefits , and interest payments -- all indexed or related to inflation -- could join the cost of financial bailouts to overwhelm the federal budget , " says Phillips .
But it 's a heads - we - lose - tails - we - ca n 't - win bet .
" As inflation and interest rates have been kept artificially suppressed , the United States has been indentured to its volatile financial sector , with its predilection for leverage and risky buccaneering "
Yes , Wall Street and the rich love playing this game .
Scene 12 : Rich get richer hiding under ' statistical camouflage '
So who really " profits from the low - growth U.S. economy hidden under statistical camouflage ? " he asks rhetorically .
Certainly not the masses : " Might it be Washington politicos and affluent elite , anxious to mislead voters , coddle the financial markets , and tamp down expensive cost - of - living increases for wages and pensions ? "
Yes , yes , yes , a voice screams off - camera !
Then a gun shot rings out ... dull thud ... silence ... haunting music builds , filling the theater ... signaling the end of this tragi-comedy ... although like Sartre 's " No Exit , " you know this drama will never end ... until ... the next sequel ...
Roll credits :
Who was that masked man ?
Kudos to the masked curtain - puller .
Yes folks , it 's the same Kevin Phillips who wrote " American Theocracy , The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion , Oil , and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century ; " " The Politics of Rich and Poor : Wealth and Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath ; " " American Dynasty : Aristocracy , Fortune , and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush " and others .
In his " Wealth and Democracy : A Political History of the American Rich , " Phillips warned us that " most great nations , at the peak of their economic power , become arrogant and wage great world wars at great cost , wasting vast resources , taking on huge debt , and ultimately burning themselves out . "
Slowly , fade to black ....

Advertisement A former soldier has described how he dragged a police officer away from a mob of Rangers fans in Manchester .
Tom Bardsley said he feared Pc Mick Regan would not get away from the group , who were acting like a " pack of wolves who had not been fed for days " .
Mr Bardsley , 23 , dragged the officer along the street before throwing him in a police van around the corner .
The violent scenes followed Wednesday 's Uefa Cup final between the Glasgow team and Zenit St Petersburg , who won 2 - 0 .
Pc Regan 's ordeal was captured by CCTV following the violence which started after Rangers lost the game .
He was pursued down the street in Manchester city centre by a mob of about 20 Rangers fans before being tripped and set upon .
The adrenaline just kicked in
Tom Bardsley
Pc describes mob attack Man Utd parade cancelled On Saturday , Mr Bardsley described how he pushed a youth away before grabbing Pc Regan and pulling him down the street .
The father - of - one , from Openshaw , Greater Manchester had just left an internet cafe in Newton Street when the violence broke out .
He said he saw a man running towards Pc Regan " aiming a kick " and jumped into action .
Mr Bardsley , who served in the 26 Engineer Regiment at Bulworth Garrison , said he had served in a number of war zones but had witnessed nothing like the scenes in Manchester .
" I would describe it as wolves who had not been fed for days .
I did not think of any danger to me just the safety of others and making sure everyone was getting out okay , " he said .
" I knew that if no - one was going to get him ( the officer ) he was n't going to make it .
I thought ' sod it '
I did not care that bottles and bricks were being thrown at me .
The adrenaline just kicked in . "
City ' like Basra ' But Mr Bardsley did not end his heroics there - a short time later he helped a water rescue team pull a Rangers fan from a canal .
And later , he pulled an unconscious man from the mass of rubbish left across the city , threw him over his shoulder and sprinted 150 m to a nearby ambulance .
Finally , he chased away two men in Rangers shirts who were looting a police van .
Mr Bardsley said he did not think anything of his actions until the CCTV coverage of Pc Regan was splashed across news bulletins .
" The next day the city centre looked like a scene from Basra - like a bomb had hit it .
I was angry that the Rangers fans had done this . "
He went to Longsight Police Station , where Pc Regan was based , to check on his condition and was thanked by a police superintendent , but is yet to meet the officer again in person .
" My ambition is to work in either the ambulance service or the police force .
The superintendent told me if I have ever applied in his area he would give me a job straight away , " he said .
Wednesday 's trouble first flared in Piccadilly Gardens after a technical fault with a big screen left up to 20,000 fans frustrated .
Riot police were sent in as violent clashes broke out along nearby Market Street , Oldham Street and Newton Street .
Manchester United 's planned homecoming parade after next week 's Champions League final has been cancelled , partly in response to the scenes of disorder .

What are these ?
Today ’s workforce is a diverse mix of generations that each come with their collective background and value systems .
Understanding their unique perspectives is important in a large organization where they are likely to be working side by side .
Professor at the Instituto de Empresa in Madrid , Spain , Cristina Simón ’s study Generation Y and the Labor Market : Models for HR Management , address differences in generational values .
Simón looked at our generations of workers , analyzed their values and suggested ways for businesses to get people working together .
Four Generations and Their Values
Traditional Workers ( born before 1946 / over 60 ) value loyalty and discipline .
These workers tend to respect authority .
They have accomplished a lot and contributed to success under hierarchical systems of the past .
Raised during wartime and the postwar period , they adapted to an environment of scarcity , valuing austerity .
Social goals of peace and national prosperity are important to this group .
As a rule they are pragmatic and disciplined .
Baby Boomers ( 1946 - 1960 / late 40s and up ) expect success .
These are the people running the major corporations right now .
They invented the workaholic , or at least a lot of them suffer from its effects .
Baby boomers created strong social change including the hippie movement , feminism , and civil rights .
They are optimistic and self - motivated .
Management ranks today are dominated by Boomers and older Gen Xers .
Together , they define corporate cultures and success within them .
Generation X ( 1961 -1979/30s and 40s ) has the advantage of the best academic training and international experience in history .
They are breaking with traditional patterns , including creating informal work environments and transforming corporate structures from hierarchical into horizontal and flexible entities .
Personal initiative and a healthy dose of skepticism toward large organizations has produced a lot of entrepreneurs from this generation .
A key value of Generation X is the achievement of balance between career goals and quality of life .
Generation Y ( starting from 1980 / under 30 ) have lived their entire lives with information technology and they have a hard time comprehending a world without it .
Childhood was comfortable and prosperous .
They tend toward individual needs in favor of the community good and often demand a high level of autonomy .
What Generation Y lacks in loyalty , they make up for with the the value they place on relationships with co-workers and supervisors .
Can you relate ?
What kind of generational conflicts do you encounter at work ?
Welcome to Mike 's America , a view of news and opinion that has caught my attention .
You 're welcome to share your thoughts by commenting on posts .
Workers in the developing world facing higher prices have been increasingly vocal in demanding higher wages , with protests erupting in recent days in Vietnam , Cambodia and Egypt .
At the same time , inflation keeps rising : the Philippines announced that its inflation at the consumer level had doubled in the last five months , showing a 6.4 percent increase in March over the same month a year ago .
And weekly inflation at the wholesale level has accelerated in India , reaching an annual rate of 7 percent in the week ended March 22 , up from 3.1 percent as recently as last October .
Not long ago , it would have been unlikely for a poor country with high inflation to see its money strengthen in value against the mighty dollar .
But the dollar is not quite as mighty as it once was .
Large American trade deficits and other problems have weakened its appeal .
And there are signs that the dollar could fall further if developing countries ’ central banks stopped supporting it , particularly in Asia .
Vietnam ’s central bank even had to order the country ’s commercial banks late last month to resume buying dollars within the tight range of exchange rates set by the government .
Many banks had started betting on dollar depreciation and refusing to accept large sums in dollars , to the point that multinationals and exporters had trouble wiring money into the country to pay their employees ’ salaries .
Additionally , the dollar ’s weakness is itself a cause of inflation in developing countries , particularly those that have barely let their currencies rise against the dollar in an effort to hold on to export markets .
In a street market around the corner from the 270 - year - old Lungshan Temple in Taipei , Taiwan , Teresa Gau , a fishmonger , is charging up to a third more for fish and crabs than she did a year ago .
That is because fishing boat owners are charging her more as they struggle to cover higher costs for diesel fuel , which is priced in dollars .
Volkswagen is showing off its new Park Assist Vision technology at the Hanover Fair in Germany .
Unlike VW 's previous attempts , this version of Park Assist is fully automatic .
As such , the driver - turned - spectator can stand outside the car while the Passat maneuvers its way into cramped spots with the help of external cameras and proximity sensors .
The driver selects his space on the monitor of the navigation system and then sets the vehicle into " P " mode .
It 's just a trial for now so you 'll still have to get by with the ol ' bump - smile - n - flirt approach that 's gotten you and your Aquanet hair into the city up until now .

Yay !!!
I guess Oregon wo n't be a battleground state .
I hope to be working in one of those battleground states soon for the Obama campaign .
If I have a choice , which one should I pick ?
Ohio ? Florida ?
Indiana ?
Michigan ?

Far as I can tell this is probably the largest political rally in US history , certainly in Oregon history .
It makes the papers & MSM all over which is all find and dandy for Obama as I would prefer him to win over the other 2 .
Of course I would prefer McKinney to win over Obama but the MSM will make certain that never happens .
Approx 75,000 gather for a political rally and they rave .
Approx .
15 + MILLION gather WORLDWIDE on Feb 15th 2003 to protest Bush & the Illegal occupation of Iraq and not a word is mentioned in the MSM .
Approx .
350,000 + gather on Sept 24th 2005 to protest Bush the War and that 9/11 was an inside job and again the MSM is silent .
About 60 % of the US population and probably 80 % + of the world population KNOW that the last 2 pResidential S-elections were blatantly stolen and again the MSM is silent .
Now just who is the enemy here ?

Great pictures of the Obama rally here in PDX today .

Serious question :
Does anyone know of anybody else ever seeing these kind of numbers at a Primary rally before ?
In all of American history ?
No Brad , I think these numbers , when combined with his grass roots contributors , is seriously worth talking about in the historical context you suggest .
The reason is of course the voter rejection of the fascists .
This is a rejection election .
The Clinton campaign did not get it .
Her advisors were not aware of the revolution .
Same with the republicans .
Still !
They think the MSM and Obama supporters are liberals .
That is incredible !
That mistake is a compounded one , borne of the ignorance of knowing how sick to the right the GOP and the MSM have drifted .
The GOP and the MSM are clearly fascists who have descended to the right , and the people are left far behind .
What used to be the far left is now the middle of the road , and the radical lefties are so far from the right the radar is n't even picking them up .
IMPEACH THE BASTARDS is mainstream is very near to the middle .
GOOD !!!!!
But I do not think America will ever recover fully from the past decade of destruction and mayhem and the hands of the fascists .

And no sooner than it is ignored or poo pooed .

Since I live in Portland , it was good to see the coverage of the event .
The support for Obama around here is tremendous , and many consider him a " once- in - a- lifetime " candidate .
I am strongly in favor of the vote - by - mail system .
It is incredibly convenient , and you have weeks to analyze the ballot measures and candidates , filling out the form as you determine your choices .
No lines .
No skipping out on work .
There may be other issues I do n't know about , but I 'd say it 's a model system for elections in terms of convenience for the average American .

I am an Oregonian and I think mail - in ballots are terrific .
There may be problems with it , but when I consider hanging chads , I know it 's not the only system with problems .
Checks & balances have to be implemented for any system to catch cheating .
My first election I was all geared up to vote to re-elect Jimmy Carter .
Before I could get off work and to the voting booth , Regan was already being declared the winner .
It is heartbreaking to be told election after election that your vote is not going to count , that you might as well not vote .
That is what happens when the East coast closes three hours before us .
No one ever seemed to care that our voting had n't closed .
Now , with mail - in voting , we can actually get our ballots mailed in and vote for our choice for president , even the primaries , before being told who won .
And , as you can see from these pictures , Oregon might just count for something in this election !
Count me : glad we 're not punished anymore for where we live .

I look forward to Brad 's article on vote - by - mail to read about the HUGE problems with vote - by - mail .
As an Oregonian and a software engineer , I love vote - by - mail .
I cannot say that I have considered all of the issues with vote - by - mail carefully , so I want to hear about the problems .
In the last general election I compared the Oregon SOS web site participation rate to a sampling of other states SOS web sites , and could not find one that could compare to Oregon 's voter participation rate .
Also , when I compared reported problems in Oregon to the other states , the only problems I could find were registration issues , and a few people who could not find their polling place to vote the traditional way .
A couple of improvements I would like to see with Oregon 's vote - by - mail is the use of open source software , and a hand count sample to compare against the machines .

Right off the top of my head I have to say that vote - by - mail necessarily obviates exit polls , which are crucial to determining the likelihood of election fraud .
You can put in every safeguard in the world , but it wo n't insure against corrupt officials .
Only exit polls have the accuracy to determine if that 's a possibility at all .
Too many people seem content to take officials at their word on this sort of thing , and ....
Is everybody remembering that the occupant of the White House was n't elected for EITHER term ?
Do you remember Katherine Harris and Kenneth Blackwell ?
What if Oregon gets an SoS like that ?
Even if the system has all kinds of opportunities for audits built into it , how are people to know when they need to look for fraud if there are no exit polls ?

Hmmm .
Problem
I have with VOTE BY MAIL is that it 's a FRAUD VECTOR , in and of itself -- like absentees .
And correct me if I 'm wrong , but does n't VBM make the US POSTAL SERVICE responsible for the CHAIN OF CUSTODY ?
Not sure HOW to feel about that ...
I do n't fear too much for Oregon ( very interesting to read the comments above ! ) as the PROGRESSIVE NORTHWEST seems to have it MUCH more together than my sucky - stupid - silly state .
In fact , I 'd feel MUCH better if SUSAN and PATRIOTNW in Oregon led the pack , instead of say , NEW HAMPSHIRE .

Condidate McFeign and his self image preznit blush call Iraq progress ( " the hospitals are busy " ) , and they think our economy is advancing because the stock market has not collapsed .
Those who oppose them see themselves as progressives too .
In fact , anyone who thinks that their political direction is the correct direction is a progressive .
Since everyone is a progressive , it is a silly , empty word that does fit the EI movement in Amurka .

The problem with vote by mail is that there is a big black box called the USPS between the voters and the counting .
It 's pretty similar to electronic voting in that sense , even if people have a better understanding of physical security than electronic security .
Voter coercion is also much easier without isolated voting booths .
On the other hand , if you give up voter anonymity , it 's pretty easy to work out methods for eliminating large scale election fraud independent of the tallying system .
COMMENT # 19 [ Permalink ]
... Susan said on 5/20/2008 @ 8:58 am PT ...
Ah , but you do n't have to use the USPS .
There are always drop boxes available at various places : city halls , election offices and libraries .
Just like showing up and voting in person in years past , I can show up and drop my ballot in the box in person .
For those who do n't know , registered voters get their ballots in the mail .
Inside is the ballot and 2 envelopes .
One envelope is generic and the completed ballot is sealed in this one .
This envelope goes into a larger envelope that has the voter 's name and address on it .
The voter signs this envelope , just like signing in when voting at polling booths .
Officials can compare and check off voters on a list ; voters can't photocopy the outer envelope and vote more than once this way .
Once the voter is checked off , the envelope is opened and the sealed , now anonymous ballot , is passed on to be counted .
I had n't thought about exit polls , but these could be done at drop sites on Tuesday night when a great many voters are dropping off their ballots by 8:00 pm .
Brad , I would be interested in the cons , as I 'm sure there are some in this , as every system .
Ballots can be tampered along the line by any unscrupulous official --- though that is , and has been , true in other systems .
I like exploring these issues and keeping this issue alive .

Every single time a voting method is brought up for use , it should be subjected to trouble - shooting for election problems by smart people .
We do n't do this at all .
Instead , we sit around like a bunch of ducks at dawn waiting for the hunters to open fire on us , before we all start quacking and flapping our wings to get out of their way .
Why not anticipate that the hunters will definitely be there ?
Whenever I read some comment by some naive person that , well , we can't undeniably prove that election rigging is taking place , therefore everyone who is focused on that possibility is nuts - oid , well , I just want to start quacking .
Seriously .
If you want to be a dumb duck , then get out of the way of those who do n't accept that fate .
Just know that you 're very possibly in love with a decoy , so any ridiculing you do of others who can spot a decoy is for your own amusement only .

** A Swiftboat BOMBSHELL **
As the RNC gracefully nominated John Timothy Griffin to ' swiftboat ' Barack Obama by digging up * his * past , I thought some of the friends here might find this rather juicy and --- yes , viral fodder for the internet at once .
It seems this ' Swiftboater ' has a bit of a past of his own , most importantly , his involvement in the 2004 Elections in Florida .
BBC Newsnight 's Greg Palast was on hand to film a 10 - minute documentary , reporting on a possible U.S. federal violation to ' disrupt ' the African - American vote , which was heavily favoring Kerry .
About 5:45 into the documentary , a familiar face is seen getting out of a black SUV with tinted windows , and standing across the street from a voting area , filming the voters .
The individual is our very own John Timothy Griffin .
So I 'm really looking forward to what Griffin tries to dig up on Obama .
All we have to do is dig up this video .
McCain loves wars so much .
Oh , let 's do give him one .

Boston Children ’s Hospital Opens Transgendered Clinic for Children
Sometimes I read a story and I just have to shake my head , and now I have read another of those stories .
Boston Children ’s Hospital is opening a brand new clinic for children .
Sounds like a wonderful idea , does n’t it ?
But this wing is for children AS YOUNG AS SEVEN YEARS OLD to begin preparation for sex change surgery .
Let me repeat this again , THESE CHILDREN ARE AS YOUNG AS SEVEN YEARS OLD !
Treatments begin by medicating children to postpone puberty so that they have more time to choose what sex they want to be .
Led by endocrinologist Dr. Norman Spack , the Gender Management Service Clinic is the first U.S. clinic to initiate medical intervention for healthy children on the basis of a “ transgender ” identification .
A 12 - year - old German boy who began receiving puberty - blocking hormone treatments last winter in preparation for sex - change “ transition ” surgery was believed to be the youngest child to receive the treatment at the time .
The Boston clinic will reportedly offer the treatments to children as young as seven years old , according to researcher Ari Taube for MassResistance .
Hormone treatment of pre-pubescent children is intended to prevent normal development of gender characterization in order to ease eventual surgical procedures to complete a change of gender , which can take place once the child is about 16 .
This is really disturbing .
Delaying puberty by artificial means cannot be healthy to a child .
And it will likely leave the child infertile even if they keep their “ birth gender ” according to the “ doctor ” that is overseeing this abusive program .
Puberty is a confusing time as it is for children and now they are going to be introduced to the idea that maybe they may not be the sex they think they are ?
That is sure to clear things up , huh ?
I do n’t understand how anybody can think that telling a child this young that they may be transgendered is a good idea .
Hell , at that age they barely even know what a gender is .
Thankfully not everybody thinks this is a good idea , this is what Dr. Paul McHugh , University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University had to say :
“ I have witnessed a great deal of damage from sex-reassignment .
The children transformed from their male constitution into female roles suffered prolonged distress and misery as they sensed their natural attitudes .
Their parents usually lived with guilt over their decisions - second - guessing themselves and somewhat ashamed of the fabrication , both surgical and social , they had imposed on their sons . ”
How can the hospital agree that this is an appropriate clinic for children to participate in ?
We are talking about children here .
I am at a loss for words , if you want to read more about this click here and here .
And by the way , if you are thinking about leaving me a comment to tell me about all of the good that Boston Children ’s Hospital does , and to berate me for bashing the hospital , do n’t bother .
I know and understand what Boston Children ’s hospital does for children .
I know first hand that Boston Children ’s Hopital saves the lives of many children every year , trust me .
That does n’t mean that I have to accept this bullshit .
I was outside St. Cecelia 's Rectory smoking a cigarette when a goat appeared beside me .
It was mostly black and white , with a little reddish brown here and there .
When I started to walk away , it followed .
I was amused and delighted , but wondered what the laws were on this kind of thing .
There 's a leash law for dogs , but what about goats ?
People smiled at me and admired the goat .
" It 's not my goat , " I explained .
" It 's the town 's goat .
I 'm just taking my turn caring for it . "
" I did n't know we had a goat , " one of them said .
" I wonder when my turn is . "
" Soon , " I said .
" Be patient .
Your time is coming . "
The goat stayed by my side .
It stopped when I stopped .
It looked up at me and I stared into its eyes .
I felt he knew everything essential about me .
We walked on .
A police - man on his beat looked us over .
" That 's a mighty fine goat you got there , " he said , stopping to admire .
" It 's the town 's goat , " I said .
" His family goes back three - hundred years with us , " I said , " from the beginning . "
The officer leaned forward to touch him , then stopped and looked up at me .
" Mind if I pat him ? " he asked .
" Touching this goat will change your life , " I said .
" It 's your decision . "
He thought real hard for a minute , and then stood up and said , " What 's his name ? "
" He 's called the Prince of Peace , " I said .
" God !
This town is like a fairy tale .
Everywhere you turn there 's mystery and wonder .
And I 'm just a child playing cops and robbers forever .
Please forgive me if I cry . "
" We forgive you , Officer , " I said .
" And we understand why you , more than anybody , should never touch the Prince . "
The goat and I walked on .
It was getting dark and we were beginning to wonder where we would spend the night .
__585 B.C. : __A solar eclipse in Asia Minor brings an abrupt halt to a battle , as the warring armies lay down their arms and declare a truce .
Historical astronomy later sets a likely date , providing a debatable calculation point for pinning down some dates in ancient history .
This was not the first recorded solar eclipse .
After failing to predict one such in the 22nd or 23rd century B.C. , two Chinese astrologers attached to a ruler 's court were soon detached from their heads .
11 Clay tablets from Babylon record an eclipse in Ugarit in 1375 B.C. Later records identify total solar eclipses that " turned day into night " in 1063 and 763 B.C .
But the 585 B.C. eclipse was the first we know that was predicted .
The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Milete predicted an eclipse in a year when the Medians and the Lydians were at war .
Using the same calculating methods that predict future eclipses , astronomers have been able to calculate when eclipses occurred in the past .
You can run the planetary clock in reverse as well as forward .
To coin a word , you can postdict as well as predict .
The most likely candidate for Thales ' eclipse took place on May 28 , 585 B.C. , though some authorities believe it may have been 25 years earlier in 610 B.C. Hundreds of scholars have debated this for nearly two millenniums .
Predicting a solar eclipse is not easy .
You need to calculate not only when it will happen , but where it will be visible .
In a lunar eclipse , when the moon passes through the Earth 's huge sun shadow , the event is visible on the whole side of the Earth that 's in nighttime , and totality often lasts more than an hour .
But in a solar eclipse , the moon 's shadow falls across the Earth in a relatively narrow path , and the maximum duration of totality at any given place is only about 7 ½ minutes .
So you need to know the moon 's orbit in great detail – within a small fraction of a degree of arc .
The early Greeks did not have this data .
We do not know the method Thales used to make his prediction .
The method may have been used only once , because we have no other records of the Greeks of this era accurately predicting further eclipses .
Thales is believed to have studied the Egyptians ' techniques of land measurement ( geo metry in Greek ) later codified by Euclid .
One has to wonder whether Thales made the famous eclipse prediction himself , or if he simply borrowed it from the Egyptians .
However he made the prediction , and however precise or vague it may have been , the eclipse occurred .
Aylattes , the king of Lydia , was battling Cyaxares , king of the Medes , probably near the River Halys in what is now central Turkey .
The heavens darkened .
Soldiers of both kings put down their weapons .
The battle was over .
And so was the war .
After 15 years of back - and - forth fighting between the Medes and the Lydians , the kings of Cilicia and Babylon intervened and negotiated a treaty .
The River Halys , where the Battle of the Eclipse was fought , became the border between the Lydians and the Medes .

Attytood 's Will Bunch asks Senator Obama the question that 's on everyone 's mind :
Tonight I had an opportunity to ask Barack Obama a question that is on the minds of many Americans , yet rarely rises to the surface in the great ruckus of the 2008 presidential race -- and that is whether an Obama administration would seek to prosecute officials of a former Bush administration on the revelations that they greenlighted torture , or for other potential crimes that took place in the White House .
Obama said that as president he would indeed ask his new Attorney General and his deputies to " immediately review the information that 's already there " and determine if an inquiry is warranted -- but he also tread carefully on the issue , in line with his reputation for seeking to bridge the partisan divide .
He worried that such a probe could be spun as " a partisan witch hunt . "
However , he said that equation changes if there was willful criminality , because " nobody is above the law . "
Back in October , shortly after he endorsed Hillary Clinton , General Wesley Clark told Matt Stoller that Senator Clinton would pursue investigations as well :
Matt Stoller :
So you think Senator Clinton as President will do those investigations ?
Wes Clark : Yes .
Matt Stoller :
And you think Congress should continue those investigations once Bush is out of office ?
Wes Clark : Absolutely .
Words are nice , but I want some firm commitments .
Who 's with me ?
Just to ensure it does n't get overlooked , Bunch 's question was framed in terms of the recent revelation that President Bush personally approved the meeting of his principals in which they discussed the intimate details of how we would torture suspected terrorists .
If you have n't already , please follow John 's action alert from yesterday and make your voice heard .
Because this is what inevitably happens when our country is flippant about torture .

An announcement will be made on the mailinglist debian - infrastructure - announce [ 4 ] at such time .
There is no point in adding new keys to the ldap right now .
Since the nature of the crypto used in ssh cannot ensure confidentiality if either side uses weak random numbers [ 5 ] we have also randomized all user passwords in LDAP .
Feel free to request a new one using the standard password recovery procedure [ 6 ] , but only use the new password once you have upgraded your client system !
( We are upgrading the servers at this moment . )
We will also have to replace several ssh host keys .
We 'll try to keep db.d. o [ 7 ] as current as possible .
Once we are done a new list will be posted to dia [ 4 ] .
We also had to replace the SSL certificate on db.debian.org because its CA which is operated by Software in the Public Interest ( SPI ) is known to have been created with a SSL with the bug .
The new SPI CA can be found at the SPI 's secretary page [ 8 ] , its fingerprints signed by Joerg Jaspert 's GPG key .
They are : SHA1 : AF:70:88:43:83:82:02:15:CD:61:C6:BC:EC : FD:37:24:A9:90:43:1C MD5 : 2A:47:9F:60:BB:83:74:6F:01:03:D7:0B:0D:F6:0D:78

John McCain became hostile with the N.Y. Times ' Elisabeth Bumiller on the campaign 's plane today , after the reporter questioned him about a 2004 meeting with John F. Kerry , in which the Massachusetts senator suggested a VP slot .
( Click here for audio clip , courtesy of Breitbart . tv )
Bumiller , who took over the McCain beat from Marc Santora in January , quoted a 2004 story in which McCain said the Kerry meeting never happened , according to ABC News .
McCain , whose temper does flare up at times , told Bumiller that everyone already knows this story , despite her persistent questioning .
UPDATE : Readers have fairly noted McCain 's reaction is n't exactly " hostile , " which I wrote before audio and video were available .
It would be more accurate to say he became irritated or annoyed , perhaps .
Transcript after the jump .
Elisabeth Bumiller : Senator can I ask you about Senator Kerry .
I just went back and looked at our story , the Times story , and you told Sheryl Stolberg that you had never had a conversation with Kerry about being , about Vice President –
John McCain : Everybody knows that I had a private conversation .
Everybody knows that .
That I had a conversation .
There ’s no living American in Washington -
EB : Okay .
McCain : - that knows that , there ’s no one .
EB : Okay
McCain :
And you know it too .
You know it .
You know it .
So I do n’t even know why you ask .
EB : Well I ask because I just read –-
McCain :
You do know it .
You do know it .
EB : Because I just read in the Times in May of ’04 you said .
McCain : I do n’t know what you may have read or heard of , I do n’t know the circumstances .
Maybe in May of 04 I had n’t had the conversation --
EB : But do you recall the conversation ?
McCain : I do n’t know , but it ’s well known that I had the conversation .
It is absolutely well known by everyone .
So do you have a question on another issue ?
EB : Well can I ask you when the conversation was ?
McCain : No . Nope , because the issue is closed as far as I ’m concerned .
Everybody knows it .
Everybody knows it in America .
EB : Can you describe the conversation ?
McCain : Pardon me .
EB : Can you describe the conversation ?
McCain : No , of course not .
I do n’t describe private conversations .
EB : Okay .
Can I ask you –
McCain : Why should I ?
Then there ’s no such thing as a private conversation .
Is there ( inaudible ) if you have a private conversation with someone , and then they come and tell you .
I do n’t know that that ’s a private conversation .
I think that ’s a public conversation .
EB .
Okay .
Can I ask you about your ( pause )
Why you ’re so angry ?
McCain : Pardon me ?
EB : Nevermind , nevermind .
McCain : I mean it ’s well known .
Everybody knows .
It ’s been well chronicled a thousand times .
John Kerry asked if I would consider being his running mate .
EB : Right .
McCain :
And I said categorically no , under no circumstances .
That ’s all very well known .
EB : Okay , let me ask you … ( moves on to another question . )

Kudos to Google for refusing to bow down to Joe Lieberman 's attempts to censor youtube .
It 's a slippery slope one starts down when one starts to censor and Lieberman seems happy to grease the slide with his efforts .
The NY Times writes , today ,
The Internet is simply a means of communication , like the telephone , but that has not prevented attempts to demonize it — the latest being the ludicrous claim that the Internet promotes terrorism .
Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut is trying to pressure YouTube to pull down videos he does not like , and a recent Senate report and a bill pending in Congress also raise the specter of censorship .
It is important for online speech to be protected against these assaults .
Mr. Lieberman recently demanded that YouTube take down hundreds of videos produced by Islamist terrorist organizations or their supporters .
YouTube reviewed the videos to determine whether they violated its guidelines , which prohibit hate speech and graphic or gratuitous violence .
It took down 80 videos , but left others up .
Mr. Lieberman said that was “ not enough , ” and demanded that more come down .
Earlier this month , the Senate homeland security committee , which is led by Mr. Lieberman , issued a report titled “ Violent Islamist Extremism , the Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat . ”
The report identified the Internet as “ one of the primary drivers ” of the terrorist threat to the United States .
All of this comes against the backdrop of a troubling Congressional antiterrorism bill that also focuses on the Internet .
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , which passed the House last year by a 404 - to - 6 vote , would establish a commission to study the terrorist threat and propose legislation .
The bill , which the Senate has not acted on , has a finding that the Internet promotes radicalization and terrorism .
The NY Times reports that the committee did n't call for restricting free speech , but did discuss the need for “ what , if any , new laws ” should be enacted .
The Times concludes , " no new laws are needed — or justifiable — any more than it would be tolerable to enact laws restricting speech over the telephone , in a newspaper or a book , on a street corner , or in a church , mosque or synagogue . "
Just as many right wing supporters are willing to give up their rights to privacy , usuall , with the explanation that they personally have nothing to hide , this approach to cutting into the essential right to free expression could be defended by suggesting that people who are not terrorists have nothing to worry about .
This is incredibly dangerous .
As the loyal opposition , in a time when opposition has been attacked as unpatriotic or even aiding the enemy , entering this slippery censorship slope could lead to the squelching of all protest .
TheTimes concludes ,
Not only do these efforts contradict fundamental American values , it is not clear if they would help fight terrorism .
Even if YouTube pulled down every video Mr. Lieberman did not like , radical groups could post the same videos on their own Web sites .
Trying to restrain the Internet is a game of “ whack - a - mole ” that cannot be won , says John Morris of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
Having the videos on YouTube may even be a good thing , because it makes it easier for law enforcement officials , the media and the public to monitor the groups and their messages .
Terrorism is a real concern .
All Americans know that .
They also know that if we give up our fundamental rights , the terrorists win .
If people use speech to engage in criminal acts , they should be prosecuted .
Cutting off free speech is never the right answer .
Lieberman is really going further and further in taking the place of neanderthalcon Zell Miller , the most toxic , offensive troglodyte faux " Democrat " the senate has seen in recent years .
Unfortunately , there are plenty more of his type , not quite as bad , but almost equally willing to shed the values and principles of Democracy .
In the house , they call themselves Bluedogs .
Fortunately , there are many in the blogosphere who are taking these sellout right wing faux Dems on .
Donna Edwards did it in Maryland and that should just be the beginning .
Unfortunately , the last three debacles for Republicans , where they lost long held Republican congressional seats , the Dems who won them are Bluedog types .
Sure , it 's an improvement , but it also changes the composition of the Democratic party , making it more conservative .
It is , therefore , essential , that progressives take aggressive action to push the party to the left .
Failure to do so will actually allow MORE people like Joe LIeberman gain influence in congress .
That would be bad news in a year when there should be a lot of good news .
A doctor exams mammograms , a special type of X - ray of the breasts , which is used to detect tumours as part of a regular cancer prevention medical check - up at a clinic in Nice , south eastern France January 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Eric Gaillard
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Extracts from a mushroom used for centuries in Eastern Asian medicine may stop breast cancer cells from growing and could become a new weapon in the fight against the killer disease , scientists said on Tuesday .
Laboratory tests using human breast cancer cells show the mushroom called Phellinus linteus has a marked anti-cancer effect , probably by blocking an enzyme called AKT .
AKT is known to control signals that lead to cell growth .
Phellinus linteus -- called song gen in Chinese medicine , sang - hwang in Korean and meshimakobu in Japanese -- has previously been shown to have anti-tumor properties on skin , lung and prostate cancer cells .
The new research on breast cancer , however , marks the first time that scientists have started to understand how it works .
Dr Daniel Sliva of the Methodist Research Institute in Indianapolis said the mushroom extract reduced uncontrolled growth of new cancer cells , suppressed their aggressive behavior and blocked new tumor - feeding blood vessels .
“ We ’re not yet able to apply this knowledge to modern medicine , but we ... hope our study will encourage more researchers to explore the use of medicinal mushrooms for the treatment of cancer , ” he said .
The findings were reported in the British Journal of Cancer .
Mr Packer was introduced to Scientology by his friend Tom Cruise in 2002 .
Friends say they remain close .
They were most recently photographed dining together with their wives in Germany .
The religion entered Mr Packer 's realm at one of the lowest points in his personal and business life .
He was overweight and depressed , his marriage to his first wife , Jodhi Meares , had ended and he was reeling from the humiliating and very public collapse of One .
Tel , losing $ 350 million from the family business on the way .
He has spoken publicly of his involvement in the religion only once , telling The Australian Financial Review Magazine in 2006 that he spent an hour or so " every couple of days " practising Scientology .
" I think it has been very good for me , " he said .
" It has been helpful .
I have some friends in Scientology that have been very supportive .
But I think it 's just helped me have a better outlook on life . "
Thanks to his Hollywood confidant Cruise , Mr Packer and his fortune were embraced at Scientology 's highest levels .

Time to start a petition drive to arrest Bush and fellow war criminals Cheney , Rice , et al upon their arrival for the GOP convention . ]
An appeal to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman :
Arrest George W. Bush when he steps off the plane for the Republican Convention in September .
George W. Bush has committed horrible crimes against humanity .
His war against a weak and defenseless country ; his use of torture and kidnapping , his illegal incarcerations of foreign nationals and the shelling of Fallujah are crimes in violation of international law .
As long as he is President he cannot be tried for these crimes in another country , but once he is a private citizen , then , like Kissinger , Pinochet and Donald Rumsfeld , he will be a hunted criminal with little refuge in any foreign country that believes in the rule of law .
But those are matters for foreign countries and the international court .
He has violated and undermined the Constitution by illegally spying on citizens , by refusing to enforce laws passed by Congress , by invading a country without a Declaration of a State of War by Congress and by entering into agreements with foreign countries and not submitting those agreements to the United States Senate for their advice and consent .
But these are matters for the U. S. Congress to enforce .
Unfortunately , Congress is unwilling to hold the President accountable to the Constitution and has refused to begin impeachment proceedings against him .
But what concerns us as Minnesotans is whether George W. Bush ’s actions have caused serious and grievous harm to the citizens of our state and whether that harm was incidental to the legitimate performance of his official duties as President or whether his actions were motivated by private and personal gain .
As the highest elected law enforcement official in Hennepin County , it is Mike Freeman ’s duty to enforce the laws of this state .
If it can be shown that there is probable cause that George W. Bush caused harm to the people of Minnesota and that this harm was caused by his willful pursuit of personal gain , then it is the duty of Mike Freeman to arrest George W. Bush and hold him accountable to Minnesota law .
There are three areas in which the criminal acts of George W. Bush have violated Minnesota law .
First , his pursuit of a war against the government of Iraq was not done in legitimate defense of national interest but rather in pursuit of personal wealth .
His administration lied about the threat of weapons of mass destruction , and they lied about a connection between Iraq and international terrorists .
They knew Iraq did not pose a threat to the United States .
The only reasonable explanation for George W. Bush ’s invasion of Iraq was that he stood to personally benefit from the war .
To fully understand the Bush family financial interests in war profiteering it is necessary to understand their history .
Great - grandfather Samuel Prescott Bush was president of Buckeye Steel Castings .
He manufactured railroad couplings for railroads owned by the Morgans , Rockefellers and Harrimans .
During World War I he was on the War Industries Board and chaired the section on forgings , guns , small arms and ammunition , and he got to work with people from Dupont , Remington , Winchester and Colt .
Sam Bush founded and became the first president of the National Association of Manufacturers , an organization whose principal cause was defending industrial capitalism from the threat of unions .
He became an indispensable part of the military - industrial complex , and he sent his son Prescott off to Yale where he could associate with the sons of his friends in the Skull and Bones fraternity .
Along with many of his college chums , Prescott joined Brown Brothers Harriman after college and started making serious money .
The biggest buck to be made in the 1920 ’s was in re-arming Germany .
Harriman & Co. set up Union Banking Corp with Prescott as Manager to trade with Nazi financier Fritz Thyssen .
They bought a steamship line to ship Remington arms to Germany through a dummy corporation in Holland .
page 2
Harriman & Co. bought Dresser Industries ( manufacturers of oil pipeline equipment ) in 1929 and Prescott became a Director , and he continued to run Dresser from the Board for the rest of his life .
They , along with John Foster Dulles and others , bankrolled Hitler as a shrewd business strategy .
Prescott became Managing Director of Union Bank in 1934 at the height of trade with Germany .
In 1939 he took direct management of some of the slave labor camps in Poland to aid Nazi armament , according to Dutch intelligence sources .
In October of 1942 , the U. S. government seized the assets of Union Bank and three other of Prescott ’s industries : the steamship line , the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation ( suppliers of steel , wire and explosives to the Nazis ) and the Silesian - American Company ( the coal mining company he managed along with John Foster Dulles on behalf of the Nazi Economic Minister ) .
This did n’t really close them down .
Once the war started they simply changed sides and started supplying war material to the Allies .
During the War Bonesmen were active in forming the OSS and its later incarnation , the CIA .
Prescott ’s relationship with Dulles would become very useful during the Eisenhower years , with John Foster as Secretary of State and his brother Allen Dulles as Director of the CIA .
Prescott and Dresser Industries were kept well inside the loop .
Hans Gisevius , the German intelligence agent who acted as the go - between with Allen Dulles in Switzerland and Admiral Canaris in the German High Command after the war , acted as go - between with Dulles , Dresser Industries and Prescott Bush .
George Herbert Walker Bush , Prescott ’s son , improved on the CIA connection to the point of becoming its Director in 1976 .
After graduating from Yale , George H. W. Bush went to work at his father ’s firm , Dresser Industries .
Eventually , with money from Brown Brothers and Harriman ( his dad ’s parent company ) he set up his own company , Zapata .
It was really a CIA front .
The Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 was probably George ’s operation as much as it was Allen Dulles’s .
The CIA code name for it was Zapata .
The boats left for the Bay of Pigs from an island that was leased to George H. W. Bush , and the boats were named Houston and Barbara .
He ran for Congress in Houston in 1964 by campaigning against the Civil Rights Act .
He did n’t get elected that year , but he did get elected the next time he tried .
When he was Chair of the Republican Party in 1972 he set up ethnic heritage groups within the Party .
These groups were havens for ex-Nazis .
While Vice President under Reagan , Bush was Chair of the Special Situations Group responsible for defeating the Sandanistas in Nicaragua .
He and Ollie North set up , financed and armed the Contras through an elaborate and highly secretive scheme that saw private planes flying cash to Iran , buying Soviet - made guns , flying guns to the Contras at a private CIA airstrip in Costa Rica , trading guns for marijuana and cocaine , then flying the drugs to a private U. S. airbase in Homestead , Florida , where the drugs were traded for cash .
George Bush was Vice President under Reagan from 1980 to 1988 .
He was elected President in 1988 and served one term until 1992 .
Dick Cheney was his Secretary of Defense .
When Bush lost , Cheney went from being Secretary of Defense to being CEO of Halliburton , probably the largest supplier of goods and services to the Defense Department .
The revolving door connecting the military to the industrial complex seemed to be well greased .
A few years later Cheney came back through the door to be Vice President for George Bush the younger .
Why did George W pick Cheney .
Well , actually , Cheney picked himself .
Bush asked him to make a list of candidates for Vice President .
Cheney did , then he sold W on the idea that he was the best man for the job .
What makes Cheney so special , so indispensable ?
While Cheney was CEO of Halliburton he built up the company by buying other companies .
One of the companies he bought was Dresser Industries .
Halliburton spent $ 8 billion buying Dresser .
When they bought it , Halliburton ’s stock dropped by a third .
Wall Street thought it was a bum deal .
Why did Cheney pay so much ?
Was it a sweetheart deal because the owners of Dresser were his former and future bosses ?
The popular image of Cheney is that he ’s the brains behind Bush , that Bush is some kind of simpleton and Cheney is an evil genius .
The Dresser deal looks like Cheney is still the loyal employee .
He ’s both the bag man and fall guy for the Bushs .
He delivers the cash , and , when the Bushs get in trouble , he ’s willing to stand up and take the hit for it .
During the 2000 presidential election Cheney admitted Halliburton did business with Libya and Iran , but he denied they had done business with Iraq , “ I had a firm policy that we would n’t do anything in Iraq , even arrangements that were supposedly legal .
We ’ve not done any business in Iraq since U. N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 , and I had a standing policy that I would n’t do that , ”  he said on ABC - TV’s This Week on July 30 , 2000 .
But Dresser was selling equipment through French subsidiaries to Iraq from early in 1997 through 2000 .
Halliburton did n’t buy Dresser until 1998 , so , it was the Bush family ’s company that was trading with the enemy and Cheney just continued the practice .
Purchasing the company also covered up the trail .
George W. Bush , in the best traditions of his family , waged war against the people of Iraq so that Halliburton could assign oil leases and control the oil and so that Halliburton would get multi-billion dollar no -bid contracts to supply the military .
More than 4000 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq .
Of that number 60 , as of March 29 , 2008 , are from Minnesota , which is the justification of this appeal to County Attorney Mike Freeman to arrest George W. Bush .
Because he has committed troops of the Minnesota National Guard to tragic danger and fatalities in Iraq for the sole purpose of enriching his family ’s business , Halliburton , and , thereby , causing the death of Minnesota citizens , he is guilty of committing murder in the third degree : Section 609.195 : MURDER IN THE THIRD DEGREE : whoever , without intent to effect the death of any person , causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind , without regard for human life , is guilty of murder in the third degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 25 years on each count .
Through the sale of oil drilling equipment Dresser Company and the Bush family have had long time relationships with the Saudi royal family .
The bin Laden family have been the principal contracting firm for the Saudi royal family , so it was natural for Osama bin Laden ’s family to give George W. Bush $ 50,000 to get started in the oil exploration business in Texas .
Bush returned the favor by grounding all aircraft after 9/11 except the plane that evacuated those members of the bin Laden family staying in the U. S. There was a touching video of Crown Prince Faisal visiting George W. Bush at his ranch in Crawford , Texas .
They were holding hands as they walked , evidence of a stronger relationship than the one Bush had with Tony Blair or Berlusconi .
As head of the Bush family , George W. Bush directs their investment in Halliburton .
Halliburton directs the movement of oil out of Iraq , 25 % of the world ’s supply .
The Saudi family directs the movement of oil out of Saudi Arabia , 40 % of the world ’s supply .
It is reasonable to assume that when George W. Bush and Prince Faisal get together they talk about the supply and price of oil .
After their last meeting in Saudi Arabia , supplies dropped and the price of oil rose dramatically .
According to Minnesota State law that meeting looks suspiciously like a conspiracy to fix prices .
Because , through Halliburton ’s control of Iraqi oil , he has acted in collusion with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to fix the price and supply of oil to distributors in Hennepin County , he is guilty of price fixing : Section 325.53 : PROHIBITED CONTRACTS , COMBINATIONS , AND CONSPIRACIES : Subdivision 1 . Price fixing , production control , allocation of markets , collusive bidding , and concerted refusals to deal .
Without limiting section 325D.51 , the following shall be deemed to restrain trade or commerce unreasonably and are unlawful : ( 1 ) A contract , combination or conspiracy between two or more persons in competition : ( a ) for the purpose or with the effect of affecting , fixing , controlling or maintaining the market price , rate or fee of any commodity or service ; ( b ) affecting , fixing , controlling , maintaining , limiting , or discontinuing the production , manufacture , mining , sale or supply of any commodity , or the sale or supply of any service , for the purpose or with the effect of affecting , fixing , controlling , or maintaining the market price , rate , or fee of the commodity or service .
Finally , George W. Bush should be arrested and prosecuted for his collusion with the opium warlords in Afghanistan to distribute heroin in Hennepin County .
The United Nations and all objective reports verify that during the last year of the Taliban reign in Afghanistan , their government had reduced the Afghanistan contribution to the world supply of opium and heroin to zero , and everyone agrees that since the opium warlords have taken back control of the rural areas of Afghanistan opium production in Afghanistan now contributes 90 % of the world supply .
The U. S. Army and the CIA worked in support of the opium warlords by granting them control over most of the opium growing areas of Afghanistan , getting them a respected place in the central government .
The CIA even insured that an opium warlord would be in charge of the Department of the Interior ” ” the government agency responsible for drug enforcement .
This is the pattern the OSS ( the early version of the CIA ) used to overthrow Musolini ’s government in Sicily .
Through contacts with Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano , they got the Mafia in Sicily to cooperate with the Allies in the invasion of Sicily .
The Mafia in America has always been a ready and willing patriot in any CIA off the shelf adventure .
When Ollie North brought cocaine and marijuana in from Colombia , the Mafia was ready to pay cash for it and distribute it .
Ollie North knew these contacts when he was working with the Hmong and Meo tribes in Laos during the Vietnam War .
As part of the golden triangle these tribes produced large amounts of opium that CIA planes would then transport to Marseille , continuing the colonial tradition begun by French forces in Vietnam .
page 3
George H. W. Bush was a part of all this because he was Director of the CIA when the golden triangle was active , and he was Vice President during the Contra War and probably in charge of the operation to fund the Contras through the illegal importation of cocaine and marijuana .
Opium poppies have grown in Afghanistan since ancient times .
The British began to control the exporting of the drug early in the nineteenth century .
The Opium War in China in the middle of the nineteenth century was a result of the Chinese government trying to forbid the British importation of opium .
The British won the war and the Chinese were forced to allow the British to sell opium .
Early in the twentieth century Sicilians and Italians found the opium through contacts in Beirut and had it manufactured into heroin in laboratories in Marseilles .
The heroin was then smuggled into Europe and the United States .
The traditional route for smugglers was over the mountains from Afghanistan , through Iran , Iraq , Jordan and to Beirut , Lebanon .
The lack of cooperation recently of the Iranian government in this smuggling conspiracy has created problems for the smugglers and international problems for Iran .
But , thanks to the active cooperation of the CIA and the U S government , opium does make its way through the Middle East , to Sicily and laboratories to be refined into heroin and , finally , to the U S and Hennepin County .
Section 609.228 of the Minnesota penal code , GREAT BODILY HARM CAUSED BY DISTRIBUTION OF DRUGS , says , “ Whoever proximately causes great bodily harm by , directly or indirectly , unlawfully selling , giving away , bartering , delivering , exchanging , distributing , or administering a controlled substance classified in schedule I or II may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years or to payment of a fine of not more than $ 20,000 , or both .
Is it possible that George W. Bush , as President of the United States , has immunity from prosecution ?
Thomas Paine wrote in Common Sense 57 ( Philadelphia , 1776 ) , “ In America THE LAW IS KING .
For as in absolute governments the King is the law , so in free countries the law ought to be king ; and there ought to be no other . ” 
The Supreme Court said in an 1882 decision , United States v. Lee , 106 U.S. 196 , 220 , 1 S.Ct. 240 , 261 , 27 L.Ed. 171 , that :
No man in this country is so high that he is above the law .
No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity .
All the officers of the government , from the highest to the lowest , are creatures of
the law , and are bound to obey .
It is the only supreme power in our system of government , and every
man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more
strongly bound to submit to that supremacy , and to observe the limitations
which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives .
We respectfully request that the Hennepin County Attorney enforce the laws of the State of Minnesota and arrest George W. Bush when he steps off the plane in Hennepin County in September when he comes here to attend the Republican National Convention .

New research from the University of Cincinnati ( UC ) reports the first evidence of a direct link between prenatal and early - childhood lead exposure an increased risk for criminal behavior later in life .
Based on long - term data from a childhood lead study in Cincinnati , Ohio , Kim Dietrich , PhD , and his team have determined that elevated prenatal and postnatal blood - lead concentrations are associated with higher rates of criminal arrest in adulthood .
" Previous studies either relied on indirect measures of exposure or failed to follow subjects into adulthood to examine the relationship between lead exposure and criminal activity in young adults , " explains Dietrich , principal investigator of the study and professor of environmental health at UC .
" We have monitored this specific sub - segment of children who were exposed to lead both in the womb and as young children for nearly 30 years , " he adds .
" We have a complete record of the neurological , behavioral and developmental patterns to draw a clear association between early - life exposure to lead and adult criminal activity . "
Dietrich says few studies have attempted to evaluate the consequences of childhood lead exposure as a risk of criminal behavior .
The UC - led study is the first of its kind to demonstrate an association between developmental exposure to lead and adult criminal behavior .
This new study is part of a long - term lead exposure study conducted through the Cincinnati Children 's Environmental Health Center , a collaborative research group funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) that involved scientists from the UC College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center .

Led by Dietrich , researchers recruited pregnant women living in Cincinnati neighborhoods with a higher concentration of older , lead - contaminated housing .
Recruitment took place at four prenatal clinics between 1979 and 1984 .
Dietrich 's team has monitored this population group since birth to assess the long - term health effects of early - life lead exposure .
Of the original 376 newborns recruited , 250 were identified for the current study .
Researchers measured blood - lead levels during pregnancy and then at regular intervals until the children were 6 ½ years old to calculate cumulative lead exposure .
Blood - lead level data was then correlated with public criminal arrest records from a search of Hamilton County , Ohio , criminal justice records .
These records provided information about the nature and extent of arrests and were coded by category : violent , property , drugs , fraud , obstruction of justice , serious motor vehicle , disorderly conduct and other offenses .
Researchers found that individuals with increased blood - lead levels before birth and during early childhood had higher rates of arrest -- for both violent and total crimes -- than the rest of the study population after age 18 .
Approximately 55 percent of the subjects had at least one arrest -- the majority of which involved drugs ( 28 percent ) or serious motor vehicle violations ( 27 percent ) .
The strongest association between childhood blood - lead level and criminal behavior was for arrests involving acts of violence .

Dietrich says that although both environmental lead levels and crime rates in the United States have dropped in the past 30 years , they have not done so in a uniform way .
" Lower income , inner-city children remain particularly vulnerable to lead exposure , " he explains .
" Although we 've made great strides in reducing lead exposure , our findings send a clear message that further reduction of childhood lead exposure may be an important and achievable way to reduce violent crime .
" Aggressive or violent behavioral patterns often emerge early and continue throughout life , " adds Dietrich .
" Identifying the risk factors that may place youth on an early trajectory toward a life of crime and violence should be a public health priority . "
Study coauthor John Wright , PhD , a member of UC 's criminal justice faculty who studies the impact of factors like genetics , psychology and biology on criminality , says he had limited expectations for how strong a correlation between lead exposure and criminality could be established .
" I did not expect we would see an effect , much less a substantive effect and even less likely a highly resilient effect , " says Wright .
" The fact that we are able to detect the effects from childhood exposures now into adulthood stands as a testament of lead 's power to influence behavior over a long period of time . "

Execution Ceremony
Several years ago an end - piece in New Scientist magazine asked that timeless question , “ How long is one aware after being beheaded ? ”
Among the reader comments was this bit of grotesquery , so vivid it borders on the poetic :
Dr Livingstone wrote that Africans he encountered were aware that consciousness is not lost immediately .
He recounts how they bent a springy sapling and tied cords from it under the ears of a man to be decapitated so that his last few moments of awareness would be of flying through the air .
John Rudge , Harlington , Middlesex
Holy cow !
Could this possibly be true ?
After a bit of research I have to conclude that the ceremony described actually did happen — though I found no evidence that Dr. Livingstone reported this , nor that the victim was assumed to be aware of his final “ journey ” towards the heavens .
More than likely Mr. Rudge had conflated scenes from descriptions given in modern biographies of Henry Morton Stanley ( not David Livingstone . )
The first public descriptions of this style of execution come from the ethnologist Walter Hough :
A Bayanzi execution
In executing , the condemned is made to sit down on a block just behind a post , his limbs passing on each side of it .
The post reaches to the height of his chin .
His arms , legs , and body are tied to stakes .
A strong sapling is bent down , having at its extremity a collar suspended by cords .
This collar is placed around the victim ’s neck , producing so great tension , that , when the executioner delivers the blow , the severed head is thrown into the air with the force of a bomb .
The circumstance which forms the subject of this paper was witnessed in November , 1884 , at Loukolela , by Mr. E. J. Glave . [ … ]
So far as known by the writer , this is the first time that an account of the Bayanzi or a similar execution has ever been published .
( From a letter dated June 9th 1887 . )
Science , Vol. 9 , No. 229 . ( Jun. 24 , 1887 )
And again , a few months later , Hough writes :
Notes on the Ethnology of the Congo
It is really in bad taste to describe an execution , but life there is so cheap and the Congo - African way of relieving a man of his head so unique that it will bear description .
In order to give an éclat suitable to African taste , and to render the feat of decapitating with the weapon possible , the victim is secured to a seat and a strong sapling bent down and fastened by means of cords and a collar around his neck ; then , while his neck is taut the high executioner delivers the blow , and the severed head is thrown into the air like a bomb .
The American Naturalist , Vol. 21 , No. 8 . ( Aug. , 1887 )
E. J. Glave , mentioned by Hough above , did not write publicly about these events until an April , 1890 article for Century Magazine .
Glave , who was only 18 - years old at the time , was an adventure seeker who had been left in charge of the Loukolela camp by Stanley himself on his journey up the Congo River .
Glave writes :
Slave Trade in the Gongo Basin A
Pole is now planted about ten feet in front of the victim , from the top of which is suspended , by a number of strings , a bamboo ring .
The pole is bent over like a fishing - rod , and the ring fastened round the slaves neck , which is kept rigid and stiff by the tension .
An unearthly silence succeeds .
The executioner wears a cap composed of black cocks feathers ; his face and neck are blackened with charcoal , except the eyes , the lids of which are painted with white chalk .
The hands and arms to the elbow , and feet and legs to the knee , are also blackened .
His legs are adorned profusely with broad metal anklets , and around his waist are strung wild - cat skins .
As he performs a wild dance around his victim , every now and then making a feint with his knife , a murmur of admiration arises from the assembled crowd .
He then approaches and makes a thin chalk mark on the neck of the fated man .
After two or three passes of his knife , .to get the right swing , he delivers the fatal blow , and with one stroke of his keen - edged weapon severs the head from the body .
The sight of blood brings to a climax the frenzy of the natives : some of them savagely puncture the quivering trunk with their spears , others hack at it with their knives , while the remainder engage in a ghastly struggle for the possession of the head , which has been jerked into the air by the released tension of the sapling .
As each man obtains the trophy , and is pursued by the drunken rabble , the hideous tumult becomes deafening ; they smear one anothers faces with blood , and fights always spring tip as a result , when knives and spears are freely used .
The Century Magazine , Volume 39 , Issue 6 . ( Apr. 1890 )
Herbert Ward , a companion of Stanley , wrote a description for Scribner ’s Magazine several months earlier .
It is unclear if Ward actually witness these events , but the text is so similar to Glave ’s ( who is shown to have been a witness in 1884 by Hough above ) one can only assume Ward had been given access to Glave ’s notes or his letters to contemporaries ( perhaps Stanley himself . )
Life Among the Congo Savages
The victim is placed on a block of wood , with his legs stretched out stiff in front of him .
Beside each ankle a small stake is driven firmly into the ground , the same at the knees and at the sides , running up under the arm -pits .
These are then firmly bound together by cords , securing the body rigidly in its position .
His head is then placed in a kind of cage formed by a ring of cane fastened round the neck with numerous strings attached to it which are drawn up over the head and tied together in a loop .
A pliant young sapling is now stuck in the ground about twelve feet from the victim and bent over toward him until the extreme end is caught in the loop , and all the strings round the ring are drawn taut and the neck stretched stiff by the strain .
The executioner then makes his appearance , escorted by the young men and women of the village , each holding over him a palm - leaf , forming a kind of canopy .
On reaching the victim they fall back and leave him there alone .
He wears a cap formed of large black cock ’s tails ; his face is blackened with charcoal down to the neck ; his hands and arms are also blackened up to the elbows , and the same with his legs down to the knees .
Around his loins he wears several wildcat skins .
Standing in front of his victim , he makes at first two or three feints with his knife , to get a proper swing .
Then , deliberately bending down and taking a piece of chalk , put there for the purpose , he draws a thin line around the neck , and putting a little fine sand on his hand so as to get a good grip , with one quick blow with his knife , severs the head from the trunk .
Until just before the execution the whole village is wild in expectation of the event .
Groups of dancers are to be seen , drummers at work , and every kind of musical instrument to add to the tumult .
The head , after being severed , is jerked up in the air by the released tension of the pole .
Scribner ’s Magazine , Volume 7 , Issue 2 . ( February 1890 )
In a biography of Stanley , “ The Man Who Presumed ” , ( 1957 ) the author , Byron Farwell , describes this same execution technique though this time witnessed by yet a third acquaintance of Stanley , Lieutenant Alphonse Vangele , at the Equator station , near to Glave ’s camp .
In the same passage Farwell relates another anecdote of Herbert Ward ( mentioned above ) :
Herbert Ward , another of Stanley ’s officers , recorded seeing a similar ceremony .
Just before one of the slaves was to be decapitated , however , a relative of the dead chief came up to the doomed slave and gave his a message to relay to the spirit of the departed .
He concluded his message with : “… and tell him when you meet , that his biggest war canoe , which I inherit , is rotten . ”
Ward himself had written about this event in his book A Voice from the Congo ( 1910 ) , p. 162 .
So , finally what does this say about the comment from Mr. Rudge of Harlington , Middlesex ?
It seems clear to me that he got the core of the story correct , just accidentally confused Livingstone with Stanley .
And that dark bit of poetry about the victim ’s “ last few moments of awareness would be of flying through the air ” was possibly a conflation of the Ward anecdote to with the more extreme beheading story .
There is some funny math in the world of academic science .
Take my graduate school for example :
My class was made up of eight people – seven women and one man , or 7 to 1 .
He was Snow White and we were the seven dwarves – each with a remarkably appropriate nickname .
I was Grumpy , should you be curious to know .
Snow White and at least four of the dwarves have continued on to postdoctoral research jobs .
That is a 4 to 3 ratio of women who went on to do a post - doc to those that chose alternate career paths .
Everything is adding up so far , right ?
Lots of women are around .
Lots of science is being done .
All is well .
The next set of numbers is slightly puzzling , however .
That is the ratio of female to male professors in our department , at a well - respected academic institution , is 48 to 7 men to women .
Interesting reversal , is n’t it ?
We go from 7 to 1 in grad school to roughly 1 to 7 in professorships .
Clearly , something does not compute .
Where did all the women go ?
What is happening to all the women en route from graduate school to professorship ?
Where is the leak ?
Then again , is it a leak , or more like a pressurized stream ?
What is applying this pressure to force women out of a career in science ?
Is it societal pressure to be a mom and take care of the family ?
Have generations of both men and women perpetuated the belief that in a fist fight between family and work , one or the other has to crawl away a loser ?
Do some women lack self confidence and convince themselves that they do n’t have what it takes to succeed in academic science ?
It is perfectly acceptable , even commendable if women make the choice , which is rightfully theirs , to stay at home , to choose careers outside of science , or to choose , well , anything at all .
It would be all right if the scientific community is still paying catch up with the rest of society in accepting women into their midst and the ratio will equalize in the next decade ( not sure there is evidence either for or against this , but I feel compelled to present it nonetheless ) .
It is not acceptable if women are forced to choose between a family and a career in science .
It is not acceptable if women are feeling unwelcome in the male - dominated , and occasionally inhospitable , scientific community .
It is not acceptable if their being female is detrimental to their careers .
So what is the solution ?
Let women make their own decisions whether to stay or to go .
Remove as many obstacles and pressures as possible and let the choice be theirs .
Is n’t that the whole point of the much - maligned term , feminism ?
Institute reasonable day care at universities .
Allow for extended maternity leave and the option of paternity leave .
Do n’t cut women any breaks .
They are no less inherently able to achieve than men , regardless of what certain Nobel Prize winners and heads of major Universities may say .
They do n’t need pity or hand me downs .
They just need the freedom to choose .

You are here : Home / Animals / 7 role models from the animal world
The shallowness of the world can bring discouragement and frustration to many .
Not succeeding or just finding it difficult to have a purpose in life can easily bring you down .
Youâ€ ™re looking for ideas .
Most role models prove to be exactly the opposite of what they claim to be , so where is the key ?
Maybe looking just a little further may give you the necessary impulse .
Discover new values within yourself !
1. ELEPHANT
Elephants are known to live in groups which are lead by an elder female .
The babies are practically raised together with no discrimination and if one of them hurts his or her leg for example the whole group will walk slower with no complaints .
Elephant families are also famous for adopting lost or orphan babies and especially for returning to their old cemeteries .
Family -
Most of us consider it to be the most important value of all but not everyone actually takes this idea further .
A stressful , time - consuming job , some new prospects , the lack of time , the competitionâ€ ¦
Family life has changed in the last years quite dramatically especially in the powerfully industrialized cities .
Many young people even refuse to start their own family for the reasons mentioned above .
But is it all worth the effort ?
Neglecting your family can have severe effects for everyone involved especially from a psychological point of view .
With a little respect , affection andâ€ ¦time just for a short visit or a phone call you can get rid of depression , loneliness and sadness also bringing joy to the ones you care about .
Also married people are known to live more and they are more likely to have a stable life .
Give it a second thought !
Itâ€™s not necessarily about legalizing but about offering and receiving affection !
2. DOG
Dogs can create remarkable bonds with their human masters which seem to pass beyond the instinct limit as many times dogs endangered their lives to save someone .
There are numerous cases when faithful dogs returned to their owners after traveling hundreds and hundreds of miles or when the death of the master meant the end of the animal as well .
Friendship - next to family is considered one of the most important elements in oneâ€™s life as these relationships influence practically every life aspect : spare time , work , way of thinking , the choices to make .
Investing in friendship is highly beneficial , of course when the other person does just the same .
A lasting friendship brings the best out of someone as it involves deep affection , the unique opportunity to confide without a care , to receive advice from another point of view and also to feel safe and relaxed .
Many people all around the world claim to feel alone most of the time but this happens ion most cases because todayâ€™s lifestyle can easily affect oneâ€™s social skills and even desire to bond .
However , investing in what you have or just discovering the ones around you will bring you more benefits than just some time spent in front of the PC .
3. ALBATROSS
The albatross is a sea bird which is known to live as much as 50 years which is remarkable for a bird .
But what is the most remarkable is the fact that these birds are monogamous which made them a symbol for sailors traveling far away .
Fidelity - a subject all like to joke about but few actually prefer to take it seriously .
Weâ€™ve all heard stories from the tragic ones to the most hilarious but the reality behind them may not be as entertaining .
Usually in these situations this is a sign that the couple has a serious problem which is definitely not solved the right way .
Infidelity is a source of distress for everyone involved leading to negative psychological effects such as guilt , underestimating , frustration , lack of confidence in anyone , adaptation problems .
Itâ€™s always been there and will probably never disappear .
However , putting fidelity behind a glass and calling it unreachable is not where we want to be .
4. PUFFIN
Puffins are sea birds which lay their eggs on cliffs in order not to be eaten by predators .
However , when the babies hatch they prepare for a long journey to the beach .
When the time comes to follow their parents , they jump from a remarkable height , most of them arriving safe on the beach .
Courage - Desiring is humanâ€ ¦but daring ?
Taking a decision , most of the times risky , is something many would not rather do .
Asking for a raise , leaving home for a college abroad , talking about your feelings - not easy .
But the torment of deciding what to do is nothing compared to the regret of missing a once in a lifetime opportunity because of fear .
We hear of people who could have done so much and so well but were afraid , everyday .
The ones who take the tough decisions are on the front page of the newspapers .
So when you truly have a feeling that this may be the right decision , analyze the situation ( making quick decisions without thinking is not the best thing to do ) take a deep breath and go for it .
It may be the right thing .
5. SALMON
Salmons travel thousands and thousands of miles to get to the rivers they began their lives in .
Many never reach their goal , but the ones who do offer the new generation the chance to make the same journey .
Perseverance -
Once youâ€™ve made the decision donâ€™t give up on it immediately because of a reason or another !
People giving up is a problem maybe not many take into consideration when they should .
Many things , some very important remain unfinished just because giving up seems a very attractive alternative .
Continuous effort is however the key in many cases as luck rarely strikes .
Leaving behind the idea , value or impulse is what causes these things to happen .
A few difficulties , some bad comments and itâ€™s hard to go on .
And still what if others gave up on their dreams or plans ?
Would the world still be the same now ?
Of course , being a Don Quixote is something totally undesirable .
Be sure that itâ€™s worth fighting for !
6. Wolf
Wolves are strong and resistant animals , being able to hunt various types of prey .
However , a wolf knows that hunting in packs is the key towards reaching a bigger lunch .
When hunting together , wolves can even kill a 500 kilo - moose , which is 10 times bigger than any of them and capable of putting tremendous fight .
Teamwork â€ “ Trusting your own powers and involving in various activities is something everyone is recommended to do .
But only to rely on yourself may not be the best solution .
More heads means more ideas .
Of course , itâ€™s normal to want to achieve glory and maximum of results by yourself ; however , history was rarely changed by just a person , there were definitely others by his or her side .
Jealousy can also be there .
Still , working like this will show you that you cannot be the best at everything but that collective effort is the key to the problem .
So , work with others to achieve a goal , share ideas , give a hand !
The results will worth making a change .
But teamwork is not just about work and school , it is about your spare time too : socialize , interact , be part of a group !
What would sports be without it ?
Or how would any humanitarian action be successful ?
Maybe there is some truth in those old sayingsâ€ ¦
7. Golden - fronted Bowerbird
One of the most impressing mating rituals belongs to a species of birds from the rain forest and concerns a special care for beauty , called the Golden - fronted Bowerbird .
Every male builds some kind of presentation tent where he puts all the beautiful things he can find especially blue things and arranges them so that they will attract a female .
The ladies come , analyze what they see and many times are not satisfied so that the males have to start working again until itâ€™s perfect .
Beauty - it fascinates each and every one of us , we have to admit it .
Finding and admiring the real beauty can be one of the most amazing things to do .
The beauty is everywhere , in nature , in the people around us , in our homes .
Becoming more attentive to details , having higher standards , improving the way you see the world is what you should do .
Beauty is not a shallow value as long as it is appreciated correctly .
Find the beauty around you and enjoy it , learn to smile at all the small things around you like a walk in the evening while the sun sets .
Animals react the way their instinct and senses dictate and still prove to be remarkable role models .
Finding the right value in them and using it in real life is what makes people remarkable .
Mr Wood says police should not target peaceful protestors A legal bid to challenge the power of the police to use surveillance against peaceful protesters has been launched at the High Court .
Andrew Wood , from Oxford , claims he was harassed by the Metropolitan Police for campaigning against the arms trade .
He says they breached his human rights by photographing and questioning him even though he had not broken the law .
The Metropolitan Police says its actions were " justified and proportionate " .
The judicial review could decide if police are legally entitled to gather information on people even if they do not commit an offence .
Mr Wood told BBC Radio 5 Live : " It was very intrusive . "
Shareholder Mr Wood , who was then a press officer at Campaign Against Arms Trade ( CAAT ) , attended the 2005 annual meeting of Reed Elsevier , a company which organises arms fairs .
He had bought a share in Reed Elsevier in advance and therefore says he was entitled to attend the meeting as a legitimate shareholder .
A police surveillance operation like the one I experienced risks a real prospect of a chilling effect on democratic participation
Andrew Wood
Arms campaigner
He says he wanted to ask the board of directors about the company 's recent purchase of another arms exhibitioner Spearhead .
Martin Westgate , representing Mr Wood , told the High Court : " He asked one question .
His behaviour was completely unexceptional , although there was a small disturbance and two other people were ejected . "
Mr Wood says that when he left the meeting officers from the Metropolitan Police breached the Human Rights
Act by photographing , questioning and following him and six other campaigners .
And he says they committed further breaches by storing the photographs on police computers even though none of the protestors was arrested or charged with any offence .
" The behaviour of the police was oppressive , bordering on harassment , " Mr Wood said .
" A police surveillance operation like the one I experienced risks a real prospect of a chilling effect on democratic participation . "
' Criminal acts ' Lawyers representing Met Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair insist that any interference with Mr Wood 's human rights was at a very low level and in pursuit of the legitimate aim of preventing crime .
It was ... considered necessary to photograph and if possible , identify those who attended the AGM
Metropolitan Police
In a letter responding to Mr Wood 's allegations , the Metropolitan Police said they felt there was " a likelihood that demonstrators may well engage in criminal acts " .
" It was therefore considered necessary to photograph and if possible , identify those who attended the AGM in order to protest in case they had either caused disruption or planned to do so in the future , " it said .
The intention was , the police added , " to do no more than remind participants of the need to comply with the law " .
But Mr Westgate said : " It may well be that a group of police officers may consider this was behaving in an entirely amicable , non-intimidatory way , but that is not the way it appears on the receiving end . "
Recently , CAAT played a major role in winning a High Court ruling that the government acted unlawfully when it stopped a corruption investigation into BAE Systems '
Al - Yamamah arms deals with Saudi Arabia .
The hearing is scheduled to last for two days .

Indian baby dropping ritual
Posted
Apr 30 - Muslims in western India have been observing a bizarre ritual - they 've been throwing their young children off a tall building to improve their health .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans are feeling a lot more economic pain than the government 's official statistics would lead you to believe , according to a growing number of experts .
They argue that figures for unemployment and inflation are being understated by the government .
Unemployment and inflation are typically added together to come up with a so - called " Misery Index . "
The " Misery Index " was often cited during periods of high unemployment and inflation , such as the mid 1970s and late 1970s to early 1980s .
And some fear the economy may be approaching those levels again .
The official numbers produce a current Misery Index of only 8.9 - inflation of 3.9 % plus unemployment of 5 % .
That 's not far from the Misery Index 's low of 6.1 seen in 1998 .
But using the estimates on CPI and unemployment from economists skeptical of the government numbers , the Misery Index is actually in the teens .
Some worry it could even approach the post - World War II record of 20.6 in 1980 .
" We 're looking at government numbers that are really out of whack , " said Kevin Phillips , author of the book " Bad Money . "
No inflation if you do n't eat or drive
According to the government 's most recent Consumer Price Index , a key inflation reading , consumer prices rose 3.9 % in the 12 months ending in April , down slightly from the 4 % annual inflation rate in March despite record gasoline prices .
But Phillips argues that consumer prices are probably up at least 5 % and perhaps more than 10 % .
Part of the disconnect may be due to the fact that nondurable goods , such as food and gasoline , makes up only 12 % of CPI .
In addition , food and energy prices are eliminated from the so - called core CPI , which many economists tend to focus more closely on because they claim food and gas prices are volatile .
But food and energy costs are a very important part of household budgets .
And those prices have been skyrocketing : Gas prices were up about 21 % over the 12 months ending in April .
However , due to seasonal adjustments in the CPI , the government reported that gas prices were down 2 % in April , even though on a non-adjusted basis , gas prices rose 5.6 % from March .
And even that number may be too low .
Measures of gasoline prices by AAA and the Department of Energy suggested prices rose as much as 10 % in April .
Meanwhile , food prices rose 5.1 % over the last 12 months , according to the report .
The nearly 1 % one - month jump in food prices in April was the biggest spike in 18 years .
To that end , nearly half of the respondents of a recent CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll said inflation was the biggest problem they face .
CPI missed the housing bubble ... and bust
Another problem with the CPI figures , according to skeptics , is that it does n't accurately reflect what 's going on in the housing market .
That 's significant because the cost of buying a home has twice the impact on CPI as does the prices of all nondurable goods combined .
The CPI showed only an 11 % rise in home ownership costs from 2002 through 2006 , a time that the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home prices soared 34 % .
The reason for the low CPI reading is because the CPI looks at equivalent rents , rather than home prices .
So inflation was understated during this period , according to Phillips .
He argues this may have helped feed the housing boom since it kept mortgage rates lower than they should have been .
Now that the housing boom has gone bust , the CPI appears to be missing the declines in home prices as well ; it estimates that the cost of owning a home posted a 12 - month increase of 2.6 % in April .
But because the CPI figure was so far behind tracking the increase in home values , the housing component of CPI still is leading to a lower inflation reading than what it should be , Phillips said .
The inflation ' con job '
The unusual way that housing prices are estimated is n't the only peculiarity of the CPI report .
Over the past ten years , there have been other changes in the calculations , particularly for big ticket items .
Cuts to estimated prices for items like electronics and cars that are thought to have improvements in quality year - after - year have lowered the overall CPI .
In addition , changes in the way certain products , such as food , are tracked by the government , have also contributed to lower readings than otherwise expected .
Bill Gross , the manager of Pimco Total Return , the nation 's largest bond fund , refers to the CPI as a " con job " that deliberately understates the price pressures faced by Americans in order to keep Social Security payments and other government costs pegged to the index unduly low .
In a report about the CPI , he noted that some of the adjustments do n't accurately reflect how much consumers pay for goods .
Pimco estimates that the changes have shaved more than a percentage point off the CPI .
" Did your new model computer come with a 25 % discount from last year 's price ? "
Gross wrote .
" Probably not .
What is likely is that you paid about the same price for memory improvements you 'll never use . "
Another flaw with the CPI numbers is that the government now assumes that higher prices for one item will lead consumers to buy more of a substitution item .
That may be true .
But if people buy fewer steaks and more hamburgers , for example , it 's unrealistic to say that inflation is n't a problem , skeptics maintain .
" The government can claim there 's no inflation but all they 're measuring is a reduced standard of living , " argues Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , an investment firm specializing in overseas investments .
With all this in mind , California economist John Williams argues that CPI is understating inflation by at least 3 percentage points and perhaps as much as 7 percentage points .
So instead of an annual inflation rate of 4 % , the true number could be between 7 % and 11 % .
Unemployed , but not counted
Finally , there 's the unemployment rate .
It was at a relatively low 5 % in April .
But according to Williams '
Web site , ShadowStats.com , the actual rate may be between 8 % and 12 % if you use a more accurate reading of those out of work .
Even the government 's own numbers show there are many unemployed people not showing up in the unemployment rate .
The official reading does not include 4.8 million people who want to work but have n't found a job , for example .
Many of these people are dropped from the official calculation because they have become so discouraged from looking without success that they have n't looked in the previous four weeks .
Simply adding those people to the number of unemployed takes the current unemployment rate to 7.8 % .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics , which produces both the CPI and unemployment readings , says changes in both measures were made to more accurately reflect the real world .
The BLS also says the changes have resulted in changes of less than 1 % for each measure .
Still , the Labor Department 's own broadest measure of unemployment , which includes as jobless those working part - time jobs because they can't find full - time positions as well as some discouraged job seekers , puts the unemployment rate at 9.2 % in April , the highest level for that reading in more than three years .
So if you take that number and add that to the 7 % that Williams thinks is a more likely annual inflation rate , you 're looking at a " Misery Index " of 16.2 , much worse than the 8.9 you get from the official numbers .
And while that may seem a bit high , it 's probably a more accurate gauge of how bad the economy is for many Americans .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The percentage of Americans saying the economy is getting worse has inched back up to 86 % , one percentage point off the high for the year in Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
As has been the case throughout April , at least 4 in 10 Americans ( 42 % in the latest polling ) rate current economic conditions as " poor " .

Employees at Apple have filed a patent for integrating solar cells into portable devices by placing them underneath the layers of a touch - sensitive display , according to the filing .
Solar power could help make devices truly portable , freeing from the need for wires to connect them to a power supply .
When generating electricity from solar panels , the larger the panel the better -- but as the patent " Solar cells on portable devices " warns , after allowing space for buttons , screens and a way to hold the device , only a small area is left on most devices for solar cells .
One of the ways around that suggested in the patent is to stack a touch - sensitive layer , a display and solar panel on top of one another .
That could make Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch good candidates for such a power supply , as the display occupies almost the entire face of those devices .
The use of solar powered charging in portable devices is starting to get more attention , for more immediate consumer use as well .
When Vodafone announced its plan in April to reduce its emissions of the greenhouse gase CO2 by 50 percent by 2020 , it also announced plans for solar - powered phone chargers and universal phone chargers for Vodafone - branded handsets .
At the recent ITU Telecom Africa 2008 conference , Ugandan Minister for Communications and Information and Communication Technologies Ham - Mukasa Mulira talked about trials of solar - powered charging conducted there , which had showed promise .
The accountancy firm that looks after children 's entertainers the Wiggles is not an obvious place to search for the Holy Grail , but that 's where the trail led last night .
It started with a simple quest - what on earth is a large advertisment headlined " The Ancient & Noble Order of The Knights Templar " doing in the Daily Telegraph ? - and it led your intrepid investigator to the wilds of west London and then all the way back to the 12th century .
It was around 1118 when the order of the Knights Templar was founded in the Holy Land by Hughes de Payens and eight other French knights to protect pilgrims and defend Jerusalem , which had been captured by the Crusaders in 1099 .
Over almost two centuries , the order grew into one of the most rich and powerful institutions of the era .
It all came crashing down when the Pope burnt the Templars ' last grand master at the stake in Paris in 1314 .
The order seemed to have disappeared - until yesterday , when this tantalising advertisement appeared .
Apart from the odd misplaced apostrophe and various arcane references to " annulling the bull " , the advert gravely announced that the Knights Templar would petition the Pope to " restore the Order with the duties , rights and privileges appropriate to the 21st century and beyond " .
It called on all Templar groups and " brothers in arms " around the world to get in touch , either via its website , www.theknightstemplar.info, or an address in west London , which could clearly become a mecca for long - lost Templars and baffled Telegraph readers alike .
My quest was to decipher this advertisement and find out why someone would pay several thousand pounds to place it in the press .
Historians agree that the Knights Templar were a powerful military order of warrior monks charged with defending the Holy Land .
They amassed great wealth , although their prestige was damaged when the Christians were driven out of Jerusalem in the 13th century .
King Philip IV " the Fair " of France is also said to have become indebted to the Templars , and in 1307 ordered the arrest of the grand master of the order , Jacques de Molay , and other key leaders , who were hit with the usual concoction of lurid charges : heresy , sodomy and devil worship .
Philip persuaded his pal Pope Clement V to issue a bull suppressing the Templars in 1312 .
Two years later , Molay was burned at the stake on an island in the Seine .
That , you might think , was that : the cruel destruction of a religious order in the Middle Ages .
But this particular nasty , brutish and short episode in medieval history has spawned long centuries of rumour about the Templars .
" They have become a kind of mosaic of mythology and conspiracy , secrecy and survival and anti-papacy right across Europe and into North America , " says Martin Palmer , a theologian and religious historian .
A popular myth is that the Templars lived on - in Scotland and secret rooms in Paris - hoarding their riches ( one cup , used by Christ ) and guarding their secrets ( Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene ) .
And since the 19th century , all kinds of new Templar groups , often loosely connected to the Masons or taking on familiar Christian rituals , have popped up , claiming to recapture the spirit of the original order .
Last year , the Vatican felt so besieged by the weight of conspiracy and conjecture drummed up by Dan Brown 's Da Vinci Code that it took an unsual step : it released a document from its archives called the Chinon parchment , which shows that Pope Clement V's investigation into the Templars in 1308 actually cleared them of the heresy charges that led to many being put to death .
Members of Templar groups have called on Pope Benedict to make a formal apology ; the Vatican instead issued a collector 's edition of the documents for £ 4,000 a pop .
Why did Rome take such a step ?
" The Catholic church has been shaken by The Da Vinci Code et al , " says Palmer .
" It was trying to put its side of the story and quash the idea that the Knights were Satanists conspiring to overturn Christendom .
It 's a full - frontal assault on the conspiracy theorists , and that 's why the document was published with considerable fanfare . "
What the advert demands is a formal restoration of the Knights Templar .
Such a move would not be without precedent : the Jesuits were suppressed by the Catholic church in 1773 before being formally restored by Rome in 1814 .
" In the background is a mix of Da Vinci Code nonsense and a hard - headed real estate issue , " says Palmer .
" The consequences of the papacy restoring the Knights would be to open up an enormous can of worms . "
One of the worms is property .
While Palmer dismisses contemporary " orders " that claim lineage back to 14th - century Templars , he believes modern Templars could in theory claim rights to property seized by the Catholic church .
There could , for instance , be a dispute over the ownership of the Temple Church in London ( which passed to the Church of England ) .
Another possible worm is the reaction that the restoration of the Templars would cause among some Islamic groups who associate the Templars with the Crusades .
Palmer believes the Pope , who has worked hard to build bridges between Islam and Christianity after several gaffes , would be wary of triggering more conflict with the Muslim world .
And so I find myself in west London , at the address given in the advert .
It turns out to be the offices of Sloane & Co , a small accountancy firm set up by David Sloane in 1974 .
Sloane is no boring bean - counter - he 's a rock accountant .
Over the years , he 's done the books for INXS , Maxi Priest , Mark Morrison and even Melinda Messenger .
His top clients today are the Wiggles , the Australian preschool entertainers who sport primary - coloured turtlenecks and have made millions from selling CDs of songs about Dorothy the Dinosaur .
The connection between turtleneck - wearing entertainers and a secretive group of warrior monks has me stumped .
At Sloane & Co's offices , the stairs are being redecorated .
Hang on : is that an image of the Turin Shroud in undercoat ?
Only kidding .
According to the Charities Commission , Sloane is the official representative of the Knights Templar Trust charity , which is listed on the advertisement .
Sadly , Sloane is not at his office and does not return my calls .
All he will say is the Ancient & Noble Order of the Knights Templar " is a client of Sloane & Co " .
Why does the client want to reinvigorate and restore the Knights Templar ?
Apparently a press release in a couple of days will reveal all .
The Templars ' website is registered under the name of another accountant .
Are the Templars a group of accountants ?
Sadly , this man is said to have left the company of tax accountants on the Isle of Man three years ago and he eludes my attempts to find him .
Still , if the Templars hid from us for 700 years through a combination of secret trap doors and shy accountants , it 's probably no disgrace that I can't locate them in one afternoon .
" Were there a serious attempt to re-establish the order , we would see all kinds of funny creatures coming out from under the stones , " predicts Palmer .
" This could be an interesting meeting of mysticism and Mammon . "
President Bush , accepting the recommendation of Army Gen. David H. Petraeus to halt the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in July , said Thursday that he would give the war commander “ all the time he needs ” to decide on future troop cuts .
But in a surprising show of public concern about an open- ended U.S. commitment , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told a Senate hearing that he hoped to resume troop reductions soon after a “ brief ” 45 - day pause this summer .
Gates ’ comments , along with similar testimony from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , were in stark contrast to those of Petraeus , who spent two days this week on Capitol Hill telling lawmakers that it could be months before conditions in Iraq permitted further troop withdrawals .
Differences within the Pentagon over the issue have been brewing for months , but rarely have they been aired publicly .
Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee seized on the contrasts , prompting Gates to acknowledge that there is a difference in the way he and Petraeus view troop levels .

“ My view is that [ Petraeus ] should be in a position at the end of that 45 - day period of evaluation and consolidation to make a determination whether a next further drawdown could take place , ” Gates said .
“ One of the benefits of being secretary of Defense , I suppose , is that I ’m more allowed to hope than the field commander is . ”
U.S. officials are in the process of withdrawing additional units sent last year as part of the troop buildup .
Once the last of those units leave , in July , Petraeus will have at least 45 days before contemplating further troop cuts under the recommendation approved by Bush .
But Gates and Petraeus appear to differ over how long commanders should take before deciding on further troop withdrawals .
Petraeus has been pressing to keep force levels as high as possible , winning a sympathetic ear from Bush .
In a televised address announcing that he had accepted Petraeus ’ recommendation , Bush said he would cut the length of Army tours from 15 months to a year starting with units deployed after Aug .
1 . In the address , Bush also set a high bar for troop withdrawals .

“ The day will come when Iraq is a stable democracy that helps fight our common enemies and promote our common interests in the Middle East , ” Bush said , aiming his comments at U.S. troops and civilians in Iraq .
“ When that day arrives , you ’ll come home with pride in your success and the gratitude of your whole nation . ”
But members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have repeatedly expressed concern that frequent deployments have strained U.S. ground forces and depleted resources needed elsewhere , particularly in Afghanistan .
Gates has been sympathetic to them but has mostly mediated differences .
The Pentagon leadership is under new pressure to find additional troops to send to Afghanistan to fulfill a commitment Bush made at a NATO summit last month , a senior Defense official said .
But Pentagon planners will only be able to supply those troops if further cuts in Iraq this year bring the size of the force there below 140,000 troops , or 15 brigades .
Advertisement
“ It is everyone ’s desire to get below 15 , ” said the Defense official , who was not authorized to speak publicly on troop levels .
On Capitol Hill , Gates emphasized that all members of the military leadership , including Adm. Michael G. Mullen , the Joint Chiefs chairman , supported Petraeus ’ recommendation that there be a 45 - day suspension of troop cuts .
But Mullen , testifying with Gates , said that U.S. units could continue to train Iraqi forces and prod the Iraqi government toward political reconciliation while the number of troops was reduced .
“ I see no reason why we cannot accomplish these goals while also keeping open the option of an informed drawdown of forces throughout the remainder of this year , ” Mullen said .

Mullen spoke with added urgency about Afghanistan , where 31,000 U.S. troops are fighting .
In Afghanistan , Mullen said , “ we do what we can .
But doing what we can in Afghanistan is not doing all that we should . ”
The comments by Gates and Mullen set up a potential confrontation this fall , just weeks before the U.S. presidential election .
The Pentagon , worried about having enough troops for Afghanistan , may insist on cuts in the Iraq force .
But such a stance would clash with Petraeus and other commanders , who want high troop levels through October for Iraq ’s provincial elections .
Gates described the cessation of troop withdrawals in July as a “ brief pause . ” Both Petraeus and Bush avoided using those words .
“ There is clearly a disagreement in rhetoric , ” said Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman .
“ Clearly , there is a clash . ”

Despite the differences , there was also broad accord among the U.S. political and military leadership during a day of public appearances .
Bush , Gates , Mullen and Petraeus all agreed that the 15 - month troop buildup had reduced violence and enabled the start of economic redevelopment and political reconciliation .
Bush argued that the buildup had changed the course of the war and revived prospects for success .
Those who have argued that further troop reductions would put needed pressure on the Iraqi government to stand on its own are wrong , he said .
“ The Iraqis are a proud people , ” Bush said at the White House , standing before military veterans and members of his Cabinet .
“ But they know that they still need our help until they can stand by themselves . ”
Mullen , who serves as the president ’s chief military advisor , told senators that future political progress depends on the willingness of Iraqi leaders to make difficult decisions .
“ Our troops can open many doors , but they cannot force Iraqi leaders through them , ” he said .

Democratic leaders denounced Bush ’s upbeat description , pointing to recent violence and attacks on Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone , where U.S. operations are based .
“ The president still does n’t understand that America ’s limited resources cannot support this endless war that he ’s gotten us involved in , ” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
In his address , Bush again warned Iran against training and funding militant Shiite militias .
“ If Iran makes the wrong choice , America will act to protect our interests and our troops and our Iraqi partners , ” Bush said , without specifying possible action .
U.S. officials have accused Iran of contributing to recent violence in Iraq through its support of extremists .
The violence has spilled into formerly peaceful Baghdad neighborhoods , including the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City , where militants loyal to cleric Muqtada Sadr have battled U.S. and Iraqi forces for two weeks .

Fighting erupted there again Tuesday , with two U.S. airstrikes to destroy suspected rocket locations .
U.S. officials provided no casualty figures , but Iraqi police said seven people were killed and 18 wounded in the strikes .
Separately , the U.S. military announced that an American soldier died earlier this week when his vehicle struck a roadside bomb in central Baghdad .
The incident raised American troop deaths to 20 in April .
U.S. fatalities have jumped since March 25 , the start of an Iraqi - led offensive in Basra .

Times staff writers James Gerstenzang in Washington and Ned Parker and Saif Hameed in Baghdad contributed to this report .
Dave Mark ’s post on Why Not More Simulation in Game AI ?
and the comments it elicited are right on the money about the correlation between lifespan and intelligence of supposedly intelligent adversaries in first person shooter ( FPS ) games .
It is extremely refreshing to hear advanced gamers agreeing that more intelligent , longer - lived characters would keep a game more interesting and engaging than current FPS .
This is exactly consistent with my experience with one of my employers who delivers intelligent agents for the military .
The military calls them “ computer generated forces ” ( CGFs ) .
The idea is that these things need to be smart and human enough to constitute a meaningful adversary for training purposes ( i.e. , “ serious games ” ) .
Our agents fly fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft or animate special operations forces ( SOFs ) on the ground .
( They even talk – with humans – over the radio .
I love that part .
It makes them seem so human . )
Of course , they get to demonstrate this intelligence only because they are not shot up or blown to bits within seconds !
Here ’s where AI in games is headed ( from the perspective of a behavior leader in serious games ) :
Real AI is being embedded with gaming milddleware to animate non-player characters ( NPCs ) with much higher human - like fidelity .
Human performance modeling , including emotion , is being enhanced within the cognitive models of CGFs and will show up next in NPCs .
Crowd animation is becoming much more sophisticated and moving to center stage in role - playing games ( RPGs ) .
The first step involves embedding a rule - based or similar cognitive architecture in game AI middleware .
These days , game AI middleware is pretty much about path planning and finite - state machine ( FSM ) modeling of agent behavior .
That is , it is not knowledge based and has all the limitations on context - sensitive and complexity that you would expect if you were hard - coding in C++
( Java is out since the middleware has to support the Xbox and the Playstation , as well as Microsoft Windows and Linux , in some cases . )
The FSM approach has been played out to its limit with hierarchical task networks .
For a look at some of this software , see :
AI - Implant from Presagis
Gamebryo from Emergent Game Technologies
kynapse from kynogon ( acquired by Autodesk )
Jupiter from Touchdown Entertainment
DI - Guy from Boston Dynamics
From our standpoint , Presagis is particularly well positioned to transition from serious games to entertainment .
We also think their simulation , 3D terrain , and flight dynamics capabilities are by far the best for our autonomous pilots in our military markets .
( We might have to plug - in to Microsoft Flight Simulator in the consumer market , though ! )
Autonomy in gaming and robotics
Parenthetically , our agents can also fly unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , but for those most part those are teleoperated rather than autonomous .
Boston Dynamics BigDog is one example of an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle ( UGV ) that will have our kind of cognition on board in the surprisingly near future .
Boston Dynamics apparently sees the same synergy in autonomy across gaming and robotics that we do .
They are also teamed up with Presagis using DI - Guy with AI - implant .
If you are interested in this kind of synnergy , you might also want to take a look at the following robotics middleware :
If you take a close look at the “ behavior modeling ” of these and game AI software you will see many conceptual similarities .
Short term AI for NPCs
Bringing rule - based cognitive capabilities to NPCs involves taking our AI technology and replacing or augmenting the FSM / HTN approaches of existing middleware is the critical step forward for AI in games .
This means C++ in order to support the Xbox and the Playstation , if not Microsoft Windows and Linux , too .
Our technology tends to be a little too heavy for the massive crowds that kynogon addresses ( check out these videos ) .
Our technology is more capable of moderate crowds , but it is really targeted at teams of agents at high fidelity .
And our technology is perfect for high - fidelity human animation .
Check out this ( and other ) videos from DI - Guy , for example .
Aside from the post I referenced above , these audio / video clips can give you some insight on how much game developers are commited to AI and how hard they are working to push the limits of their current approaches :
A podcast by a developer of the AI in Halo III .
( I too like the NPCs fighting to drive the HumVee . )
A video with the developer of the AI in Assassins ’ Creed .
The Assassin ’s Creed scenario is close to ideal for today ’s cognitive AI .
You have a small crowd of agents of long - lived NPCs where the quality of the game emerges from the reality and complexity of interactions with them .
It has a long way to go but this game clearly broke ground .
The basic approach is to take the lessons from military CGFs , especially concerning cognitive and human performance modeling , including emotion , and raise the level of everything from path planning to behavior up to the knowledge - level .
If you take a close look at some of the game AI middleware , you will see that NPCs actually throw out rays to “ see ” .
In a few years ( a game cycle or two ) , NPCs will just drop into games and perceive their environment with the same vision that camera and laser equiped robots use .
And they will figure how to get from point A to point B the same way you and I do .
Going into all the details of how this is unfolding is too much for me at the moment , but here are few more references on where the military folks are coming from :
Stottler Henke tried ( apparently unsuccessfully ) with the FSM / HTN approach in SimBionic .
Chi Systems tried ( apparently unsuccessfully ) with a proprietary cognitive architecture in iGEN .
Micro Analysis & Design remains strictly military CGF emphasizing stress / fatique / hunger / training more than cognition or emotion .
Soar Technology also remains strictly military CGF with the strongest emphasis on cognition and some emotional modeling .
Note that each of these companies does more than “ intelligent ” agent work , I am only commenting on those aspects here .
Realistic Avatars
As more human behavior ( including performance and emotion ) is modeled , facial animation , including speech will become key .
I enjoy CrazyTalk from Reallusion but image metrics seem to be the facial animation leader for current games .
Also , check out Volker Blanz .
If you find this interesting , nothing that I have seen compares to the work of Stephen Stahlberg .
It will take a lot of horsepower before the agents that we interact with will be as personified as the video behind his face shown above , but will happen .
Intelligent Agents
As compelling as synthetic humans may become , their ability to engage us and be of use to us will require more the complex behavior , it will require learning and problem solving that current rule technology does not address .
Some of the cognitive architectures such as Soar and ACT - R provide these capabilities , the former on a rule - based platform .
Soar is an interesting technology with a good rule engine .
It may not be the exact approach to embed in AI middleware , but it is certainly a guidepost on the way towards intelligent autonomous agents , whether they be on screen or robots .
Of the estimated 7,000 languages spoken in the world today , linguists say , nearly half are in danger of extinction and likely to disappear in this century .
In fact , one falls out of use about every two weeks .
Some languages vanish in an instant , at the death of the sole surviving speaker .
Others are lost gradually in bilingual cultures , as indigenous tongues are overwhelmed by the dominant language at school , in the marketplace and on television .
New research , reported yesterday , has found the five regions where languages are disappearing most rapidly : northern Australia , central South America , North America ’s upper Pacific coastal zone , eastern Siberia , and Oklahoma and the southwestern United States .
All have indigenous people speaking diverse languages , in falling numbers .
The study was based on field research and data analysis supported by the National Geographic Society and the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages .
The findings are described in the October issue of National Geographic and at languagehotspots.org .
Maybe Barack Obama backers just decided to sleep in longer after Tuesday night 's barnburner of a primary in Indiana .
The day 's first movement by an undeclared Democratic superdelegate was into Hillary Clinton 's camp .
But Obama 's team countered with three pickups , and according to the Associated Press he will gain another .
The trio of new supporters announced by Obama 's campaign includes Democratic National Committee member Inola Henry of Los Angeles .
More on her and the other two ( both from North Carolina ) can be gleaned here .
The fourth pickup , reported by the AP , will be especially gratifying for Obama -- Jennifer McClellan , a state lawmaker in Virginia , once had been a Clinton supporter .
A few days ago , McClellan was featured in a Washington Post story on the increasing pressure D.C. - area superdelegates were feeling to either make up their minds or change their allegiance .
" This is the most stressful thing I 've been through in my whole life , " she told the paper .
" It was never supposed to be like this . "

Maybe you are in the nice situation of running machine with multiple cpu cores having to crunch a lot of numbert or providing network daemons .
Multiple cpu cores can boost your performance dramatically but there are , of course , possible issues .
On is the fact , that interrupts by default are mainly called by the first cpu .
As applications that are n’t able to thread correctly can stick to this cpu you might notice by a „ cat / proc / interrupts “ that something goes wrong .
The following is a ( compressed ) / proc / interrupts from a live server running for about ten weeks :
CPU0 CPU1 0 : 1855681242 574 timer 7 : 0 0 parport0 8 : 1 0 rtc 9 : 1 0 acpi 14 : 65 0 ide0 58 : 4 0 ehci_hcd:usb1 , uhci_hcd : usb2 66 : 212905125 72 3w - xxxx 74 : 1094755762 0 eth0 185 : 6223686 0 uhci_hcd:usb4 , eth1 193 : 1978 0 uhci_hcd:usb3 , libata
You can see , that actually all interrupts are called by CPU0 .
We want to brush this up !
How ?
Just run a „ aptitude install irqbalance “ as irqbalance promises :
Daemon to balance interrupts across multiple CPUs , which can lead to better performance and IO balance on SMP systems .
This package is especially useful on systems with multi-core processors , as interrupts will typically only be serviced by the first core .
So let ’s check after about one week by another „ cat / proc / interrupts “ :
CPU0 CPU1 0 : 1887385089 33827155 timer 7 : 0 0 parport0 8 : 1 0 rtc 9 : 1 0 acpi 14 : 65 0 ide0 58 : 4 0 ehci_hcd:usb1 , uhci_hcd : usb2 66 : 212950265 11810501 3w-xxxx 74 : 1310191290 0 eth0 169 : 0 0 uhci_hcd:usb5 185 : 6223686 228881 uhci_hcd:usb4 , eth1 193 : 1978 0 uhci_hcd:usb3 , libata
Nice , is n’t it ?
CPU1 started to grab interrupts also .
If we would reboot the server , most of the irqs would look balanced over time .
( most , not all )
Please notice :
Before installing irqbalance , check your / proc / interrupts .
It might be possible , that you do n’t need it though you have multiple cores as there is a value „ CONFIG_IRQBALANCE “ in 2.6 kernels that can be turned on .
[ update ]
The comments ( thank you ! ) pointed out the following :
There are reports on crashed systems using irqbalance .
( Though I have never seen anyone by myself )
Note that irqbalance is not in main – if you are using it on an important server .
CONFIG_IRQBALANCE seems to be enabled in Bbuntu Hardy by default .
There are discussions about removing CONFIG_IRQBALANCE as it is said that irqbalance is more reliable .
So it is up to you to decice which one to use !
[ update2 ]
Actually a glance on / boot / config - 2.6.24 -17 - generic shows , that CONFIG_IRQBALANCE seems not to be enabled in Hardy though the balancing seems to work .
Actually I am not one of the kernel guys so my investigation will take it ’s time .
Any hints welcome ( thank you lissyx ) .
Mr Bush : " Popularity is fleeting ... principles are forever " President George W Bush has said he was disappointed in " flawed intelligence " in the run-up to the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Mr Bush said analysis of the material by many intelligence agencies had led to the " wrong conclusion " on weapons of mass destruction .
In an interview with internet portal Yahoo and newspaper Politico , he also explained why he had given up golf .
" I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal , " he said .
Carter criticised Mr Bush said he did not feel he had been misled on the intelligence on Iraq .
" ' Mislead ' is a strong word ...
Do I think somebody lied to me ?
No , I do n't .
I think it was just , you know , they analysed the situation and came up with the wrong conclusion . "
Mr Bush said the 2003 UN Baghdad killings ended his golf
He said intelligence communities across the world had shared the same assessment .
" And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was , " he said .
Mr Bush also said a US pullout of Iraq or not maintaining " a forward presence " in the Middle East would send " all kinds of signals " .
" It would shake everybody 's nerves , and it would embolden the very same people that we 're trying to defeat . "
Mr Bush was also asked why he had not been seen on the golf course for almost five years and recalled the explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 that killed top UN envoy , Sergio Vieira de Mello , and 21 others .
" I remember when de Mello ... got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man 's life .
And I was playing golf ... and they pulled me off the golf course and I said , it 's just not worth it anymore . "
He said : " I did n't want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander - in - chief playing golf . "
Mr Bush , who has just begun a trip to the Middle East , said he thought " we 're on the right track to defining a Palestinian state " .
The president also criticised former President Jimmy Carter , who said recently the next US leader should commit to avoiding torturing prisoners or invading nations unless its own security was threatened .
Mr Bush said the US did not torture and suggested Mr Carter was advocating a policy of courting popularity .
" Popularity is fleeting ... principles are forever , " Mr Bush said .
The president also touched on other key issues : Global warming : " I could have supported a lousy treaty and everybody would have went , ' Oh , man , what a wonderful sounding fellow he is ' .
But it just would n't have worked . "
" I could have supported a lousy treaty and everybody would have went , ' Oh , man , what a wonderful sounding fellow he is ' .
But it just would n't have worked . "
Democrat - led Congress : " I would call them , so far , good at verbiage and not so good at results . "
" I would call them , so far , good at verbiage and not so good at results . "
Burma : " It 's taken these people too long to move .
It 's almost as if they 're in a state of denial . "
" It 's taken these people too long to move .
It 's almost as if they 're in a state of denial . "
His legacy : " I think history , when they look back , will say this is a fellow who knew how to make decisions , and made some tough ones , stood by them , was n't driven by the latest opinion poll , but was driven by some core principles from which he would not deviate . "

What are these ?
Irony alert : Fox News accuses rival of blurring the line ‘ between news and commentary ’
This might be one of the greatest Fox News items of all time .
Last night , Karl Rove appeared on Fox News ’s “ The O’Reilly Factor ” to discuss President Bush ’s interview with NBC and accusations that the network distorted Bush ’s comments .
Rove and guest host Laura Ingraham quickly attacked NBC ’s ethics : INGRAHAM : Yes , well , Karl , this follows on , you know , on primary nights , big nights , when you ’re with Brit and everybody here .
Over at NBC , they have a couple of their , you know , commentator types Matthews and the like , sitting next to Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams .
I mean , there is no line between news and commentary .
It ’s all blurred .
Rove added that the “ journalistic standards of MSNBC , which are really no standards at all , ” are now “ creep[ing ] into NBC . ”
Now , on the substance , we ’ve already talked about how foolish the charges against NBC are .
The report did not distort Bush ’s comments , and this manufactured outrage is pretty weak tea .
But more importantly , it ’s genuinely comical to hear Fox News personalities accuse anyone of blurring the line “ between news and commentary . ”
That is , after all , the reason Fox News exists .
I mean , really .
Consider the context on this one — Laura Ingraham ( prominent Republican media personality ) was talking to Karl Rove ( prominent Republican consultant - turned - media - personality - turned - McCain - advisor ) about another network maintaining weak journalistic standards on objectivity and neutrality .
Not only were they wrong about the NBC report , but neither Ingraham nor Rove are journalists , neither are objective , neither are neutral , and neither have professional standards .
Indeed , adding to the rich irony , Rove was appearing on camera as some kind of media professional — criticizing NBC ’s integrity — while failing to disclose his ties to the Republican presidential campaign .
If you missed it , Amanda Terkel and Matt Corley , two estimable members of the ThinkProgress team , had a great piece in Salon today highlighting Rove ’s conflict - of - interest problem .
It has now been more than three months since Karl Rove first appeared on television as a Fox News political analyst on Feb 5 .
In no fewer than 57 appearances , he has increasingly been welcomed into the Fox News fraternity , even joking that the “ Hannity & Colmes ” show should be renamed the “ Colmes & Rove ” show .
After departing from a Bush administration in political tatters last August , he has reemerged to hold forth at length on the 2008 presidential race .
And he may have plenty of seasoned political wisdom to offer Fox ’s audience .
Rove , however , is playing a strategic role that he and the network refuse to reveal to viewers .
Fox News hosts routinely introduce Rove as a “ former senior advisor to President Bush , ” “ the architect , ” a “ political wizard ” and a “ famed political consultant . ”
But never has he been introduced as he should be — as an informal advisor and maxed - out donor to John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
To political news junkies , a disclosure of Rove ’s relationship to the McCain campaign may seem unnecessary .
But whether the public simply assumes that Rove supports McCain is n’t the point .
The “ most influential pundit ” in America , as Fox likes to trumpet , should have to play by the same rules as other high - profile political analysts .
For example , Paul Begala and James Carville are regularly identified as supporters of Hillary Clinton when they appear on CNN .
But Rove has been able to act as an independent observer while criticizing Clinton and Barack Obama , McCain ’s likely general election opponent .
There is nothing shocking about Rove ’s attacking Democrats , of course .
And his operating with a duplicitous air of independence probably is n’t going to make or break Fox ’s claim to “ fair and balanced ” coverage .
But will the greater public catch on ?
Amanda and Matt present a compelling case , noting Rove ’s financial support for McCain , Rove ’s work “ informally advising ” the campaign , the Rove - McCain meetings , and McCain apparently taking Rove ’s advice .
Rove has become , as Frank Rich noted , a “ thinly veiled McCain surrogate . ”
Tell us again , Fox News , about the importance of ethics , standards , and the problems associated with blurring the line between news and commentary .
If you think the coming nuclear winter will make job market tough for employees , you need to hear about the job offer my daughter got recently .
The job has :
$ 0 salary and no equity ( you ’re supposed to be compensated in experience )
and no equity ( you ’re supposed to be compensated in experience ) no benefits other than vacation and sick time : no insurance , for example
no possibility of promotion or raise , ever
no job description : just do what you ’re told
micromanaging boss asks about project status every hour
strict hours , starting at 8:30 AM sharp
if you ’re late even a few minutes , your boss sends you to her boss
rigid workweek , but then you ’re expected to work from home a ton
open - desk seating , not even a cube , with a hard chair
the work is boring and demeaning , like adding digits and copying text
all your useless work gets thrown away
if you want to use a computer , you can buy one or just scribble on paper
no supplies room , either
my daughter can’t drive , so commute was complicated
ca n’t even put the job on your resume until you work there for a decade
I wish this was a joke or I was making it up .
Having consulted with me , my daughter of course rejected this ridiculous offer and is now just working on side projects while looking for a better opportunity .
But millions of other seven - year - olds accepted identical offers .
Hollywood Stars with IRS Issues
MSNBC put together a list of the top 10 Hollywood stars who have had issues with the IRS .
On the list are : andJ - Lo 's nanny , Marc Anthony was hit up in 2007 and had to pay back $ 2.5 million in back taxes .
Word is that he never filed his returns for 2000 - 2004 while bringing in $ 15.5 million .
Nice !
No charges were brought against the " singer " but two of his associates plead guilty to tax felonies .
Wesley Snipes accidentally forgot to file about $ 10 million from 1999 - 2004 .
Things were looking pretty serious for a while and the Blade actor could have spent as much as 16 years in prison .
Snipes ended up pretty much with a slap on the hand and received 3 misdemeanor counts for failing to file his taxes .
In 1990 country music legend Willie Nelson felt the hit when he was ordered to pay back a whooping $ 16.7 million in back taxes .
The singer ended up selling his assets and writing and records more hits to pay back the money .
First time winner of the show Survivor , Richard Hatch , cashed in his million dollars in 2000 and ooops ... forgot to pay the taxes .
Now this is my favorite because he went to the big house and is not getting released until 2009 .
Now is this a case of not having the right lawyer to fight your fraud ?
Seems odd that the guy who owed the least paid the most .
We recapped just a few of our favorites .
To see the full list check it out here .
GOODRICH -- Crystal Sirignano gave her daughter a most unselfish gift : Twin babies .
At age 52 , the Goodrich woman on Wednesday gave birth to her daughter 's babies , Domenic and Mia , at an Arizona hospital .
" I just feel so blessed and fortunate , it 's the best experience of my life , " Crystal said .
" I do n't regret one second , even the times when I did n't feel good .
None of that was as bad as watching what my daughter went through . "

Christopher Burgess , the 40 - year - old managing director of Greystone Limited , is a former Navy SEAL and adventure - sports enthusiast who has competed in endurance races around the world .
He met Blackwater founder Erik Prince while both men were in training for the Navy ’s elite Special Forces unit , and years later Prince brought him on board to found Blackwater ’s sister company , Greystone .
Burgess declined to be interviewed in person or by phone for our story but agreed to answer written questions by email under the condition that his responses be reprinted in full on Mother Jones ‘ website ; through Blackwater ’s spokeswoman , he also requested that Greystone be permitted to cross - post his answers to its website .
The question / answer transcript follows , along with several questions that we submitted to Burgess , but which he chose not to respond to .
Mother Jones :
On Greystone ’s website , the company notes , “ It is more difficult than ever for an organization to successfully protect its interest against diverse and complicated threats in today ’s grey world where the solutions to your security concerns are no longer black and white . ”
Please elaborate on why today ’s security concerns are no longer black or white and the specific types of security solutions this environment requires .
Did this contribute to the firm being named “ Greystone ? ”
Christopher Burgess : Today ’s security concerns are no longer black and white because threats are constantly changing , requiring evolving solutions to meet the needs of various environments .
Every security situation is unique and requires a tailored , culturally sensitive and well thought security package to meet the specific requirements of a customer .
No .
The company was named “ Greystone ” because it was formed as a sister company to “ Blackwater ” and the names complimented each other well .
MJ : It ’s been suggested to us that Greystone ’s triangular logo is a reference to the CIA triad , whose tenets include confidentiality , integrity , and availability .
Is this the case ?
CB : No .
The triangular logo was designed by a web designer and is intended to very generally look like a “ stone , ” or mountain .
MJ : How does Greystone differentiate itself from other companies working in the private security sector ?
What makes it unique ?
What does it offer that others do not ?
CB : Like Blackwater , Greystone has the tools to provide turn - key security solutions .
As an international provider , we try very hard to be sensitive to each unique environment and to create a solution that is appropriate .
A critical factor is understanding the desires of foreign customers and working with them , and the tools we have , to create the best solution for them .
MJ : What are the key differences between Greystone and Blackwater ?
CB : Blackwater focuses mainly on United States Government contracts , whereas Greystone focuses on foreign governments and foreign commercial business .
MJ : Why was Greystone incorporated in Barbados ?
CB : Barbados is a well known business center with established business practices and banking systems .
MJ : We understand that Greystone relies on a large number of third country nationals .
We ’ve been told that it has recruited from Chile , Colombia , El Salvador , Jordan , Turkey , Fiji , Croatia , Iraq , the Philippines , and Pakistan .
Is this an accurate picture ?
From what other countries has the company recruited security contractors ?
CB : Out of concern for operational security we would rather not specify where we have recruited from .
However , we have never recruited from some of the countries mentioned in this question .
MJ : How many contractors and employees does Greystone employ and how many of these are third country nationals ?
CB : The company employs roughly two hundred , including both employees and independent contractors .
MJ : Specifically , what ’s the process for vetting these foreign personnel ?
CB : The vetting process is specifically outlined by specific contracts , but it typically involves a criminal background check , review of military records ( if applicable ) and a requirement of having the equivalent of an honorable discharge , drug testing , physical fitness test , medical and dental examinations .
MJ : We understand that Greystone is co-located with Blackwater .
To what extent do the companies share resources and personnel ?
CB : While Greystone and Blackwater do share some physical facilities , we are a separate company with our own autonomous administrative and operational systems and staff .
If a potential customer calls us with a need we see as better suited for Blackwater , we refer that potential customer to Blackwater .
Blackwater does the same for us .
MJ : Given the range of services described on Greystone ’s website , what specific types of work has Greystone actually undertaken ?
CB : Static security , K - 9 , assessments , aviation maintenance and management , and training .
MJ : Beyond Iraq , in what countries has Greystone operated for governments , private entities , or both ?
CB : Greystone has worked in various Middle Eastern countries .
We do not divulge the specific locations due to operational security concerns and the desires of our customers .
MJ : We understand that Greystone often works on subcontract for Blackwater .
Is it the prime contractor on any U.S. government contracts ?
Is it the prime contractor for contracts issued by other governments or private entities ?
CB : No and yes , respectively .
MJ : Has Greystone ever been contracted by anyone other than the U.S. government ?
If so , can you provide examples of who , in general terms , the contracting party was and what type of services Greystone provided ?
CB : Yes .
Greystone has been contracted by foreign governments and private sector clients to provide static security , K - 9 support , assessments , aviation maintenance and management , and training .
Because we have US citizens working for the company and because the company is American - owned , we seek State Department licensure for all security services overseas , as well as complying with other federal trade controls and restrictions , such as ATF rules , Commerce export requirements or OFAC regulations .
MJ : Greystone has registered as a UN vendor .
Has it secured any UN contracts and , if so , what services was it contracted to supply ?
If not , what role does Greystone hope to play in the peacekeeping and humanitarian sector ?
CB : No . Greystone hopes it can bring to the UN superior training , human resources and logistic support .
MJ : We understand that Mr. Burgess is a former Navy SEAL .
Did he serve with Erik Prince , and what was his other professional experience before becoming Greystone ’s managing director ?
CB : Mr. Prince and I met while in training for the SEALs but never served on a team together .
I worked in corporate America and then went to business school before coming to Greystone .
MJ : Jose Miguel Pizarro , whose company recruited for Blackwater in Chile , says that at some point his Blackwater contracts were shifted over to Greystone .
If true , what was the reason for this ?
Does Greystone handle all of Blackwater ’s TCN contracts ?
CB : Blackwater made the decision to concentrate on providing US Personnel to US Government contracts .
MJ : Pizarro says that he stopped working for Greystone / Blackwater in 2006 because his recruits had become too expensive as private security firms began to find lower paid recruits in other Latin American countries .
Is this an accurate description of what transpired with Pizarro ?
If not , why ?
CB : No , that is not correct .
Greystone has always paid personnel according to market demands .
Greystone ended that relationship over business differences .
MJ : Greystone attempted to lease land in the Philippines through a company called Satelles Solutions .
What was Greystone ’s business relationship with Satelles ?
And why specifically did it seek to lease this property ?
CB : Greystone started to create an entity , Satelles Solutions , to lease land in the Philippines to be used as a training facility , but the concept was terminated before it got past the planning stage .
The following questions went unanswered :
Blackwater has referred to Greystone as its “ international affiliate . ”
What does this mean in practice ?
We understand that Greystone representatives traveled to El Salvador in 2005 to review potential contractors recruited by Central America Professional Services ( CAPROS ) .
What was / is Greystone ’s relationship with CAPROS ?
We understand that Greystone provided funds to the company .
What was the reason for this ?
Did Greystone ever deploy any contractors recruited by CAPROS ?
Does Greystone have similar relationships with other Latin American recruiting firms , for example a Colombian company called ID Systems ?
Has Greystone taken part in training Iraqi military or intelligence officers ?
If so , what type of training was provided ?

News :
Rep. Rick Renzi , R - Ariz. , allegedly defrauded dozens of pro-life organizations for hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund his first congressional bid , according to an analysis of the recent indictment against him , a state insurance claim and an interview with an insurance lawyer involved in the case .
When federal prosecutors indicted Renzi , 49 , on 35 felony counts two weeks ago , many reports focused on alleged crimes stemming from a complicated series of land swaps the congressman facilitated .
Organizations such as Arizona Right - to - Life , the Hope Crisis Pregnancy Center and the Wickenburg Pregnancy Resource Center paid insurance premiums to Renzi 's insurance firm , Renzi & Company , but received notices their insurance coverage was going to be cancelled for nonpayment , according to a 2003 complaint filed with the State of Arizona .
The complaint was first reported by the Phoenix New Times .
Read on ...
It 's not clear if Renzi has stepped down from his position in John McCain 's campaign , but if the Senator has n't asked him to go away by now , this news should seal the deal .
St. McSame is having enough difficulty holding on to the hard right wing of the party as it is , and for word to spread that someone this close to his campaign is suspected of ripping off their bread and butter groups , it will NOT sit well with the elders .
The Associated Press has promised to meet with some organization I 've never heard of called " The Media Bloggers Association " to work out the details of its frankly insane proposal to sell licenses to quote five or more words from AP stories .
Who are the Media Bloggers Association ?
Turns out it 's mostly one guy , some right - wing attack - blogger who hangs around on the lecture circuit and ran a blog devoted to pissing on Keith Olbermann .
Our Teresa Nielsen Hayden 's blogged an extensive analysis of the Media Bloggers Association and its total irrelevance to blogging and its total unsuitability to representing " blogging " in some kind of negotiation with the AP .
The Media Bloggers Association substantially consists of one lackluster blogger named Robert Cox .
His weblog , Words in Edgewise , and the MBA website , are two halves of the same site .
Robert Cox is n't all that interested in blogging per se .
What he 's really into is self - aggrandizement by representing himself as someone who speaks for bloggers and blogging .
An embarrassing number of organizations have fallen for this .
Link
Update : Regarding today 's post on the Media Bloggers Association , whom the AP and New York Times said would " represent bloggers " in negotiations over whether the AP would be able to charge $ 12.50 for quoting five words from a news story ( and only if you promised not to criticize the AP ! ) ,
Mary sez , " AP ( and the NYTimes ) misrepresented that the MBA is representing bloggers
to negotiate a policy about use of AP story quotes .
I do n't know Robert Cox , and was n't familiar with the MBA , but some of the founding members
include Jeff Jarvis , Jay Rosen , O Willis , Rebecca MacKinnon and Micah Sifry .
Jay , Liza and others are saying that when the MBA represents bloggers in trouble with
the FBI , over C&Ds and with other issues , they 've been helpful . "
The NYT ( in implying ) and AP in it 's headline and throughout the article outright , completely misunderstand this , and lead readers to misunderstand that there is even an institution that can " negotiate for the blogosphere . "
The blogophere is made up of millions of little spheres of conversation and influence , and those are made up of tens of millions of bloggers .
It 's utterly ridiculous and shows a complete lack of understanding of the blogosphere to believe there is some sort of institution on the other side of traditional media .
The whole point of blogging is that people do what they want , that online publishing is completely atomized , and that if some sort of policy were to be negotiated with one small group , no one else would likely follow it * because Fair Use exists * and I would personally rather follow the constitution on this one .
I think it 's time for a correction / restatement / clarification at NYT and a complete retraction at AP .

( Thanks , Mary ! )
The St. Paul Saints , long known for offbeat , sometimes edgy , promotions , have come up with a real doozy for this Sunday 's game .
While lots of sports franchises hand out bobblehead dolls , usually depicting their players , the Saints are handing out 2,500 " bobblefoot " knicknacks .
The keepsakes consist of a miniature bathroom stall with a couple of lower legs and feet .
One of the feet is springloaded and " taps , " which , the Saints ' press release says , is in honor of National Tap Dance Day .
Right .
The team also takes pains to note : " It does n't matter if your tapping style is done with a ' wide stance ' or is used as some sort of code . "
That 's a none - too - subtle reference to Idaho Republican Sen .
Larry Craig , who pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct after an undercover police officer arrested him for allegedly soliciting sex in a bathroom stall at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
The undercover officer who arrested Craig said the senator 's foot - tapping , bumping feet and swiping his hand under the bathroom stall amounted to well - known code used in soliciting sex .
Craig , however , said his foot - tapping was the result of the fact that he has " a wide stance . "
The first Pilgrims to reach America seeking religious freedom were English and settled in Massachusetts .
Right ?
Well , not so fast .
Some fifty years before the Mayflower left port , a band of French colonists came to the New World .
Like the later English Pilgrims , these Protestants were victims of religious wars , raging across France and much of Europe .
And like those later Pilgrims , they too wanted religious freedom and the chance for a new life .
But they also wanted to attack Spanish treasure ships sailing back from the Americas .
Their story is at the heart of the following excerpt from America 's Hidden History : Untold Tales of the First Pilgrims , Fighting Women , and Forgotten Founders Who Shaped a Nation .
It is a story of America 's birth and baptism in a religious bloodbath .
A few miles south of St. Augustine sits Fort Mantanzas ( the word is Spanish for " slaughters " ) .
Now a national monument , the place reveals the " hidden history " behind America 's true " first pilgrims , " an episode that speaks volumes about the European arrival in the Americas and the most untidy religious struggles that shaped the nation .
St. Augustine , Florida — September 1565
It was a storm - dark night in late summer as Admiral Pedro Menéndez pressed his army of 500 infantrymen up Florida 's Atlantic Coast with a Crusader 's fervor .
Lashed by hurricane winds and sheets of driving rain , these 16th - century Spanish shock troops slogged through the tropical downpour in their heavy armor , carrying pikes , broadswords and the " harquebus , " a primitive , front - loading musket which had been used with devastating effect by the conquistador armies of Cortés and Pizarro in Mexico and Peru .
Each man also carried a twelve - pound sack of bread and a bottle of wine .
Guided by friendly Timucuan tribesmen , the Spanish assault force had spent two difficult days negotiating the treacherous 38 - mile trek from St. Augustine , their recently established settlement further down the coast .
Slowed by knee - deep muck that sucked at their boots , they had been forced to cross rain - swollen rivers , home to the man-eating monsters and flying fish of legend .
Wet , tired and miserable , they were far from home in a land that had completely swallowed two previous Spanish armies — conquistadors who themselves had been conquered by tropical diseases , starvation and hostile native warriors .
But Admiral Menéndez was undeterred .
Far more at home on sea than leading infantry , Admiral Menéndez drove his men with such ferocity because he was gambling — throwing the dice that he could reach the enemy before they struck him .
His objective was the French settlement of Fort Caroline , France 's first foothold in the Americas , located near present - day Jacksonville , on what the French called the River of May .
On this pitch - black night , the small , triangular , wood - palisaded fort was occupied by a few hundred men , women and children .
They were France 's first colonists in the New World — and the true first " Pilgrims " in America .
Attacking before dawn on September 20 , 1565 with the frenzy of holy warriors , the Spanish easily overwhelmed Fort Caroline .
With information provided by a French turncoat , the battle - tested Spanish soldiers used ladders to quickly mount the fort 's wooden walls .
Inside the settlement , the sleeping Frenchmen — most of them farmers or laborers rather than soldiers — were caught off - guard , convinced that no attack could possibly come in the midst of such a terrible storm .
But they had fatally miscalculated .
The veteran Spanish harquebusiers swept in on the nightshirted and naked Frenchmen who leapt from their beds and grabbed futilely for weapons .
Their attempts to mount any real defense were hopeless .
The battle lasted less than an hour .
Although some of the French defenders managed to escape the carnage , 132 soldiers and civilians were killed in the fighting in the small fort .
The Spanish suffered no losses and only a single man was wounded .
The forty or so French survivors fortunate enough to reach the safety of some boats anchored nearby , watched helplessly as Spanish soldiers flicked the eyeballs of the French dead with the points of their daggers .
The shaken survivors then scuttled one of their boats and sailed the other two back to France .
The handful of Fort Caroline 's defenders who were not lucky enough to escape were quickly rounded up by the Spanish .
About fifty women and children were also taken captive , later to be shipped to Puerto Rico .
The men were hung without hesitation .
Above the dead men , the victorious Admiral Menéndez placed a sign reading , " I do this , not as to Frenchmen , but as to Lutherans . "
Renaming the captured French settlement San Mateo ( St. Matthew ) and its river San Juan ( St. John's ) , Menéndez later reported to Spain 's King Philip II that he had taken care of the " evil Lutheran sect . "
Victims of the political and religious wars raging across Europe , the ill - fated inhabitants of Fort Caroline were not " Lutherans " at all .
For the most part , they were Huguenots , French Protestants who followed the teachings of John Calvin , the French - born Protestant theologian .
Having built and settled Fort Caroline more than a year earlier , these French colonists had been left all but defenseless by the questionable decision of one of their leaders , Jean Ribault .
An experienced sea captain , Ribault had sailed off from Fort Caroline a few days earlier with between five and six hundred men aboard his flagship , the Trinité , and three other galleons .
Against the advice of René de Laudonniére , his fellow commander at Fort Caroline , Ribault planned to strike the new Spanish settlement before the recently arrived Spanish could establish their defenses .
Unfortunately for Ribault and his shipmates , as well as those left behind at Fort Caroline , the hurricane that slowed Admiral Menéndez and his army also ripped into the small French flotilla , scattering and grounding most of the ships , sending hundreds of men to their deaths .
According to René de Laudonniére , it was , " the worst weather ever seen on this coast . "
Unaware that Fort Caroline had fallen , groups of French survivors of the storm - savaged fleet came ashore near present - day Daytona Beach and Cape Canaveral .
Trudging north , they were spotted by Indians who alerted Menéndez .
The bedraggled Frenchmen were met and captured by Spanish troops at a coastal inlet about 17 miles south of St. Augustine on September 29 , 1565 .
Expecting to be imprisoned or perhaps ransomed , the exhausted and hungry Frenchmen surrendered without a fight .
They were ferried across the inlet to a group of dunes where they were fed what proved to be a last meal .
At the Admiral 's orders , between 111 and 200 of the French captives — documents differ on the exact number — were put to death .
In his own report to King Philip , Admiral Menéndez wrote matter - of - factly , if not proudly , " I caused their hands to be tied behind them , and put them to the knife . "
Sixteen of the company were allowed to live — self - professed Catholics who were spared at the behest of the priest , who reported , " All the rest died for being Lutherans and against our Holy Catholic Faith . "
Twelve days later , on October 11 , the remaining French survivors , including Captain Jean Ribault , whose Trinité had been beached further south , straggled north to the same inlet .
Met by Menéndez and ignorant of their countrymen 's fates , they too surrendered to the Spanish .
A handful escaped in the night , but on the next morning , 134 more French captives were ferried across the same inlet and executed ; once again , approximately a dozen were spared .
Those who escaped death had either professed to be Catholic , hastily agreed to convert or possessed some skills that Admiral Menéndez thought might be useful in settling St. Augustine — the first permanent European settlement in the future United States , born and baptized in a religious bloodbath .
Although Jean Ribault offered Menéndez a large ransom to secure his safe return to France , the Spanish Admiral refused .
Ribault suffered the same fate as his men .
Following Ribault 's execution , the French leader 's beard and a piece of his skin were sent to King Philip II .
His head was cut into four parts , set on pikes and displayed in St. Augustine .
Reporting back to King Philip II , Admiral Menéndez wrote , " I think it great good fortune that this man be dead , for the King of France could accomplish more with him and fifty thousand ducats than with other men and five hundred thousand ducats ; and he could do more in one year , than another in ten . . . . "
Just south of modern St. Augustine , hidden off the well - worn tourist path of t- shirt stands , sprawling condos and beach - front hotels , stands a rather inconspicuous National Monument called Fort Matanzas .
Accessible by a short ferry ride across a small river , it was built by the Spanish in 1742 to protect St. Augustine from surprise attack .
Fort Matanzas is more a large guardhouse than full - fledged fort .
The modest structure , about fifty feet long on each side , was constructed of coquina , a local stone formed from clam shells and quarried from a nearby island .
Tourists who come across the simple tower certainly find it far less impressive than the formidable Castillo de San Marco , the star - shaped citadel that dominates St. Augustine 's historic downtown .
Unlike other Spanish sites in Florida named for Catholic saints or holy days , the fort 's name comes from the Spanish word , matanzas , for " killings " or " slaughters . "
Fort Matanzas stands near the site of the grim massacre of the few hundred luckless French soldiers in an undeclared war of religious animosity .
This largely unremarked atrocity from America 's distant past was one small piece of the much larger struggle for the future of North America among contending European powers .
The notion of Spaniards fighting Frenchmen in Florida four decades before England established its first permanent settlement in America , and half a century before the Pilgrims sailed , is an unexpected notion to those accustomed to the familiar legends of Jamestown and Plymouth .
The fact that these first settlers were Huguenots dispatched to establish a colony in America in 1564 , and motivated by the same sort of religious persecution that later drove the Pilgrims from England , may be equally surprising .
That the mass execution of hundreds of French Protestants by Spanish Catholics could be mostly overlooked may be more surprising still .
But this salient story speaks volumes about the rapacious quest for new territory and brutal religious warfare that characterized the European arrival in the future America .

ENCINO , Calif. , July 11 —
In an unusually blunt session here today , several of Hollywood ’s highest - ranking executives called for the end of the entertainment industry ’s decades - old system of paying what are called residuals to writers , actors and directors for the re-use of movie and television programs after their initial showings .
The executives stopped short of saying they would demand an immediate end to residual payments in the upcoming , probably difficult negotiations with writers , actors and directors .
But they were emphatic in calling for the dismantling of a system under which specific payments are made when movies and shows are released on DVD , shown abroad or otherwise resold .
Instead , they want to pool such revenue and recover their costs before sharing any of the profit with the talent .
“ There are no ancillary markets any more ; it ’s all one market , ” said Barry Meyer , chief executive of Warner Brothers .
“ This is the time to do it . ”
The briefing at the headquarters of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , an industry bargaining group , was conducted by Mr. Meyer , Leslie Moonves , chief executive of CBS , and Anne Sweeney , president of the Walt Disney - ABC Television Group , along with the alliance ’s president , J. Nicholas Counter .
It was intended to set the stage for Monday ’s opening of contract talks with the Writers Guild of America unions on both coasts .
PARIS ( AP ) 
Divers trained in archaeology discovered a marble bust of an aging Caesar in the Rhone River that France 's Culture Ministry said Tuesday could be the oldest known .
The life - sized bust showing the Roman ruler with wrinkles and hollows in his face is tentatively dated to 46 B.C. Divers uncovered the Caesar bust and a collection of other finds in the Rhone near the town of Arles — founded by Caesar .
Among other items in the treasure trove of ancient objects is a 5.9 foot marble statue of Neptune , dated to the first decade of the third century after Christ .
Two smaller statues , both in bronze and measuring 27.5 inches each also were found , one of them , a satyr with his hands tied behind his back , " doubtless " originated in Hellenic Greece , the ministry said .
" Some ( of the discoveries ) are unique in Europe , " Culture Minister Christine Albanel said .
The bust of Caesar is in a class by itself .
" This marble bust of the founder of the Roman city of Arles constitutes the most ancient representation known today of Caesar , " the ministry statement said , adding that it " undoubtedly " dates to the creation of Arles in 46 B.C.
Among other things , researchers are trying to uncover " in what context these statues were thrown into the river , " said Michel L'Hour , who heads the Department of Subaquatic Archaeological Research , whose divers made the discovery between September and October 2007 .
The site " has barely been skimmed , " L'Hour told The Associated Press , adding that a new search operation will begin this summer .
He said the Arles region , in the Provence region of southern France , with its Roman beginnings , and the Rhone are " propitious " for discoveries .
Albanel called the find " exceptional " and said that the Caesar bust is " the oldest representation known today " of the emperor .

Are US Republicans Sane ?
One has to wonder when listening to George Bush , Mike Huckabee and John McCain , how did these “ men ” get the positions they have when they are so obviously not in possession of their full mental faculties .
Indeed , both Bush and McCain behave like sociopaths .
There will be more on John McCain at a later date , but for now … .
Are US Republicans Sane ?
Let ’s start with the recent words of George Bush .
Never mind his immoral , genocidal , illegal and disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In a speech to Israel 's Knesset , Bush said : " Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , ” Bush went on further to say , ” We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ‘ Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . ’
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ”
A strong case could most certainly be made that George Bush is skating on very thin ice to be making references to Nazis or Hitler , given his family connections to Nazi leadership and his disgusting fascist behavior .
In other words , it is certain that George Bush , aside from being known as the worst president his country ever had will also be known as one of those evil , totalitarian dictators and Hitlers that fill all decent human beings with disgust and revulsion .
Mr. Bush , YOU are a terrorist !
Mr. Bush , YOU are a Hitler !
Mr. Bush , you are a fundamentalist radical !
Most commentators have seen through Bush ’s inane ramblings ( of which there certainly has been no shortage in the past ) for what they are : an attack on Senator Barack Obama who has said that he would meet with “ enemy ” leaders .
In response to George Bush , Senator Obama said through a statement his aides distributed :
" It is sad that President Bush would use a speech to the Knesset on the 60th anniversary of Israel 's independence to launch a false political attack .
George Bush knows that I have never supported engagement with terrorists , and the president 's extraordinary politicization of foreign policy and the politics of fear do nothing to secure the American people or our stalwart ally Israel . "
Dana Perino , the White House spokeswoman , said Bush 's comment was n't a reference to Obama .
Joe Biden , Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said that the president was out of line : “ This is bullshit , this is malarkey .
This is outrageous , for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country , to sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement . ”
“ He is the guy who has weakened us , ” he said .
“ He has increased the number of terrorists in the world .
It is his policies that have produced this vulnerability that the US has .
It ’s his intelligence community that has pointed this out , not me . ”
Even Hillary Clinton refused to take part in the insanity .
“ President Bush ’s comparison of any Democrat to Nazi appeasers is offensive and outrageous on the face of it , especially in light of his failures in foreign policy , ” Clinton said .
“ This is the kind of statement that has no place in any presidential address . ”
When a reporter reminded the New York senator that she too has criticized Senator Obama for his statements on meeting with Iranian leaders , Clinton said , “ I have differences with Senator Obama on certain foreign policy matters , but I think we are united in our opposition to the Bush policies and to the continuation of those policies by Senator .
McCain . ”
Clinton continued , “ I disagree that any president would ever meet with a leader of a country which we have such deep and profound differences as Iran , for example .
However I believe there should be diplomatic engagement , which President Bush has resisted from the very beginning .
So I think that I have more in common with Senator Obama and the Democratic position in our understanding of what we have to do to re-engage with the world . ”
Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the House , said Bush ’s remark was “ beneath the dignity of the office . ”
Now for the lunatic fringe …
John McCain , the presumptive presidential nominee for the Republican Party , stood with his mentor : “ The president is exactly right , ” said McCain , about his assertion that opening up talks with modern day terrorists was the same as appeasing Hitler and the Nazis . ”
" It is a serious error on the part of Senator Obama .
It shows naiveté and inexperience and lack of judgment to say that he wants to sit down across the table from an individual who leads a country that says that Israel is a ' stinking corpse ' that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel .
My question is , what does he want to talk about ? "
Both Bush and McCain frequently attack Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for threatening Israel and believe he must be stopped from developing a nuclear weapon , a goal Iran denies .
Joe Lieberman , the Democrat - turned - Independent senator who supports McCain ( some suggest he might be McCain ’s running mate ) , defended Bush as well .
“ President Bush got it exactly right today when he warned about the threat of Iran and its terrorist proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah .
It is imperative that we reject the flawed and naïve thinking that denies or dismisses the words of extremists and terrorists when they shout “ Death to America ” and “ Death to Israel , ” and that holds that — if only we were to sit down and negotiate with these killers — they would cease to threaten us .
It is critical to our national security that our commander - in - chief is able to distinguish between America ’s friends and America ’s enemies , and not confuse the two . ”
Mike Huckabee , who is also backing McCain after his unsuccessful presidential bid , also had a psychotic moment in Louisville , Kentucky , in front of the National Rifle Association .
An unexpected offstage noise prompted him to make the statement : “ That was Barack Obama , he just tripped off a chair , he 's getting ready to speak , ” said the former Arkansas governor , to audience laughter .
“ Somebody aimed a gun at him and he dove for the floor . ”
Meanwhile , John McCain made a speech where he sounded absolutely detached from reality and delusional .
He painted a scenario of what would be during his hopefully mythical presidency .
“ US troops would be home from Iraq by 2013 after the war would be won under his watch .
Osama bin Laden would be captured or killed , and that the threat from the Taliban in Afghanistan would be greatly reduced under his stewardship . ” .
" By January 2013 , America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom .
The Iraq War has been won .
Iraq is a functioning democracy , although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension . "
What happened to his 100 years ?
It must have been shown to be unpalatable to voters ,
It ’s pretty well known that politicians lie , but this guy really believes this stuff .
The world , as well as the US , is in deep trouble should John McCain win the election .
All will breathe a deep sigh of relief when the regime of George Bush and his reign of terror comes to an end next January , barring any unforeseen circumstances .

It will soon be 200 years since the birth of Charles Darwin and 150 years since the publication of On the Origin of Species , arguably the most important book ever written .
In it , Darwin outlined an idea that many still find shocking – that all life on Earth , including human life , evolved through natural selection .
Darwin presented compelling evidence for evolution in On the Origin and , since his time , the case has become overwhelming .
Countless fossil discoveries allow us to trace the evolution of today ’s organisms from earlier forms .
DNA sequencing has confirmed beyond any doubt that all living creatures share a common origin .
Innumerable examples of evolution in action can be seen all around us , from the pollution - matching peppered moth to fast - changing viruses such as HIV and H5N1 bird flu .
Evolution is as firmly established a scientific fact as the roundness of the Earth .
And yet despite an ever - growing mountain of evidence , most people around the world are not taught the truth about evolution , if they are taught about it at all .
Even in the UK , the birthplace of Darwin with an educated and increasingly secular population , one recent poll suggests less than half the population accepts evolution .
Advertisement
For those who have never had the opportunity to find out about biology or science , claims made by those who believe in supernatural alternatives to evolutionary theory can appear convincing .
Meanwhile , even among those who accept evolution , misconceptions abound .
Most of us are happy to admit that we do not understand , say , string theory in physics , yet we are all convinced we understand evolution .
In fact , as biologists are discovering , its consequences can be stranger than we ever imagined .
Evolution must be the best - known yet worst - understood of all scientific theories .
So here is New Scientist ’s guide to some of the most common myths and misconceptions about evolution .
There are already several good and comprehensive guides out there .
But there ca n’t be too many .
Shared misconceptions :
Everything is an adaptation produced by natural selection
Natural selection is the only means of evolution
Natural selection leads to ever - greater complexity
Evolution produces creatures perfectly adapted to their environment
Evolution always promotes the survival of species
It does n’t matter if people do not understand evolution
“ Survival of the fittest ” justifies “ everyone for themselves ”
Evolution is limitlessly creative
Evolution cannot explain traits such as homosexuality
Creationism provides a coherent alternative to evolution
Creationist myths :
Evolution must be wrong because the Bible is inerrant
Accepting evolution undermines morality
Evolutionary theory leads to racism and genocide
Religion and evolution are incompatible
Half a wing is no use to anyone
Evolutionary science is not predictive
Evolution cannot be disproved so is not science
Evolution is just so unlikely to produce complex life forms
Evolution is an entirely random process
Mutations can only destroy information , not create it
Darwin is the ultimate authority on evolution
The bacterial flagellum is irreducibly complex
Yet more creationist misconceptions
Evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics
Mobile phone tracking technology is being put to good use watching how punters migrate around a shopping centre , thanks to gear from Portsmouth - based Path Technologies .
By installing receivers around a shopping centre the company can pick up communication between handsets and base stations , enabling them to track shoppers to within a metre or two - enough to spot the order in which shops are visited .
Two UK shopping centres are already using the tech , with three more deploying in the next few months .
This information is used to work out if shoppers are dropping in to visit one particular store , or doing the rounds of 15 different shoe shops before going back to buy the first pair seen .
Retailers will pay good money for this kind of data , but while existing solutions are based on counting heads or asking questions of a selected few , watching where the phones go is far more useful .
Most of the GSM connection is encrypted , so there 's little chance of an individual customer being identified .
Even the IMSI ( International Mobile Subscriber Identity – the user 's phone number ) is n't normally sent over the air ; the network issues a TMSI ( Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity ) which is only valid until the next authentication .
A TMSI is like a dynamic IP address , so punters can be tracked as they move around the centre .
But if you want to drop off the radar , you can just reset your phone - you 'll get a different TMSI to confuse the software with .
Path Intelligence is very keen to distance itself from those privacy - invading companies that track your online existence then claim it 's all anonymised .
Path will track your real existence , but point out they can't establish who you really are or follow your phone after a reset even if they wanted to .
The company does point out how broadly the concept can be applied .
Once one assumes that each person is carrying one mobile phone ( a statistically realistic assumption in Europe ) , then you can track everything from cars driving around a city to how far people will walk across a stadium to get a hotdog .
Trade shows are an obvious application .
Knowing how long a visitor spends at each stand is very valuable .
The company recently did trials at O'Reilly 's Web 2.0 conference where the popularity of iPhones meant there was enough GSM technology to gather some useful statistics .
For the moment Path Intelligence only does 2G GSM , though supporting CDMA would n't be too difficult .
3G GSM is slightly more secure but still uses a TMSI , so those on a 3G network are unlikely to remain untracked for long .
Whether punters will be happy about being tracked anonymously remains to be seen .
Path Intelligence points out that it has less information than the network operators , but you might trust your network operator more than the company running the local shopping centre .
And while the tracking is anonymous , it would n't take a genius to match a tracked phone to a CCTV recording and fill in the gaps for one visit at least . ®

CBD oil has become a popular alternative treatment from certain ailments and illnesses in the body .
It does this by interacting with receptors in your brain and mostly helps keep the body in homeostasis .
It has a lot of health benefits and little to no side - effects compared to other drugs that can have a high chance of damaging the body .
Here we ’ll talk about CBD oil for anxiety and what benefits CBD oil gives to brain health to make you more informed about it .
What is CBD ?
Cannabidiol or CBD is a chemical compound that ’s naturally found in cannabis .
Unlike its counterpart THC , it does not contain any psychoactive properties which give you that “ high ” when ingesting it making it quite safe to use .
It also has a lot of health benefits throughout the body which is why it ’s become a new trend for people who are into health and wellness .
How CBD Affects the Body
The way CBD is able to affect the body is by interacting with the endocannabinoid system , the one responsible for keeping the body ’s internal function in smooth condition .
It ’s able to affect certain receptors in the brain which affects the central nervous system and other receptors that deal with pain and inflammation .
Treating Alzheimer ’s with CBD
CBD has been used to research certain brain diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , which is caused by inflammation and oxygen build - up in the brain .
The way CBD help this is by reducing the oxygen build - up int the brain as CBD is known to have antioxidant properties .
It also helps cell brain growth and development which slows down the decline of memory and brain functions .
Alleviating Depression and Anxiety
Depression and Anxiety can also be alleviated through CBD .
It does this by interacting with the serotonin receptor of the brain which is known to be responsible for various mental disorders .
When the receptors release low amounts of serotonin , it will cause the person to have anxiety , even depression if there ’s little to no release .
CBD helps normalize the amount of serotonin released in the body putting it in a stable condition .
Helping People With Sleeping Disorders
The drug can also be used to help people who have sleeping disorders like insomnia .
It ’s able to minimize factors that can make them unable to sleep like stress and anxiety .
It can even let them go from REM sleep to a deeper , much more restful , NREM sleep .
CBD ’s Effects on Parkinson ’s Disease
Parkinson ’s disease is a neurological disorder that occurs when the dopamine receptors in the brain are damaged or even completely die off .
It can lead to the decline of some cognitive functions such as memory and attention span .
Research has shown that CBD is able to treat symptoms of Parkinson ’s Disease such as pain , uncontrollable muscle movements , and psychosis .
Conclusion
CBD oil has only been a new product in the market and further research is still needed to understand more about it .
There can still be a possibility that it can help more physiological ailments .
