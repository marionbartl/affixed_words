The resolution called for sanctions on Mugabe and 13 other officials A draft resolution to impose sanctions on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and a number of his key allies has been vetoed at the UN Security Council .
China and Russia rejected the proposed measures , which included a freeze on financial assets and a travel ban .
There has been growing international criticism of Zimbabwe since the re-election of Mr Mugabe in a run-off boycotted by the opposition .
The UK foreign secretary called China and Russia 's stance " incomprehensible " .
David Miliband said Russia used its veto despite a promise by President Dmitry Medvedev to support the resolution , when it was discussed at this week 's summit of the G - 8 group of industrialised nations .

The US ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , said Russia 's veto raised " questions about its reliability as a G8 partner " .
A BBC correspondent at the UN says the failure of the resolution is a major blow for the United States and Britain .
The UK ambassador said after the vote that the UN had failed in its duty .
" The people of Zimbabwe need to be given hope that there is an end in sight to their suffering , " said Sir John Sawers .
" The Security Council today has failed to offer them that hope . "
However , Russia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said sanctions would have taken the UN beyond its mandate because Zimbabwe did not threaten international stability .
Zimbabwe 's ambassador told the BBC the vote showed that " reason has prevailed " .
" People have been able to see the machinations of Washington , London and France , " said Boniface Chidyausiku .
South Africa voted against the sanctions resolution .
It has promoted a power - sharing arrangement between President Mugabe and the opposition .

Mugabe survives despite pressure
It also called for a UN special envoy for Zimbabwe to be appointed .
The resolution had the support of nine council members , the minimum required to pass in the 15 - member council .
But the veto of any of the five permanent members is enough to defeat a resolution , and both China and Russia voted against .
Zimbabwe has become a matter of increasing international concern , as violence increased after disputed presidential elections .
The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , Morgan Tsvangirai , won the first round of Zimbabwe 's presidential elections on 29 March , but official results gave him less than the 50 % share needed to avoid a run-off .
He pulled out of the run -off poll after many of his supporters were targeted , assaulted and even killed , leaving Mr Mugabe to win unopposed in the second round at the end of June .
Since March , the opposition says 113 of its supporters have been killed , some 5,000 are missing and more than 200,000 have been forced from their homes .

Daimler Announces Electric Smart for 2010
image : Mr. Thomas
A few months ago Daimler reported that they were testing 100 electric versions of its Smart car in London , and that if all went well they would work on putting the car into production for the general population to buy .
Well , now Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche has said that all did go well .
This means that the company will release its EV Smart in 2010 , the same year the Chevy Volt is scheduled to come out .
Personally , I find it funny that Daimler can go from no electric car to a firm release date so easily and with so little fanfare , while the blogosphere seems poised to trip over every word that comes out of Bob Lutz ’s mouth about the not - even - EV Chevy Volt .
But , that ’s really a story for another post .
No price has yet been released for the EV to be .
Because the Smart is known not only as a fuel efficient car , but a cheap car , Daimler is deciding whether it wants to sell the batteries with the car or lease them .
Leasing has the advantage of a lower up - front cost , but will also mean continued cost of ownership .
Also , no mention was made of whether or not the Smart EV would be released in the US .
Seeing as how the car just made the jump across the pond , it ’s likely that the first incarnation will be a Europe - only affair .

I understand that by submitting my information , I may be contacted by telephone by one lender .
Who Are Online Loans Same Day For ?
Short term loans came about because it was observed that people with a poor credit record were unable to borrow money .
So , lenders formed to help out those specific people and they did not judge them on their credit score but just allowed them to borrow small amounts of money so that they could get what they needed .
They also made sure that the money was available quickly .
They wanted to make sure that it was also available quickly as they realised that often money is needed quickly for an emergency .
Therefore , some of the lenders are able to produce money within hours .
Therefore , the accounts tend to be for two main types of borrowers – those that have a poor credit rating and those that need money quickly .
However , it is always good practice to compare all loan types when you are deciding what loan to take out .
We all have different needs at different times and so we never know what type of loan we might need in the future .
Being aware of all of our options can be extremely useful .
It is also worth understanding that online loans do vary .
Some need to repaid very quickly and others in instalments .
Some offer more money than others and the prices vary as well .
They will take different amounts of time to arrange too .
Although some can get you money in a few hours , others will be longer .
Some may also be able to get you money outside of business hours and others will not .
This means that if you do decide that this type of loan is for you , you will need to compare the different lenders to see which looks to be the most suitable for you .
Where Do I Find Online Loans Same Day ?
If you have never used this sort of loan before you may wonder where you can find them .
There are different ways online that you can find them .
Below are a few suggestions of places that you might be able to either find them or find out more about them .
Search Engine
If you search for ‘ online loans same day ’ then you will find that you will get search results listing different companies such as Adherents that offer these types of loans .
You will be able to go to their website and investigate what they are offering .
However , this could get rather tedious as you will start to notice that there are pages and pages of lenders .
It is important to compare lenders so that you make sure that you are getting the best value for money from the one that you choose but there will be a lot to go through and if you are in a hurry you might be tempted to just pick the first you come across .
Try not to do this as you may end up paying a lot more than necessary and picking a loan which does not really suit your needs .
Comparison Website
Comparison websites are available for all sorts of things these days .
They can be a very quick and easy way to compare different lenders .
They will usually compare the interest rates and then list them in order with the lowest rates at the top .
This is a great indication of rates but it will not necessarily tell you which is cheapest .
This is because many payday loans direct will have fixed fees as well , perhaps admin fees or things like this .
Unless you add that in to the cost you will not know which loan is the cheapest .
You will also find the actual cost of the loan in dollars will depend on how long you have it for as it will attract interest until it is repaid .
So , if you compare a loan that is repaid over a few months with one that is repaid in a few weeks , then the interest rate tells you very little .
You need to actually calculate the real cost .
However , the sites can be useful for highlighting the lenders that are available all in one place and you will be able to check them out .
Rating Website
There are websites which with rate or rank lenders .
They will take a selection and put them in order of good to bad .
These can be useful as a way of identifying which lenders are available but it is wise not to use it alone .
This is because you have no idea what they are using as a basis for their rating or ranking and whether you feel that those things are important to you .
So , it is worth looking at a selection of these sites so that you can get an idea of what lenders are available to you but it is wise to make sure that you do your own research .
Review Website
You will find that there are also websites which review lenders .
These can be more useful because you will be able to find out a bit more about the lenders and what they can offer .
This can save you some work in looking for this information for yourself .
However , you need to think about whether you agree with them or not .
They might think certain features are good , for example , but you may not think they are important .
You also need to be aware that many online sites will gain commission on leads they generate .
You will see that they will have links to the lenders websites when they mention them .
These are affiliate links and are tracked by the lenders and they will pay commission if you click through it and borrow money .
While there is no reason why they should not do this , the problem with it is that they may only recommend lenders which pay them a high commission .
Personal Finance Sites
If you know of or use any personal finance sites that you trust then these could be useful as well .
They might have a loans section , for example and you may be able to use this to find out lots about different loans types and lenders .
Some might even have recommendations for you .
Some of these sites may still have the affiliate links but some may not .
Message Boards and Forums
These may be a bit old fashioned these days but you may still find some of these on the topic of personal finance or loans .
You will be able to find out people ’s personal experiences of different lenders here .
Although you will be unlikely to find links to lenders websites , it will allow you to find out about them and then you could use a search engine to find them directly if you do decide that you want to use them .

It may seem a lot of research to do but it is well worth having this information under your belt .

Knowing that you will be able to get money in a few hours if you need it , can be a great relief for many people and hopefully , if you know it can arrive so quickly , then you will feel that you can take the time that you need to make sure that you choose the best loan for you .
A PC in your entertainment center
TiVo and its brethren get credit for introducing the average consumer to the concept of the digital video recorder ( DVR ) and opening the door to bigger and better things .
The Home Theater PC ( HTPC ) is the computer enthusiast 's take on all the things a DVR generally does , with the potential to do everything a full - fledged computer does .
The concept had a bit of a slow start until Microsoft 's release of Windows XP Media Center Edition ( MCE ) 2005 , which gave the very familiar Windows a living room interface and the hardware support that HTPCs needed .
No matter what operating system you use for your HTPC , the same general concepts exist : recording and time - shifting TV is the most basic role .
Playback and recording of DVD and Blu-ray is probably secondary , followed by distribution of audio content and , in more ambitious setups , serving as the whole home network 's media storage center .
And do n't forget the ability to do mundane things such as browsing the web from ten feet away on a shiny new 1080 p HDTV .
It 's been three years since the HTPC has gone mainstream .
Today , the HTPC front - end is fairly well established , with a slick interface and a compact , living room - friendly form factor , and it 's reliable enough that you rarely notice it 's there .
Going beyond the DVR
The HTPC , fundamentally , is a geek endeavor .
An off - the - shelf DVR is almost certainly going to be cheaper , take less power , and be easier to setup than an HTPC .
Using an Xbox 360 , PS3 , AppleTV , or something else as a Media Center Extender to get content to your TV is also going to be cheaper ( and probably easier ) .
As Mythtv.org points out , lots of solutions exist , almost all of them cheaper than building your own HTPC .
When it come to an off - the - shelf DVR , the most valuable thing for many will be the fact that you can call technical support when it breaks ; or , more appropriately , when your family 's DVR breaks and they live 300 miles away , they can call tech support so you can continue watching Battlestar Galactica uninterrupted .
Setting aside the geek appeal of the HTPC and other potential issues like cost and power consumption , the HTPC 's additional capabilities are the biggest reason to build one rather than going with a prebuilt DVR .
Sheer space is an easy argument to identify : there 's nothing but your budget stopping you from building a HTPC with 4TB of storage .
You wo n't find multiple terabytes of space in the average DVR , nor will you find the upgradablity .
Have a standard definition DVR already and want to go high - definition ( HD ) ?
Sure , it would be cheaper to buy an HD - capable DVR , but what if you want Blu-ray , too ?
A Sony PlayStation 3 might be able to do the Blu-ray part , but with only 80 GB max , it 's severely lacking in space .
Hence , for those with needs desires beyond the average DVR user , the HTPC starts to make sense .
You can do it all in one box in your HTPC .
If you need HD , design it for that .
Processors are cheap and powerful today , a sub - $ 200 Core 2 Duo from Intel or Athlon X2 from AMD can handle 1080 p content ; if you 're doing SD or 720 p HD , requirements are even lower ( and cheaper ! ) .
Storage space is cheap .
Gaming ?
We do n't generally discuss gaming on the HTPC , but it can be done too .
We have n't forgotten that the PS3 and Xbox 360 are superb consoles for gaming .
They just do n't do everything a capable HTPC can do — but then they were n't intended to .
A key appeal of the PS3 or Xbox 360 is that you may already have one in your living room , ready to go , complete with Blu-ray if it 's a PS3 ... and that may make a lot more sense than another couple hundred dollars on an HTPC .
Three approaches to the HTPC
Compared to past HTPC guides on Ars , this one is more simple in some ways , and more complex in others .
It 's simplified compared to the previous HTPC guide in that hardware has gotten cheaper and powerful enough to handle HD without blowing too many budgets , so we wo n't be worried about a low - end and a high - end setup .
Instead , we 'll focus on 1080 p HD content as our baseline to help differentiate the guide from cheaper , less - capable setups .
To remind people , building a HTPC generally is not an inexpensive endeavor : we deliberately choose to go for a fairly powerful setup to emphasize the differences that might otherwise be blurred with an off - the - shelf HD DVR .
A mid-range Athlon X2 and just about any off - the - shelf hard drive can handle a few HD streams in Linux without breaking a sweat , which is a significant improvement from where things were just three years ago .
Many people now have a Home Media Server ( aka , the back - end ) sitting in a study or closet somewhere with far more storage than most would want to stick in a little box in their A/V stack , and instead put out a very lightweight front - end HTPC .
There 's no longer a single box sitting next to the TV in the most ambitious HTPC setups , and this means quite a few more areas of expansion that we can address .
This gives us three systems in the HTPC System Guide :
All - in - one HTPC : this is what most people traditionally think of as the classic HTPC : a single box that you can set next to your TV , plug it in to your TV , your network ( wired or wireless ) , and your antenna , cable , or both , power it up , set it up , and then let it do its thing .
This normally has at least two tuners in it , so you can watch and time - shift content at the same time as you record something else in the background .
It 's got enough space for most of your TV , and probably your pictures , music , DVD ripping , and whatever else you need to do .
The other two come in the form of a one - two punch :
Few months before 911 Wolfowitz gave a chilling speech at west point .
It was all doom and gloom .
It sounded strange .
I recently acquired a copy of the speech and I do not know what to make of it .
Most of the time , though , these robots that look so cool on screen are so incompetent at their jobs , they'd have had better luck just sending a random intern to do it .
Such as :
Basically , robots can make everything cooler , from wars to weddings .
Hollywood knows this and tries , when possible , to give us what we crave in the form of kickass robots with kickass abilities .
8 The Terminator

Terminator asks us to believe a computer becomes sentient and begins building an army of machines to wipe out the humans who survive the nuclear holocaust that the computer creates .
Machines that look like kickass chrome skeletons with laser Gatling guns and shit , stomping across fields of skulls , grinning like Dick Cheney .
Then the computer , demonstrating child - like frustration at having only murdered about 5.8 billion people , sends a Terminator back in time to take out the most annoying human before he knows how to fight back .
At this point a cocker spaniel - haired waitress and then her smart - ass kid , manage to outwit the thing three different times .

That alone should be proof of the laughable incompetence of the grossly misnamed Terminator .
But it gets worse .
As witnessed in T3 , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Terminator ( a T - 800 ) has a little battery thing in his chest that basically acts like a nuclear device when he needs it to .
Why did n't the original , whilst crawling through the machines that eventually crushed it , just use that to kill Sarah Connor ?
We may never know .
You'd be tempted to call the T - 800 the lamest possible Terminator , but in the sequel , Skynet sends back a super advanced T - 1000 .
So advanced it has to be within reaching distance to kill someone since it can only stab .
Apparently sending the terminators back in time with some kind of pamphlet on how to build an effective bomb was out of the question , as was programming them to not ask the name of their victim then stare at them for an extended period of time before slowly drawing a weapon .

The cruel irony of it all is , with an army of machines that incompetent , it did n't take John Connor to wipe them out .
All mankind needed to do was find a hiding place until the machines accidentally killed themselves somehow .
The UN reacted furiously last night to Burma 's military government confiscating food aid intended for more than a million victims of last week 's cyclone .
Two planeloads were impounded by the junta , prompting a temporary suspension in deliveries .
UN flights were resumed last night , in the hope that negotiations would lead to a resolution .
Gordon Brown called the Burmese action " utterly unacceptable " .
He stopped short of joining France and the US in calling for aid deliveries without Burmese permission , although pressure within his government for such a move is growing .
Last night , the international development secretary , Douglas Alexander , said an emergency UN meeting today would demand urgent humanitarian access .
A UN appeal launched yesterday raised almost half its target of $ 187 m ( £ 96 m ) .
Britain's ambassador to the UN , Sir John Sawers , last night demanded that the Burmese government grant visas to aid workers , allow importation and distribution of food aid , and stop charging import duties on it .
He also hinted Britain might back the distribution of aid without Burmese government permission .
" The United Nations will need to reflect on what steps it can take if a government prevents the international community from taking the steps needed to prevent an even greater disaster than the one we face now , " Sawers said .
Britain's ambassador to Burma , Mark Canning , said authoritative estimates of the numbers of dead and missing ranged from 63,000 to 100,000 , while up to 1.9 million people were vulnerable to water - borne disease , hunger and lack of drinkable water .
" So you can do the maths and you will see how quickly this thing can get larger . "
Small amounts of aid were trickling through , he added , but not nearly enough .
Save the Children estimated that a tenth of the victims made homeless by Cyclone Nargis last Saturday had been reached by yesterday when aid deliveries were halted .
Seven tonnes of high - energy biscuits flown in on a Thai commercial flight last Thursday were cleared by Burmese customs but the next two loads , 38 tonnes , enough to feed 95,000 people , were seized by the government .
" All of the food aid and equipment we managed to get in has been confiscated , " Paul Risley , a spokesman for the UN's World Food Programme , said in Bangkok .
The regime was also blocking visas for aid workers .
The foreign ministry said it would accept cash and material aid but not international aid workers ; the government would distribute food aid .
Britain is putting diplomatic pressure on Burma via China , India and Thailand .
But if this fails in the next few days , it would look again at unilateral delivery .
" If it comes to letting hundreds of thousands of people die , of course we 're not going to do that , " a British official said .
" There are people suffering , " the prime minister told Sky TV .
" It 's utterly unacceptable that , when international aid is offered , the regime will try to prevent that getting in . "
The row over food deliveries came after a standoff between the junta and the UN over visas for up to 40 disaster management experts .
UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon criticised the government 's decision to press ahead today with a referendum strengthening the generals ' grip on power .
Is the universe conscious ?
And does the cosmos actually care about what happens to Earth ?
In a new book , " Cosmos and Psyche " cultural historian and professor at California Institute of Integral Studies , Richard Tarnas , Ph.D. , makes the case for a caring and sentient universe .
While many scientists and academics subscribe to a paradigm in which faith and reason are separate , Tarnas offers an integrated perspective .
Using astrology and planetary correspondences to illustrate patterns in world history , he reminds us that the stars do , in fact , light the way for humanity in its spiritual evolution and struggle with maturity .
Tarnas recently spoke to Beliefnet about history and astrology , and how , in a culture with a soulless cosmology , " you can never get enough of what you do n't really need . "
Given current assumptions about the cosmos , it is a scandal for a professor of philosophy to come out with a book that is in any way supportive of astrology .
I think it 's safe to say that of all perspectives , astrology is the one most subject to automatic rejection and scorn in the modern intellectual world .
I myself was skeptical until I conducted my own research .
But the evidence is very compelling :
There is an astonishingly consistent correlation between planetary alignments and the patterns of human experience .
" Cosmos and Psyche " sets out that evidence in a way that readers new to this perspective can examine and assess for themselves .
It 's a little like Galileo 's telescope :
Anyone could look through it to see the new universe it revealed , but it was a scandal at the time .
Most cultures , including our own prior to the modern era , had some kind of astrology as part of their world view , for they understood the cycles of the moon , sun , and planets as deeply meaningful .
The astrological perspective sees the universe as both meaningful and unified .
Instead of the modern division between the purposeful , meaning - seeking human consciousness and a random , meaningless universe , astrology points to a universe that is integrated at all levels : outer and inner , macrocosm and microcosm , celestial and terrestrial .
As was said by the ancients , " As above , so below .
" The existence of correlations between the planetary cycles and human life makes it possible for both individuals and societies to understand better what archetypal energies are at work and at what time .
This can help us be more skillful and aware as we engage in the activities of life .
It 's like knowing the weather report before going out into the ocean to sail or surf .
It helps to know where the winds and waves will be coming from .
But there is also a deeper advantage : Modern civilization pays a high price for living in a universe that it believes is random and spiritually meaningless .
Nature is not honored but is instead exploited for short - term benefit .
And a purposeless universe creates a sense of deep spiritual emptiness inside , which people try to fill with endless consumer products , so that the industrial technology producing those products is cannibalizing the planet .
But as we know , you can never get enough of what you do n't really need .
A new vision of nature and the universe as ensouled , as spiritually significant , would give a better ground for both moral responsibility and a sense of spiritual belonging .
Our civilization desperately needs to develop more awareness about the consequences of our activities .
We need to be paying attention not just to the bottom line of the next quarterly profit report , but to what seven generations from now will experience as a result of our actions .
The only way that such a fundamental change will occur would be if enough individuals become more deeply aware of our profound embeddedness within the larger Earth community and the universe itself .
Our civilization basically seems to be caught in an immature period in its development , like a self - enclosed adolescent who has not yet been initiated into the deeper realities of life and who therefore continues to act from a short - sighted and often self - destructive state of consciousness .
It 's as if our entire civilization is undergoing an initiation in our time , into a new world view and a new way of living .
How and when did astrology fall out of favor with established academia and science ?
Historically , astrology actually has a long , noble tradition that was central to Western civilization from the ancient Greeks onwards .
As recently as the Renaissance it was highly regarded by most of the intellectual and cultural elite .
The shift really happened in the later 17th century , when many factors came together — the growing conviction that the modern mind was superior to all ancient traditions and perspectives , the new sense that the cosmos was disenchanted or soulless , a belief that to be free , the human being could not live in an astrological universe , and a gradual intellectual decline within astrology itself that made it increasingly vulnerable to criticism .
Underlying all of these , a deep change of consciousness was occurring in the modern self that eclipsed the astrological vision so that something else could emerge .
Astrology stopped being taught at Harvard and Oxford by the end of the 17th century ; interestingly , though , astrology courses are again entering higher education , this time in a form that has integrated modern and postmodern developments .
It 's an enormous challenge .
On the one hand I think each individual is on a journey of her own or his own .
Individuals need to be listening closely to their own hearts , their own calling to new horizons .
They need to pay attention to where they feel " not right " — perhaps unplug the television , go out into nature more often , look at the heavens and the night sky outside of the city .
We all need to orient our lives more towards beauty , towards art , towards relationships , and towards interior self - exploration , whether it 's meditation or more powerful forms of experience .
For example , the ayahuasca rituals coming from South America are extraordinary , powerful initiatory rituals that help people become aware that they are in a larger universe than they thought .
So on the one hand , there are individual paths on which each of us has to find our own way .
But then there 's the question of how we are to deal with the major problems of modern consciousness on the collective level - - for example , the vast collective entrancement that 's happening right now through the mass media .
Exactly .
Many people today are more tuned into the weekly sitcoms and " reality shows " than they are to what 's going on in the planetary biosphere or even in their neighborhood community .
What will wake people up from this trance ?
Many experts believe that some very critical events will unfold within the next decade or so .
We 've already seen some in these last two years : Katrina , the tsunami , the many violent hurricanes and tornadoes , the strangeness of the weather patterns , the melting of the ice caps ...
And we know from individual lives that there is nothing like a mortal crisis to profoundly reconfigure a person 's life .
Out of such a crisis a radical shift of values tends to emerge .
The whole moral structure of a person's or an entire society 's way of being is transformed .
It seems to me quite possible that we as a civilization and as a species may face some kind of crisis that will serve to catalyze this awakening .
The question is :
How severe will the crisis have to be for this awakening to take place ?
This is where we come in , with our free will , our courage , our spirit .
Over the 30 years of research , I found that the most striking correspondences involved the aspects , like conjunctions and oppositions between the planets , rather than the signs .
It 's more important that there is a new moon or a full moon ( which is formed by the conjunction and the opposition of the sun and the moon ) , than what sign the moon is in .
It 's not that signs have no significance .
But the most basic archetypal dynamics that we see in history and in people 's biographies seem most precisely connected to the geometrical aspects between the planets .
Signs color those energies , but the energies themselves are related to the planets and their cyclical alignments .
We see this , for example , in the great conjunction of Uranus and Pluto that took place from 1960 to 1972 .
This coincided precisely with a time of tremendous empowerment of innovative and revolutionary impulses across the world , with both great social upheaval and liberating change occurring in every country on the planet .
Which is just what one might expect given what astrologers have long concluded about the meanings of those two planets .
Those same two planets were also in alignment during the French Revolutionary epoch , 1787 - 1798 , when there was a virtually identical upsurge of tremendous rebellious and liberating energies sweeping the world , with radical change affecting many societies .
We actually are going to be getting the square aspect of these same two planets during the next fifteen years , so on the basis of the past correlations we can anticipate some profound changes and new social energies in the not - too - distant future .
I hope my book opens thoughtful readers to a new dimension of the extraordinary universe we live in , a universe that seems to be informed at all levels by a profound creative intelligence .
I believe that we can participate in the evolutionary unfolding of this universe more consciously and fully if we are aware of the correspondences between the planetary movements and our lives .
And we can move into a more trusting relationship to life and the cosmos when we recognize the larger patterns of meaning and purpose in which we are embedded .

Recently , when walking home from work , I was passed by one of those red monster pick - up trucks with an oversized bumper sticker on the back window that announced : FORMER MARINE .
It made me wonder why it is that Marines are the only federal employees who feel the urge to proclaim that they once were paid with taxpayer loot .
You never see Volkswagens buzzing around town with a sign that says FORMER POSTAL WORKER , or Lexuses chugging down the street with a sticker proclaiming FORMER FEDERAL FISHERIES STAFF ACCOUNTANT .
So , what 's with the Marines ?
Like any other federal employee , they live off of other people 's money ( acquired via conscription ) , they operate on a socialist model , they specialize in bullying people , and they are always faithful ( semper fi ! ) to the government bureaucracy , whether or not that bureaucracy is acting in accord with the Constitution ( or natural law ) .
In other words , they are different from federal housing clerks in degree but not in substance .
Normally , I ’d sympathize with such individuals .
Despite the pay and benefits , no one said that working for the military was easy ( although it often is ) .
This is especially true for the troops sweating it out on the streets of Baghdad , many of whom signed up for National Guard service believing that two weekends a month and two weeks a year meant just that .
They are , nevertheless , simply another variety of federal workers bearing grenades and guns instead of paper clips and White Out .
Both sets of workers freely chose to pledge their lives in exchange for a share of the stolen goods locked away in the Treasury for the most economic of reasons : that course of action benefited them more than the next best alternative .
But while one worker finds himself in the air - conditioned bowels of the Department of Waste building somewhere near the Potomac , the other crosses himself every time he gets on the Baghdad Beltway .
It does n’t seem fair .
But it is predictable .
Whether bureaucracies comprise the welfare or warfare states , they must spend their budgets this year in order to justify bigger ones next year .
This insight was not accepted into the mainstream of economic thought until the development of the Public Choice school in the 1960s , but long before that , the Austrian school considered the economic analysis of bureaucracies as fair game .
For instance , when Mises analyzed bureaucracies in Human Action in 1949 , he merely emphasized the main points he raised in his classic 1944 book Bureaucracy .
As recently as 1995 , Rothbard noted that
Bureaucracy is necessarily hierarchical . . . because [ it ] grows by adding more subordinate layers .
Since , lacking a market , there is no genuine test of " merit " in government ’s service to consumers , in a rule - bound bureaucracy seniority is often blithely adopted as a proxy for merit .
Increasing seniority , then , leads to promotion to higher ranks , while expanding budgets take the form of multiplying the levels of ranks under you , and expanding your income and power .
Bureaucratic growth occurs , then , by multiplying levels of bureaucracy .
Such layers continue to fester unless constrained by a strict constitution ( which is rare ) or other institutional constraints ( such as a gold standard ) .
The result is hardly congruent with a peaceful and orderly society .
A bureaucracy 's very existence is based on involuntary trade , implying the introduction of some violence , whether in the form of tax system enforcement or of bullets fired by those federal employees stationed out on the fringes of the American Empire .
The festering explains the general resentment toward government .
One can sense it in the total disgust felt toward the two major parties ' presidential candidates .
One can measure it in the size of record budget deficits and projected inflation .
One can see it in the popularity of a recently - released documentary that questions the moral legitimacy of the warfare state and its sycophants .
After a certain point , the waste is obvious .
When that happens , shame is the proper reaction on the part of those who helped cause it by participating in a system based on transferred — as opposed to created — wealth .
After all , you do n’t see the same kind of pride of work on the part of U.S. Department of Agriculture price fixers that you do among Wal - Mart employees .
Why is that ?
The answer is because a life devoted to fidelity to Leviathan in a government bureaucracy is neither a badge of honor nor the mark of a meaningful life , and most every former federal employee knows it — except , perhaps , the former leathernecks who cruise by during my walk home from work .
People who devote their lives to private enterprise , on the other hand , might be told that they are greedy and selfish but they know in their hearts that they have been serving others within a framework of voluntary exchange all their lives .
Major League Baseball is attempting to institute instant replay on home run calls before the end of this season , according to two sources familiar with those discussions .
However , in order to accomplish that , MLB still needs to settle on a replay system that would satisfy everyone involved , from the umpires to commissioner Bud Selig .
USA Today reported Friday on its Web site that MLB had approached the World Umpires Association about implementing replay on Aug .
1 . However , it appears that 's merely a tentative target date .
While it 's possible a system could be in place that soon , some baseball officials merely want to get some form of replay system up and running before this year 's postseason .
As recently as a few weeks ago , baseball officials were still talking about experimenting with replay during the Arizona Fall League , the World Baseball Classic and spring training before implementing it in the big leagues .
But so many people within the sport have reached the conclusion that replay is now inevitable , they 're pushing to get it in place as soon as possible .
Their thinking , according to the same sources , is that if there no longer is any serious opposition to the principle of using replay to decide home run calls , it would be embarrassing to the sport to have a big game down the stretch , or in October , decided by a blown home run call .
They 're hoping to settle on specifics that would be acceptable to Selig , the umpires ' union and the players ' union .
However , a source told ESPN.com he believes the umpires are in favor of replay as long as it's done in a way that protects and supports them .
And while Selig still has n't given the go - ahead , it 's believed he would support a system that would preserve the character of the sport and not delay games significantly .
The idea of replay has gained momentum after umpires botched several home run rulings on national TV in May .
At Yankee Stadium , umpires reversed their correct call and concluded a home run by the Mets ' Carlos Delgado was foul .
The following night in Houston , umpires mistakenly ruled a ball off a center - field wall was in play , prompting a reconfiguration at Minute Maid Park the next day .
And , again at Yankee Stadium , a ball hit by Alex Rodriguez that struck a stairway beyond the outfield fence and bounced back into the outfield was ruled a double when it should have been a home run .
Chicago Cubs pitcher Jon Lieber said before Friday 's game that he supports the idea of replay .
" The game needs it and I think it does need it soon , " Lieber said .
" With technology the way it is today , there 's no reason why it should n't be a part of the game . "
Cubs manager Lou Piniella said he does n't think replay is needed .
" I do n't think it 's needed at all , to be honest , " Piniella said Friday .
" How many times do you see players make errors ?
Baseball has talked about speeding up the game .
It 's all you hear .
All of a sudden , they want instant replay ?
You 're going to have slower games and more restless people in the stands . "
Last November , general managers voted 25 - 5 to try replay on boundary calls .
At the time , Selig took the recommendation under advisement .
Selig , like many of the game 's traditionalists , has always liked the human element of baseball , and that meant tolerating an occasional wrong call by an umpire .
He also worried about further bogging down a sport that has been criticized for its slow pace .
Count Pittsburgh outfielder Jason Michaels in that corner .
" Here 's the thing : I guess I 'm old - school , but I think human error is part of the game , " Michaels said .
" It 's always been that way .
I would think I 'd be against it . "
In recent years , the new and cozy ballparks , with their quirky dimensions , odd angles and yellow lines that denote home runs , have made it more difficult for umpires .
" If that is what it takes to get the calls right , " Pirates outfielder Nate McLouth said .
" They [ say ] it will make the game longer , but it might actually make it faster because wo n't have all the arguing .
But use it just for home runs ; the umps are there are a reason .
But some home run calls are so close -- we 've had a couple this year . "

Robot Planes Getting Bird ’s Eye View of Shrinking Greenland Ice Sheet
July 25th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Two low - flying unmanned aircraft are cruising over Greenland this month to closely observe the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its potential contribution to global sea level rise in the coming century .
The flights will help scientists determine whether the ice sheet ’s melt rate will accelerate in the future .
The drones are flying out of Ilulissat , half way up Greenland ’s west coast , for three weeks through the end of this month .
Scientists studying the rapidly vanishing Greenland ice sheet need to fill gaps in their data that was collected through satellite imagery .
A spurt of innovative unmanned aircraft missions have recently been flown including those that will deliver maps to help fight this year ’s California wildfires , to scrutinize atmospheric pollution levels , and to study Atlantic and Gulf hurricanes .
“ We ’re seeing the start of a new era in Arctic exploration , ” said scientist Betsy Weatherhead , of NOAA ’s Earth System Research Laboratory and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences .
“ With unmanned aircraft systems , we can fly missions too dangerous , dirty , or dull for humans and address questions we could n’t even think of addressing before . ”
In the ongoing Greenland ice sheet mission , the unmanned “ Manta ” vehicles are controlled by operators from the aircraft ’s manufacturer , Advanced Ceramics Research ( ACR ) , under the direction of on - site scientists .
The eight - foot - wide , 45 - pound Mantas will carry a digital camera , atmospheric temperature and pressure sensors , and other instruments .
Carrying a full 15 - pound instrument payload , the Manta can fly for up to six hours at about 40 knots , or 45 miles per hour , according to the Advanced Ceramics website .
Gathering Data on Dynamic Response in Glaciers
Scientists now studying the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland found its melt rate has doubled in the past decade with the resulting ice stream moving nearly 120 feet per day .
According to NASA satellite measurements , the Greenland Ice Sheet is melting at a rate of 57.3 cubic miles per year .
In summer months , the sun melts the top layer of the glaciers to form little lakes throughout the region , many of which vanish within a day .
Scientists think these lakes may be emptying out through the ice and lubricating the bottom of the glacier with water .
The glacier can then slide more quickly down the valleys , eventually breaking off into icebergs at the coastline .
In an August 2007 article , ( sub. req ’d . ) glaciologist Dr. Konrad Steffen , explained the problem of so - called “ dynamic response ” this way :
“ What happens is that the melting accelerates as meltwater funnels down to the bedrock .
At the bottom , the water acts as a lubricant , flowing under the outlet glaciers and allowing the ice to slip into the sea more quickly . ”
A bird ’s - eye view of the region from 500 to 1,000 feet above the ice will provide fine - scale measurements of the water and surface of the glaciers .
Low - flying , unmanned Mantas are able to provide that view by cruising at low altitudes over little - known terrain without putting human life at risk .

Gillian Anderson gets her James Bond on in 55
Virologist and cancer biologist Patrick Lee was on his way to the American Association of Cancer Research in San Diego last week when he decided to check out the in - flight movie I Am Legend .
The premise of the sci - fi horror movie is that a virus successfully used to fight cancer in clinical trials has gone out of control , pushing humankind to the edge of extinction .
Early on in the movie , survivor Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) replays a three - year - old TV interview which foreshadows the impending disaster .
“ So , Dr. Krippin , give it to me in a nutshell , ” says the TV interviewer .
“ Well , the premise is quite simple , ” responds the scientist .
“ Um , take something designed by nature and reprogram it to make it work for the body rather than against it . ”
In his airplane seat , Dr. Lee ’s jaw is dropping .
Not a movie - goer , he did n’t catch the movie in theatres when it came out last Christmas , although a colleague at McGill thought he should .
“ That ’s my research .
I ca n’t believe it , that ’s my research , ” he says .
“ I was the first one to use a virus to target cancer cells . ”
Dr. Lee has championed the development of the naturally occurring “ reovirus ” as a potential treatment for cancer .
Reovirus , like all viruses , self - propagates and multiplies when it attaches itself to a host cell .
With ordinary viruses , they can cause sickness due to infection .
Reovirus , though , kills cancerous host cells and leaves healthy cells alone .

In 1998 , Dr. Lee revealed that reovirus injected in mice shrank tumours from brain cancer significantly .
Not only that , the reovirus would seek out other tumours and eliminate them as well .
His discovery of a promising therapy for cancer was a worldwide sensation when announced in the journal Science .
In the decade since his breakthrough , Dr. Lee relocated from the University of Calgary to Dalhousie University , where he ’s worked to understand how reovirus replicates in the host cell and seeks out other cancerous cells .
In short , says Dr. Lee , “ to know what makes the virus such a potent cancer killer . ”
He ’s recently received word of a $ 711,000 grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) which will support his laboratory for the next three years ; the money is part of more than $ 4 - million in grants from CIHR that are going to Dalhousie University researchers .
Ten graduate students and post - doctoral fellows work on two cancer - related projects in Dr. Lee ’s laboratory : one is the reovirus project ; the other involves the function of p53 , a tumour - suppressor protein .
Meanwhile , independent of Dr. Lee ’s research , phase - one and phase - two clinical trials are taking place in the United States and in the U.K. to test the safety and effectiveness of reovirus in humans .
Results have been promising so far , says Dr. Lee , but large - scale , phase - three clinical trials are still a few years away .
But clearly the movie is still bothering him .
He wants to make it clear there ’s no worry that the reovirus could run amuck .
“ I thought the movie was very entertaining but the scenario it presents is highly unlikely , almost impossible , ” he says .
With a pause , he adds : “ Scientists do n’t like to deal in absolutes , but in this case , I would say absolutely impossible . ”
Step aside Moore and Taylor .
Welcome Garcia and Rodriguez .
Smith remains the most common surname in the United States , according to a new analysis released yesterday by the Census Bureau .
But for the first time , two Hispanic surnames — Garcia and Rodriguez — are among the top 10 most common in the nation , and Martinez nearly edged out Wilson for 10th place .
The number of Hispanics living in the United States grew by 58 percent in the 1990s to nearly 13 percent of the total population , and cracking the list of top 10 names suggests just how pervasively the Latino migration has permeated everyday American culture .
Garcia moved to No. 8 in 2000 , up from No. 18 , and Rodriguez jumped to No. 9 from 22nd place .
The number of Hispanic surnames among the top 25 doubled , to 6 .
Compiling the rankings is a cumbersome task , in part because of confidentiality and accuracy issues , according to the Census Bureau , and it is only the second time it has prepared such a list .
While the historical record is sketchy , several demographers said it was probably the first time that any non-Anglo name was among the 10 most common in the nation .
“ It ’s difficult to say , but it ’s probably likely , ” said Robert A. Kominski , assistant chief of social characteristics for the census .

Matt Drudge is reviled by many on the left , but his news instincts are undeniable — and he has an uncanny ability to drive the national conversation with what he chooses to highlight on his site .
Drudge keeps campaigns guessing
May 19 was a fairly typical day in the recent life of the Drudge Report .
There was a breathtaking picture of Sen. Barack Obama ’s rally in Portland , Ore. , framed by the words “ AS FAR AS CAMERA'S EYE CAN SEE … THE OBAMA MASS . ”
Advertisement
And there was thinly veiled mockery of two other candidates : “ Clinton Sits Through Sermon About Adultery , ” was one headline .
“ State GOP chair : McCain ‘ kind of like Jesus , ’ ” was another , closely followed by “ McCain ’s national finance co-chair exits over lobbyist ties … ”
The day , and the weeks before and since , capture what may be the most striking new feature of the 2008 media landscape .
Matt Drudge has upended the conventional wisdom that he and his powerful online vehicle are stalwarts of the conservative message machine .
After skewering Al Gore and lampooning John Kerry , he ’s emerged as an unreliable ally for the GOP , while trumpeting Obama ’s victories and shrugging at his scandals .
“ It ’s clear to us that Barack Obama has won the Drudge Primary , and it's one of the most important primaries in this process , ” conceded a senior aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton , who also acknowledged that Drudge ’s treatment of Obama could make the Illinois senator more electable in November .
Now , as Obama and Sen. John McCain look toward the fall , Drudge has emerged unexpectedly as more of a threat to the Republican than to the Democrat .
This , combined with the rise of left - leaning sites such as TalkingPointsMemo.com and HuffingtonPost.com — both of which have proved effective in promoting and amplifying a Democratic message — reflects a major shift from the last two presidential elections , a matter of open alarm to Republican strategists and surprised satisfaction to Democrats .
“ The MSM is already sending love letters to Obama , ” said a GOP operative who worked for the Bush - Cheney reelection .
“ That ’s something that has traditionally been countered on the Republican side with talk radio , blogs to a lesser degree but especially Drudge .
If those tools are not part of the Republican vehicle for message delivery , that ’s crippling . ”
The Drudge Report is no ordinary compendium of news stories .
It is a heavily trafficked gateway to all corners of the Internet , a portal composed of links largely to breaking news from traditional media like The New York Times ( as well as newer entrants like Politico ) .
Most of the content is without any obvious ideological attachment .
But operatives of both parties have long believed that his choice of links — along with occasional posts of Drudge 's own reporting — have reflected a rightward tilt , and they assumed a preference for Republican candidates .
Drudge himself is reviled by many on the left , but his news instincts are undeniable — and he has an uncanny ability to drive the national conversation with what he chooses to highlight on his site .
Now , while his links tend to stress the energy and scale of the Obama phenomenon , he has emphasized a particularly damaging aspect of McCain ’s candidacy : his age .
Age and health are common features on the Drudge Report — everything from Hillary Clinton ’s coughing ( “ Health Scare ! ” ) to people with obscure diseases gets a headline — and McCain has fallen victim to this obsession .
In April of last year , Drudge featured an image of a dark spot on the head of the Republican candidate , who had previously been treated for skin cancer , spurring a round of media inquiries and speculation on a possible recurrence .
The campaign later said McCain had hit his head on a plane .
Last week , Drudge excerpted just one portion of McCain ’s speech on nuclear weapons , but only to dwell on McCain ’s discussion of America as a “ young country . ”
And then there are the images themselves .
“ He has a tendency to include photos — he understands the power of visuals , ” observed a GOP strategist and close Drudge - watcher .
“ And his photos often played into the worst stereotypes of McCain : cranky , old or nuts — or all three in some . ”
To Obama , meanwhile , Drudge has been admiring at times , featuring the tear - stained faces of Obama supporters with the headline “ Screams and Tears of Delight . ”
More important have been the dogs that did n’t bark : Drudge showed comparatively little interest in the controversy around the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama ’s pastor , ignoring his “ God damn America ! ” sermon for a day after the story of it broke , then linking only to the news that he ’d left Obama ’s campaign .
Among Drudge ’s next scattered forays was the story of a McCain aide who was suspended for promoting the story .
Then , with more fanfare , he posted an image of Wright with ... Bill Clinton .
When Obama addressed the story in a major speech , Drudge — uncharacteristically — simply posted Obama ’s words in full .
He ’s shown similarly little interest in the trial of former Obama patron Tony Rezko on corruption charges : Again , his first recognition of the story , this January 25 , came when he posted a photo of Rezko and Clinton that political sources were circulating .
He also paid far less attention to Obama ’s “ bitter ” comments than others on the right and most in the mainline media .
Obama ’s description of his grandmother ’s racial bias as that of a “ typical white person ” — which might have been classic fodder for a site that relishes the controversial statements and rhetorical stubbed toes of politicians — never made the Drudge Report .
Explanations vary for Drudge ’s apparent embrace of Obama and coolness to McCain — as do answers to the question of whether Drudge has changed , or whether he ’s simply responding to a changed landscape and a new set of candidates .
Some Drudge watchers note an ideological element , even if they ca n’t agree on the direction .
Drudge ’s public statements have long suggested that he has a strong libertarian streak , often linking stories detailing the latest developments in video surveillance or encroachments on speech .
McCain is no libertarian , and indeed regulating political speech — campaign finance reform — is one of his signature crusades .
“ A big part of Drudge is libertarian and First Amendment and McCain ’s not all there , ” said a top Republican strategist .
Arianna Huffington , whose Huffington
Post is sometimes cast as a liberal alternative to Drudge , views it through a different lens .
“ He does have a great grasp of the zeitgeist , and the zeitgeist has shifted , ” said Huffington .
“ What used to be left - wing positions are now solidly mainstream and supported by the majority of the American people . ”
Others who know Drudge say Obama benefits from the site ’s bias for a good story , and above all for the Next Big Thing .
“ I think he is fatigued by Clinton , I think he is invigorated by Obama , ” said one person who knows Drudge .
“ He would say that the Obama story is new .
If you ’re somebody who does what he does , you get really sick of the same stories . ”
“ He ’s interested in what brings people to the site — and Obama is a great box office , ” said Jim Dyke , the communications director for the Republican National Committee in 2004 .
Asked if McCain could fix his Drudge problem , Dyke replied , “ I do n’t think there is very much you can do . ”
After beginning to fashion something of a public profile after his Lewinsky - era debut — writing a book , hosting a TV and radio show , appearing regularly on C - SPAN — Drudge has gone mostly underground , letting his site speak for itself .
Drudge - watchers noted that his traffic is increasingly international , bringing him an audience for whom a young charismatic and cosmopolitan Democrat who defies ethnicity is a fascination — unlike his opponent , just another white Republican male .
Drudge , who in keeping up his Salinger - like air of mystery declined to comment for this story , was quick to tout his transnational appeal in a rare interview with the British Sky News late last year .
“ It ’s become sort of an international clearing ground of news — not just American news , not just British news , not just European news — anywhere news , ” he said .
“ This to me is the future , no boundaries . ”
Chris Lehane , who was Al Gore ’s spokesman in 2000 , analyzed Drudge ’s mindset in those business terms .
“ Drudge can count , ” he said .
The campaign , Lehane noted , is an opportunity for the site “ to position itself as less of a partisan and more as an equal opportunity muckraker ... [ The site ] may not be able to afford to be seen as explicitly partisan for its long - term growth purposes — especially given the potential electoral realignment the country may very well be going through . ”
What nobody who follows the daily cut and thrust of American politics questions is Drudge ’s continuing power to drive the stories and shape the narratives that define presidential politics .
His site grew notorious in the Clinton scandals of the late 1990s , and in 2000 , he tortured Gore and helped solidify the perception that the vice president was a serial exaggerator .
In 2004 , he was such a regular source of damaging stories about Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) that Kerry ’s research director , Michael Gehrke , set his computer ’s instant messenger to respond , automatically , to all incoming messages : “ Yes , I ’ve seen Drudge . ”
Drudge is the homepage as well as the first and final web stop of the day for many conservative opinion elites .
The site can be seen automatically refreshing just over Rush Limbaugh ’s shoulder on the talk show host ’s “ Dittocam ” and is also the chief news hub which local and regional talkers take their cues from to chat about from coast to coast .
But it ’s not just in the right - wing world where Drudge reigns supreme .
“ He serves as an assignment editor for the national press corps .
If he has a story up , you know the cable networks are going to cover it all day , ” said Kevin Madden , who was Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ’s campaign press secretary during the GOP primary .
“ Print reporters would call up and ask , ‘ Did you see this on Drudge ? ’ ” Madden recounted .
“ I ca n’t tell you how many calls I got that were prefaced with that explanation . ”
The primary provided repeated demonstrations of Drudge ’s power , and also of his new respect in the liberal , pro-Obama political precincts .
At 6:51 a.m. on Feb. 25 , Drudge posted an old image of Obama in African clothes , with the claim that Clinton staffers “ circulated ” the photo , and a quote from “ one campaign staffer , in an e-mail obtained by the DRUDGE REPORT . ”
The Obama campaign embraced Drudge ’s report of a dastardly smear , and the story burned for days in the mainstream media and liberal and conservative blogs alike , cementing the perception that the Clintons would do anything to stop Obama .
" I find it interesting that in a room of such esteemed journalists that Mr. Drudge has become your respected assignment editor , " Clinton spokesman Phil Singer later lectured reporters .
More recently , Drudge almost singlehandedly elevated Clinton ’s reference to Robert F. Kennedy ’s assassination into a campaign crisis and helped fuel her demise by leading with a YouTube.com link of the declaration by NBC ’s Tim Russert following the Indiana and North Carolina primaries that the Democratic nominee had been chosen .
The Clinton campaign at one time attempted to establish a relationship with Drudge , to little avail .
The site has been energetically ushering her offstage and even Clinton 's victory in Puerto Rico Sunday won only another gloomy headline : " THE END . "
For its part , the McCain campaign has brought in Matthew McDonald , a veteran of the Bush - Cheney war - room , to help bolster the communications operation .
Part of that job means trying , if possible , to shape the Drudge Report 's coverage of the campaign or , if not , to soften the negative impact among conservative media outlets .
McCain aides are still sore over the cancer scare Drudge briefly sparked last year and also recall the tempest the online newshound provoked in December when he posted as his lead an original item reporting that McCain ’s campaign was trying to spike the New York Times story that the Times eventually ran about the senator ’s relationship with a telecommunications lobbyist .
Still , those in McCain ’s orbit are clear - eyed about the power Drudge commands and are loath to cross him .
Asked about their rocky relationship with Drudge , a McCain aide — at once voicing hope , recognizing the need to improve the rapport and displaying an appreciation of Drudge ’s disdain for public talk of his source relationships — would only say : “ The way to appeal to him , I believe , is not commenting on him in the press . ”
When he became a psychiatrist in the 1970s , John Ratey did n’t expect to evolve into an exercise buff .
But today , the Harvard University professor and expert in attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder calls exercise the single most important tool people have to optimize brain function .
If you get your body in shape , he says , your mind will follow .
Ratey describes the emerging research on exercise and the brain in a book , “ Spark : The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain , ” which was published in January by Little , Brown .
His theory is straightforward : Humans evolved as physical creatures .
When they ’re lulled into sedentary lives , their bodies -- and their brains -- get flabby from lack of physical exertion .

Exercise , particularly aerobic exercise , can improve cognitive performance , soften the effects of stress , help fend off addiction - related cravings and tone down the negative consequences of women ’s hormonal changes , Ratey says .
When it comes to psychiatric disorders , he calls exercise “ one of the best treatments we have . ”

Explain why you titled the book “ Spark . ”
We ’re talking about the brain and changing it .
Exercise is adding the spark to the brain .
It gives energy to the brain .

We ’ve heard that exercise increases neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin .
But what is brain - derived neurotrophic factor and why is it so important ?
It is a very key linchpin for me and for the neuroscience community .
In the ‘90s , we learned in a big study [ by UC Irvine neuroscientist Carl Cotman ] that exercise is one of the factors that delayed the onset of cognitive decline .
That surprised a lot of people and no one knew how to account for it .
The assumption was that exercise did n’t act on the brain .
We also knew there was a thing called BDNF -- brain - derived neurotrophic factor [ a protein that helps build and maintain the cell circuitry in the brain ] .
Another study [ also by Cotman ] showed exercise elevates BDNF .
It truly is Miracle - Gro for the brain .

Why does aerobic activity and complex motor activity , such as martial arts or dance , produce different effects in the brain ?
The more complicated the exercise , the more challenging it is .
You ’re challenging the learning and focusing parts of your brain as well as doing the aerobics .
It optimizes the brain to learn .

Which is better to do ?

The ideal exercise plan would include both exercise that keeps you learning and [ exercise that ] keeps you moving -- and keeps the challenge up .
Challenge is something that we should all be striving for .
It ’s the key to a long and healthy life .

Is walking helpful for the brain ?
Even moving a little bit , such as walking very slowly , causes some increase in heart rate , and it does help .
But volume and intensity are different .
If you ’re going to do one , limit the volume and increase the intensity .
. . .
Intensity is important for the benefits to the brain .
Most of the studies showing the benefit of exercise on depression were of people doing brisk walking .
That might be at 65 % to 75 % of maximum heart rate .
But that really is the level where you ’re just beginning to get a benefit .

Why is morning the best time to exercise ?
I think morning is such a good time because it helps you start the day off correctly .
Your attention system is turned up and on .
But you ’re still going to get quite a bit of benefit from exercising in the evening .

You recommend exercise for depression , anxiety and addictions .
But telling someone who is addicted or depressed to exercise sounds as if it ’s trivializing the problem , does n’t it ?
It might .
I certainly would consult a physician first if you ’re depressed or if you need someone watching you .
I ’m not opposed to medicine at all .
I think what is revolutionary is the new science that exercise may be the best second treatment you can use -- in conjunction with whatever treatment you ’re already doing .
Exercise improves cognitive behavior therapy and it ’s a good partner to antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications .

It is a very useful tool for ADHD .
They may focus better and be less impulsive .
People feel less like they have to move [ making them less fidgety ] .
With exercise , you ’ve changed things in the brain .

How big an effect can regular aerobic exercise have on cognitive decline related to aging ?
The evidence on the benefits of exercise on cognitive decline really started the whole ball rolling .
It has been studied so much .
It certainly has a big impact , delaying cognitive decline by as much as seven to 10 years .
It plays a huge role in maintaining and regaining cognitive function .

--
So exercise is the best thing to do if you ’re worried about memory loss and cognitive decline during aging ?
No. 1 is exercise .
No. 2 is learn and connect with other people .
The ideal prescription is to do the exercise with someone .
A social event has a positive effect with exercise and learning .

If it lifts mood and increases energy and helps us think better , why do so many people hate exercise and quit ?
That is the biggest problem .
Fifty percent of people who start exercise end up dropping it after six months or so .
It does require planning , consideration and work .
I tell people to make a commitment with a loved one , friend or neighbor .
Often , that kind of social obligation can help get people started .
That is probably the best way to begin .
But it would be ideal if there were people to check on you and get you out of the house every day .

Understanding its physical benefits has n’t gotten a lot of people to exercise .
Will knowledge of the brain benefits carry more meaning -- and more motivation ?

That is exactly my point .
If people were aware this was such good medicine in so many ways and gets you in a steady state mentally , more people would likely start and stick with an exercise regimen .
But look at the studies that show exercise is as effective as antidepressants .
It makes news for a day , and it ’s gone .
It ’s like we ’ve gotten into thinking we need a pill , not just for mood , for everything .
Exercise is simple , but , oh boy , it really takes a commitment .
That ’s why we need to tell people about the evidence that exercise benefits the brain and the body .

People , Hello
Economists continue to seek the keys to predicting currency values .
Some recent research supports the idea that exchange rates behave like financial assets , whose price movements are primarily driven by changes in expectations about future economic fundamentals , rather than by changes in current ones .
These studies suggest that the real contribution of standard exchange rate models may not lie in their ability to forecast currency values .
Instead , the models imply predictability runs in the opposite direction : Exchange rates can help forecast economic fundamentals .
Economic differences between countries — in such areas as national income , money growth , inflation and trade balances — have long been considered critical determinants of currency values .
[ 1 ]
However , there ’s no definitive evidence that any economic variable can forecast exchange rates for currencies of nations with similar inflation rates .
These steep , prolonged depreciations have brought a new urgency to understanding the factors that move exchange rates .
Some way of forecasting them would allow businesses , investors and others to make better , more - informed decisions .
Unfortunately , exchange rates are very difficult , if not impossible , to predict — at least over short to medium time horizons .
Why Are Exchange Rates So Difficult to Predict ? , by Jian Wang , Economic Letter , Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas : The U.S. dollar has been losing value against several major currencies this decade .
Since 2001 – 02 , the U.S. currency has fallen about 50 percent against the euro , 40 percent against the Canadian dollar and 30 percent against the British pound ( Chart 1 ) .
What about the other way around , can exchange rate movements be used to predict economic fundamentals ?
The answer here is a bit more positive as there is some evidence that exchange rates are useful in forecasting commodity prices ( an NBER Digest on this point follows the Economic Letter ) :
This Economic Letter from the Dallas Fed discusses the relationship between exchange rates and economic fundamentals .
Can fundamentals predict exchange rate movements ?
It depends upon how the question is asked , e.g. how far into the future the forecasts extend , but it does n't look promising .
The Disconnect Puzzle
Supply and demand hold sway on currency exchanges , just as they do in most other markets .
Exchange rates ebb and flow depending on the shifting needs of the individuals , firms and governments that buy foreign goods and services , invest abroad , and seek profit or protection through speculation .
The fundamentals that economists link to exchange rates shape the forces supply and demand .
It seems logical , for example , that countries with large trade deficits would see their currencies decline , and countries with strong growth and low inflation would see their currencies rise in value .
But what may be logical in theory has n’t been easy to prove .
In 1983 , Richard Meese and Kenneth Rogoff challenged the long - held idea that economic fundamentals determine relative currency values .
[ 2 ]
The economists compared existing models to an alternative in which fundamentals are excluded and any exchange rate changes are purely random .
They found a “ random walk ” model just as good at predicting exchange rates as models based on fundamentals .
In short , their findings suggest economic fundamentals — like trade balances , money supply , national income and other key variables — are of little use in forecasting exchange rates between countries with roughly similar inflation rates .
[ 3 ]
This result has been labeled the “ exchange rate disconnect puzzle . ”
This disconnect can be illustrated by comparing the one - month forward exchange rate forecast and a random walk , using data for the U.S. dollar against the euro from March 2003 to January 2008 ( Chart 2 ) .
There ’s no evidence that the forward rate follows the spot rate more closely than a random walk .
The results are similar for three other currencies — the British pound , the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen .
Indeed , for the euro , pound and yen , the random walk has smaller prediction errors than forward rates ( Table 1 ) . [ 4 ]
Table 1 Forward Rate Forecast vs. Random Walk
( Mean Squared Prediction Errors ) Euro British pound Canadian dollar Japanese yen Forward rate 2.143 % 2.044 % 2.029 % 2.112 % Random walk 2.138 % 2.023 % 2.040 % 2.102 % Ratio 100.23 % 101.03 % 99.45 % 100.50 % NOTES : Ratios are calculated using the mean squared prediction errors of forward exchange rates and the random walk .
If the ratio is greater than 100 percent , the random walk is more accurate than forward rates in predicting exchange rates .
Economists have offered several reasons for the inability to find clear links between exchange rates and economic fundamentals , starting with the inherent limitations of economic models .
A typical model relies on coefficients that specify the relationship between exchange rates and fundamentals .
Estimates of these parameters are based on historical data , but their predictive power stems from their ability to determine currency values from new data or projections ( see box ) .
In their disconnect - puzzle paper , Meese and Rogoff conjecture that these parameters may vary over time .
They note that monetary and other policies in many countries have been in flux since the early 1970s , when the fixed exchange rate regimes of the Bretton Woods system collapsed .
Model misspecification could also be a factor in the exchange rate disconnect puzzle .
[ 5 ]
If the coefficient values are skewed from their true values , forecasts based on these “ wrong ” parameters can be more off base than those generated by a random walk .
In addition to being difficult to forecast , exchange rates are far more volatile than the economic fundamentals that supposedly determine them .
Over a 30 - year period , for example , swings in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound have been far wider than the countries ’ differences in output and inflation ( Chart 3 ) .
The high volatility of exchange rates relative to economic fundamentals is very difficult to replicate in a model without introducing arbitrary disturbances .
The fact that standard , fundamentals - based models can’t outperform a random walk casts serious doubt on their ability to explain exchange rate fluctuations .
The random walk itself does a mediocre job predicting exchange rate movements .
It ’s surprising we can’t find some economic variables to help us beat this poor predictor .
Beyond the Disconnect
Researchers have been probing the relationship between economic fundamentals and exchange rates since Meese and Rogoff first posed the disconnect puzzle .
Various combinations of economic variables and econometric methods have been tried in an attempt to predict exchange rates .
[ 6 ]
These models have n’t wholly disproved the idea of a disconnect , but they ’ve found evidence that economic fundamentals matter — at least under some conditions .
For example , longer time frames improve predictability in standard exchange rate models . [ 7 ]
Models that rely on the money supply , real incomes and other fundamentals do a better job tracking the dollar ’s movements against the deutsche mark over eight or 12 quarters than one quarter ( Chart 4 ) .
With the longer horizons , fundamentals can outperform a random walk at forecasting long - term changes in exchange rates .
The practical value of these results is limited , however , because of the short - term nature of many decisions affected by currency values .
Introducing the possibility of monetary policy feedback can also improve predictability .
Some central banks take exchange rates into account when setting short - term interest rates .
Models that incorporate this feedback from currency values to interest rates can replicate exchange rate data relatively well .
One of them looks at the deutsche mark–dollar exchange rate from 1979 through 1998 ( Chart 5 ) . [ 8 ]
Evidence suggests that models incorporating central bank actions can beat a random walk in forecasting exchange rates . [ 9 ]
By extending time horizons and introducing central bank actions , researchers have shown links between economic fundamentals and exchange rates .
They have n’t , however , overturned the pivotal Meese and Rogoff finding that economic fundamentals can’t predict exchange rates where it really counts — in the short term .
A recent , comprehensive study concluded , “ No model consistently outperforms a random walk … .
Overall , model / specification / currency combinations that work well in one period will not necessarily work well in another period . ” [ 10 ]
Given the empirical results , should we decide that exchange rates are not determined by economic fundamentals ?
Probably not .
Admittedly , currency values are difficult to predict , and economic fundamentals offer little help .
But that does n’t necessarily mean that exchange rates are mainly driven by irrational noise .
There are reasons economic fundamentals are n’t very helpful in forecasting exchange rates , even if currency values are determined by these fundamentals .
Currencies as Assets
Expectations are at the heart of recent explorations of the exchange rate disconnect .
Economists incorporate expectations into an economic model using an asset - pricing approach .
In such models , current data receive far less weight than future factors in determining prices for long - lasting financial assets .
For instance , recent dividends are a minor consideration when people buy stocks .
More weight is given to expected future dividends and capital gains .
In asset - pricing exchange rate models , currency values are determined not only by current fundamentals but also by expectations of what the fundamentals will be in the future . [ 11 ]
Current fundamentals receive very little weight in determining the exchange rate .
Not surprisingly , they are n’t useful in forecasting currency values , and the exchange rate approximately follows a random walk .
Under certain conditions , the asset - pricing approach can explain the greater predictability of exchange rates as time horizons lengthen . [ 12 ]
Some fundamentals may behave like “ noise ” that drives exchange rates away from their long - run levels in the short term .
As time passes , exchange rates gradually move back to their long - run levels , exhibiting long - horizon predictability .
The short - term noise may be related to fundamentals that are n’t observable — for instance , the risk premium for holding a currency .
Calculating the premium from survey data reveals that it has no long - run effect on exchange rate movements .
In other words , it is stationary .
In the short run , the premium can push exchange rates away from their long - run levels .
However , they gradually move back over time .
In this case , exchange rates can be predicted in the long run but not in the short run .
While the asset - pricing approach does n’t allow us to predict short - term exchange rates , it does lead to an interesting implication : Exchange rates should help forecast economic fundamentals .
If the exchange rate is determined by expected future fundamentals , today ’s currency values should yield information about tomorrow ’s fundamentals .
Empirical evidence supports this prediction , although it ’s not uniformly strong .
One study , for example , looks at exchange rates in Australia , Canada , Chile , New Zealand and South Africa — all countries where commodities account for a large portion of exports . [ 13 ]
After allowing for parameter instability , the study finds that exchange rates help predict an economic fundamental — in this case , world commodity prices .
The asset - pricing approach gains further support from research that compares currency markets to other financial markets .
One study , for example , examines opportunities arising from the carry trade — a term for borrowing in low interest rate currencies while lending in high interest rate ones .
The return is positive if exchange rates do n’t move to offset gains from the rate differential .
The results show excess returns are only compensation for the risks investors undertake in the carry trade , suggesting that in some ways exchange rates behave like other assets . [ 14 ]
The asset - pricing approach shows promise , but empirical work has n’t yet solved the exchange rate puzzle Rogoff and Meese introduced more than a quarter century ago .
Economic models still do a poor job forecasting short - term exchange rates .
This issue has become more pressing .
Globalization has made economies more integrated than ever , making exchange rates increasingly important for both businesses and policymakers .
Making wise decisions when conducting international business and economic policies requires a better understanding and modeling of exchange rates .

Currencies experiencing hyperinflation will depreciate against currencies with more stable prices .

So the value of currencies in these countries has negligible effects on international commodity prices .

But will it be enough ?
Former presidential candidate Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) has never been shy about his passion for hunting .
But he found himself the object of some friendly ribbing in yesterdayâs Washington Post for his most recent hunting plan :
Hunter recently wrote the U.S. Embassy in Chad saying he planned to take a hunting safari there -- part of an effort , he explained , to save refugees .
Hunter wrote that he would begin his trip to Chad with an expedition to hunt wildebeest , after which he would cure the meat and distribute it to hungry Sudanese refugees living in Chad .
The State Department issued a tepid response to Hunterâs request .
Among the problems it pointed out : " Wildebeest are not present in Chad . "
Despite the State Departmentâs assurance that he would be more than welcome to assist in a more typically scheduled aid distribution , Hunter scrapped his trip and is now looking into Kenya or Tanzania , which have fewer Sudanese refugees than Chad , but far more wildebeest .
Hunter has something of a history of creative hunting projects .
Hunter represents Californiaâs 52nd District , which covers part of San Diego County and lies inland from Channel Islands National Park .
The park is crisscrossed with endemic wildlife , such as the endangered island fox .
But those species have been under threat for years from a non-native deer population , which the National Park Service had planned to eradicate until 2005 , when Duncan Hunter stepped in .
Hunter , who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee at the time , included language in the 2006 defense bill that would have allowed the Channel Islandâs second largest island , Santa Rosa , to be used as a private game preserve available to disabled veterans and guests of the Pentagon .
When criticism of the policy arose , Hunterâs spokesman told the Los Angeles Times , " This is disappointing news , when considering this proposal was solely intended to benefit our nation 's wounded and disabled service personnel . "
The problem was interested disabled vets , much like the wildebeest , were nowhere to be found .
Paralyzed Veterans of America declared the plan " not viable " after visiting Santa Rosa and concluding the mountainous terrain wouldnât work for hunters in wheelchairs .
Hunterâs Santa Rosa plan , which his press secretary , Joe Kasper , told us " reflected Congressman Hunterâs passion for the outdoors and his interest in supporting our wounded vets , " was finally reversed in the 2008 Defense Authorization bill , ending veterans ' chances to have what Kasper called " the experience of a lifetime . "
As for Hunterâs short - circuited Chadian adventure , Kasper said , " Hunting game that could be distributed to refugees -- if allowed -- would be one part of the privately funded trip . "
He added , " At this point , nothing has been finalized . "
It ’s troubling that the NY TImes can’t find a more worthy columnist than Nixon speech writer , intelligent design proponent , game show host , pro-life activist , and commercial pitchman Ben Stein .
In this Sunday ’s column , after noting that the gargantuan oil supply we currently enjoy is largely being wasted , he concludes we should * increase * subsidies for oil producers , maximize offshore drilling domestically , and step up environmentally disastrous conversion of coal and tar sands to gasoline .
Hopefully we listen to our engineers and not our idiots .

The process of writing large parallel programs is complicated by the need to specify both the parallel behaviour of the program and the algorithm that is to be used to compute its result .
This paper introduces evaluation strategies , lazy higher - order functions that control the parallel evaluation of non-strict functional languages .
Using evaluation strategies , it is possible to achieve a clean separation between algorithmic and behavioural code .
The result is enhanced clarity and shorter parallel programs .
Evaluation strategies are a very general concept : this paper shows how they can be used to model a wide range of commonly used programming paradigms , including divide - and - conquer , pipeline parallelism , producer / consumer parallelism , and data - oriented parallelism .
Because they are based on unrestricted higher - order functions , they can also capture irregular parallel structures .
Evaluation strategies are not just of theoretical interest : they have evolved out of our experience in parallelising several large - scale parallel applications , where they have proved invaluable in helping to manage the complexities of parallel behaviour .
Some of these applications are described in detail here .
The largest application we have studied to date , Lolita , is a 60,000 line natural language engineering system .
Initial results show that for these programs we can achieve acceptable parallel performance , for relatively little programming effort .
Global warming climate change is happening .x
A major cause of it is the burning of fossil fuels .
The effects of it will be severe and damaging .
We are already seeing some effects in extreme weather events , melting glaciers and rising seas .
Those are the facts .
But ExxonMobil did not like the facts , and funded a propaganda campaign to combat them . x
“ Victory will be achieved when recognition of uncertainty becomes part of the ‘ conventional wisdom , ’ ” said a 1998 American Petroleum Institute memo about the budding propaganda campaign .x
From what I ’ve been hearing , it seems ExxonMobil got its “ victory ” .
For example , one of my colleagues thought global warming is a political plot to advance world government .
But that would mean that the best scientific organizations and journals in the world are in on the plot .x
More likely , my colleague was wearing a very shiny tinfoil hat .
In another case , a friend of mine thinks the fact of Vikings farming in Greenland 1000 years ago proves a natural warm phase , warmer than the present .
But the Viking settlement shows little about worldwide temperature and much about human tenacity .x
The Vikings had sparse farms with skinny animals , and used up more and more of the land over the course of two centuries before the last of them starved during a bad winter .
Another friend of mine gave me a copy of the documentary “ The Great Global Warming Swindle ” and said it was a BBC production .
It turns out the video is not a BBC production , but a propaganda piece full of already debunked global warming denier arguments .x
I found the answers to these arguments from the website RC Wiki — an index to debunkings of such nonsense that appears in the popular media .

Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years .
The global increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to fossil fuel use and land use change , while those of methane and nitrous oxide are primarily due to agriculture .
~~~
The understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling infl uences on climate has improved since the TAR , leading to very high confidence7 that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming , with a radiative forcing of +1.6 [ +0.6 to + 2.4 ]
Watts per square meter .
~~~
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice , and rising global average sea level .
~~~
At continental , regional and ocean basin scales , numerous long - term changes in climate have been observed .
These include changes in arctic temperatures and ice , widespread changes in precipitation amounts , ocean salinity , wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather including droughts , heavy precipitation , heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones .
~~~
There is now higher confidence in projected patterns of warming and other regional - scale features , including changes in wind patterns , precipitation and some aspects of extremes and of ice .
ExxonMobil has pumped more than $ 8 million [ from 2000 to 2003 ] into more than 40 think tanks ; media outlets ; and consumer , religious , and even civil rights groups that preach skepticism about the oncoming climate catastrophe .
Here is a list of organizations that accept anthropogenic global warming as real and scientifically well - supported :
First , Greenland is part of a single region .
It can not be necessarily taken to represent a global climate shift .
See the post on the Medieval Warm Period for a global perspective on this time period .
Briefly , the available proxy evidence indicates that global warmth during this period was not particularly pronounced , though some regions may have experienced greater warming than others .
…
Instead of hunting whales in kayaks , [ the Vikings ] farmed cattle , goats , and sheep — despite having to keep them in a barn 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , for a full 5 months out of the year .
It was a constant challenge to get enough fodder for the winter .
Starvation of the animals was frequent , emaciation routine .
Grazing requirements and growing fodder for the winter led to over - production of pastures , erosion , and the need to go further and further afield to sustain the animals .
Deforestation for pastures and firewood proceeded at unsustainable rates .
After a couple of centuries , it led to such desperate measures as cutting precious sod for housing construction and even burning it for cooking and heating fuel .
When finally confronted with several severe winters in a row , they , along with the little remaining livestock , simply starved before spring arrived .
On Thursday March 8th [ 2007 ] , the UK TV Channel 4 aired a programme titled “ The Great Global Warming Swindle ” .
We were hoping for important revelations and final proof that we have all been hornswoggled by the climate Illuminati , but it just repeated the usual specious claims we hear all the time .

THOUGH wine tastings seem to have become less pretentious in recent years , it ’s still rare to hear a top varietal compared to Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal .
But at coffee tastings  known to aficionados as cuppings  there is no prescribed lexicon , and a lot more room for whimsy .
One Monday night at Joe , a West Village cafe , a group of coffee enthusiasts crowded around Erin Meister , a barista , as if they were graduate students and she were a professor .
The eight New Yorkers , who had paid $ 20 apiece to taste three coffees , each from a different country , listened intently .
They sniffed and slurped .
Then came the tricky part : finding the mot juste to describe the flavors .
“ I thought the Kenya had hints of curry and cedar , ” began Ms. Meister , 26 , who is also a copy editor and the writer of a coffee blog called Meet the Press Pot ( meetthepresspot.blogspot.com ) .
“ I tasted nuts and bark in the Guatemalan , ” said Katsu Tanaka , 50 , who plans to open a coffee shop in Japan .
“ And basil and jasmine in the Sumatra . ” A hush fell over the room ; perhaps the others were intimidated by Mr. Tanaka ’s sophisticated palate .
Bikini Waxing for Tweens !
Have Spas Gone Too Far ?
Some spas offer facials and chemical treatment to young girls .
May 19 , 2008  --
The simple mother - daughter stress - reducing day at the spa — complete with perfect manicures and pedicures — has morphed into a full - fledged booming beauty business .
Some spas now are giving their tween clients resort - type treatments and pint - size pampering .
The offerings go beyond the typical painted nails .
Catering to a kid's every possible desire , some spas have stepped up their tween care by offering hair highlights , microdermabrasion and bikini waxes for girls as young as 11 and 12 .
" I feel it 's part of hygiene .
When it 's appropriate and they need to , they 'll be doing it , " said Kelly Burrus , mother of 11 - year - old Bella Burrus .
Spas like Simon Says in Skokie , Ill. , as well as Sothy 's and Salon Ouidad , which are both in New York City , have seen an increase in the number of younger clients coming in to attain that polished look .
" We do a coconut and lemon facial .
We have seasonal facials that we offer to the tween market , " said Trena Ross , Sothy 's director .
All of the primping and pampering equal big bucks for the salons .
A surprising 20 percent of Ouidad 's clientele comes from the tween market .
" I have 9 - year - olds coming in for chemical treatments , " said salon owner Ouidad , who only uses one name .
" I have [ children ] as young as 6 and 7 [ come into the salon ] .
They do a chemical treatment . "
The Search for the Perfect Polished Look
The young girls after Hollywood style admittedly take their cues from shows like " Gossip Girl " and tween sensation Miley Cyrus of the uber - popular television show " Hannah Montana . "
The fans pick up on even the most subtle differences in their idols ' appearances .
" When I saw her first episode of ' Hannah Montana ' her eyebrows were n't the same way as they are now when I see her in pictures .
I like how it 's much cleaner and thinner now because it makes her look more mature , " said 11 - year - old Danielle Gallagher .
Ouidad said it 's clear " moms are under a lot of pressure " to make sure their girls look their best .
But the tweens seeking the grown - up treatments clearly are under peer pressure too .
" I do feel a lot of pressure .
It 's very nerve - wracking .
Everyone is like , ' Your hair is messy . '
Or , ' You look ugly , ' " said 11 - year - old Evelyn O'Byrne .
" Sometimes I feel sad . "
The fifth - grader added that having her hair done at a salon gives her confidence .
Fellow salon - goers Danielle and Bella said the spa treatments make them feel good about themselves too .
Danielle said perfectly plucked eyebrows are the must - have accessory for her first dance and Bella said facials help her unwind .

But at least one critic believes the kiddie spas are too much too soon .
Combined with the shrinking clothes popular with many youths today , it can contribute to tweens ' sexualization and loss of self - confidence , said Roni Cohen - Sandler , author of " Stressed Out Girls . "
" By focusing so much on their appearance , kids today are being asked today to grow up so much sooner than they should be , " Cohen - Sandler said .
" The earlier that girls begin to see themselves as objects that are appealing to the opposite sex and worry about how they look — that is harming them psychologically .
They 're not able to feel good about themselves . "
Cohen - Sandler said glossy , photo - shopped Tinseltown images are only partially to blame .
Often the girls are taking cues from their mothers .
" I hear girls tell me that boys are giving them ratings .
' You 're a two .
You 're an eight . '
So if they also have mothers who are very focused on their looks by saying they need facials , that 's reinforcing that message that their looks are very important and mothers need to de-emphasize that , " Cohen - Sandler said .
The author advised mothers to treat spa days as a luxury and enjoy the time bonding with their daughters .
" Mother needs to be very mindful of the messages she 's giving her daughter , " Cohen - Sandler said .
" If she 's telling her daughter , ' This is something we need routinely , ' that 's a message that will be harmful . "
But some mothers insist mom does know best when it comes to learning about proper skin -care habits .
" I do all these types of things myself and I think they 're better off starting young , " Kelly Burrus said .
" It will teach them to take care of themselves and have pride . "
WINNIPEG–The Manitoba government has seized two young children from a Winnipeg home based on concerns their father – an alleged neo - Nazi – was filling their heads and marking their bodies with messages of hate .
The government agency is now seeking a permanent order of guardianship based on ongoing concerns about the safety of the 7 - year - old girl and 2 - year - old boy .
A Court of Queen 's Bench case is ongoing , with the next hearing set for today .
" The children may be at risk due to the parents ' behaviour and associates .
The parents might endanger the emotional well - being of the children , " Child and Family Services wrote in court documents obtained by the Winnipeg Free Press .
Winnipeg police confirmed their involvement in the case , which came to a head in late March when school officials raised concerns about the little girl .
A source told the newspaper the girl showed up one morning in class with writing on her body , including a swastika and a common white supremacist symbol " 14/88 " .
The number 14 refers to a slogan containing 14 words – " We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children " , while 88 represents the letters HH ( the eighth in the alphabet ) to mean " Heil Hitler . "
Const .
Pat Chabidon confirmed the father was recently interviewed based on allegations he was involved in " hate crimes involving children . "
Police had questioned him regarding similar concerns in 2005 , he said .
No criminal charges have been laid , but police turned the file over to CFS , Chabidon said .
The mother of the children is also named in the CFS application as being unfit to parent , based on her relationship with her husband .
He is the biological father of the young boy and the stepfather of the girl .
" There are also concerns about parental drug and alcohol use in the home , " CFS wrote .
The couple could n't be reached for comment , and their lawyer did n't return phone messages .
They have not yet filed any affidavits outlining their position .
A judge recently ordered a psychological report on the father as part of the ongoing case .

From the air , this 3.7 - million - acre national park in northeastern Bolivia seems a vast carpet of lush timberland , cloaking jaguars , howler monkeys , and giant anteaters beneath .
Outside the tiny window of a three - seat plane , the terrain rises from rainforest to flooded savannah .
There is not a person in sight .
But in the distance is a trail of lighter , younger canopy the width of a road , a remnant from when logging paths carved this forest into pieces .
That was before The Nature Conser­vancy , its Bolivian partner Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza ( FAN ) , the Bolivian government , and three international energy companies devised a plan to protect 1.5 million acres threatened with deforestation and degradation .
The idea was simple :
This national park in the Amazon basin , perhaps the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ’s “ The Lost World , ” would do its part to fight climate change .
It is perhaps the best current example of how poor countries and rich countries can come together in the fight against climate change .
It is a model of research and monitoring ; it ’s a lesson in the benefit of involving the central government ; and it ’s a cautionary tale about the need to include the local community as a full partner .
The Noel Kempff Climate Action Project is a prime global case study .
As negotiators work this week and next in Bonn to craft a new climate agreement to take effect in 2013 , a consensus has emerged on the crucial role forest protection plays in re­ducing greenhouse - gas emissions , and en­­vironmentalists are looking at an international carbon - trading model as an incentive to save forests .
It is called REDD : Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation .
Now countries are looking to devise two - year pilot projects , in which rich nations pay poorer ones to conserve their forests .
Not everyone agrees this mechanism is valid , mainly because its track record is so short .
But here in Bolivia , a REDD program that ’s been under way for more than a decade has lessons for some of the concept ’s more controversial features , including measurement impediments , the role that indigenous communities should play , and the support required from national governments .
Today the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project is the largest of its kind and the only one in the world to be independently verified : “ Noel Kempff is the first project in the world that comprehensively included every type of deforestation and degradation in a full - blown carbon accounting scheme , ” says Joerg Seifert - Granzin , head of the environmental services unit of FAN in Bolivia .
“ It was meant to stimulate scientific development , ” Mr. Seifert - Granzin says .
But as REDD has become central to the debate on how to bring developing countries into a new global climate treaty , “ people realize that there is an amazing experience in this project on how to deal with carbon accounting , how to generate benefits for biodiversity preservation , and how to generate benefits for sustainable development of indigenous communities . ”
Environmentalists were wary of REDD
In December in Bali , Indonesia , at a United Nations conference on climate change , world leaders agreed to establish a timeline and road map for future negotiations .
There , the World Bank announced it will use $ 100 million to help 20 nations prepare projects for their eventual participation in REDD systems .
Environmentalists did n’t always like REDD .
Many criticized the concept as an easy way out for polluters .
And the principle behind it – getting credit for what existing forests already are doing – was rejected as a ploy that developed nations could use to say that they were meeting emissions targets under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
But REDD is now seen as a leading solution to deforestation , which accounts for 20 percent of the world ’s annual greenhouse - gas emissions – more than the transportation sector , according to the Center for International Forestry Research ( CIFOR ) .
Only a handful of REDD projects exist , including those in Belize , Costa Rica , Brazil , and Madagascar , says Zoe Kant , manager of carbon finance for The Nature Conservancy .
Indonesia has designed project - based approaches that are not yet operating ; Papua New Guinea is developing a national REDD scheme .
In Bolivia , the idea has been tested at the widest scale :
The project bought out four timber concessions , nearly doubled the national park ’s boundaries , and set up a carbon - monitoring system by which offsets are awarded to three participating energy companies ( American Electric Power , BP , and PacifiCorp . ) and the Bolivian government – offsets that could be traded on the voluntary carbon - trading market , and ( in the case of the Bolivian government ) the money reinvested in the communities affected .
In 2005 , the park became the first forest emissions - reduction project to be verified by a third party .
The British firm SGS , using international standards developed under the Kyoto Protocol , showed that between 1997 and 2005 the project kept more than 1 million metric tons of CO2 from being released into the air .
Skeptics of REDD question whether reducing emissions in one area just shirt polluters to another – called “ leakage ” – negating any benefit .
This is especially true for REDD schemes that are project - based , like that of Noel Kempff , instead of those carried out at a national level .
Here , this Massachusetts - size forest of mahogany and oak seems limitless .
But its boundaries do end – at forests where logging is allowed .
So the project studied the market influence nationwide of having bought out timber concessions here , for $ 1.6 million .
Their results found a 16 percent leakage rate .
Determining leakage was n’t easy .
Diane Fitzgerald , managing director for governmental and environmental affairs for American Electric Power , says that some environmental groups initially had concerns about REDD because they doubted how well benefits could be monitored .
“ Noel Kempff has shown that you can develop the technology , ” she says .
“ That project was the proving ground for remote sensing and monitoring . ”
Villagers ’ livelihoods rebound
Science is one concern in REDD schemes , but the role of indigenous communities and forest peoples must be central , leaders agree .
In April , representatives of rain - forest peoples across Latin America met in Manaus , Brazil , to demand a greater say in REDD schemes .
Peter Cronkleton , a scientist in Bolivia with CIFOR , says that REDD could boost such communities , since , for example , it should clarify land rights .
“ There is a lot of potential in REDD schemes for involving local people , which could have a [ positive ] impact on poverty , ” he says .
Stretching across a grassy field along the banks of the Paragua River , the community of Florida consists of 30 - some families living in thatched - roof homes .
The 150 residents are among the most affected by the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project .
Their livelihoods , directly and indirectly , revolved around the logging that was banned when the project was put in place .
At that time , most in the community rejected it .
“ It was a sudden slump , ” says Manuel Arias , Florida ’s cacique , or tribal leader , as he walks through a wooded path to the river ’s edge .
The community has rebounded with ecotourism and microcredit enterprises – ranging from chicken farms to rustic bakeries – supported by the project .
A hotel with neat , wood - plank floors and screened windows is open to visitors , who arrive via private plane or by taking an arduous 12 - hour ride down a dirt road .
Villagers trained as tour guides take visitors into the park , where they might visit the Arco Iris Waterfall that pours over the Huanchaca Plateau – a sight that must have been , if anything was , the paradise described in “ The Lost World . ”
Villagers have running water and electricity now .
But the logging trucks that provided transportation to the nearest city , 300 miles away , are gone .
Mr. Arias says that , to some , life has improved .
For others , life will never be as good .
Most significantly , residents were not treated as partners in the process .
None of the 1,000 people living in the seven communities around the park sits on the project ’s board of directors .
As a consequence , says FAN ’s Seifert - Granzin , the community still has n’t received payment from the 2005 verification process : a one - time payment of $ 400,000 , based on the price of carbon offsets sold on the voluntary market , and about $ 150,000 annually from 2006 onward .
Promised cash has yet to appear
The money has n’t arrived yet because the Bolivian government – a full partner in the project with a right to 49 percent of the carbon offsets – has yet to cash in its shares .
Staff turnover , political uncertainty , and structural changes have also affected the project , leaders say .
Detractors of REDD question the ability of a developing country to oversee a multimillion - dollar project , given corruption and a weak legal system .
Above all , says Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , the former environment minister of Costa Rica ( he now works for Conservation International ) , nations need to demonstrate “ good environment governance . ”
As countries move forward , with lessons learned from one another , some wonder whether , inadvertently , the scheme rewards the wrong people .
Mr. Cronkleton says some at CIFOR argue that the ranchers or loggers are the ones who will reap the benefits , because they are the ones destroying the forest .
But rubber tappers and brazil - nut gatherers , who eke out a subsistence living and have a clear stake in preserving the forest , will be left out of a payment scheme .
Here at Noel Kempff , the program also has an unintended benefit :
The economics of the scheme , if plotted on a chart , might be a wash , says Arias .
But a sense of environmental responsibility , of the need to preserve the forest , the river , and the creatures that inhabit both , has blossomed where it never was before .
“ We never had a culture of conservation , ” says Arias , looking out at the Paragua River , his nephew playing in the grass at his feet .
“ I feel proud to be a part of this . ”
FOR several years I had a problem unusual among Internet geeks : I had too much success with women .
I used the Internet as a means of communication with women I had already met offline in order to overcome my social awkwardness and forge romantic relationships .
Sounds healthy ?
It was n’t .
It started in my sophomore year in high school .
I went to one of those big Eastern public schools that pumps out students in a way that would make 19th - century industrialists throw their top hats into the air and shout “ Huzzah ! ”
Even we students thought of ourselves as a faceless mob of subproletarians waiting for the next episode of “ American Idol ” to take away the pain of our meaningless existence .
I was at the bottom of the barrel : a plump , silent , painfully awkward dweeb who clung to his Latin textbook as if it held the secrets to existence .
The only good thing that happened to me that year was meeting Chelsea .
We talked for maybe 5 minutes about video games between classes , and of that time I spent 4 minutes and 59 seconds dripping in nervous sweat and trying to swallow my stutter .
Whenever I tried to say something charming , my sentence drooped off with an invisible ellipsis .
My words of wit fell flat , and my skillful cultural allusions deteriorated into a stream of loosely associated quotations from “ Star Trek . ”
Pythonはその起源からすると関数型言語ではない。しかし、functoolsライブラリを利用することで、関数型言語のスタイルでプログラムを記述できるようになる。関数型のコードを記述するために重要なツールの一つとして、functoolsモジュールでも利用可能な「関数の部分適用」がある。
部分適用とは、ある関数への複数の入力のうち一つを定数値にバインドし、残りの入力のみを受け取る新しい関数を作成することである。バインドされた入力は、新しく作成された関数が呼び出される際にはいつも同じ値になる。以下に、functoolsモジュールを用いた部分関数の簡単な使用例を紹介しよう。なお、この例ではoperatorモジュールのadd関数も使用している。このadd関数は「+」演算子と同様の働きをするものの、関数であるためオブジェクトとしても扱うことが可能だ。
>>> from functools import * >>> from operator import * >>> add ( 1,2 ) 3 >>> add1 = partial ( add , 1 ) >>> add1(2) 3 >>> add 1( 10 ) 11
partial関数はいわゆる高階関数であり、入力として関数を一つ受け取る（高階関数には、ほかにmap関数やfilter関数がある）。ただし、ほかの関数とは異なって、partial関数は戻り値としても関数を返す。このとき返されるのは、ほかの関数と同様にプログラム内で使用可能な関数だ。add1関数は、引数を一つ受け取るほかの関数とまったく同様に利用することが可能なのである。呼び出しはもちろん、以下のようにmap関数の引数として使用したり、もう一度部分適用することすら可能なのだ。
>>> map( add1 , [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ) [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] >>> five = partial ( add1 , 4 ) >>> five ( ) 5
partial関数はオブジェクトのメソッドに対して使用することも可能である。たとえば、以下の例ではデフォルトの文字列を持ったリストを生成するためにpartial関数を使用している。
>>> standard = " User N " >>> usern = partial ( standard .replace , " N " ) >>> usern ( " 1 " ) ' User 1 ' >>> usern ( " 1202 " ) ' User 1202 '

The impact struck the northern half of the Red Planet
The puzzle of why the northern and southern hemispheres of Mars look so different may now have been solved .
Mars ' crust is thicker in the southern hemisphere , and magnetic anomalies are found in the south but not the north .
New studies in Nature magazine suggest that a massive space rock smashing into the planet could have created an abrupt disparity between the two halves .
This asteroid would have been close to the size of Earth 's moon and hit Mars ' northern regions , scientists say .
According to one group of researchers , the rock struck with an energy equivalent to a quadrillion atomic bombs like the one dropped on Nagasaki in 1945 .
Mars ' northern hemisphere is an enormous lowland basin which might once have held a mighty ocean .
It 's a very old idea , but nobody had done the numerical calculations
Francis Nimmo , UCSC
The southern hemisphere , on the other hand , comprises rugged , crater - pitted highlands with an altitude up to 8,000 m ( 26,000 ft ) greater than the north .
The new research suggests
Mars bears the largest impact scar known anywhere in the Solar System .
It challenges an alternative theory which proposes that the " two faces " of Mars are the result of enormous volcanic disruption 3.8 billion years ago .
Deep impact
The scientists on the latest work used data from two Mars - orbiting spacecraft : Reconnaissance Orbiter and Global Surveyor .
Researchers led by Francis Nimmo at the University of California , Santa Cruz , US , carried out computer simulations to show that an impact with particular conditions could produce the present - day appearance of Mars .
These conditions indicate a space rock about one - half to two - thirds the size of Earth 's Moon , striking the Red Planet at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees .
This would have produced an elliptical crater .
" It 's a very old idea , but nobody had done the numerical calculations to see what would happen when a big asteroid hits Mars , " said the associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC .
Elevations in the Martian south are higher than in the north
The team 's findings are corroborated by another study in Nature led by Oded Aharonson , associate professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , also US .
" The dichotomy is arguably the oldest feature on Mars , " Dr Aharonson explained .
The feature arose more than four billion years ago , before the rest of the planet 's complex geological history was superimposed . "
This was about the same time that a much bigger object slammed into the Earth , throwing material into orbit around our infant planet .
This material is thought to have coalesced to form the Moon .
Indeed , the coincidence in timing of the formation of our Moon and the Mars dichotomy is probably not coincidental at all .
Tail end " It happened probably right at the end of the formation of the four terrestrial planets - Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars , " said Craig Agnor , a co-author on the Francis Nimmo study .
He told BBC News : " We think the planets formed out of a disc of rocks .
As the rocks collide , you get bigger rocks and so on .
Eventually , you end up with four planets and a lot of rocks - of various sizes .
" In terms of the process of the planets sweeping up the last bits of debris , this could have been one of the last big bits of debris . "
Shock waves from the impact would travel through the planet and disrupt the crust on the other side , causing changes in the magnetic field recorded there .
The predicted changes are consistent with observations of magnetic anomalies in the southern hemisphere , according to Dr Nimmo .
In a third study published in Nature , Jeffrey Andrews - Hanna and Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Cambridge , and Bruce Banerdt of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in California , provide impact evidence from gravitational and topographical signatures on Mars .

In today 's edition of Boing Boing tv , music legend David Byrne transforms an entire NYC building into a giant musical instrument , and Xeni joins him inside for a BBtv tour .
Playing the Building is Byrne 's latest sonic innovation , and morphs the century - old Battery Maritime Building into a clanging , vibrating sound sculpture .
In this installation , the former Talking Heads co-founder blurs the boundaries between the creators and consumers of culture .
He explains :
Devices [ have been ] attached to the building 's structure – to the metal beams and pillars , the heating pipes , the water pipes – and are used to make these things produce sound .
The activations are of three types : wind , vibration , striking .
The devices cause the building elements to vibrate , resonate and oscillate so that the building itself becomes a very large musical instrument .
Byrne sees music as deeply embedded within the natural sounds that surround us every day , and believes " anyone can be a writer , artist , or musician if they want to . "
Playing the Building continues through August 10 , 2008 at 10 South Street , New York , NY ; open every Friday through Sunday , noon – 6 pm .
Admission is free of charge .

In the early 1990s , the Southern Baptist Church of Alabama produced the first mathematics - driven estimates of how many people are going to hell .
The estimates were a practical tool , a guide for where to concentrate the church 's evangelical efforts and where not to bother .
Any well - run modern business does this .
A company that sells insurance or cereal or cars likes to let its sales force know how many dependable customers are in each region , how many potential new customers , and also how many marginal prospects - people not worth wasting time on .
With this information , the sales force can focus its efforts productively .
So it is with the Southern Baptist Church of Alabama .
The church assumes that in a given neighbourhood , nearly all the Southern Baptists are already saved ( they also assume that , people being people , a certain small percentage are damned idiots ) .
Other Baptist and evangelical denominations are a mixed lot - some are still savable , others have irrevocably blown it .
Most , but not all , Catholics are a lost cause .
Non-Christians - Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Confucians , atheists and others who refuse to accept Jesus - can be written off , evangelically speaking .
The Southern Baptist Convention 's Home Mission Board did all the work on this .
It devised a secret mathematical formula , estimating what percentage of each religious group will go to hell : X % of Southern Baptists , Y % of Episcopalians , Z % of Catholics , and so on .
The Home Mission Board puts great faith in these percentages .
It was easy to find out how many people of each faith live in each Alabama county .
A group called the Glenmary Home Missioners Board , in Ohio , periodically publishes a massive county - by - county survey of the entire US .
The Southern Baptist Convention fed the 1990 survey numbers into its formula .
The numbers that popped out are collectively called the evangelistic index .
The evangelistic index was not meant to be celebrated .
Like any sales estimate , it was prepared for the organisation 's internal use .
But someone gave parts of it to Greg Garrison , a reporter for the Birmingham News , and the newspaper published a page one article revealing that : " More than 1.86 million people in Alabama , 46.1 % of the state 's population , will be damned to hell if they do n't have a born - again experience professing Jesus Christ as their savior , according to a report by Southern Baptist researchers . "
The Birmingham News suggested this was just the half of it .
But , actually , this was just the 1/50th of it .
The Southern Baptist Church of Alabama made estimates of how many people are going to hell in every county in all 50 of the American states .
The countrywide figures have never been made public .
But using the Alabama data as a guide , anyone can calculate the algorithm that produced them .
And once you have that , you can apply it to population figures for the other 49 American states - and to almost any region of any country on earth .
Then you 'll know , at least in theory , who 's going to be hot and who 's not .

Hayden Panettiere Hates U.S. Age Limits ....
Heroes actress Hayden Panettiere has criticised the U.S. for imposing strict age limits on teenagers - branding the legal drinking age of 21 as " ridiculous " .
The 18 - year - old star insists she is much happier in Britain where the legal age limit on buying alcohol is 18 and she is able to get served in bars .
Panettiere insists America's age restrictions are old - fashioned and in desperate need of reform .
She says , " I can buy porn or kill someone in war but I can't have a glass of wine .
If I could change one thing about America , it would be its ridiculous age limits on things .
" That 's why I love visiting Britain .
I can walk into a bar and order a drink without having to show my passport .
That 's so cool .
"
In other news the Heroes actress has become the latest star to auction off a date - she 'll take a fan whale watching in return for a hefty charity donation .
The actress will spend a day with the winning bidder and guests on the high seas in August ( 08 ) .
The whale watchers will be joined by marine expert and conservationist Jeff Pantukoff .
The eBay.com auction , which runs from 20 to 30 May ( 08 ) , will benefit The Whaleman Foundation , which is Panettiere 's favourite charity .
Panettiere 's deep love for sealife became clear last year ( 07 ) when she risked her life by joining protestors in the waters off the coast of Taiji , Japan and attempted to stop fishermen from killing dolphins .
Since then , she has further championed the cause by lending her name to the Save The Whales Again !
campaign and heading to Washington D.C. to confront the Japanese , Icelandic and Norwegian embassies about their hunting practices .
The auction is a Save The Whales Again ! venture .

なぜ新書が売れるのか。筆者も近頃ときどき新書を読むが、中身がコンパクトにパッケージとしてまとまっていて、すらすら読めるので驚いてしまう。ハードカバー本にはたいてい、様々な学派の意見を取り入れた相反する記述があり、著者のためらいがあり、蛇足があったりするが、新書はだいたいどれもクリアカットに書かれている。この簡潔さ、手軽さが、新書の醍醐味と言えるだろう。
情報量の拡大と情報のパッケージ化
インターネットの登場以降、私たちをとりまく情報の量は飛躍的に拡大した。1995年から2005年の十年で、情報の流通量が410倍になったという統計もある（平成17年度情報流通センサス、総務省）。しかし私たちの持つ時間の量は変わらない。検索エンジンやらブログやらRSSリーダーやらソーシャルブックマークやら「まとめサイト」やらのおかげで効率的に情報を取得できるようになったかもしれないが、それでも10年前より410倍も効率的になったかは怪しい。つまり私たちは年を追うごとに知らないことが増えてきているということである。もちろん、その中には知らなくていいこともたくさんあるだろう。ただ、このように情報量が増加し続けるようでは、知るべきか知らないでいいか、その判断さえ難しくなってしまう。
そう考えると、このインターネット全盛の時代に、昔ながらの新書が注目を集めたのは必然だったのではないか。新書は「いまこれを知っておくべきでしょう」という情報のパッケージである。難しい話は抜きにして、要はこれだけ知っておきましょうよ、というのが新書だ。情報量が拡大している今日で、そういう指針は心強い。あるいはインターネットでブログが人気を集めているのも同様の理由で、一つ一つの記事が新書同様に情報のパッケージとして機能しているからと説明できる。著名ブロガーの多くが新書を執筆しているのは偶然だろうか。
こうした情報のパッケージ化に異を唱える人は多い。批判には色々なバリエーションがあるが、例えば「新書の情報は一面的すぎる、ちゃんとハードカバー本を、それも何冊も読むべきだ」というような意見があり、同様に「ブログの情報は信頼性が低い、新聞を読むべきだ」という意見があり、「 Wikipediaの記述を信じてはいけない」「そもそも調べものをするなら白書を読むべきだ」「論文を読むべきだ」と続く。確かに人生や仕事に関わることなら、誰が書いたとも分からないブログの情報に踊らされてはいけない。調査業者ならWikipediaで調べたまま、というわけにいかない。しかしそうでなければ、私たちの持つ時間が有限である以上、白書や論文を読んでばかりというわけにはいかない。新書やブログ、テレビやWikipediaで効率的に情報の入手を済ませたいと思うのも当然ではないだろうか。
今北産業の時 代
タイトルに書いた今北産業というのは「2ちゃんねる」に存在する無数のジャーゴンの一つで、なんらかのトピックで盛り上がっている時に遅れてやってきた人が「いま来たところなので、これまでの流れを三行で（短く）教えてください」という意味である。だから盛り上がっているところに「今北産業」と書き込むと、たいてい誰かが三行で（概ね断片的すぎて間違った）流れを教えてくれる。
新書やブログ 、Wikipediaはいますぐ情報をパッケージとして取得したい、という今日のニーズにうまく応えて成長した。まさに「今北産業」である。「今北産業界」は近年急速に拡大し、難しく冗長な説明は受け入れられなくなってきている。こうした流れを批判することは容易だが、これからも情報量が増え続ける以上、流れを食い止めるのは困難である。
今回、筆者が提案したいことは二つある。一つは、情報のパッケージ化をただ批判するのはもうやめようということ。理由は既に書いた通りである。そしてもう一つは、批判をするよりも良質なパッケージを作ろう、ということ。「なぜこんな間違った情報が蔓延しているのか」と思うのであれば、ただ憤るだけでなく、自ら正しいと思う情報をパッケージにして世に出さなければいけない。新書を出版するのは難しいかもしれないが、ブログを始めるのは容易だ。どうせ検索エンジンにもヒットしないし、誰も見てくれない、と思われる方も多いかもしれないが、誰も知らなかったようなブログが一つの冴えた記事から急に有名になる、というのはよくあることである。
新書もブログ もWikipediaのページも、玉石混淆なのは事実である。しかし今後ますます大勢が情報を発信するようになれば、玉が目立つようになるはずだ。それは集合知などではなく、ただ「最後は正論が通る」ようになるということである。そうなった時、私たちは検索一つで本当に正しい情報が手に入る、という世界を手に入れることができる。Wikipediaだって誕生してまだ7年ほどだが、もう10年も経てば「むかしはWikipediaに変な記事がたくさんあったなあ」と笑える日が来るのではないか。情報の良質なパッケージがどんどん増えることで、これから私たちの知識体系というのは大きく変化する。人々の「今北産業」の声に応える今北産業革命の日を、もうしばらく待ちたい。
WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton , who has frequently described herself on the campaign trail as playing a pivotal role in forging a children 's health insurance plan , had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress , according to several lawmakers , staffers , and healthcare advocates involved in the issue .
In campaign speeches , Clinton describes the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP , as an initiative " I helped to start . "
Addressing Iowa voters in November , Clinton said , " in 1997 , I joined forces with members of Congress and we passed the State Children 's Health Insurance Program . "
Clinton regularly cites the number of children in each state who are covered by the program , and mothers of sick children have appeared at Clinton campaign rallies to thank her .
But the Clinton White House , while supportive of the idea of expanding children 's health , fought the first SCHIP effort , spearheaded by Senators Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , because of fears that it would derail a bigger budget bill .
And several current and former lawmakers and staff said Hillary Clinton had no role in helping to write the congressional legislation , which grew out of a similar program approved in Massachusetts in 1996 .
" The White House was n't for it .
We really roughed them up " in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration 's objections , Hatch said in an interview .
" She may have done some advocacy [ privately ] over at the White House , but I 'm not aware of it . "
" I do like her , " Hatch said of Hillary Clinton .
" We all care about children .
But does she deserve credit for SCHIP ?
No - Teddy does , but she does n't . "
Neera Tanden , policy director for the Clinton campaign , said that the senator had " always been pushing for SCHIP " and that the White House had opposed the 1997 Hatch - Kennedy amendment to create the program because President Clinton had made a deal with the then - GOP leadership not to back any amendments to a contentious budget bill .
The SCHIP plan - which provides federal matching grants to help states ' uninsured children - was to be paid for with a hefty tobacco tax , an idea many Republican and tobacco - state lawmakers opposed .
Chris Jennings , who was a Clinton healthcare adviser during her years as the wife of a president , said Clinton had been a longtime and tireless advocate for expanding children 's healthcare , and Jennings was baffled by suggestions that she had not been instrumental in getting the plan approved .
Jennings noted that SCHIP was indeed adopted , in a second attempt , that same year .
" She was very proactive .
At every step of the way , she was always pushing " for the concept of expanding healthcare for children , Jennings said .
Group Also Asks Secret Intelligence Court Not To Exclude Public From Any Proceedings
On New Law's Constitutionality
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union filed a landmark lawsuit today to stop the government from conducting surveillance under a new wiretapping law that gives the Bush administration virtually unchecked power to intercept Americans ' international e-mails and telephone calls .
The case was filed on behalf of a broad coalition of attorneys and human rights , labor , legal and media organizations whose ability to perform their work - which relies on confidential communications - will be greatly compromised by the new law .
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , passed by Congress on Wednesday and signed by President Bush today , not only legalizes the secret warrantless surveillance program the president approved in late 2001 , it gives the government new spying powers , including the power to conduct dragnet surveillance of Americans ' international communications .
" Spying on Americans without warrants or judicial approval is an abuse of government power - and that 's exactly what this law allows .
The ACLU will not sit by and let this evisceration of the Fourth Amendment go unchallenged , " said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero .
" Electronic surveillance must be conducted in a constitutional manner that affords the greatest possible protection for individual privacy and free speech rights .
The new wiretapping law fails to provide fundamental safeguards that the Constitution unambiguously requires . "
In today 's legal challenge , the ACLU argues that the new spying law violates Americans ' rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution .
The new law permits the government to conduct intrusive surveillance without ever telling a court who it intends to spy on , what phone lines and email addresses it intends to monitor , where its surveillance targets are located , why it 's conducting the surveillance or whether it suspects any party to the communication of wrongdoing .
Plaintiffs in today 's case are :
The Nation and its contributing journalists Naomi Klein and Chris Hedges
Amnesty International USA , Global Rights , Global Fund for Women , Human Rights Watch , PEN American Center , Service Employees International Union , Washington Office on Latin America , and the International Criminal Defence Attorneys Association
Defense attorneys Dan Arshack , David Nevin , Scott McKay and Sylvia Royce
" As a journalist , my job requires communication with people in all parts of the world - from Iraq to Argentina .
If the U.S. government is given unchecked surveillance power to monitor reporters ' confidential sources , my ability to do this work will be seriously compromised , " said Naomi Klein , an award - winning columnist and best - selling author who is a plaintiff in today 's lawsuit .
" I cannot in good conscience accept that my conversations with people who live outside the U.S. will put them in harm 's way as a result of overzealous government spying .
Privacy in my communications is not simply an expectation , it 's a right . "
The ACLU 's legal challenge , which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today , seeks a court order declaring that the new law is unconstitutional and ordering its immediate and permanent halt .
In a separate filing , the ACLU asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) to ensure that any proceedings relating to the scope , meaning or constitutionality of the new law be open to the public to the extent possible .
The ACLU also asked the secret court to allow it to file a brief and participate in oral arguments , to order the government to file a public version of its briefs addressing the law 's constitutionality , and to publish any judicial decision that is ultimately issued .
" The new law allows the mass acquisition of Americans ' international e-mails and telephone calls , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The administration has argued that the law is necessary to address the threat of terrorism , but the truth is that the law sweeps much more broadly and implicates all kinds of communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind . "
In 2006 , the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to stop its illegal , warrantless spying program .
A federal district court sided with the ACLU , ruling that warrantless wiretapping by the NSA violated Americans ' rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution , ran counter to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and violated the principle of separation of powers .
The Bush administration appealed the ruling , and an appeals court panel dismissed the case .
However , the court did not uphold the legality of the government 's warrantless surveillance activity and the only judge to discuss the merits of the case clearly and unequivocally declared that the warrantless spying was unlawful .
The Supreme Court declined to hear the case earlier this year .
" A democratic system depends on the rule of law , and not even the president or Congress can authorize a law that violates core constitutional principles , " said Christopher Dunn , Associate Legal Director of the New York Civil Liberties Union .
" The only thing compromised in this so - called ' compromise ' law is the Constitution . "
Leigh Montville resurrects the 1930s tale of John Montague , a ready - for - Hollywood saga of sports , wealth , deception , and armed robbery .
In the early 1930s , a mysterious , heavy - set man showed up on the Hollywood and golf scenes ( apparently , they used to intersect ) .
The man , John Montague , thrilled his contemporaries with extraordinary feats in the clubhouse , at the bar , and especially on the golf course .
He could knock a bird off of a wire from 170 yards away or chip off of a sofa cushion into a window open three inches .
Respected sportswriters called Montague the greatest golfer they 'd ever seen , though he refused to have his picture taken .
The reason for this need for secrecy would become apparent when he was placed under arrest .
Montague , aka LaVerne Moore , had committed an armed robbery in upstate New York before coming out to the West Coast , and was a wanted man .
Leigh Montville , formerly of the Boston Globe and Sports Illustrated , brings Montague 's story to life in his book , The Mysterious Montague : A True Tale of Hollywood , Golf , and Armed Robbery .
He 's also written biographies of Babe Ruth , Ted Williams , and Dale Earnhardt .
Though researched extensively , The Mysterious Montague does not entirely disentangle legend from fact , since the two have become inextricably intertwined .
Says Montville , " Anything you read from an American newspaper in the 1930s , you have to take with a grain of salt . "

Protestors have numbered 20,000 who object to US beef imports
Many people are wondering how it could have come to this .
Not least South Korea 's President , Lee Myung - bak , who , just 100 days into office has shown he has the opposite of the Midas touch .
The landslide popularity that brought him to power has evaporated , the more humiliating opinion polls put his support rating barely into double digits .
The reason ?
A once seemingly mundane and long running agricultural dispute has mushroomed into one of the biggest political crises in recent memory .
It is a crisis that has taken shape on the streets .
Mass movement
What started as a series of relatively small - scale candlelit vigils against a lifting of the five - year ban on American beef imports , has now taken on the air of a mass movement .
We are creating the fear of mad cow disease in our own minds .
Candlelights should be used to brighten the darkness , not burn down our own homes
Lee Sae Jin , lone pro-beef import protestor Mothers pushing prams march alongside ranks of high - pitched school children , all carrying delicate , fluttering flames through the dark Seoul night .
The symbolism is potent .
It is a picture of the nation 's most cherished and vulnerable under threat from a cavalier government and the poisoned , imported produce of a foreign power .
" I am afraid of American beef , " one 13 - year - old protester told a US newspaper reporter .
" I could study hard in school .
I could get a good job and then I could eat beef and just die . "
This week , the growing intensity of the protests and sporadic outbreaks of violence finally forced a government U - turn .
The lifting of the ban on US beef has been put on hold .
" The essence of the beef protests is anti-American , " said Keun Park , President of the Korea - America Friendship Society .
" The left - wing media has instigated the feeling that there is a good reason to fear US beef . "
Age issue Some of the claims made about the risks of mad cow disease are certainly difficult to substantiate .
Young mothers and children say they are afraid to eat US meat South Korea 's marching citizens have been worried onto the streets by widely circulated rumours that American consumers do not eat beef from cattle aged over 30 months , and that large quantities of this more dangerous , older meat will flood into Korea .
It was with reference to these fears that the South Korean government suspended the import agreement this week , saying it wanted 30 - month and older cattle removed from the deal .
But according to statistics from the US beef industry , 18 % of cattle slaughtered in the US for human consumption is above , in many cases well above , 30 months of age .
The meat from these animals , considered perfectly safe , is ground into beef for burgers and other such delights .
Americans , it seems , do not just eat 30 - month - old cows , they eat them in vast quantities .
And according to Joe Schuele from the US National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , " research shows that before exports were stopped in 2003 , less than 2 % of the total beef we sent to South Korea came from cattle aged over 30 months " .
It is hardly a flood .
American interests
Among the more hysterical claims , of course , the fears of many South Koreans about the safety of imported beef are genuinely held .
After all , there are those in the US , both producers and consumers , who argue that there should be much more testing of slaughtered cattle than there is at present .
But central to the South Korean government 's willingness to open its ports is the certification of US beef hygiene standards by the World Organisation for Animal Health .
According to this intergovernmental food - safety body , the US removes risky material from slaughtered animals , conducts adequate testing and has feed policies that control the risk and make its meat safe for export .
I am afraid of American beef .
I could study hard in school .
I could get a good job and then I could eat beef and just die
Young girl protesting , 13 South Korea has yet to supply enough information to the World Organisation for Animal Health to allow an assessment of its own mad cow risk to be carried out .
Hahm Sung - deuk , professor of presidential studies at Korea University , did not agree that the beef protests were motivated by anti-American sentiment , but he admitted that outsiders may well be baffled as to why it has become such a serious issue .
" People have become gradually disappointed with President Lee , " he said .
" There have been a series of errors . "
One of the biggest ones , he said , was to give the appearance of capitulating to American political interests .
Free - trade deal risked Politicians in Washington were threatening to scupper a US - South Korea free - trade deal - one that President Lee is championing - unless he gave them back what used to be America 's third largest market for beef exports .
That he duly obliged , seemingly without consultation and with the agreement to include almost all beef products , of all ages , may have proved the catalyst for the rising public anger .
South Korea 's political leadership has been caught out by the uproar " People felt that this guy was just out of touch , " Professor Hahm added .
" Now the US needs to come to his assistance . "
The Americans however seem reluctant to drop cattle aged over 30 months from the agreement , although some might ask why , given that these older animals make up such a small share of the export market .
Not all South Koreans agree with the candlelit protesters who continue to march through the streets of Seoul each night .
Lee Sae Jin , a 25 - year - old university student , bravely held his own , one - man protest in favour of US beef imports .
He was soon shepherded away by a policeman , led off through the rather angry crowd that had gathered to read his posters .
" We are an exporting nation , " he had written .
" We are creating the fear of mad cow disease in our own minds .
Candlelights should be used to brighten the darkness , not burn down our own homes . "

A campaign spokesman for Sen. Barack Obama today told a reporter that ex-President Bill Clinton would play a " big role " in the upcoming general election campaign .
This could be the usual unity hoo - haa leading up to Friday 's joint Obama - Hillary Clinton appearance in , of all places , Unity , N.H.
This , after their joint appearance in Washington on Thursday before many of her top fundraisers .
Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki did not reveal to Bloomberg reporter Kristin Jensen how the campaign might use the former president .
" A unified Democratic Party is going to be a powerful force for change this year , and we 're confident President Clinton will play a big role in that , " Psaki said .
Not that there would be any political conniving among fellow Democrats because the Republicans are so collectively evil and any personal party ambitions must take second place to that or be seen to anyway .
But can you imagine all the conceivable subversive subplots inherent in the husband of the defeated Democratic candidate campaigning for the man who beat her ?
And if Obama just happens to lose , the door to 2012 is wide open for , oh , look , the Clinton wife again .
Of course , both Clintons want to appear to work hard for ...

In the decades after Watergate , the basic thrust of campaign finance reform was this : limit the flow of big - money private contributions to candidates .
No more bags of money for the pols .
Now , only donations of up to $ 2300 from individuals are acceptable .
And in the presidential race , there is public financing : the nominees –if they agree to forgo fundraising –receive full underwriting of their general election campaigns .
This year that subsidy is about $ 85 million .
This system has been an imperfect reform .
There have been loopholes .
Well - heeled private interests have poured money into independent efforts to support a preferred candidate or , more often , blast that candidate ’s opponent .
And parties could raise money , while corporations could donate unrestricted amounts to presidential conventions .
So the opportunity for one side to outspend the other ( using unlimited donations from wealthy individuals , corporations or unions ) has remained .
The influence of big money has not been eradicated .
Still , presidential candidates , once nominated , could focus on campaigning , rather than cash - hunting .
Now comes Barack Obama .
He has run for president as an agent of change who slams the money - talks ways of Washington .
As an Illinois state senator and as a U.S. senator , he has passed reform measures .
Yet on Thursday , in an email to his supporters , he announced that he would not participate in the public financing system in the general election , despite an earlier promise to stay within this system .
He will be the first major presidential nominee to reject public financing for the general election since Watergate .
Instead of relying on that check from the U.S. Treasury , he will continue his record - setting fundraising operation .
John McCain ’s campaign immediately and predictably proclaimed that this decision “ undermines his call for a new type of politics ” and will “ weaken and undermine the public financing system . ”
Obama said :
It ’s not an easy decision , and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections .
But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken , and we face opponents who ’ve become masters at gaming this broken system .
John McCain ’s campaign and the Republican National Committee are fueled by contributions from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs .
And we ’ve already seen that he ’s not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so - called 527 groups , who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations .
Obama is clearly doing what ’s best for his political prospects .
No doubt , Obama , who has raised about $ 265 million so far ( while McCain has raised $ 97 million ) , can pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in the general election .
So by eschewing the public financing system , he will have far more dollars to deploy–and be able to double , triple or quadruple what the McCain campaign raises and spends ( presuming McCain keeps within the system ) .
But the story here is deeper than the simple narrative , Obama - sells - out - reform .
His campaign , relying on Internet fundraising , has broken records in the number of small donors it has attracted .
It has been far more populist than other major campaigns when it comes to fundraising .
As Obama put it , “ Instead of forcing us to rely on millions from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs , you ’ve fueled this campaign with donations of $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , whatever you can afford .
And because you did , we ’ve built a grassroots movement of over 1.5 million Americans . ”
Sure , Obama did receive a significant amount from maxed - out contributors and bundlers , but he has mobilized small contributors like no one else .
Given that the goal of the reform system was to prevent big - money backers from getting their hooks into a candidate , are its restrictions less relevant for a candidate who does so well with small donors ?
When the system was first designed , few could imagine an Internet - dominated world in which it would be possible for a candidate who motivates millions of voters to haul in so much from non -fat - cats .
Are these rules then obsolete ?
And considering that Democrats have often been at a disadvantage when it comes to big - bucks fundraising ( though not lately ) , should a Democratic nominee walk away from an advantage in people - power fundraising ?
After all , if literally millions of citizens yearn to make a small contribution to a campaign that aims to undo the work of the Bush administration , why stop them ?
Is n’t that small - d democracy at its best ?
And Obama ’s decision will put him in a stronger position to pressure independent groups from raising and spending unlimited amounts to support him or attack McCain .
If he does draw in $ 300 million or so in campaign donations , Obama will not need these outsiders .
McCain , however , will .
Even though McCain has said he does not fancy independent spending in campaigns , he will be less able to lean on these players ( say , this year ’s Swift Boaters ) to cease and desist .
Assuming that McCain will rely on the public subsidy of $ 85 million , the GOP will somehow have to cover the $ 200 million - plus gap between the McCain campaign and the Obama campaign .
Obama can be pegged a flip - flopper on this front .
And the McCain camp is right : he ’s setting a precedent that will weaken the system .
Longtime reform advocate Fred Wertheimer says ,
We had hoped and expected that Senator Obama would stick with the public pledge he made to accept public financing and spending limits for the presidential general election , if he was nominated , and if his Republican opponent also agreed to accept public financing and spending limits for the general election .
These conditions have been met .
We do not agree with Senator Obama ’s rationale for opting out of the system .
Senator Obama knew the circumstances surrounding the presidential general election when he made his public pledge to use the system … .
Senator Obama ’s decision to opt out … make it all the more important for Senator Obama to personally make clear to the public in no uncertain terms that if he is elected , one of the early priorities for his Administration will be enacting legislation to repair the presidential public financing system .
The argument that the Obama campaign has created a parallel system of public financing through its Internet small donor fundraising does not hold up .
… Larger contributions and bundlers already have played an important role in financing the Obama presidential primary campaign and may well do so in the general election … .
It is true that Obama has used bundlers and accepted money from big donors .
But he has indeed demonstrated the potential of a new model .
And Obama is one of three lead Senate sponsors of legislation that would improve the presidential public financing system , particularly for presidential primaries .
This bill would give primary candidates public matching funds of $ 4 for every $ 1 raised , covering only individual contributions of $ 200 or less .
Under this reform , the importance of smaller Internet contributions would be maximized and the primaries would become less a money - chase than they have been .
Does Obama ’s decision mean he ’s a phony , or is his embrace and mastery of small - donor fundraising an indication he is truly a vehicle for change ?
Ultimately , his move will be judged expediently .
Political foes will brand him a business - as - usual promise - breaker .
His supporters will cheer his hard call and celebrate his grassroots and netroots successes as a democratic ( and Democratic ) triumph .
As for nonpartisan reformers , they will have to keep on pondering the implications for reform and clean elections in the brave new world of the web .
And whatever happens in November , Obama will not have the excuse of having been outspent .
This self - proclaimed candidate of change will be the most well - financed - by - the - voters politician in the history of the United States .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When a grenade bounced off his chest and fell to the floor near his fellow troops , Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Monsoor acted out of instinct .
His actions did n't stem from a lack of training .
His instant reaction was to protect his comrades .
The Navy says he committed a selfless act : jumping on the grenade and taking the full force of the blast .
President Bush presented Monsoor 's parents with a posthumous Medal of Honor for their son at an emotional White House ceremony on Tuesday .
Watch Monsoor 's sister share her memories »
Bush quoted one of the SEALS saved by Monsoor as saying , " Mikey looked death in the face that day and said , ' You can not take my brothers .
I will go in their stead . ' "
Watch the president bestow the award »
Monsoor was one of the U.S. military 's most highly trained combatants , a Navy SEAL .
He 's the first SEAL to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq .
On September 29 , 2006 , Monsoor was part of a major clearing and isolating operation to root out enemy fighters holding parts of Ramadi , the Sunni insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad .
Monsoor was in a sniper position on a rooftop along with two other SEALs when a grenade flew into his location from out of nowhere .
It bounced off his chest and landed in an area where it probably would have killed or seriously wounded all three of them .
Do n't Miss U.S. Navy : Tribute and biography of Monsoor
Monsoor was in a position to escape before the explosion but instead leapt on the grenade .
" He recognized immediately the threat , yelled ' grenade ' and due to the fact that two other SEAL snipers , our brothers , could not possibly escape the blast , he chose to smother it with his body , absorbed the impact and lost his life in the process , " said Lt. Cmdr .
Seth Stone , Mansoor 's platoon commander .
The blast did not kill him right away ; he hung on for 30 minutes .
His two comrades were wounded but survived the shrapnel that ripped through their bodies .
Stone said : " He essentially saved [ the ] Navy SEALS on the rooftop and three Iraqi soldiers who were there . "
Until this month , when the White House announced that Monsoor would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously , few people knew of his story .
Born in 1981 in Long Beach , California , Monsoor excelled as a high school athlete .
He joined the Navy before the September 11 attacks .
In 2004 , Monsoor graduated from the basic SEAL training course as one of the top members of his class .
By March 2005 , he had completed his training and was assigned to SEAL Team 3 , Delta Platoon .
In April 2006 , that unit deployed to Iraq 's troubled and violent western provincial capital of Ramadi .
Monsoor would not return home alive .
His five - month stay in Ramadi was marked by constant attacks .
As a heavy machine gunner , Monsoor had to stay behind the point man on foot patrols and protect the unit from attacks .
Delta Platoon was involved in attacks on 75 percent of its missions in a highly contested part of Ramadi called the Ma'laab district , according to the Navy .
On a patrol less than a month after arriving in Iraq , Monsoor showed some of his selfless instinct when gunfire hit a fellow SEAL in the leg .
Monsoor " ran out into the street with another SEAL , shot cover fire and dragged his comrade to safety while enemy bullets kicked up the concrete at their feet , " according to Navy documents .
He received the Silver Star , the third highest award for valor in combat .
His unit continued to endure the constant barrage of attacks and some 35 firefights with insurgent forces over the scorching Iraqi summer .
Monsoor also was saddled with carrying heavy radio equipment on his back as the " SEAL communicator " who called in tank and other support during firefights .
He received the Bronze Star for his work as an adviser for Iraqi troops .
" His leadership , guidance and decisive actions during 11 different combat operations saved the lives of his teammates , other [ U.S. - led ] coalition forces and Iraqi army soldiers , " according to Navy documents .
But it was his instinct on his last operation on that Ramadi roof that solidified Monsoor 's standing as a hero .

All About U.S. Navy Activities • Iraq War
Dennis Kucinich just released 35 counts against George Bush , calling for Impeachment .
He is being ignored by the media .
We all need to condemn the corporate media for their continued betrayal of the public trust by its silence on this .
This betrayal is even worse than the corporate media aiding the Bush Administration lies that got us into the illegal , immoral invasion and occupation of Iraq .
It is true that the brave Representative from Ohio has been marginalized and demonized by those in the corporate media .
However , we must remember that that marginalization and demonization have not just been by the corporate media .
There have been many willing partners in crime from within the political establishment .
The corporate media blackout has had allies .
For this blackout to be broken , Progressive Democrats of America , Move On and every other progressive group need to call for Senator Obama to publicly call for Impeachment .
Make it clear that if he does not do so , right now , that they will publicly withdraw support from Senator Obama and publicly support Cynthia McKinney and / or Ralph Nader .
We need to make the same case for every politician running : that if they do not support Kucinich that we will publicly not support them and will indeed support any Independent that runs against them , now and in the future .
Most importantly , having Senator Obama and others making it clear that they support an Impeachment investigation will force the corporate media to cover the story .
This will then provide the evidence needed to convince the American public just how deep and insidious the crimes of the Bush Administration are .
This simple act of courage by progressive groups could propel Impeachment into the minds and consciousness of the public of our country .
It can make the oft - heard term " holding their feet to the fire " have real meaning and relevance .
On the other hand , to not push this will do one thing and one thing only .
It is unarguable that the Democratic majority has proven to be worse than spineless .
For progressives to not publicly pressure the Democratic Party leadership in this manner will actually reward them for their cowardice .
At this stage , this is the only leverage we have left .
Impeachment really is this important , and you all know it .
Make them prove that Impeachment was not taken off the table because they had something to hide under the table .
Or we can assume that they did have something to hide , in which case , they do not deserve our support .
It will become undeniable that the Democratic Party leadership would rather lose the election to John McInsane and the Republicans than to push for Impeachment .
It will be proof positive of their complicity , the fact that they are coconspirators in the crimes of the Bush Administration
If we all come to that horrifying reality , we can then be truly aware of how bad the situation is that we find ourselves in .
It also gives We The People the responsibility to create real and lasting change for ourselves and the world in which we live .
The choice is ours to make .

Fuel blockade :
Talks resume in bid to head off tanker drivers strike
Talks aimed at averting a strike by hundreds of fuel - tanker drivers will resume today .
Yesterday , leaders of the Unite union met for more than 10 hours with managers from two companies which deliver fuel to Shell garages across the UK in a bid to resolve a row over pay .
Around 500 drivers employed by Hoyer and Sucklings are due to walk tomorrow morning unless the dispute is resolved .
Yesterday 's meeting was held under the chairmanship of the conciliation service Acas , but the two sides will hold direct talks today .
Motorists queue up at a petrol station in Aintree , Merseyside , today
Shell tanker drivers will urge unionised drivers for rival oil companies not to cross their picket lines
A spokesman for Unite said last night : " The discussions between Unite and Shell contractors Hoyer and Sucklings through Acas concluded tonight without resolution .
" Unite will be meeting with Hoyer and Sucklings tomorrow to enter into direct negotiations in an attempt to reach a deal to avert industrial action . "
One in 10 filling stations across the UK could be hit by the strike .
The Government has urged drivers not to panic - buy fuel , but there were queues at some garages yesterday , with one woman admitting : " I am panic - buying . "
A Downing Street spokesman said : " We want the public to continue to buy as normal so as to avoid creating problems that might otherwise not exist . "
Contingency plans include allowing suppliers to share information about stocks without falling foul of competition laws .
Fuel supplies to the emergency services would also be maintained in the event of shortages .
The pay row has erupted because members of Unite claim they are paid the same now as they were in 1992 - just under £ 32,000 a year - despite their working week being 11 hours longer .
Union organisers believe a picket - line blockade of terminals , depots and refineries could lead to a crisis not seen since the fuel protests of autumn 2000 .
Airports will also be hit .
Luton , which is understood to be supplied by Shell , is among those being targeted .
Members of the Unite union employed by two firms working on Shell contracts - Hoyer UK and Suckling - are due to walk out over pay from 6 am on Friday until 6 am the following Tuesday .
By law , only six pickets can protest at their place of work - which for many drivers includes refineries and oil terminals .
But strikers from Unite believe that drivers for other companies will back the Shell drivers by refusing to cross picket lines where they share facilities .
Among the depots at risk are Kingsbury terminal in Birmingham , Killingholme refinery near Hull , Stanlow refinery at
Ellesmere Port in the North West and Grangemouth in Scotland .
Last - ditch talks , led by conciliation service ACAS , are being held at a secret location , understood to be a hotel in Hook , Hampshire .
Driving instructors from Sunderland on a ' go slow ' protest ' at the rising cost of fuel
The Shell drivers deliver fuel to up to 1,000 filling stations - about one in ten of the total .
The union say they earn just under £ 32,000 before overtime .
Employers insist their improved 6.8 per cent offer would take the average to around £ 39,000 .
As fuel prices soared to record levels yesterday , there were long queues in some forecourts after the
Government said shortages were ' inevitable ' if the strike went ahead .
Petrol retailers and motoring organisations said the Government 's ' do n't panic ' plea to motorists had in fact created panic .
The AA said the Government was ' acting like Corporal Jones ' .
Retailers predict a £ 6 gallon for diesel ( £ 1.31 a litre ) will be breached by the weekend and jump by up to 5 p a litre by the middle of next week .
Delays : Motorists wait at a Sainsburys garage , in Wigan , Lancs
However , suggestions that petrol could double to 230 p a litre were ' wide of the mark , according to Ray Holloway of the Petrol Retailers ' Association .
He said even if predictions of oil doubling to $ 250 a barrel within 18 months came true - which he doubted - the extra $ 100 - plus per barrel would add about 35 p to the cost of a litre of diesel , raising it to around £ 1.65 a litre .
Petrol would be about £ 1.55 a litre .
Mr Holloway said speculators were talking up the market and that they would ' get their fingers burned ' when the peak driving season ends in the autumn and prices relax .
' There is no shortage of supplies , ' he added .
The AA said the cost of filling a 50 - litre family car is now £ 10.23 more for a petrol and £ 16.69 more for diesel than last year .
Mr Holloway said : " Unfortunately , the nervousness and volatility in the market means that if there is a strike the price of oil will rise higher - most of it driven by speculators . "
Luke Bosdet of the AA said : " For the Government to say , " Do n't Panic " is a bit like Corporal Jones in Dad 's Army .
Motorists must understand that there will be no problem whatsoever provided they keep their heads . "
Ministers have invoked emergency measures , including suspending normal competition rules to allow rival companies to share information and supply areas where there are shortages .
If that fails rationing will be introduced , with drivers restricted to a £ 20 fill up .
Ministers can also invoke the full National Emergency Plan for Fuel - prioritising fuel for ' essential users ' .
The patient sat with his eyes closed , submerged in the rhythm of his own breathing , and after a while noticed that he was thinking about his troubled relationship with his father .
“ I was able to be there , present for the pain , ” he said , when the meditation session ended .
“ To just let it be what it was , without thinking it through . ”
The therapist nodded .
“ Acceptance is what it was , ” he continued .
“ Just letting it be .
Not trying to change anything . ”
“ That ’s it , ” the therapist said .
“ That ’s it , and that ’s big . ”
This exercise in focused awareness and mental catch - and - release of emotions has become perhaps the most popular new psychotherapy technique of the past decade .
Mindfulness meditation , as it is called , is rooted in the teachings of a fifth - century B.C. Indian prince , Siddhartha Gautama , later known as the Buddha .
It is catching the attention of talk therapists of all stripes , including academic researchers , Freudian analysts in private practice and skeptics who see all the hallmarks of another fad .
Microsoft this week offered a window into the first phase of a mega million dollar advertising campaign designed to clear up ' misconceptions ' about the quality of its Windows Vista operating system exacerbated by in - your - face marketing efforts on the part of longtime rival Apple .
The first series of ads in the campaign were reportedly met with rave reviews last week when they were previewed at Microsoftâs employees - only Global Exchange conference .
" [ I ] got goosebumps - just , wow , " said one insider who was privy to the preview .
While those ads have yet to surface publicly , the first instances of an associated Web campaign spotted by ZDNet suggests the Redmond - based software giant will attempt to alter the perception of Vista by liking its critics to proponents of flat earth theory .
Instead of responding directly to Apple 's influential " I'm a Mac , I 'm a PC " global campaign , an ad that appears on the company 's website ( below ) recalls that " at one point , everyone thought the Earth was flat . "
It links to a recently established information base on the state of Windows Vista , which attempts to " clear up some confusion and lingering misunderstandings " about the XP successor while simultaneously admitting to some early missteps .
" We know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter .
Printers did n't work .
Games felt sluggish .
You told usâloudly at timesâ that the latest Windows was n't always living up to your high expectations for a Microsoft product , " the company said .
" Well , we 've been taking notes and addressing issues . "
What follows are a series of common questions on the part of would - be Vista adopters , such as " Why do I keep reading that Windows Vista wo n't work with my hardware or software ? , " along with answers .
" We know that 's what some people are saying on the Internet , " the company said , opting not to mention Apple by name .
" And in its early days , Windows Vista did experience some compatibility problems .
But thanks to our industry partners ' efforts during the past 18 months , here 's where things stand today . "
According to Microsoft , Vista now supports nearly 77,000 hardware products , runs 98 of the top 100 consumer software programs , and works with all of the leading small business applications .
The security of Vista is another matter which Microsoft believes to have been exploited unfairly by Apple 's marketing tactics .
As such , the company 's references to the Mac maker and its Leopard operating system in this regard are not as subtle .
" Windows Vista has fewer than half the security vulnerabilities of Windows XP , " Microsoft said .
" It 's also 60 % less likely to be infected by spyware or malware than Windows XP SP2 .
And in early 2008 , Windows Vista was shown to have 89 % fewer vulnerabilities than MacOS X 10.5 , making it the most secure Windows release to date . "
( Fortune ) --
After months of negotiations with Microsoft , Yahoo has ditched the software giant for Google .
Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) struck an online advertising partnership with Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) late Thursday that it believes is a better deal than hooking up with Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) .
Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang said the search advertising tieup could bring the company an extra $ 800 million in annual revenues .
Investors disagreed .
Yahoo's stock tanked by 10 % Thursday when news hit that a deal between Microsoft and Yahoo would definitely not happen .
Yahoo's shares did not rise on the announcement of the Google agreement in after - hours trading .
" Clearly it is time to move on , " Yang told investors in a conference call Thursday .
Yang said that Microsoft executives told Yahoo's board on June 8 that they were n't interested in a full acquisition and that it was only interested in buying Yahoo 's search business .
Yahoo saw a non-exclusive arrangement with Google to be more beneficial than a partial one with Microsoft .
Yahoo says it will mix and match Google 's paid search ads alongside its own search results within North America and offer Google 's text - based ads on its web properties .
Yang said Yahoo will continue to use Panama , its own search technology .
" This will put Yahoo on a faster track in the global online advertising market , " he said .
The company expects to generate between $ 250 to $ 450 million in operating cash flow once the deal gets the blessing of the Justice Department , which could take up to 3 - 1/ 2 months .
The deal is expected to run up to ten years .
Google gets the dual benefit of gaining a major publisher in Yahoo and keeping the Internet portal out of the hands of Microsoft .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the deal would benefit users and advertisers because Google will be able to place higher - quality ads now that it will gain access to Yahoo 's network .
" This is an important partner deal for us , " Schmidt said in a conference call late Thursday afternoon .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer has previously stated that the company would not be interested in pursuing Yahoo if Yahoo decided to partner with Google .
Yet shortly after Yahoo announced that talks with Microsoft were over , the company released a statement that the deal was n't over yet and that " our alternative transaction remains available for discussion . "
Some shareholders said Thursday that they remained confident Microsoft would return with an offer .
" I do n't think things are over between Microsoft and Yahoo , " said Chris Boova , an investment officer for tech stocks at J. & W. Seligman , which has a minor stake in Yahoo .
" I remain of the opinion that the greatest value that can be realized from Yahoo is a deal with Microsoft . "
Added Ryan Jacob of the Jacob Internet Fund , which also has small stake in Yahoo , " This is n't completely over .
The board meeting is coming up .
And shareholders will still have their say . "
Yahoo's move to partner with Google was seen as a way to appease disgruntled shareholders who favored a sale to Microsoft .
Investors will have a chance to vote for Yahoo's board members or support billionaire activist Carl Icahn , who is leading a charge to kick out Yang as CEO and implement his slate of nominees as directors .
Boova says he is undecided whether he will vote for Icahn or Yahoo 's existing board .
His institutional fund has roughly the same number of shares as Icahn Associates .
" I 'm somewhat frustrated with the level of unwillingness [ by Yahoo's board ] to conclude a transaction , " he said .
" We have n't reached a decision yet on how we 'll vote . "

Uxbridge , CANADA , Jul 21 ( IPS ) – Wetlands are dangerous , scientists say , in the sense that they are ticking carbon bombs best left alone .
To help stave off extreme climate change , existing wetlands should be enhanced and new wetlands created so they could capture more carbon .
“ Wetlands hold massive stores of carbon — about 20 percent of all terrestrial carbon stocks , ” said Eugene Turner , a leading wetlands expert at Louisiana State University ’s Coastal Ecology Institute .
However , wetlands , including peatlands , continue to be converted to other uses around the world , resulting in large emissions of carbon and methane , a potent greenhouse gas that has 21 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide .
By itself , climate change is already degrading wetlands , especially in the Arctic and near Arctic regions where the once permanently frozen peatlands are thawing , Turner told IPS prior to the opening of the Eighth INTECOL International Wetlands Conference in Cuiaba , Brazil on Monday .
“ Researchers have been measuring huge releases of carbon and methane up there , ” he said .
“ It ’s crazy to add to that by draining or mismanaging other wetlands . ”
While birds and bird lovers value wetlands , hardly anyone else does .
Besides capturing and holding carbon , wetlands are hotspots of biodiversity , crucial components in flood control and in providing clean water .
The recent disastrous floods in the U.S. Midwest would have been far less damaging if wetlands in the region had n’t been drained decades ago , Turner said .
“ Humanity in many parts of the world needs a wake - up call to fully appreciate the vital environmental , social and economic services wetlands provide , ” said conference co-chair Paulo Teixeira , coordinator of the Cuiaba - based Pantanal Regional Environmental Programme , a joint effort of the United Nations University ( UNU ) and Brazil ’s Federal University of Mato Grasso ( UFMT ) .
“ The benefits of wetlands are not understood by the public .
We hope to change this through our meeting , ” Teixeria said in an interview .
The INTECOL conference will assess the status of global wetlands , identify knowledge gaps , foster greater collaboration and consistency in wetland science worldwide , and offer plain - spoken policy prescriptions for decision makers with an appeal to adopt them with urgency , he said .
Climate change has dramatically increased the need to protect wetlands .
Without substantial reductions in emissions of fossil fuels , up to 85 percent of wetlands will be lost in the future .
That loss is far more than a loss of important bird habitat — it would also release enough carbon and methane to almost certainly tip the climate into an era of extreme and rapid change , experts believe .
“ Too often in the past , people have unwittingly considered wetlands to be problems in need of a solution , ” said U.N. Under Secretary - General Konrad Osterwalder , rector of UNU .
“ Yet wetlands are essential to the planet ’s health — and with hindsight , the problems in reality have turned out to be the draining of wetlands and other ‘ solutions ’ we humans devised , ” Osterwalder said in a statement .
Covering just six percent of Earth ’s land surface , wetlands — including marshes , peat bogs , swamps , river deltas , mangroves , tundra , lagoons and river floodplains — contain an estimated 771 gigatonnes ( 771 billion tonnes ) of greenhouse gases , both CO2 and more potent methane , an amount in CO2 equivalent comparable to the carbon content of today ’s entire atmosphere .
Some 60 percent of wetlands worldwide — and up to 90 percent in Europe — have been destroyed in the past 100 years , principally due to drainage for agriculture but also through pollution , dams , canals , groundwater pumping , urban development and peat extraction .

Everyone enjoys hearing about a good conspiracy theory and many people enjoy coming up with new ones .
You can spend an incredible amount of time reading about theories and wondering if there is any truth to them .
This list is the top 10 conspiracy theories .
If you feel that I have left off your favourite , or have proof that any of these are not just theory but fact , post a comment , just remember : do n’t be cruel !
1. 9/11 was Planned by the US Government [ Wikpedia ]
Many conspiracy theories have been presented concerning the September 11 , 2001 attacks , many of them claiming that President George W. Bush and / or individuals in his administration knew about the attacks beforehand and purposefully allowed them to occur because the attacks would generate public support for militarization , expansion of the police state , and other intrusive foreign and domestic policies by which they would benefit .
Proponents point to the Project for the New American Century , a conservative think tank that argues for increased American global leadership , whose former members include ex-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney and several other key Bush administration figures .
An 1990 report from the group stated that “ some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor ” would be needed to budge public opinion in their favor .
2. UFO Recovered at Roswell [ Wikpedia ]
The Roswell UFO Incident involved the recovery of materials near Roswell , New Mexico , USA , in July 1947 , which have since become the subject of intense speculation , rumor , questioning and research .
There are widely divergent views on what actually happened , and passionate debate about what evidence can be believed .
The United States military maintains that what was recovered was a top - secret research balloon that had crashed .
By the early 1990s , UFO researchers such as Friedman , William Moore , Karl Pflock , and the team of Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt had interviewed several hundred people [ 11 ] who had , or claimed to have had , a connection with the events at Roswell in 1947 .
Additionally , hundreds of documents were obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests , as were some apparently leaked by insiders , such as the disputed “ Majestic 12 ” documents .
Their conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the Roswell vicinity , that aliens , some possibly still alive , were recovered , and that a massive cover - up of any knowledge of the incident was put in place .
3. John F. Kennedy ’s Assasination [ Wikpedia ]
The assassination of John F. Kennedy , the thirty - fifth President of the United States , took place on Friday , November 22 , 1963 , in Dallas , Texas , USA at 12:30 p.m. CST ( 18:30 UTC ) .
Kennedy was fatally wounded by gunshots while riding with his wife Jacqueline in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza .
The official investigation by the Warren Commission was conducted over a ten - month period , and its report was published in September 1964 .
The Commission concluded that the assassination was carried out solely by Lee Harvey Oswald , an employee of the Texas School Book Depository in Dealey Plaza .
A number of conspiracy theories exist with regard to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy .
Such theories began to be generated soon after his death , and continue to be proposed today .
Many of these theories propose a criminal conspiracy involving parties such as the Federal Reserve , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , the KGB , the Mafia , Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) director J. Edgar Hoover , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , Richard Nixon , Fidel Castro , George H. W. Bush , Cuban exile groups opposed to the Castro government and the military and / or government interests of the United States .
4. Global Warming is a Fraud [ Wikpedia ]
The suggestion of a conspiracy to promote the theory of global warming was put forward in a 1990 documentary The Greenhouse Conspiracy broadcast by Channel Four in the United Kingdom on 12 August 1990 , as part of the Equinox series , which asserted that scientists critical of global warming theory were denied funding .
William Gray , phD ( a pioneer in the science of hurricane forecasting ) has made a list of 15 reasons for the global warming hysteria .
The list includes the need to come up with an enemy after the end of the Cold War , and the desire among scientists , government leaders and environmentalists to find a political cause that would enable them to ‘ organize , propagandize , force conformity and exercise political influence .
Big world government could best lead ( and control ) us to a better world ! ’
In this article , Gray also cites the ascendancy of Al Gore to the vice presidency as the start of his problems with federal funding .
According to him , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stopped giving him research grants , and so did NASA .
5. Princess Diana was Murdered by the Royal Family [ Wikpedia ]
In 1997 , Princess Diana ( Princess of Wales ) and Dodi Fayed ( son of Mohamed Fayed , owner of the Ritz Hotel and Harrods ) were killed in a car accident while trying to get away from press photographers in Paris .
The scandal surrounding their relationship ( Dodi was Muslim whilst Diana was the mother of the future head of the Church of England ) has led many people to speculate that they were actually killed in order to prevent further scandal to the throne of England .
Polls suggest that around a quarter of the UK public , and a majority of people in some Arab countries , believe that there was a plot to murder Diana , Princess of Wales .
Motivations which have been advanced for such a conspiracy include suggestions that Diana intended to marry Dodi Fayed , that she intended to convert to Islam , that she was pregnant , and that she was to visit the holy land .
Organizations which conspiracy theorists suggest are responsible for her death have included French Intelligence , the British Royal Family , the press , the British Intelligence services MI5 or MI6 , the CIA , Mossad , the Freemasons , or the IRA .
6. Jewish World Domination [ Wikpedia ]
This theory , in recent history , extends mainly from the booklet The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , which are widely considered to be the beginning of contemporary conspiracy theory literature .
The Protocols are considered by some to be an anti-Jewish literary forgery that purports to describe a Jewish plot to achieve world domination .
Numerous independent investigations have repeatedly proven it to be a plagiarism and a hoax , yet numerous independent investigations have shown it to be a factual document .
The text was popularized by those opposed to Russian revolutionary movement , and was disseminated further after the revolution of 1905 , becoming known worldwide after the 1917 October Revolution .
It was widely circulated in the West in 1920 and thereafter .
The Great Depression and the rise of Nazism were important developments in the history of the Protocols .
7. Apollo Moon Landing Hoax [ Wikpedia ]
Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations are claims that some or all elements of the Apollo Moon landings were faked by NASA and possibly members of other involved organizations .
Some groups and individuals have advanced alternate historical narratives which tend , to varying degrees , to state that the Apollo Astronauts did not land on the moon , and that NASA created and continues to perpetuate this hoax .
Moon hoax proponents devote a substantial portion of their efforts to examining NASA photos .
They point to various issues with photographs and films purportedly taken on the Moon .
Experts in photography ( even those unrelated to NASA ) respond that the anomalies , while sometimes counterintuitive , are in fact precisely what one would expect from a real Moon landing , and contrary to what would occur with manipulated or studio imagery .
Hoax proponents also state that whistleblowers may have deliberately manipulated the NASA photos in hope of exposing NASA .
8. Pearl Harbor Was Allowed to Happen [ Wikpedia ]
This theory states that President Roosevelt ( FDR ) provoked the attack , knew about it in advance and covered up his failure to warn the Hawaiian commanders .
FDR needed the attack to sucker Hitler to declare war , since the public and Congress were overwhelmingly against entering the war in Europe .
It was his backdoor to war .
Theorists believe that the US was warned by , at least , the governments of Britain , Netherlands , Australia , Peru , Korea and the Soviet Union that a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was coming .
All important Japanese codes were broken .
FDR and Marshall and others knew the attack was coming , allowed it and covered up their knowledge .
9 . The Third Secret of Fatima [ Wikpedia ]
The Three Secrets of Fatima are said to be three prophecies that were given by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three young Portuguese shepherds , Lucia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto .
From May to October , 1917 , the three children claimed to have witnessed this Marian apparition , which is today popularly described as Our Lady of Fatima .
On July 13 the Virgin Mary is said to have entrusted the three secrets – in the form of prophecies – to the young visionaries .
Two of the secrets were revealed in 1941 in a document written by Lucia to assist with the canonization of her cousins , while the third was to remain secret , although the bishop of Leiria commanded Lucia to put it in writing and to present it to the Pope .
A Catholic priest who has apparently seen the original text of the “ third secret ” of Fatima disputes the official interpretation of the secret released by the Vatican .
Furthermore , he has asked key people in the Vatican about the text and has gotten no response .
While the Priest ’s comments are somewhat radical , they are not without merit , as he has seen the secret with his own eyes .
Moreover , while the first 2 secrets are fairly obvious and clear , leading some to wonder why the third one is required to be examined by a team of experts because of its complexity .
10 . The Philadelphia Experiment [ Wikpedia ]
The Philadelphia Experiment was an alleged naval military experiment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , sometime around the date of October 28 , 1943 , in which the U.S. destroyer escort USS Eldridge was to be rendered invisible to human observers for a brief period of time .
It is also referred to as Project Rainbow .
The story is widely regarded as a hoax .
The U.S. Navy has stated that the experiment never occurred , and furthermore , details of the story contradict stated facts about the Eldridge .
It has nonetheless caused a significant ripple effect in many conspiracy theory circles , and elements of the Philadelphia Experiment are featured in many other government conspiracy theories .
According to some accounts , the experiment was conducted by a Dr. Franklin Reno ( or Rinehart ) as a military application of a Unified Field Theory .
The theory , briefly , postulates the interrelated nature of the forces that comprise electromagnetic radiation and gravity .
Through a special application of the theory , it was thought possible , with specialized equipment and sufficient energy , to bend light around an object in such a way as to render it essentially invisible to observers .
The Navy considered this application of the theory to be of obvious military value ( especially as the United States was engaged in World War II at the time ) and both approved and sponsored the experiment .
A navy destroyer escort , the USS Eldridge , was fitted with the required equipment at the naval yards in Philadelphia .

There are so many conspiracy theories that this would be an unwieldy list if I included them all .

The California Air Resource Board is considering new certification standards for plug - in hybrid conversions that could make it more costly for companies to enter the market .
A draft proposal calls for companies that convert regular hybrids into plug - conversions to undergo emissions testing on par with new - vehicle tests .
It also requires manufacturers to provide warranties of seven to 10 years for different parts , and installers to provide warranties for incorrect installation .
Some plug - in hybrid advocates claim the requirements , if passed as proposed , could be a big barrier to putting plug - in hybrids on the road in California .
They fear the requirements could push the technology back a couple of years just as a crop of new plug - in hybrid conversion companies have popped up aimed at buyers who do n’t want to wait for major automakers to bring the vehicles to the market in 2010 .
But others say the requirements are badly needed to protect buyers who want to do good from paying to add ineffective – or environmentally damaging – products to their cars .
Craig Childers , an air resources engineer at the California Air Resources Board , also known as CARB , said the proposed certification process is expensive and challenging for small companies -- but necessary .
After all , Argonne National Laboratory tests have found that some conversions can actually increase emissions , he said .
“ If you take the hybrids like now , like the Prius , they are very tightly designed to meet emissions requirements , ” he said .
“ If you change anything – for example , if you start the engine , turn it off and wait too long before you start again , it ’s like another cold start – it can increase emissions .
They ’ve got to prove that emissions are not compromised . ”
Technically , certification is not a new requirement , Childers said .
All after - market parts that could impact emissions -- such as , say , turbo chargers -- already require certification .
Still , a certification process for plug - in hybrids has not existed before , and the proposal specifies how the board plans to certify plug - in hybrid kits , he said .
“ What we ’re doing is laying out a more detailed approach , ” he said .
“ The proposal specifies what [ companies ] would have to do to prove that emissions are not compromised .
You ca n’t take a car and make it worse than it was before ; that ’s the idea .
And the challenge is you ’re starting with the best cars in the world . ”
The creation of these specifics means that existing companies are going to have to certify their plug - in conversion kits , installing them on a vehicle and running through the same tests new manufacturers have to pass , he said .
Some companies that already have conversions on the road might end up failing those tests .
“ It ’s an awkward situation because it ’s much more complicated than people think , ” Childers said .
“ We need to make sure a conversion is as clean or cleaner than it was before it was converted – we want the same or better .
Everyone assumes they ’re doing good , but they may not be .
We need to make sure . ”
Robb Protheroe , owner of conversion - kit company Plug - In Supply , agreed that regulations are needed and called the proposal “ a good first draft . ”
But some of the proposed requirements are “ overly harsh , ” he said .
In particular , he said , the endurance - testing proposal seems like it could take pointless years to fulfill ( see the draft after - market parts - certification requirements here ) .
The test , set up to determine how a vehicle will deteriorate over time , would require a vehicle to drive ( or simulate driving ) for the miles equal to its expected useful life .
It would be tested for emissions after about 4,000 miles , then undergo a second emissions test after accumulating the required miles in the so - called durability test .
Protheroe suggested the test could be shortened if , instead of running the vehicle for its expected lifetime , the board simply tested an older battery already near the end of its life , because the vehicle emissions would be the worst at that point .
“ There are ways of simulating the end - of - life product , ” he said .
“ Instead of the lifetime test , why not jump to the end of the cycle ? ”
Other draft provisions with which Protheroe disagrees include one that would standardize a new Yazaki charging coupler for electric vehicles and one that would require batteries to charge in four hours or less ( see the draft electric - vehicle - charging requirements here ) .
He would like to see the standard require couplers equivalent to those made by Yazaki without specifying a manufacturer , in case other manufacturers come out with better technology , he said , and added he would like CARB to also specify some American - made options .
As far as the four - hour charging time , Protheroe said it would make more sense to draw power off the grid over a longer period of time , from a utility ’s standpoint , instead of having all the vehicles charge up in the same first four hours of the evening .
“ Even PG&E has said it would like it to be more drawn out , ” he said .
“ They have plenty of cheap power over a seven - hour window , so there ’s no reason to charge it all in the first four hours . ”
Plug - In Supply ’s charger takes six to eight hours to charge a 5 - kilowatt battery pack .
The four - hour requirement puts an extra burden on manufacturers to come up with new chargers , he said , and could even prevent plug - in hybrids from using standard wall outlets .
Overall , the main concern is the burden of the cost of the process , he said .
“ They could design a testing program that , if it ’s really expensive , the only ones who could do it are large car companies that are n’t too interested [ in doing conversions ] . ”
According to the proposal for after - market parts , applicants would have to pay for an engineering evaluation to test the impact on a vehicle ’s driveability , provide a vehicle to undergo the durability and emissions testing , provide warranties and – if selected by the board – provide another converted vehicle for in -use testing .
“ I understand they do n’t want a kit to turn a clean car into a dirty car , but [ these requirements ] are unduly harsh , ” he said .
“ Are they creating roadblocks ?
Are they under the influence of large car manufacturers ?
The problem is now .
We want to save the environment now .
They should be a little more reasonable in their approach . ”
As for Plug - In Supply , Protheroe said he is confident the company will be able to do whatever the regulations end up requiring .
“ It would just be a waste to have to wait two years , ” he said .
“ The public wants this stuff now ; it does n’t want to wait years .
In the worst - case scenario , we just would not sell to California .
It would hurt our sales , but it ’s not going to kill us . ”
Daniel Sherwood , president of Berkeley , Calif . - based 3 Prong Power , another conversion company , also warned that the four - hour charging requirement , along with the warranty specifications and another requirement that would require manufacturers to provide five vehicles for evaporative testing , could have serious impacts on plug - in hybrids and electric cars .
“ For a small after - market parts manufacturer , providing five vehicles for testing is an overly onerous requirement , ” he wrote in a letter to the board , adding a recommendation that manufacturers selling less than 1,000 cars or conversions per year provide only one test vehicle .
“ My company currently has just two project vehicles available for testing . ”
And the warranty requirement could essentially cut out lead - acid batteries -- widely available , inexpensive batteries that have been used for electric vehicles for decades -- from being used in conversion kits , he wrote .
“ These batteries clearly cannot achieve a seven - year lifespan , ” he wrote .
“ As long as consumers are made properly aware of their battery - lifespan expectations , there should be no problem with continuing to use shorter - than - seven - year - lifespan battery technology . ”
Sherwood asked the board to avoid stifling the innovation of “ nimble , progressive California small businesses and nonprofits ” in this field .
Chelsea Sexton , an electric - vehicle advocate who was featured in “ Who Killed the Electric Car ? ” , said she thinks the new standards will limit the market – but is n’t sure that ’s a bad thing .
It ’s important to guard the public against bad plug - in products , she said .
“ We ’re in a fishbowl and anything that happens is going to reflect on us as a movement , ” said Sexton , who also is a co-founder of Plug - In America , which promotes electric and plug - in hybrid cars .
“ Things are going to happen , but we need to do our best to guard against it .
There are 250,000 gasoline - car fires a year , and people do n’t say , ‘ We need to take them off the road , ’ but it ’s human nature to scrutinize the new . ”
She said she believes it ’s possible for small conversion companies to meet a minimum emissions standard , but added that she thinks there are other areas – such as the warranties – where the board has more options to meet “ the little guys ” in the middle .
Providing 10 - year warranties would be tough , and Sexton said she ’d like to see the board start with five - year warranties instead .
“ We want conversions to meet emission standards , ” she said .
“ We might argue about how to go about it , but the sentiment is a good thing . …
I ’m all for crash - tested , CARB - certified vehicles . ”
The board had a public workshop of the proposed test procedures last week , and originally had planned to accept public comments on the draft only until Tuesday ( see the agenda here and the staff presentation here ) .
Childers said the public comment period has been extended , but was n’t sure of the new deadline , which also is n’t yet available on the CARB Web site .
Before the extension , the board was scheduled to release a statement in September , followed by a 45 - day public comment period and a board hearing in October .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Three U.S. Marines and two interpreters were among 20 people killed Thursday when a suicide bomber attacked a meeting of tribal sheikhs in Iraq 's Anbar province , officials said .
Twenty people also were wounded in the attack .
A military statement said the Marines were " killed in action against an enemy force . "
However , Iraq 's Ministry of Interior said they died in the bombing .
The military had said earlier that coalition forces were among the casualties in the attack .
The suicide bomber struck the meeting in Karma , a town west of Baghdad , an Interior Ministry official said .
Coalition forces were among the casualties in the attack , which authorities believe was carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq .
The bomber detonated an explosives belt inside the Karma municipal council headquarters , according to police and an Awakening Council leader .
The official said Karma 's administrative director , three police officers and three sheikhs were among those killed .
In the northern Iraqi city of Mosul , 18 people were killed and more than 80 wounded in two bombings in the area of a busy market in central Mosul , authorities said .
Gov. Duraid Kashmoula said two Katyusha rockets landed near the provincial building in the crowded market area .
He went to inspect the location , and a parked car bomb detonated 25 meters away when he arrived .
He said he and his security detail escaped uninjured , except one guard who was hit by shrapnel in the stomach .
He said most of those injured in the attack were civilians .
The Interior Ministry gave a slightly different account , saying a roadside bomb targeted Kashmoula 's convoy .
Five of his security detail were wounded .
Moments later , a parked car bomb exploded , killing at least 18 people and wounding 80 , the U.S. military said .
An Iraqi police officer was among the dead ; the rest were civilians .
Of the wounded , nine were police , and the rest were civilians , the U.S. military said .
Elsewhere , coalition troops in central and northern Iraq killed two militants and detained 15 people Thursday , the U.S. military said .
The two deaths occurred near Sharqat , south of Mosul , and one of those killed was an al Qaeda in Iraq cell leader , the military said .
In one of the raids , troops captured two Egyptian men thought to be involved in suicide operations in Abu Ghraib .
In Karbala , a bomb attached to a minibus exploded Wednesday night near the Shiite shrine of Imam Abbas , killing a child and wounding four people , including the driver , a police official said .
The explosion took place about 7:30 p.m. after the minibus was stopped at a security checkpoint , the official said .
Iraqi police are investigating .
Karbala is about 60 miles ( 100 kilometers ) south of Baghdad .
A U.S. soldier was killed in Baghdad on Wednesday by a bomb attack , the U.S. military reported .
The death brings the number of American troop deaths in Iraq since Monday to eight .
In June , there have been 26 U.S. troop deaths in Iraq , still a low total in comparison with previous months of the war .
May 's death toll of 19 was the lowest monthly total of the war .
In 2007 , there were 125 troop deaths in May and 101 in June .
Since the war began , 4,110 U.S. service members have died in Iraq .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

Alberto Morpurgo and his team of researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands recently attached a micrometer - thick crystal of an organic polymer to a similarly thin organic crystal of a second polymer creating a thin but strongly conducting channel along the junction that acts like a metal .
The discovery could lead to a whole new way of making electronics from non-metallic materials , and even new superconductors .
Dr Alberto Morpurgo
( Credit : TU Delft ’s Kavli
Institute of Nanoscience )
The thin , flexible crystals which conform to each others ’ shape and stick together due to van der Waals forces are both electrical insulators .
Morpurgo ’s team found that a 2 - nanometre - thick strip along the interface between the two crystals conducts electricity as well as a metal .
While it was known that a blend of the two materials could conduct electricity , but it does so relatively poorly .
The two materials are physically unchanged when laid side - by - side , but the way electrons behave is subtly altered along the interface where the different materials are in close proximity .
Because the two plastics become more insulating at lower temperatures , during testing the combined materials were cooled down , expecting the odd behavior to disappear .
Surprisingly , the interface became a better conductor , just as metals offer less resistance to electricity when they are cooled .
While electrons inside each of the materials are usually unable to travel freely Morpurgo thinks that molecules at the interface are able to jump over to vacant spaces known as “ holes ” , so that they can travel freely , allowing current to flow .
“ Such an electron - hole system is really something new and it may have interesting electronic properties , ” Morpurgo says .
This new interface conducts electricity much better than standard semiconductors and has the power to create new effects , from magnetism to superconductivity .
TFOT recently covered a method to self - assemble metals into complex configurations as well as a new material which is as tough as metal but stretchy and light .
More about the new conducting plastic can be found on the Delft University of Technology website .

In recent months , several prominent analysts have taken aim at media reports that have allegedly miscast how well Chromebooks -- portable computers based on Google 's Chrome OS platform -- are doing in sales terms .
" There has been a ton of misreporting as many lazy reporters and bloggers have characterized this as all sales , which it was n't , or even consumer sales , which it most assuredly was not , " Stephen Baker of the NPD Group , has told Computerworld , for example .
Chromebooks are actually a fast growing part of the portable computer market , though , and Chrome OS has become an entrenched operating system .
Particularly in schools , these systems are making a difference , and now Asus and Acer are out with new models focused on the educational market .
Back in November we asked what you would do with an old unused laptop .
If you have an old laptop that ’s not doing much more than gathering dust , chances are you could put it to better use .
You could sell it , but you probably would n’t get too much for it .
Donating or recycling can also get it out your hair , but if you ’d like to try something different , read on for some ideas .
Salvage usable parts
Not the flashiest choice , but potentially the most useful one .
Just because the processor and RAM no longer meet your needs does n’t mean that the hard drive , optical drive , and even the LCD screen should be thrown out too .
All of these parts can be easily removed , and , with the exception of the screen in some cases , do not require total dismantling .
When removing any of these parts , be careful to remove all mounting screws and carefully detach any cables before removing it from the case .
LCD monitors almost always have a cable that attaches directly to the mainboard , and tearing it could render the monitor useless .
If you wreck it , you ’ll have to buy a new monitor to extend your desktop display .
Of course , you can also get a wealth of small parts from an old laptop , including screws , jumpers , heatsinks , cables , LEDs , and even keys from the keyboard .
FRC
Tech offers a good instructional page on the basics of dismantling a laptop , and a forum on ThinkComputers.com offers a comprehensive set of guides to taking apart many different Toshiba laptops .
Make a digital picture frame
A digital picture frame can be a great gift that you made yourself .
Your mom would probably like it more than the ceramic pencil holder you made in the third grade .
Unlike that time , though , you ’ll have to decide whether the frame will show only preloaded images or whether it will access an online source like Flickr .
PopSci.com offers this useful guide to building your own photo frame , as does Repair4Laptop.org .
Install Linux and make a media extender
Old laptops are n’t great at running memory or processor - intensive software , but they can make great Linux terminals .
You could outfit it with Linux for exclusive internet use , data storage , or even for controlling other devices like a home entertainment center .
Unfortunately you may also have to retrofit it with a larger harddrive or WiFi card to get better use out of it .
Yesterday we mentioned both MythTV and XBMC as alternative frontends .
This article at Linux.com has more information on building a Linux home media center .
There ’s also this guide by The MediaCenter Expert or this article by ZDNet ’s George Ou .
Get creative with upgrades
Sure , you could do the standard mods and add WiFi or Bluetooth , but why not get adventurous with your modding ?
You could give the old laptop a snazzy wooden case mod , an extremely potent air - cooling system , or switch to the qwerty keyboard out for a Dvorak keyboard .
Your imagination is the limit .
In the spirit of our previous post , what would you do ?
Measuring the Growth of the Web
June 1993 to June 1995
The World Wide Web was started originally proposed in 1989 and the first implementation appeared in 1990 .
The Web however , did not gain any widespread popular use until NCSA Mosaic became available in early 1993 .
In Spring of 1993 , I wrote the Wanderer to systematically traverse the Web and collect sites .
I was initially motivated primarily to discover new sites , as the Web was still a relatively small place .
As the Web grew rapidly , the focus quickly changed to charting the growth of the Web .
This report covers the period from June 1993 to June 1995 .
Tools
The primary tool used to collect the data presented here was the World Wide Web Wanderer , the first automated Web agent or " spider " .
The Wanderer was first functional in spring of 1993 and performed regular traversals of the Web from June 1993 to June 1995 .
Other valuable data sources include data from ZONE , a DNS walker and from the Merit Computer Network Backbone Statistics .
Methodology
The Wanderer was run on a monthly basis from June 1993 to June 1995 .
While the Wanderer certainly did not reach every site , it was run with consistent methodology , hopefully yielding consistent data for the growth of the Web .
Context
The Internet in general has grown quite fast .
Any look at the growth of the Web necessarily examines the growth of the Internet at large .
Doing so , particularly by looking at the data collected by ZONE and the Merit Computer Network , makes it all the clearer how fast the Web has grown , even compared to the explosive growth of the Internet in general .
Results
The Web has grown fast .
How fast ?
For the second half of 1993 , the Web had a doubling period of under 3 months , and even today the doubling period is still nearly 5 months .
Additionally , the percentage of Web sites that are commercial has increased dramatically .
The numbers below show the percentage growth in the .com domain , which excludes foreign commercial sites ( such as the .co.uk domain , etc. ) .
The growth of the Web has been remarkable even compared to the Internet at large , as shown by the number of hosts per Web server .
In June of 1995 , even with the phenomenal growth of the Internet , the number of Web servers soared to a point where one in every 270 machines on the Internet is a Web server .
Scientists have unveiled a hypothetical Scenario describing how a magnitude 7.8 Southern California earthquake - similar to the recent earthquake in China - would impact the region , causing loss of lives and massive damage to infrastructure , including critical transportation , power , and water systems .
In the Scenario , the earthquake would kill 1800 people , injure 50,000 , cause $ 200 billion in damage , and have long - lasting social and economic consequences .
This is the most comprehensive analysis ever of what a major Southern California earthquake would mean , and is the scientific framework for what will be the largest earthquake preparedness drill in California history , scheduled for November 13 , 2008 .
The November preparedness exercise , " Golden Guardian ' 08 , " will test the ability of emergency responders to deal with the impact of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in Southern California , and is being jointly organized by the Governor 's Office of Emergency Services and the California Office of Homeland Security .
The Golden Guardian exercise will occur during a week - long series of public events planned for the " Great Southern California ShakeOut . "
A June 4th kick - off event is planned for the " ShakeOut " to help communities plan to respond to the risks highlighted in the Scenario .
The scientific report describing the ShakeOut Scenario , jointly published by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) and the California Geological Survey ( CGS ) , will be released May 21 during a Congressional hearing in Washington , D.C. The House Committee on Natural Resources , Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources , led by Chairman Jim Costa ( D - CA ) , will hold an oversight hearing on USGS efforts to prepare for future earthquakes .
Although imaginary , the Shakeout Scenario is based on scientists ' best predictions of what would actually occur during and after a major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault .
The Scenario outlines a hypothetical earthquake in which :
The strongest shaking and greatest damage is near the stretch of the San Andreas Fault that extends through the fastest growing areas of Southern California , including the Coachella Valley , Inland Empire and Antelope Valley .
At least 10 million people will be exposed to heavy shaking .
California 's efforts at mitigation have concentrated on life safety and have been largely successful .
Thus , in spite of the large numbers of people in highly shaken areas , deaths are estimated at only 1,800 .
Building types known to be vulnerable to damage and collapse , do indeed sustain major damage .
All un-reinforced masonry buildings within 15 miles of the San Andreas Fault are completely destroyed .
Those that are not retrofitted kill many occupants .
Many other older building types without retrofitting contribute to over $ 33 billion in damage to buildings .
The fault offsets all lifelines crossing into Southern California at Cajon Pass ( Interstate 15 ) , San Gorgonio Pass ( Interstate 10 ) and along Route 14 , including pipelines , power lines , roads , railways , telecommunications and aqueducts .
Strong shaking continues in downtown Los Angeles for 55 seconds - nearly 8 times longer than in the Northridge Earthquake
The prolonged , strong shaking heavily damages and sometimes collapses hundreds of old brick buildings , thousands of older commercial and industrial concrete buildings , many wood - frame buildings , and even a few , high - rise steel buildings .
Over 600,000 buildings suffer at least some damage that causes tens of thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths , and leaves many thousands of people without homes or jobs .
Fire doubles the fatalities and economic losses .
Around Southern California , there will be 1,600 fires started large enough to warrant a 911 call , and some fires merge into conflagrations that burn hundreds of city blocks .
Assuming no Santa Ana winds , the models still indicate a further $ 65 billion in direct losses and $ 22 billion in indirect losses from the fires .
Nearly two thirds of the hospital beds are non-functional in Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , and San Bernardino counties .
At the same time , 50,000 people will seek treatment at emergency rooms .
Thanks to a $ 6 billion investment in seismic safety , the State highway system fares well .
However , although collapse is avoided , some bridges are non-functional so that much of the highway is not passable on the day of the event .
The long duration of shaking takes a greater toll on bridges and overpasses under the jurisdiction of cities and counties where the retrofitting processes are not complete or have not begun .
The largest long - term economic disruption comes from damage to the water distribution system .
Damage to this system will be so extensive that some areas will have to replace the whole system , and some buildings will be without water for as long as 6 months .
The direct and indirect business interruption costs attributed to the lack of water will be $ 50 billion .
Most of the damage is predictable and much is preventable .
Individuals can protect themselves and help their community by :
Storing more water than they already have Keeping a fire extinguisher and knowing how to use it .
Securing their space .
This means securing building contents from flying around and reinforcing a building they own to the most current standards .
" The planned emergency drill is underpinned by the most comprehensive analysis ever of what a major Southern California earthquake would mean on the ground , " said Dr. Lucile Jones , chief scientist for U.S. Geological Survey 's Southern California Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project .
" We know this science will help state and local agencies develop comprehensive emergency - response plans that will help us avoid the worst impacts of a major quake . "
The ShakeOut Scenario is the product of an interdisciplinary collaboration of over 300 scientists , engineers , and other experts from several agencies , including the USGS , the California Geological Survey , Southern California Earthquake Center , California Office of Emergency Services and Seismic Safety Commission .
To create the Scenario , geologists determined the amount of potential motion on the part of the San Andreas Fault with the greatest risk of imminent rupture , a 200 - mile long section from the Salton Sea in the Coachella Valley to just south of Gorman .
From this , seismologists and computer scientists modeled the ground shaking .
Engineers and building professionals used the models of ground shaking to estimate damage to the built environment .
And from these damages , social scientists evaluated emergency response , casualties , and the impact on our economy and society .
A copy of the full technical report , The ShakeOut Scenario , is available online at http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1150.

Entering !!
in normal mode is translated to :.!
Appending a command sends the current line to the command replacing it with command 's result !! date : Replace current line with date !! which command : Replace current line with the absolute path to command !!
tr -d AEIO : translate current line deleting As , Es , Is , and Os from the current line
You can also use ! on a visual selection .
Select an area with one of the visualmode commands , and then type ! command to pipe the whole selection through command .
This is equivalent to :'< ,'>!
command .
For example , after selecting multiple lines with visualmode : ! sort : sort selected lines ! grep word : keep only lines containing ' word ' in the selected range .
Multiple files
:wn : write file and move to next ( SUPER ) :bd : remove file from buffer list ( SUPER ) :sav php.html :

Launching programs under Windows
There are a number of options to run applications on the Windows platform .
This causes Windows to launch the program associated with the file extension .
It also restores the paste buffer to its original value :
" This command will execute the file , for example , if this is an " HTML file , it will run : " start c:\absolute\filename.html nnoremap < silent > < C - F6 > : let old_reg=@ " < CR >: let @ " =substitute ( expand ( " % : p " ) , " / " , " \\ " , " g " ) <CR>:silent !!cmd /cstart <C - R><C - R >" < CR >< CR >:let @ " =old_reg <CR >
You can also use Windows rundll 32.exe for some options :
" vmap < silent > < C - F5 > :< C-U>let old_reg=@ " <CR>gvy:silent!!start rundll32.exe url.dll , FileProtocolHandler <C - R><C - R >" < CR >< CR >:let @ " =old_reg <CR >
Or , for example , you can launch Internet Explorer directly :
: nmap < Leader >f :update<CR >:silent ! start c:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe file://%:p<CR > :nmap < Leader > i :update<CR >:! start c:\progra~1\intern~1\iexplore.exe < cWORD >< CR >

The Buffer Explorer scripts mentioned above ( \be \bs ) rely on the popular script bufexplorer.vim .
Have recently started to appreciate taglist.vim ( the most popular Vim script ) it really comes into it's own with very long programs containting lots of subroutines / functions as it shows which function / sub you 're in etc script # 273 .

In regular expressions you must backslash + ( match 1 or more ) .

\v ( very magic ) reduces backslashing

Might delete some of these if covered in other tips .
Instead of this :

and possibly these :
map < F11 > : set hls !< Bar > set hls ?< CR > map < F10 > : set paste !< Bar > set paste ?< CR > map < F9 > : set wrap !< Bar > set wrap ?< CR >
to easily change ( and display ) the current state .
If you do not want to remove Windows key mappings , keep the line
noremap <C - kPlus > < C -A >
in your vimrc .
Then you can use Ctrl - NumPad+ to increment numbers as others do with Ctrl - A .
Another very useful mapping :
noremap < C - J > gj noremap < C - K > gk
That 's really useful when dealing with long lines .
It lets you use Control - J and Control - K to move up and down screen lines instead of buffer lines with j and k.
Control - J is n't really mapped to anything by default , it 's like hitting enter , but Control - K is something to do with digraphs .
However , noremap wo n't remove this ability in insert mode .
Alternatively , you could use :
noremap < Up > gk noremap < Down > gj
which would map the arrow keys to screen line movement instead of buffer line movement .
To substitute any word ( say FILE ) by actual filename you can use
:%s/FILE/\=expand ( " % :t " )
The mappings to wrap visual selections in text clobbers a buffer .
I use :
vmap s( < Esc>`>a ) < Esc >`< i(< Esc > : wrap a visual selection in ()
What was the point of changing < Esc > into < esc > and < Tab > into < tab > ?
The capitalized form is what 's used in Vim 's help , and it's what should be used here .
( Spiiph 03:34 , December 6 , 2009 ( UTC ) )
unfixed it . sorry .
( perhaps this would have been better been placed in the discussion
Thanks for working on the tip .
I might join in later .
We put comments in plain view in the " Comments " section ( so I removed the html comment ) and we avoid the talk page ( see the discussion guidelines for a little more ) .
In due course we will delete these temporary comments , and what is on the talk page .
It 's hard to know what to do with this tip .
I think it should pretty well all be kept , but we should resist the temptation to expand it much ( some better explanations are good ) .
I 'll think about how we might provide links to tips that expand some points , for example Tutorial .

Commands are case sensitive :
c : starts a change command C : change to end of line ( same as c$ ) ce : change to end of word ( a complete change command )
Does ce belong as an example of case sensitive command ?
Would better additional entry be
a : append after cursor A : Append at end of line

Help for help
Is it me or does this section have a mix of syntax for control characters ?
DG12 13:51 , December 6 , 2009 ( UTC )
My thoughts on comments by DG12 above and on my talk :
By " all be kept " above , I mean that the content is probably all good and should not be removed ( although there 's a lot of it , and when I take some time to look through it again I might change my mind ) .
Re the format of the tip :
The current plain text with just a ' :' separating command and text is a bit confusing in places , but the simplicity rather suits Vim .
I have used cleartable in a couple of tips , and I might try it here .
See VimTip605 for an example .
Wikitable is also available , but it 's rather overwhelming ; see VimTip1611 for an example .
Re the style of the tip :
The quirky comments are often not directly helpful but they worked well for me when I first read this tip ( at vim.org ) several years ago .
For example " : set ignorecase : you nearly always want this " alerts readers that they should find out what the command means and consider using it .
If every point were clarified , the tip would be far too long and hard to read .
Currently the tip is useful because it provides a subjective overview of what people should look for in Vim .

Re the case sensitive point above :
While a / A is a good example , it 's not needed as an additional example .
I think the ce is to show a complete change command .
It might be a good idea to replace the c / C / ce with a / A which makes the point .
Actually , even better might be j /J because the two actions are totally different .

The " Help for help " section is perhaps confusing , but it is exactly correct because it shows what a person should type .
Like many of the items , it could be improved while resisting the tempation to add too many words .
Finally thanks for drawing attention to this page because the tip does need cleaning , and discussion and work will help .
JohnBeckett 01:03 , December 7 , 2009 ( UTC )
re Help for help : I was refering to :
:h ctrl < C - D > : list help of all control keys :h CTRL - R : normal mode
or maybe I am confused ?
( Be nice ! )
I also think some people know the info so well what is unclear to someone reading the tip may not seem awkward at all .
re case sensitive example : I choose a / A because many ( well some ) of the uppercase form of the command are like BIG versions of the lowercase version w/ W b/ B h/ H i/ I ...
re " quirky " comments : may mean something to look into but without a link its not much help .
Then there is the length of this document which makes scrolling difficult !

Wii players use a wireless wand that detects acceleration in three dimensions
Only certain games are effective - those requiring delicate movements .
The fine hand control required to play these games acts as a warm up and hones scalpel skills the Banner Good Samaritan Medical Centre team claim .
Now they are designing Wii software that will accurately simulate surgical procedures , New Scientist reports .
They asked eight trainee surgeons to spend an hour playing the games on a console before performing " virtual reality " surgery on a computer system .
Wii warm -up
Game players scored nearly 50 % higher on tool control and overall performance than other trainees .
Marble Mania , in which a ball is guided through a 3D obstacle course - was particularly effective in the study .
Researcher Kanav Kohel explained that the type of game play was crucial .
" You do n't gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket .
" The whole point about surgery is to execute small finely controlled movements with your hands , and that is exactly what you get with the Wii . "
The fine control needed to move a virtual marble around a 3D maze is similar to the skills needed to perform keyhole surgery , for example .
Colleague Mark Marshall said the games consoles were cheap enough to be used to train surgeons in poorer countries where cutting - edge virtual reality systems were not available .
The researchers will present their work at the Medicine Meets Virtual Reality conference in California later in January .

Talking Points Memo is reporting this evening that the McCain campaign is gearing up to air ads in the four major media markets in the state of Virginia .
Is this a sign that the McCain camp is worried that this long time red state is ready to turn blue ?
The campaign will start airing a sixty second ad next Tuesday in Norfolk , Richmond , Roanoke , and Tri-Cities .
They did n’t spend a lot of money on the ad because it is only slated to run four or five times a week compared to the four or five times a day McCain ’s first ad aired in my home market of Pittsburgh , but if McCain is n’t worried about Virginia , he should be .
Virginia has not voted for a Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , and until this cycle was considered a solidly Republican state .
However , changing demographics have turned Virginia into a state that now trends Democratic .
After Mark Warner disposes of Jim Gilmore this fall , the state will have a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators .
Advertisements
The early polls in Virginia show Obama with a slim 1 - 2 point lead , but the state is split 50/50 along age , race , and gender lines .
The Obama campaign sees the state as critical to their November strategy , especially if Florida goes for McCain , and they have already been sending key staff members to organize and are planning ad buys for the state .
This where Obama ’s fundraising advantage really pays off for him .
At worst , he will force McCain to spend some of his limited resources in a state that George W. Bush carried twice .
At best , he will tip the state into his column .
Either way , it is a win-win for the Democratic nominee .

Aspirations of Being a Weirdo
We all have dreams .
Deep seeded ambitions that struggle to surface through the daily grind of our mundane routines .
Mr. Tsukasa Okazaki , a 45 year - old banker in Hokkaido , dreamed of being known as a “ weirdo ” .
To achieve his dreams , Tsukasa put on a womens sweater and trousers , slapped on some make - up , and headed into the ladies restroom at the Eon Asahikawa Nishi Shopping Center .
Not wearing a wig , Tsukasa was clearly recognizable as a cross -dresser .
A store employee nabbed him after exiting the public toilet .
He was arrested and charged with trespassing .
“ I wanted people to see me as some sort of weirdo , ” he told the police .
Congrats …

Who ’s thirsty ?
Between the barbecues , national holidays and beach vacations , cold beers become a necessity in many households over the summer months .
As we pay more attention to the way our food is grown , harvested and transported , perhaps we owe it to the environment to be as vigilant with our beer .
But how easy is it to find environmentally - conscientious breweries ?
Beer brewing is not the most environmentally - friendly of activities , particularly regarding water usage .
On average , six gallons of water are required to brew one gallon of beer – a ratio that must be drastically reduced in dry areas .
Wastewater , carbon emissions and huge energy generators also contribute to the environmental sins of the industry .
But more breweries are taking notice of the eating public ’s environmental awakening .
While the biggest multinational breweries are beginning to make structural changes that promote sustainability , most of the greenest beers are ( unsurprisingly ) local and regional ones .
Microbreweries are great agents of change because they interact with the communities that surround them .
Their smaller size and community feeling make them more amenable to change , so it is easier to petition them and request more sustainable practices .
Below are the top five eco-minded , North American mid-sized breweries :
1.New Belgium Beer ( Distribution : Western U.S. )
This small - scale Colorado brewer takes a multilateral approach to its greening .
The brewing kettles trap steam energy during the brewing process and reuse it .
The facilities use solar and compressed florescent lighting .
Shelving and other building materials are made from trees killed by invasive beetle species rather than virgin wood .
The company has also implemented a wastewater treatment process to reclaim used water .
The methane generated from the treatment is then collected and used as an on - site generated alternative energy .
In addition to steam and methane energy , New Belgium was the first wind - powered brewery back in 1999 .
They continue to use wind - powered energy today .
As if all of this were n’t enough , New Belgium donates 1 % of all revenue to environmental causes .
2.Steamwhistle ( Distribution : Canada )
This Canadian brewery wins for recycling and material waste - reduction efforts .
Their logo is etched onto the glass bottles , freeing the facility of paper - wasting labels and toxic paper dyes and glosses .
All packaging is made from recycled materials and the bottles themselves are recyclable .
They can be returned to the facility via drop - offs at beer stores , washed and reused up to 30 times .
Even the grains are recycled : spent hops are sent to local farmers to be used as animal feed .
Energy efficiency is also a priority .
Steamwhistle uses primarily steam heat and fuels its delivery trucks with 100 % biodiesel .
They recently built a new brewhouse with 30 % more efficiency .
Additionally , Steamwhistle participates in an alternative refrigeration method that is specific to the Ontario area : deep lake water cooling .
Ice cold water from the bottom of Lake Ontario is piped throughout the facility and then back into the lake , providing enough chill to forgo air conditioning .
3. Long Trail Brewing Company ( Distribution : New England and Mid-Atlantic )
Vermont - based Long Trail makes a line called Eco -Brew that is created using a multilateral approach much like Breweries # 1 and # 2 .
The “ spent mash ” from brewing is sent to area farmers as cow feed .
The kettle steam is recovered and stored for energy and heating .
Wastewater is treated and recycled , reducing water usage .
Their on - site vehicles are powered by biodiesel from their pub ’s kitchen grease and they invest in local alternative energy cooperative , Cow Power , which – in addition to providing alternative energy – provides financial support to independent dairy farmers who suffer from competition with corporate farms .
4. Sierra Nevada Brewing Company ( Distribution : U.S. )
Sierra Nevada uses fuel cell technology to power their brewing and has won California ’s highest award for waste reduction .
In 2006 , their website says , they diverted 97 % of their total waste from landfills through a combination of waste reduction and creative recycling .
Sierra Nevada also recovers both steam heat and carbon dioxide for reuse in the facility .
Like the other eco-minded breweries , Sierra Nevada treats and reclaims its wastewater and sends its spent mash to local farms .
5. Brooklyn Brewery ( Distribution : Eastern U.S. , Canada , Western Europe , Turkey , Japan and Hong Kong )
The Brooklyn Brewery was the first New York City company to convert to 100 % wind - powered energy back in 2003 .
They continue to fuel their brewing with wind .
Honorable Mention : Lambic Beer
Made in the Senne Valley of Belgium during the time of year that wild yeast travels in the wind .
Instead of brewing with an industrial kettle only , this beer is crafted by allowing giant barrels of mash to sit outside exposed to the wild yeast and letting nature take its course .
Truly , a naturally - fermented beer .

I think this is the most interesting Reusable Bag story yet …
Target teams up with Newsweek and Terracycle to create reusable totes out of fused target plastic bags !
Finally - a recycled reusable bag that looks like the bags it came from and is replacing !
And that ’s not all … the Newsweek aspect is fascinating as well - you rip off the cover of the latest “ green ” issue , and are taught how to tape up the cover into a prepaid envelope that you can put Target plastic bags in , and mail them in for a coupon to get one of the Terracycle $ 6 ReTotes for free in a Target Store .
Basically the bags end up feeling much like those blue / yellow IKEA bags ~ a bit on the crunchy side , and probably waterproof ( with the exception of the seam perhaps .
See the press release here .
So in usual NOTCOT fashion , we could n’t help ourselves , and picked up an issue , took a few sneaky shots in Target of the display , and walk you through the whole process in pictures on the next page !
I suppose my one biggest question is … these bags made in Vietnam , are they actually out of bags people have recycled ?
Or did they use new bags to make the first batch of bags to get this whole program rolling ?
Scott Stevenson interviews Aaron Hillegass about the new edition of Aaron 's book , programmers ' fear of the NIB file , and why there are n't more Macs in corporate America .

Scott Stevenson :
What sort of experience should a developer already have before reading Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X ?
Do they need to know anything about using Apple 's development tools or Objective -C ?
Aaron Hillegass :
One of the most difficult things about writing a book is choosing your audience .
It would be great to write a book that assumes nothing ; anyone could read it .
However , an experienced programmer would find the resulting book painfully tedious .
In the end , I decided to assume that readers are familiar with the C programming language and thinking in an object - oriented manner .
The reader with this base knowledge will find Objective - C to be a rather unsurprising language , so the book moves quickly through the fundamentals of Objective - C and into the design patterns of Cocoa .
Scott : Conversely , how far does this edition take the reader ?
In other words , if a developer has already stumbled through the basics , knows the Objective - C syntax , and has compiled a few sample apps , will they find this book useful ?
Aaron : I think the old adage rings true : " If you only know how to use a hammer , everything looks like a nail . "
The typical self - taught Cocoa programmer has mastered a few concepts and uses them in every situation .
By going through the book from beginning to end , the reader gets familiarity with a large collection of ideas and technologies .
This deeper understanding results in better , more reliable applications — because the reader uses the Cocoa frameworks as they were intended to be used .
The book does n't cover everything — that would take thousands of pages — but I have done my best to identify and explain the concepts that the average Cocoa programmer uses on the average day .
There is also some interesting feedback in the system :
Because my book has become the standard approach to learning Cocoa programming , a lot of documentation and discussion on the internet assumes that the audience has read it .
Thus , the chapters in the book now represent the core knowledge that every Cocoa programmer is expected to have .
Scott : I see that you 've refined many of the existing chapters , as well as added brand new material .
Which new chapter did you find the most interesting to write , and which existing chapter received the most re-working ?
Aaron :
For years , I have taught students in my classes how to do view swapping in an elegant , maintainable way .
With 10.5 , Apple added the NSViewController to Cocoa .
It is n't nearly as glamourous as Core Data or Core Animation , but I think the chapter on View Swapping was the most satisfying addition because it is a technique that Cocoa programmers use daily .
The NSArrayController chapter was reworked so much that it eventually underwent mitosis and became two chapters :
One dedicated just to the ideas of Key - Value Coding and Key - Value Observing and a second devoted to the mechanics of using these ideas with NSArrayController .
Scott : I 've seen emails from novice developers who liked the way the previous editions of the book were written , but were confused how they did n't match up with the recent changes in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard .
Has all of that been addressed now ?
Aaron : If Apple would just stop innovating , I would stop rewriting this book and write new ones instead .
Yes , the third edition is now up - to - date with Xcode 3.1 and Mac OS X 10.5 .
The world outside Apple has also been changing .
For example , web services have also become very important , so I added the web services chapter to the book .
Scott :
What was the most challenging part of writing this edition of the book ?
Aaron :
The technologies documented in the first and second edition of the book had been around for a decade , and the community had developed a set of common idioms and best - practices .
I could authoritatively say , " This is how we do it . "
The new technologies — Core Animation , Garbage Collection , and Core Data — do n't have a deep history .
No one can speak about their use with complete authority .
I did my best to study how the engineers who created them wanted the technologies to be used .
Scott :
Is the material in this book a good starting point for developers looking to hit the ground running with the iPhone SDK , or are the development concepts too different ?
Do you plan to write a book specific to iPhone development ?
Aaron :
There is , at this point , no better starting point for iPhone development than " Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X . "
If you understand the book , you can get started with iPhone development .
There are ideas that have changed — for example , controls on the iPhone can have multiple targets and actions — but they have evolved naturally from the ideas of Cocoa programming .
In September , Big Nerd Ranch ( my company ) will debut its iPhone Development Bootcamp .
That class , which will be every bit as brilliant as our Cocoa Bootcamp , is going to focus only on iPhone development .
By removing ideas like the pasteboard , we create time and space for discussions of iPhone - specific topics like the CoreLocation framework and the accelerometer .
Perhaps that class will become a book someday , but we need to test and improve it in the classroom for a while first .
Scott :
What would you say to new developers who are trying to figure out if they should learn Objective - C or use one of the Cocoa scripting bridges in Leopard ?
On a related note , what do you think about the comments from those who say Apple should have based the iPhone SDK on Java or C ++?
Aaron :
For fifty years , there has been a heated debate going on about programming languages .
In the meantime , real programmers have been solving real problems with imperfect languages like Perl and Objective - C. Why ?
Perl and Objective - C have three things in common :
They come with incredible libraries .
Perl has CPAN and Objective - C has Cocoa .
They do n't get in your way .
Both languages have good performance and loose typing .
They are easy to learn .
Ruby and Python are lovely scripting languages , and you can write Cocoa applications with them after you learn Objective -C !
Cocoa was written in Objective - C and for Objective - C. You will never really understand Cocoa until you understand Objective -C .
It is true that some people have voiced the opinion that the iPhone SDK should have been based on languages other than Objective - C. However , it is important to note that none of these people have ever shipped an application written in Objective - C. Anyone who has used Objective - C knows that it is an able work - horse .
Scott :
What do you think are the most common misconceptions that new Mac developers have coming from Windows , Java , or even traditional C++ GUI toolkits ?
Aaron : Fear of the NIB file .
Experienced Cocoa programmers put a lot of the smarts of their application in the NIB file .
As a result , their project has a lot less code .
Programmers who have spent a few years working in Visual Studio get freaked out .
They ask me stuff like , " Can I write Cocoa apps without using Interface Builder ?
I like to see the code .
Maybe I can just explicitly create my windows and the views that go on it ? "
It is difficult to explain how the NIB file ( and a few other scary ideas ) create leverage .
It is that leverage that enables one guy in his basement to compete with a team of engineers at Microsoft or Adobe .
It is like I showed a chain saw to a early American colonist , and he said , " Can I cut down the tree without starting the engine ?
I do n't like the noise .
Maybe I can just bang it against the tree ? "
Scott : I think a lot of developers wonder how to get their work noticed by potential employers , customers , and the community .
Do you have any suggestions ?
Aaron :
One of the nice things about the Mac community is that quality gets noticed .
People love their Macs , and anything or anyone who can make it better will get recognized in blogs and discussion groups and magazine articles .
The Mac community has been very kind to me ; people have spent a lot of energy explaining the strengths and weaknesses of my books and my classes .
I could n't be more grateful .
Scott :
What sort of effect do you think the iPhone will have on the Mac development community ?
Do you think they 'll divide into separate camps , or is it more likely that the lines will blur ?
Do you expect to see an influx of new Mac developers from the iPhone ?
Aaron :
It is a great time to be a Cocoa programmer .
Apple is selling 50 % more Macs than they did a year ago .
They are selling iPhones by the boatload .
The Cocoa community is , in the grand scheme of things , rather small right now .
I suspect that it will double in size over the next two years .
Everyone in that community will know how to write code for either device .
But !
A good iPhone app is going to be very different from a good Mac app .
iPhone apps are going to be smaller and simpler .
Overall , I suspect that a brilliant iPhone app will take six months to write , while a brilliant Mac app takes five years .
I suspect that there will be two camps — not because the skill sets are different , but because iPhone programmers will have different personalities and proclivities than Mac programmers .
Scott :
The Mac appears to be making real inroads in the mainstream consumer computing market , and certainly the iPhone is doing the same .
Do you expect to see this carry over to the corporate world ?
Aaron : Apple seems to doing its best to keep Macs out of the corporate world .
Most dialogues between Apple and a corporation go something like this :
Corporation :
Hey , does Cocoa include something to help us write apps that talk to our Oracle database ?
Apple : Um , nope .
But is n't GarageBand cool ?
Corporation : Hmm .
Scott :
What do you find most rewarding about the books you 've written and the classes you 've taught ?
Seeing the light go on in the student 's head , seeing them ship an app , or something else ?
Aaron : I 'm a good programmer —
I 've written large medical , military , and financial systems — but that is not my calling .
I am a teacher , and I live to get people to " Aha ! "
Over my career , I 've developed and tested many theories about teaching and learning .
Now , I want to make these ideas manifest in a physical form .
I have purchased some land , and I 'm working with architects to design an environment for learning — the new Big Nerd Ranch .
Scott : Mac development has changed a lot in the last few years , and dramatically so in the last six months .
What sort of things surprise you when you see them now versus how things were when the first edition of the book came out in 2002 ?
Aaron : I think people overestimate how much has changed since 1991 .
If we thawed out a developer who had been writing an app for the NeXT computer in 1992 , he would not feel out of place on Mac OS X 10.5 .
The last 16 years have been spent making significant , but evolutionary , steps toward fulfilling the promises embodied by the elegant ideas in NeXTSTEP 1.0 .
Scott :
When you 're not busy writing , do you spend most of your time teaching classes in person , or are you involved in other projects ?
Aaron : I teach about a dozen classes each year .
I continue to help our clients write applications for the Mac , and now the iPhone , but as Big Nerd Ranch grows , I spend more and more of my day being a business guy .
We are always developing new courses on technologies like Django and Android — I spend a lot of time editing these new courses .
Scott : Will you be at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in June ?
How should developers that want to meet you in person at the conference try to track you down ?
Aaron : I 'll be at WWDC , and I 'm always happy to meet new people .
I am pretty easy to spot — I 'm quite tall and I wear a cowboy hat .
Please come say hello .

ESA ’s orbiting X - ray observatory XMM - Newton has been used by a team of international astronomers to uncover part of the missing matter in the universe .
Ten years ago , scientists predicted that about half of the missing ‘ ordinary ’ or normal matter made of atoms exists in the form of low - density gas , filling vast spaces between galaxies .
All the matter in the universe is distributed in a web - like structure .
At dense nodes of the cosmic web are clusters of galaxies , the largest objects in the universe .
Astronomers suspected that the low - density gas permeates the filaments of the web .
The low density of the gas hampered many attempts to detect it in the past .
With XMM - Newton ’s high sensitivity , astronomers have discovered its hottest parts .
The discovery will help them understand the evolution of the cosmic web .
Only about 5 % of our universe is made of normal matter as we know it , consisting of protons and neutrons , or baryons , which along with electrons , form the building blocks of ordinary matter .
The rest of our universe is composed of elusive dark matter ( 23 % ) and dark energy ( 72 % ) .
Small as the percentage might be , half of the ordinary baryonic matter is unaccounted for .
All the stars , galaxies and gas observable in the universe account for less than a half of all the baryons that should be around .

Scientists predicted that the gas would have a high temperature and so it would primarily emit low - energy X - rays .
But its very low density made observation difficult .
Astronomers using XMM - Newton were observing a pair of galaxy clusters , Abell 222 and Abell 223 , situated at a distance of 2300 million light - years from Earth , when the images and spectra of the system revealed a bridge of hot gas connecting the clusters .
" The hot gas that we see in this bridge or filament is probably the hottest and densest part of the diffuse gas in the cosmic web , believed to constitute about half the baryonic matter in the universe , " says Norbert Werner from SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research , leader of the team reporting the discovery .
“ The discovery of the warmest of the missing baryons is important .
That ’s because various models exist and they all predict that the missing baryons are some form of warm gas , but the models tend to disagree about the extremes , ” adds Alexis Finoguenov , a team member .
Even with XMM - Newton ’s sensitivity , the discovery was only possible because the filament is along the line of sight , concentrating the emission from the entire filament in a small region of the sky .
The discovery of this hot gas will help better understand the evolution of the cosmic web .
" This is only the beginning .
To understand the distribution of the matter within the cosmic web , we have to see more systems like this one .
And ultimately launch a dedicated space observatory to observe the cosmic web with a much higher sensitivity than possible with current missions .
Our result allows to set up reliable requirements for those new missions . " concludes Norbert Werner .
ESA ’s XMM - Newton Project Scientist , Norbert Schartel , comments on the discovery , “ This important breakthrough is great news for the mission .
The gas has been detected after hard work and more importantly , we now know where to look for it .
I expect many follow - up studies with XMM - Newton in the future targeting such highly promising regions in the sky . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans are already paying through the nose for gasoline , and they think it 's only going to get worse .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 94 % of respondents expect they will have to pay $ 4 a gallon sometime this year - and 78 % said they figure it will hit $ 5 .
The national average for gasoline was $ 3.61 on Monday , according to motorist group AAA .
Consumers ' fears that they will have to pay more have intensified .
A year ago , 79 % thought gas would cost $ 4 by the end of 2007 and only 28 % feared $ 5 gas .
At the same time , high prices seem to be easier to swallow now than it has been for most consumers in the past .
Of the more than 1,000 American adults surveyed in the poll , conducted April 28 - 30 , 60 % said high fuel prices have caused hardship for them or their household .
That 's down from 72 % in March and 66 % during the same time last year .
Demand for gas is down
But if Americans feel better able to absorb the rising price of gas , it might be because they are driving less .
In fact , demand for gas is far below the average for this time of year .
" It takes a big jump in prices to alter commuters ' behavior , but it appears we have now approached that level , " said Stephen Schork , editor of energy industry newsletter The Schork Report .
And with crude oil topping $ 120 a barrel for the first time Monday , gas may continue its historic rise .
" With oil prices so high and demand so low , refiners ' incentive to produce gasoline is very thin , " noted Schork , saying that low gasoline supplies have meant higher prices for consumers .
In addition to cutting back on driving , consumers are also buying more fuel - efficient vehicles .
U.S. automakers reported a continued drop in SUV and truck sales in April , but smaller cars and hybrid vehicles have increased dramatically .
Sales of Toyota 's hybrid Prius rose 67 % in April .
No end in sight
Of course , for some Americans in California , Hawaii , and other western states , $ 4 gas is already a reality .
Gas prices have set record after record , rising 18.4 % nationwide this year .
Most of that increase has come in the past month .
Last month , the U.S. Department of Energy said that the national average price of gasoline would hit a high of $ 3.60 this year .
But gas prices have already surpassed that forecast well before the typical peak in gasoline prices in June , leading some analysts to raise their forecasts toward a high beyond $ 4 .
" For gas prices to come down significantly , we 'll have to see a material depreciation in the value of crude , but with prices hitting $ 120 , it does n't look like that 's happening any time soon , " Schork said .
" We 'll see a national average of $ 4 , $ 4.10 , $ 4.20 and maybe even $ 4.30 , " added Schork , saying that $ 5 gas was indeed possible in certain parts of the country by the end of the spring .
Where do consumers place the blame ?
With oil companies like ExxonMobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) and Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) taking home record income in the past year , 83 % said oil companies are making too much profit .
In the 1999 - 2000 US election , the drug industry spent more money on political lobbying than any other industry .

Over the past couple days , a new issue has emerged in the 2008 presidential race .
It emerged from the McCain campaign itself : McCain has a problem with birth control — and that issue is becoming a major political liability for him .
He looks very old - fashioned , very out - of - touch and very uncaring about women .
This all started when top McCain adviser Carly Fiorina opened this real can of worms earlier this week when she raised the issue of the disparate treatment from insurance companies for Viagra , used by men , and most birth control used by women :
Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett - Packard chief who is now the Republican National Committee ’s “ Victory Chairman , ” was discussing consumer - driven health insurance at a breakfast with reporters when she proposed “ a real , live example which I ’ve been hearing a lot about from women :
There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but wo n’t cover birth - control medication .
Those women would like a choice . ”
For effect , the woman frequently mentioned as a possible McCain running mate repeated : “ Those women would like a choice . ”
Yes , those women would like a choice .
Fiorina clearly does n’t know McCain ’s record because McCain voted against giving them that choice .
In 2003 , McCain voted against a bill “ To improve the availability of contraceptives for women . ”
Ms. Fiorina seems equally unaware that birth control is actually a controversial issue for the base of the Republican Party .
Which is why as Jed astutely noted yesterday , it is n’t Viagra that freaks out McCain , it ’s birth control :
… it ’s not that McCain did n’t want to talk about Viagra .
It ’s that he did n’t want to talk about birth control .
And it ’s not that McCain is n’t familiar with either the pill or Viagra — it ’s that for McCain , birth control is a politically touchy subject .
Believe it or not , many wingers think birth control should be made illegal .
Case in point : Mike Huckabee .
And McCain does n’t want to run afoul of them .
Jed ’s right .
It is n’t just Huckabee .
Missouri Republicans launched a war on birth control back in 2006 .
With that in mind , watch the video :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1NweA9662g]
McCain is so uncomfortable — and claims he does n’t know his own record .
He needs to kowtow to his theocratic base .
But , in the real world , this issue is resonating — I hear that recent polls have shown McCain ’s support from independent women tanks because of this issue .
One more thing that this election is about : preserving access to safe and effective birth control .
That ’s really something out of the 50s and 60s .
For opponents of the 84 - year - old Gabriel Robert Mugabe , the campaign of violence meted out by pro-government militias begs a crucial question .
Either it is history repeating itself - the latest episode in a long catalogue of brutality leading , inexorably , to a rigged election and another lease on power for his ossified regime ; or this latest assault on opposition supporters marks the last chapter in the long and blood - soaked struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe , and the threshold of a new era .
Nobody can predict with certainty the outcome of the looming presidential election - not even the malleable Zimbabwe Electoral Commission , which dithered for almost a month before announcing the results of the inconclusive first - round ballot on 29 March .
And for all his ruthlessness , Mugabe craves a legacy as the man who gave Zimbabweans back their land : it is far - fetched , but not inconceivable , that he would defy the tightly knit Joint Operations Command ( JOC ) - a council of political , military and intelligence chiefs which is the real centre of power in Harare - and concede defeat .
More plausibly , his regime will endeavour to cling on , fearful of the consequences of any concession .
Zimbabwe 's government is paralysed by a shortage of hard currency , and the productive economy is in ruins .
But amid widespread hunger , a parallel economy persists in the resilience of small traders .
A third of the population depend on remittances from the diaspora , while a well - connected lootocracy wring eye - watering profits from the unlikely opportunities of hyper-inflation .
For anyone else it makes most sense to leave , as a third of Zimbabweans have done since 2000 .
The country they leave behind is gripped by momentous struggles .
For the first time in recent years , both factions of the divided Movement for Democratic Change have signed up to an electoral pact .
The united opposition commands an unprecedented majority in parliament .
Morgan Tsvangirai has survived bitter infighting and a succession of strategic blunders to emerge as the undisputed popular challenger to Mugabe .
Ministers have so far ignored the MDC majority in parliament , but its presence will become significant once the real power brokers in the JOC begin to contemplate a successor to Mugabe .
Hopes that a consensus - seeking candidate might emerge from the ranks of Zanu - PF , a fashionable notion in political circles in Harare , have been diffused .
A presidential bid by former finance minister Simba Makoni drew only 7 per cent of the popular vote .
Zimbabweans , wracked by cynicism , have grounds to believe that opposition politics , although painful , may at last be possible and useful .
Nothing like this has happened before , although the old cliché of a region helplessly detained by its history is far from the truth .
The historical relationship between Zanu - PF , sponsored during the colonial era from Beijing , and its pro-Soviet counterparts among the mass movements of southern Africa , has always been vexed .
Today , at last , Mugabe can no longer claim his brothers are behind him .
The so - called quiet diplomacy of South African president Thabo Mbeki is not yet abandoned .
But a widely leaked letter to Mbeki from Tsvangirai , in which he asks Mbeki to excuse himself from the regional mediation , confirms a relationship in need of repair .
Mbeki's efforts to engage the regime in Harare have been much criticised , but his rapport with Mugabe is arguably much worse .
Zimbabwe 's president has often reneged on agreements with the South African leader , sometimes even before Mbeki 's plane had left Harare .
But Mbeki 's mediation , under the auspices of the 14 - nation Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , enabled a more credible first round election than many observers had feared .
Those gains are clearly in jeopardy , as violence escalates in the run-off campaign and aid agencies have been banned .
The MDC claims 65 of its supporters have been killed and many hundreds beaten in attacks orchestrated , ultimately , by the veteran Zanu - PF securocrat Emmerson Mnangagwa .
A report published last week by Human Rights Watch claims Defence Forces commander General Constantine Chiwenga and police chief Augustine Chihuri have been tasked with terrorising MDC supporters , particularly in Zanu strongholds .
The violence is symptomatic of a lack of any alternative strategy within Zanu .
Mnangagwa , 61 , is the closest thing to a genuine Mugabe loyalist , and aspires to succeed him as president .
But Mbeki 's mediation has left an obstacle in his path .
A constitutional amendment , No 18 , ratified by the Harare parliament last year , vests the power to appoint a presidential successor between elections in members of parliament .
Former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda has called for a unity government , arguing that neither side will be able to claim a workable mandate after 27 June .
Amendment 18 at least provides a basis for some kind of power - sharing between the Joint Operations Command and a cross-party grouping of elected parliamentarians .
The constitution is vulnerable , of course , to the whims of the ruling party .
But the looming presidential contest may yet mark the start of a more protracted negotiation over Mugabe 's successor .
Kaunda wants Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister .
The MDC angrily rejects the job descriptions .
But if and when Mugabe steps down , there is a kind of logic in the call for power - sharing .
First round results - broadly endorsed by independent surveys - gave Zanu - PF a narrow lead in the overall tally of votes , although the ruling party lost on parliamentary seats and Mugabe trailed Tsvangirai in the presidential ballot .
Much will depend on the swing voters who backed Simba Makoni .
Diplomats from South Africa , Britain and the US are said to have encouraged him to stand , a measure - if true - of the gulf between diplomats ' thinking and the popular vote .
Makoni's supporters have doubts about Tsvangirai , but few are likely to support Mugabe .
Beyond Zimbabwe , the impact of its collapse on the wider economy of southern Africa has long been a concern for neighbouring governments .
Mugabe 's defiance of the liberalising economic agenda at the core of the new policy initiatives - from the African Union to Nepad , the unfortunately named New Partnership for Africa 's Development - weighs heavily on regional ambitions .
The SADC needs Zimbabwe 's industrial infrastructure and educated population to advance the cause of regional economic integration .
African critics
Mugabe has often belittled his African critics and questioned their liberation credentials .
Although he retains some support from Angola and Namibia , the influence of neighbouring countries is limited .
But on a recent visit to London , Jacob Zuma - who replaced Mbeki as leader of South Africa 's governing ANC in December - referred to Tsvangirai as " Morgan " , in pointed contrast to " President Mugabe " ( or closer to home , " Mbeki " ) .
Mugabe 's refusal to attend the last SADC summit in April in Lusaka - to which Tsvangirai was invited - confirms he has lost interest in African institutions .
International opinion has proved still less effective .
The United Nations has made no impact in Zimbabwe .
Kofi Annan 's intervention to encourage an inclusive government in Kenya is a substantial precedent , but still far from a model for others to follow .
G8 resolutions for Africa are undermined by a failure to agree a common international position on Zimbabwe .
At base , the problems of diplomacy cannot be separated from the suspicion - on both sides - that foreign policy is determined by unreconstructed notions of racial solidarity .
This charge , levelled in the west at African leaders , must be applied also to the " liberal " western democracies .
The collapse of the post - colonial pact between Mugabe and his erstwhile enemies - the Rhodesian farmers , Britain , capitalism and Empire - has triggered a keen appetite for historical vindication among western critics .
Mugabe 's fiercest critics are often the same people who , in the early 1980s , turned a blind eye to the notorious " Gukurahundi " slaughter of 20,000 Ndebele loyal to his rival , the late Joshua Nkomo .
But in Zimbabwe today there is not much appetite to indict Mugabe for human rights abuses - if only he would go quietly .
The real reckoning between politicians and securocrats in Harare is still to come .
Meanwhile , the Cold War has ended , and apartheid is defeated .
Our own Gordon Brown wants Britons to take pride from their colonial heritage .
Mugabe is equally sincere in his belief that , on the day of judgement , he will be admitted to heaven ahead of the warmongering George Bush and Tony Blair .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor
Co posted a record $ 8.7 billion quarterly loss on Thursday as it wrote down the value of slumping truck and SUV operations and revamped plans in a bid to break its reliance on the gas - guzzlers that have been its franchise vehicles for a decade .

The second - quarter loss was deeper than analysts had forecast and Ford shares fell by 15 percent .
Its bonds also traded lower .
Ford cautioned that it did not expect a U.S. economic turnaround until 2010 with oil prices remaining “ high and volatile ” and no relief for the high prices for steel and other commodities that have hit automakers hard .
In response to the sudden premium on fuel efficiency , the No. 2 U.S. automaker said it would retool truck plants in Michigan and Kentucky to make small cars in addition to an already announced conversion for a Mexican truck plant .
In addition , Ford will bring four previously unannounced small cars to North America , including a Mercury - branded derivative of its popular Focus .
It also said it would double its hybrid output in 2009 and double its capacity to make fuel - saving four - cylinder engines by 2011 .
Analysts have increasingly focused on whether Ford and rival General Motors Corp have the cash needed to ride out the economic downturn in a market moving away from the light truck segment the U.S. automakers have dominated .
Ford ended the second quarter with a cash position of $ 26.6 billion down $ 2.1 billion from the first quarter .
“ We ’re confident that we have enough liquidity to get through , ” Chief Financial Don Leclair told reporters .
Calyon Securities Mark Warnsman said in a note he was “ cautiously optimistic ” about Ford ’s future but said the time it would take the automaker to complete its turnaround represented a risk for investors .
The collapse in demand for trucks and SUVs since the start of the year forced major automakers , including industry leader Toyota Motor Corp , to cut production .
One analyst warned that Ford ’s results were a warning sign for GM .
“ We think the quarter has a negative read across for GM , as the shortfall to Ford earnings seems to have been largely a function of a weaker ( economy ) not cost execution , ” Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault said in a note .
Ford said it was on track to cut 15 percent of its white - collar expenses by August 1 and would cut more deeply in 2009 after reducing recurring costs by $ 5 billion by year end .
Executives declined to offer a timeline for returning to profitability after more than $ 15 billion of losses the past two years , citing the industry ’s continued uncertainty .
“ I think it really goes with the economy both with the United States and worldwide , ” Chief Executive Alan Mulally told analysts .
TRUCK LOSSES WEIGH HEAVILY IN CHARGES
Ford ’s net loss , which included $ 8 billion in charges , amounted to $ 3.88 per share , compared with net income of $ 750 million , or 31 cents per share , a year earlier .
Total revenue fell to $ 41.5 billion , from $ 44.2 billion a year ago .
The quarterly charges underscored Ford ’s exposure to the rapid decline in U.S. light truck sales , a segment where Ford ’s sales dropped 18 percent in the first half .
“ The magnitude of the special items reported by Ford suggests that the company is striving to get the bad news behind it , ” Calyon ’s Warnsman said .
“ The problem is that this has been done in the past and yet the company is now taking further write - offs . ”
Ford took a $ 2.1 - billion charge to write down the value of leases written by its Ford Motor Credit finance unit .
About 85 percent of the charge reflected a sharper - than - projected decline in the resale values of light trucks .
Ford also took a $ 5.3 - billion charge to write down the value of its North American operations to reflect its more cautious view that the boom for trucks and SUVs that took off in the 1990s will not return .
Standard & Poor ’s equity analyst Efraim Levy warned the shift to smaller vehicles would be costly , but said Ford ’s plan would deliver lower costs and better flexibility over time .
Cars historically have generated lower profits than trucks and SUVs and Ford will have to invest heavily to convert the truck factories starting in December .
Ford plans to maintain production of its Ranger compact pickup truck until 2011 , keeping a Minnesota plant open two years longer than previously planned .
Ford said it would keep its Mercury brand and revitalize the nameplate with new products after analysts had questioned its commitment to the brand .
The latest turnaround plan assumes that Ford ’s three core brands -- Ford , Lincoln and Mercury -- would maintain about a 14 - percent market share in North America .
In May , Ford abandoned a long - standing goal of returning to profitability in 2009 and said it would delay the launch of its redesigned F - 150 truck by two months to sell down inventory .
Ford also cut its North American production plans in the third and fourth quarters sharply and slashed its outlook for 2008 U.S. industry sales by 700,000 vehicles to a range of 13.7 million to 14.2 million .
The cuts reflect “ the rapid pace of deterioration in the North American volume and mix environment , ” Archambault said .
Ford shares were down 92 cents at $ 5.11 in late Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Israel and Syria are holding indirect peace talks , with Turkey acting as a mediator , both countries confirmed officially for the first time today .
The nations have " indicated they want to lead these negotiations in a serious spirit so as to reach a comprehensive peace agreement " , a spokesman for Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , said .
Syria 's foreign ministry confirmed the country was holding " indirect peace talks with Israel under Turkish auspices " , Reuters reported .
The brief statements mark the first official acknowledgment that the countries – which have fought three conflicts in Israel 's 60 - year history and remain officially at war - are talking again about the tangled issue of the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 six day war .
There have been repeated recent reports of such indirect talks .
Syria 's president , Bashar Assad , told a Qatari newspaper last month that Turkey , which has good relations with both nations , had been assisting with talks for the past year .
The last talks over the Golan Heights , mediated by the US , broke down in 2000 over disagreements as to how far Israel should withdraw from the territory .
Another Israeli government official , speaking anonymously , said today that Olmert 's chief of staff and diplomatic adviser had been in Turkey since Monday , as had their Syrian counterparts .
He gave no details of any talks .
Turkey 's NTV television said that while both delegations were in Istanbul they did not meet directly , but that Turkish mediators were shuttling between them .
According to Olmert 's spokesman , contact began in February 2007 when the Israeli prime minister visited Turkey .
" In the discussions , the issue of Syria came up , and the Turks started to play a role that was designed to try to create a political momentum between Israel and Syria , " said the spokesman , Mark Regev .
The indirect contacts have seemingly continued even after Israeli military planes attacked an installation in Syria in September last year .
Israel has refused to comment on the raid but the US said last month that the target was an unfinished Syrian nuclear plant being built with North Korean assistance .
In his comments to the Qatar - based al - Watan newspaper last month , Assad said the Turkish - brokered talks had seen Israel offer to withdraw from the Golan Heights in return for a peace treaty with Syria , but that there would be no direct negotiations between the nations until a new US president took office next year .
It is unclear how much of the Golan Heights Israel is willing to cede , or the extent of withdrawal demanded by Syria .
In the past , Syria has demanded the return of the whole of the territory , including a narrow strip along the Sea of Galilee , Israel 's main water source , a concession rejected by Israel .
As well as providing a guarantee of peace from Syria , a deal over the Golan Heights could help tempt Damascus from its currently close ties with Iran , a major regional foe for Israel .
However , it could prove politically difficult for Olmert , who faces a series of domestic political difficulties and is under pressure not to make significant territorial concessions to any of Israel 's neighbours .
One recent opinion poll showed two - thirds of Israelis opposed the return of the Golan Heights , even in exchange for a promise of peace .
One group representing some of the 18,000 Israeli settlers living in the territory called the talks " a deluded and irresponsible move which would hand over such a vital Israeli strategic asset to the Arab axis of evil . "
Olmert has also been weakened by recent claims about alleged corruption .
Police have seized documents relating to Olmert 's time both as mayor of Jerusalem and trade minister after reports he accepted bribes from an Jewish - American businessman .
The Israeli leader admits he accepted campaign donations from Morris Talansky but says he took no money for himself .

Gordon Brown thought his luck had changed when the shadow home secretary said he was resigning over 42 - day detention .
Conservatives , by contrast , thought he had gone mad .
Yet to judge from the emails sent by Tory activists , Labour voters and people who had never given a thought to politics , the MP for Haltemprice and Howden may be on to something , writes political editor Gaby Hinsliff
When a battle - weary David Davis got off the train home on Friday night , the condemnation of his colleagues ringing in his ears , he headed to his local pub for solace .
His aides were waiting , with a sheaf of emails they stuffed straight into his hands .
They came from excited Tory activists , life - long Labour voters , ordinary people who had never written to politicians before : there was an offer of help from a Lib Dem constituency chairman and pledges of cash from pensioners .
But one , he admits , gave him ' a lump in the throat ' : it was from a woman who worked on a local government project to encourage the alienated and unfranchised to vote .
What he had done , she wrote , would ' make my job so much easier ' .
When one of the most aggressively ambitious men in politics last week threw away the chance of becoming home secretary to embark on what one shadow cabinet colleague describes as an ' utterly barking ' crusade for civil liberties , the Westminster verdict across all parties was instant : it was an ego trip , a midlife crisis ; at best , a naive romantic whim and , at worst , a selfish plot to destabilise his leader .
Even his friends , none of whom had been consulted , were appalled .
But as the dust settles , Davis 's eccentric rejection of conventional politics is beginning to pose some awkward questions .
He still risks ridicule if his grand mission flops , but as Iain Dale , the Tory blogger who ran Davis 's ill - fated leadership campaign , points out , while newspapers scorned the resignation the blogosphere largely embraced it : political chatrooms are overflowing with right - wingers offering to start a fighting fund , and left - wingers agonising over whether to support him .
Even the Daily Telegraph 's Saturday letters page was two to one in favour of the former MP for Haltemprice and Howden .
Could David Davis somehow have stumbled across something the establishment has missed , an untapped anger with what the public sees as a snooping , heavy - handed state that spies on it through speed cameras and CCTV and microchips on its rubbish bins , that tramples its freedoms and makes sloppy mistakes with its private data ?
' I was hoping it would strike a chord with the public , and it turns out it really has touched a nerve , ' Davis told The Observer yesterday .
' The more people from all walks of life who want to join in , the better .
We will be looking to get non-politicians involved : I 'm pretty sure we will have some senior lawyers . '
With their help , he argues , he will challenge the opinion poll findings suggesting that Britons overwhelmingly support extending detention of terror suspects without charge to 42 days , which have made some politicians afraid to defy the government on the issue .
' We will say , " If you knew that half the people who went to 28 days ' detention were innocent , would you support it ? "
We will do the same with the DNA database , with other issues . '
He hopes to run the campaign on small donations from ordinary people , and stage genuine debates engaging everyone from politicians and those who have directly experienced terrorist violence to ordinary people .
It could be , said one aide , an ' Obama - like ' campaign for the masses .
Such rhetoric may sound overblown .
But yesterday he scored his first serious political hit , as the maverick Labour MP Bob Marshall - Andrews announced he will campaign for Davis .
What was a crisis for David Cameron is now becoming a serious headache for Gordon Brown , who must now decide whether to discipline his rebellious MP and turn him into a dangerous martyr , or ignore him and risk others joining in , turning a by - election that Brown dismissed as a farcical stunt into a cross -party uprising .
Is British politics seeing the emergence of something genuinely new ?
Perhaps .
Sceptical colleagues still believe Davis is playing the oldest game in politics : positioning himself for the leadership should anything befall Cameron .
One who knows him well argues that Davis ' basically does n't approve of the Cameron Project ' and has chosen to abandon it : ' I think he thinks this is a bold bid of the type that would have worked for Enoch Powell if the Tories had lost the 1970 election .
He 's very struck by historical parallels . '
Powell stood for the Tory leadership in 1966 and came a poor third .
Two years later his ' rivers of blood ' speech abruptly ended his frontbench career but caught a public mood : historians credited Powellite politics with swinging millions of Tory votes in 1970 .
Four decades on , his voice still echoes in the British immigration debate .
Does Davis have something similar in mind ?
His friends say Davis would now rather spend his career being his own man than following a leader with whom he increasingly disagrees on issues from environmentalism to tax cuts .
' Does he really want to be Cameron 's home secretary ?
Not much , ' says a senior MP who is close to him .
' The most important thing to David is to be a big character . '
Davis himself insists , however , there are no rifts and no hidden agendas : he simply believes he does n't need a seat at the shadow cabinet table to pursue his cause , insisting that his successor Dominic Grieve - a passionate opponent of detaining terror suspects for 42 days and the only colleague he discussed his plans with - can continue the parliamentary battle without him : ' Dominic is at least as good as me and probably better . '
By Davis 's own admission , Grieve has an uphill job .
Up until last weekend , Davis believed Brown would be defeated on the terrorism Bill in the Commons and was certain he would be defeated in the Lords .
He says he began to think again when he saw last - minute polling suggesting that 65 per cent of the public supported it .
As he makes clear for the first time today , he feared Cameron would not be able to hold the libertarian line as it got closer to a general election .
Was he right ?
Well - placed sources say there were certainly disagreements about how firmly Tory peers should be whipped on the terrorism Bill .
Michael Gove and George Osborne , the two shadow cabinet minsters closest to Cameron , also both had broader reservations about appearing soft on terrorism .
Those closest to the discussions insist there was ' never any question ' of Cameron doing a U - turn and that he knew , if he had did , frontbench resignations - and not just Davis 's - would have followed .
Even those who share his concerns argue that Davis should not have quit .
' Cameron has treated David very well and he deserves better , ' said one shadow cabinet colleague , who regards Davis as being ' out of his fucking mind ' for drawing attention to one of Brown 's few popular policies .
The unrepentant Davis , however , argues the terrorism Bill was only part of a jigsaw of controversial issues he wants to debate , which include the estimated one million people whose samples are held on the police DNA database even though they have never been convicted of any crime , and the surveillance powers introduced to combat terrorism being used by councils to enforce anything from school admissions policies to dog fouling .
He said he was not embracing a full libertarian agenda of abolishing CCTV cameras or scrapping the DNA database , but both mechanisms should include stronger protection for innocent citizens : ' I would n't say , do n't have a DNA database : I would have everybody who has ever been to prison on it , but the innocent get taken off .
' It 's the past people we do n't have , the people who were imprisoned 10 years ago .
That way we would protect the rights of the innocent and we actually solve far more crimes .
As for surveillance powers , it cannot ever have been Parliament 's intention that there should be a thousand surveillance operations by local government . '
He said he also wanted to see tougher safeguards controlling the use of data from CCTV cameras : ' Most of them are no good for evidence .
There should be a requirement that they should be of evidential standard and with that will go a mandatory penalty for misuse of the data .
At the moment we 've got 3 per cent of crimes solved by surveillance camera , and 80 per cent of cameras are useless in court . '
Such policies may be harder for Labour to attack than it thinks .
The government consensus was that Davis had scored what one senior party figure calls ' the biggest own goal in history ' - knocking Brown 's woes off the front pages , exposing Tory tensions and pitting his party against Rupert Murdoch 's Sun , now the leading proponent of 42 days .
Within hours of his resignation , senior Labour aides were suggesting the paper could mount a candidate against him ; by Friday morning , ex - Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie had offered to stand .
MacKenzie has said the idea followed a party for Sun editor Rebekah Wade 's 40th birthday , attended by Murdoch , on Thursday night .
But Wade 's inclusion on the guest list for a girlie sleepover hosted by Sarah Brown at Chequers this weekend has only fuelled speculation that Downing Street was closely involved in encouraging the Sun to join the fight .
Is MacKenzie really a Labour puppet ?
If so , he needs his strings tightening .
Within 24 hours , he had committed at least two gaffes , insisting that Murdoch had personally promised to fund him - as an American citizen , Murdoch cannot legally do so - and being caught unawares on camera describing Hull , next to Davis 's constituency , as an ' absolute shocker ' of a place .
Labour 's refusal to say if it will put up a candidate has triggered suspicions that it is seeking a convincing outsider to pit against Davis , with names in the frame including the Glasgow airport baggage handler John Smeaton , who helped to foil an alleged bomb attack there .
The Sun is also said to have considered approaching Rachel North , a survivor of the 7/7 bombings , who has campaigned for justice for the victims , but North said she admired Davis 's stand : ' I am a big fan of civil liberties and freedom and democracy , all things that terrorists are not keen on , and I 'm pleased that a senior politician has campaigned about this . '
Would she go out on the stump for him ?
' I might do something , but he has n't asked me . '
Davis , unsurprisingly , says she is ' exactly the sort of person ' he would welcome .
Could all this political party cross-dressing lead towards the emergence of a new political movement , with Davis at its head ?
Not according to Davis : ' When they cremate me , the ashes will be Conservative . '
If the gamble goes wrong , however , he could be supporting his party from an armchair in Yorkshire , not from inside a future Tory government .
But if he pulls it off , Davis may yet inflict more damage on Brown than his nervous colleagues realise .
The ball is in Labour 's court .
Supposerunners having distinct constant speeds start at a common point and run laps on a circular track with circumference 1 .
Then for any given runner , there is a time at which that runner is distance at least ( along the track ) away from every other runner .
This conjecture was independently introduced in two very different contexts .
Wills [ W ] introduced it as a problem in diophantine approximation , and Cusick [ C1 ] discovered it as a geometric view obstruction problem .
The poetic name is due to Goddyn .
There are a number of different proofs of this conjecture for small values of ( as a warning , there are different formulations of this conjecture , and what appears here as the problem for runners is sometimes considered to be the problem for runners ) .
The cases with runners are easy to check .
The case was proved independently by Betke and Wills [ BW ] and by Cusick .
The case was first established by Cusick and Pomerance [ CP ] with the help of some computer checking , and this argument was later simplified by Bienia et al . [ BGGS ] who also found applications of this theorem to the study of flows on graphs .
The case was first proved by Bohman et al . [ BHK ] and this was later simplified by Renault [ R ] .
Recently , the case was proved by Barajas and Serra [ BS ] .
An important study raises concern about the way intensive care physicians approach patients and families facing serious end - of - life medical decisions .
Based on interviews with more than 1,200 ICU physicians at five major medical centers across the country , researchers conclude that physicians are less comfortable discussing end - of - life issues and do it less frequently with African - American patients and their families than with Caucasian patients and families .
J. Daryl Thornton , M.D. , M.P.H. , of the Center for Reducing Health Disparities at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University ( CWRU ) , an assistant professor at CWRU , will present the findings at the American Thoracic Society 's 2008 International Conference in Toronto on Wednesday , May 21 .
One in five Americans will die in the ICU or shortly after a stay there , and , frequently , their deaths follow a decision made by families to withdraw life - sustaining therapies .
" That is why it is so important that physicians are comfortable delivering difficult and sometimes complex diagnoses , potential outcomes and prognoses to patients and families in the ICU , " said Dr. Thornton .
" Our study suggests there may be some underlying biases and / or discomfort among physicians , which impacts their ability to have these difficult conversations with families . "
" We had previously shown that ICU physicians , when predicting likelihood of survival of their patients , are less likely to predict that their African - Americans patients will survive , " he continued .
" Ironically , those African - Americans were more likely to survive .
These two studies , taken together , suggest we need to collect more information about what impacts the prognostic decisions by physicians , and whether any underlying biases are influencing the way they communicate with patients and families . "
The researchers examined data from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment ( SUPPORT ) , which was conducted between 1989 and 1994 involving a group of 9,105 seriously ill hospitalized patients and their 1,241 physicians at five major medical centers across the country .
On the third day of the study , physicians were asked if they had had prognostic conversations with their patients or their patients ' surrogates ( the person appointed by the patient to make their medical decisions ) .
Patients or their surrogates were also interviewed at the same time to assess their functional level two weeks prior to being admitted to the hospital , income , race , age and insurance status .
After adjusting for a variety of potentially confounding factors , such as severity of illness and insurance status , physicians reported having had prognostic conversations with 58 percent of their white patients , but only 41 percent of their African - American patients .
Furthermore , physicians were less than half ( 43 percent ) as likely to report feeling comfortable during those conversations with their African - American patients .
This was true regardless of the actual prognosis .
" We acknowledge that this study uses data that is dated .
The findings should be replicated and would be an important area for health disparities research -- understanding the effects of physician biases on decision - making , communication and patient outcomes in the ICU , " said Dr. Thornton .
" By having a detailed understanding of the components of this intricate relationship , interventions can be implemented to enable the provision of more culturally sensitive and equitable care in the ICU . "
Closing coal - fired power plants can have a direct , positive impact on children 's cognitive development and health according to a study released by the Columbia Center for Children 's Environmental Health ( CCCEH ) at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health .
The study allowed researchers to track and compare the development of two groups of children born in Tongliang , a city in China 's Chongqing Municipality -- one in utero while a coal - fired power plant was operating in the city and one in utero after the Chinese government had closed the plant .
Among the first group of children , prenatal exposure to coal - burning emissions was associated with significantly lower average developmental scores and reduced motor development at age two .
In the second unexposed group , these adverse effects were no longer observed ; and the frequency of delayed motor developmental was significantly reduced .
The study findings are published in the July 14th Environmental Health Perspectives .
" This study provides direct evidence that governmental action to eliminate polluting coal - burning sources benefits children 's neurodevelopment , " said Frederica Perera , DrPH , professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health , director of the Columbia Center for Children 's Environmental Health , and lead author of the study .
" These findings have major implications for environmental health and energy policy as they demonstrate that reduction in dependence on coal for energy can have a measurable positive impact on children 's development and health -- in China and elsewhere . "
To conduct the study , researchers from CCCEH partnered with physicians and scientists from the Children 's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , the School of Public Health at Fudan University in Shanghai , and the School of Environmental Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University .
The researchers followed two successive cohorts of Chinese newborns through age two .
Children in both cohorts were born in Tongliang , a city with a coal - fired power plant that operated seasonally until it was shutdown by the government in May 2004 .
The first cohort involved 107 women whose children were born in 2002 , prior to the plant closing .
The second involved 110 women whose children were born in 2005 , when the coal plant was no longer in operation .
" This is a unique environmental intervention study using molecular techniques to demonstrate the relationship between a cleaner environment and healthier children , " added Deliang Tang , MD , DrPh , associate professor of clinical Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School , director of the Tongliang Project , and co-author of the study .
Prenatal exposure to plant emissions was measured by a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) exposure in umbilical cord blood .
The investigators controlled for exposures to other pollutants , such as tobacco smoke and lead , which might have contributed to neurodevelopment problems .
Children in the first cohort had varying exposure prenatally to PAHs emitted by the coal - fired power plant .
This exposure was recorded by monitoring the levels of PAHs in air during the mothers ' pregnancies and in measuring a marker of PAH exposure in cord blood -- specifically the levels of PAHs bound to DNA , known as " PAH - DNA adducts " .
Among these children , the researchers found significant associations between the marker of exposure in cord blood and delayed motor and average development at age two .
The second group of children , who were conceived after the closure of the plant , had significantly lower levels of the marker in cord blood and their incidence of delayed motor development was one - third that of the first cohort .
Coal - fired power plants provide the majority of the energy for China 's industry , as well as the electricity needs of the U.S.
The Chinese government has ordered the closure of older , more polluting coal - fired power plants such as the one in Tongliang .
The study is one of four parallel international cohort studies being conducted by the CCCEH that examine the health effects of exposure of pregnant women and babies to indoor and outdoor air pollutants in urban areas .
Additional studies are being conducted in New York City and Krakow , Poland .
The Center 's prior research findings have shown that exposure to air pollutants are associated with an increase in risk for developmental delays among children living in New York City .
Today 's findings contribute to a further understanding of how air pollution impacts child health .
Other investigators on the study include Tin-yu Li , Zhi-jun Zhou , Tao Yuan , Yu-hui Chen , Lirong Qu , Virginia A. Rauh , and Yiguan Zhang .
The Washington Post is reporting that the Pentagon is refusing orders from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up three sites where it dumped chemicals that the EPA says have contaminated soil and drinking water and pose " imminent and substantial " dangers to public health .
The sites are at military bases at Fort Meade in Maryland , Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida , and McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey .
The Post also reports that the EPA has identified 12 Superfund sites contaminated by the Pentagon that the Pentagon refuses to acknowledge , even though it is required to do so by law .
Of the 1,255 Superfund sites on the EPA 's list , the Department of Defense owns 129 – making it the single biggest polluter in the country .
The Post says that environmental experts find the Pentagon 's defiance of the EPA is unprecedented :
" This is stunning , " said Rena Steinzor , who helped write the Superfund laws as a congressional staffer and now teaches at the University of Maryland Law School and is president of the nonprofit Center for Progressive Reform .
" The idea that they would refuse to sign a final order – that is the height of amazing nerve . "
The law gives the EPA administrator final say in cleanup disputes with other agencies , a rule that the Pentagon refuses to recognize .
Instead , Defense Department officials have asked the Justice Department and the White House to intervene .
If it were a private polluter and not the Pentagon , the EPA would most likely go to court to force compliance , but an executive branch policy prevents federal agencies from suing one another .
Other agencies , including NASA and the Department of Energy , have complied with the EPA 's Superfund cleanup orders without protest .
This is the second time in a week that it 's been revealed that the EPA 's authority has been ignored by others in the government .
The New York Times reported last Wednesday that , when the EPA sent an e-mail to the White House concluding that greenhouse gasses can be regulated by the Clean Air Act , the White House simply refused to open it , successfully getting the EPA to backtrack .
There ’s been a lot of talk about the recent New Hampshire primaries .
Now it ’s time to hear from the experts , in particular , Michael Herron , Walter Mebane , and Jonathan Wand , the political scientists who , among other things , did the definitive estimate of the Florida vote from 2000 .
Their punchline : “ with respect to Hillary Clinton ’s surprise victory in the Democratic Primary and the notable differences across vote tabulation technologies in Clinton ’s and others ’ levels of support , our results are consistent with these differences being due entirely to the fact that New Hampshire wards that use Accuvote optical scan machines typically have voters with different political preferences than wards that use hand counted paper ballots . ”
Here ’s their paper , and here ’s the executive summary :
We [ Herron , Mebane , and Wand ] address concerns that the reported vote counts of candidates running in the 2008 New Hampshire Presidential Primaries were affected by the vote tabulating technologies used across New Hampshire .
• In the Democratic Primary , Hillary Clinton was more successful in New Hampshire wards that used Accuvote optical scan vote tabulating technology than was Barack Obama , receiving 4.3 more percentage points of the vote there ( 40.2 % for Clinton versus 35.9 % for Obama ) .
In contrast , Clinton did worse than Obama in wards that counted paper ballots by hand , trailing by 6.1 percentage points ( 33.7 % versus 39.8 % ) .
• In the Republican Primary , Mitt Romney trailed John McCain by 3.6 points in Accuvote wards and by 15 points in wards that counted ballots by hand .
• In New Hampshire the choice of vote tabulation technology is made ward by ward , and electronic technology was used in wards that typically differ demographically and politically from wards that count ballots by hand .
Wards that selected electronic tabulation are disproportionately from the southeast part of New Hampshire , and they tend to be more densely populated and more affluent .
Accuvote and hand count wards have also typically produced divergent voting patterns in elections prior to the 2008 primary .
It is plausible that most or all of the observed differences between vote tabulation technologies in the votes candidates received reflect such background differences and not anything inherent in the tabulation methods .
• Using a subset of New Hampshire wards that have similar demographic features and voting histories but differ in their vote tabulation technologies , we find no significant relationship between a ward ’s use of vote tabulating technology and the votes or vote shares received by most of the leading candidates who competed in the 2008 New Hampshire Presidential Primaries .
Among Clinton , Edwards , Kucinich , Obama and Richardson in the Democratic primary and Giuliani , Huckabee , Paul , Romney and McCain in the Republican primary , we observe a significant difference only in the votes counted for Edwards , and that difference is small ( a deficit of between 0.6 and 3.4 percent in the hand - counted votes ) .
• With respect to Hillary Clinton ’s surprise victory in the Democratic Primary and the differences
across vote tabulation technologies in Clinton ’s and others ’ votes , our results are consistent with these differences being due entirely to the fact that New Hampshire wards that use Accuvote optical scan machines have voters with different political preferences than wards that use hand counted paper ballots .
Agripping documentary about performance - enhancing drugs , “ Bigger , Stronger , Faster * " has everything going for it :
Some of the year ’s best reviews , a highly topical subject , a film festival pedigree and winsome filmmakers willing to tour the country to drum up interest .
There ’s only one thing missing : moviegoers .
Critically acclaimed films about provocative subjects struggle to make money all the time , but rarely have so many lauded documentaries consistently failed to connect at the box office .
The recent nonfiction returns have been so bleak that several distributors are growing wary about taking on such highbrow works , an alarming development in a pop culture universe already dominated by “ American Idol , ” James Frey and US Weekly .
“ It ’s unlike anything I ’ve seen before , ” says Michael Barker , whose Sony Pictures Classics has released the documentary duds “ Standard Operating Procedure , ” “ Jimmy Carter : Man From Plains ” and “ My Kid Could Paint That , ” none of which grossed more than $ 250,000 theatrically .
“ Unless you have movie stars like Michael Moore or Al Gore associated with your film , you ca n’t sell tickets . ”

In addition to Magnolia Pictures ’ “ Bigger , Stronger , Faster * , ” which arrived in theaters three weeks ago but has grossed only $ 164,000 , the recent beleaguered documentaries include Fox Searchlight ’s “ Young@Heart ” and Magnolia ’s “ Surfwise . ”
The winner of this year ’s feature documentary Academy Award , Think Film ’s “ Taxi to the Dark Side , ” grossed just $ 275,000 .
“ It ’s been brutal , ” Alex Buono , a producer on “ Bigger , Stronger , Faster * , ” says of trying to coax moviegoers into theaters .
“ We spent three years making this film , and [ releasing it ] is just an extension of that uphill battle . ”
Distributors offer a number of explanations behind the drop in documentary attendance :
“ Standard Operating Procedure ” and “ Taxi to the Dark Side ” focus on war and torture , topics that have been a deadly curse for numerous dramas , including “ Lions for Lambs , ” “ Stop - Loss ” and “ Rendition . ”

Wall - to - wall coverage of the political campaigns may have left moviegoers desperate for mind - numbing getaways .
In that view , “ The Incredible Hulk ” is far more attractive than the challenging “ Surfwise , ” a look at an unusual family wandering around in a camper .
Audiences that used to embrace contentious films have grown tired of them .
“ I used to die to have my movies be controversial , ” says Magnolia ’s Eamonn Bowles .
“ Now I do n’t want my movies to be controversial . ”
While all of the explanations may be partially true , something larger may also be at work : a rising schism within the theatrical marketplace .
Just as the gap between the rich and poor is growing in the country , it ’s expanding at the multiplex too .
Among last summer ’s 30 highest - grossing films , the top 10 collected an average of $ 248.3 million .
The bottom third grossed an average of $ 32.3 million -- a chasm of $ 216 million , according to Nielsen EDI .
A year earlier , the gap between the haves and have - nots was almost a third less , at $ 158.5 million .

The tables are tilting more heavily toward blockbusters in the specialized film world too .
After the success of crossover hits such as “ Bend It Like Beckham , ” “ March of the Penguins ” and “ Juno , ” millions of dollars flooded into independent film production , creating not only hundreds more movies but also higher expectations for their box - office performance .
Marketing costs for specialized films consequently are soaring , up from $ 17.8 million per film in 2006 to a whopping $ 25.7 million last year .
As companies once content with art - house singles started swinging for wide - release home runs , the audience followed their lead :
If a new film did n’t have a must - see buzz surrounding it , moviegoers would just wait for it to arrive in their Netflix mailers .
And documentaries -- no matter how favorably reviewed -- were caught in the middle .
“ It costs too much money and too much effort to break through , ” says Steven Beer , an attorney at Greenberg Traurig who specializes in selling difficult dramas and documentaries .

Before “ Bigger , Stronger , Faster * " was released , though , there were disagreements over how the film should be marketed .
Magnolia wanted creative materials to play up the film ’s entertainment value and female appeal , even adding a ballerina ( who is n’t in the movie ) to its poster .
The filmmakers worried Magnolia ’s campaign might repel documentary aficionados and sports fans .
“ That ’s what we were trying to emphasize -- that it ’s really entertaining , ” says Magnolia ’s Bowles .
“ Not that we ’re ripping the lid off on steroid abuse . ”
But producer Buono worries the marketing spin made the movie seem superficial .
“ It ’s intentionally trying to make it look not too serious , that it ’s a big , fun action movie . ”
The film ultimately might have been hurt by its subject matter -- people simply had steroid fatigue .
And the topic of “ Young@Heart ” -- older people singing alternative rock hits -- may have been too much for Fox Searchlight to conquer as well .
In its first deal for a doc- umentary , Fox Searchlight bought the film at last year ’s Los Angeles Film Festival for $ 1.5 million .
Although “ Young @ Heart ” might gross as much as $ 4 million ( it ’s at $ 3.4 million now ) , given the acquisition cost and marketing expenditures , “ we are disappointed , ” says Fox Searchlight ’s Steve Gilula .

Even though the film “ is an incredibly uplifting , joyous experience , ” Gilula says the core art - house audience did n’t take up the film , leaving mostly older women as its ticket buyers .
“ We were not able to successfully overcome the resistance ” to a movie about the elderly , Gilula says .
With such a tight documentary marketplace , distributors are looking for new ways to deliver nonfiction films .
First Run Features , which has distributed documentaries for nearly 30 years , relies on out - of - the - ordinary venues , showing its “ For the Bible Tells Me So ” at churches and “ Wetlands Preserved : The Story of an Activist Nightclub ” at concert sites .
IFC recently launched Festival Direct , a video - on - demand service whose slate includes unusual documentaries .
The nonprofit Tribeca Film Institute just started Reframe , which has more than 300 documentaries available for DVD purchase and computer download .
“ It ’s not the only solution , ” says Tribeca ’s Brian Newman , “ but we hope it ’s part of one . ”
It might be small consolation for moviegoers who want to see their docs in theaters .

“ I believe , ” says Gilula , “ that we will be very cautious in considering future documentaries . ”

ALMATY , Kazakhstan 
A 246 - foot tall , rocket ship - like monument to the late ruler of Turkmenistan , topped with a golden statue of himself that rotates to always face the sun , will be removed from the center of the Turkmen capital , state news media there have reported .
A decision by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov to move the monument was his latest step in dismantling the personality cult of Saparmurat Niyazov , whose often bizarre decrees turned the isolated , energy - rich country into the punch line of a bad international joke .
The president had already reversed Mr. Niyazov ’s order renaming the days of the week and months of the year in honor of himself and his family .
He had also ended the bans on opera , ballet and the circus , which Mr. Niyazov had decreed un -Turkmen , and lifted restrictions on the Internet .
The monument , erected in 1998 and known as the Neutrality Arch , remains the most prominent icon to Mr. Niyazov , who ruled the desert nation of five million people from its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 to his death in 2006 .
A giant white tripod with an Eiffel Tower - type observation deck , the monument is capped with a spinning 39 - foot - tall effigy of Mr. Niyazov .

PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA is extending the international Cassini - Huygens mission by two years .
The historic spacecraft 's stunning discoveries and images have revolutionized our knowledge of Saturn and its moons .
Cassini 's mission originally had been scheduled to end in July 2008 .
The newly - announced two - year extension will include 60 additional orbits of Saturn and more flybys of its exotic moons .
These will include 26 flybys of Titan , seven of Enceladus , and one each of Dione , Rhea and Helene .
The extension also includes studies of Saturn 's rings , its complex magnetosphere , and the planet itself .
" This extension is not only exciting for the science community , but for the world to continue to share in unlocking Saturn 's secrets , " said Jim Green , director , Planetary Science Division , NASA Headquarters , Washington .
" New discoveries are the hallmarks of its success , along with the breathtaking images beamed back to Earth that are simply mesmerizing .
"
" The spacecraft is performing exceptionally well and the team is highly motivated , so we 're excited at the prospect of another two years , " said Bob Mitchell , Cassini program manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Based on findings from Cassini , scientists think liquid water may be just beneath the surface of Saturn 's moon Enceladus .
That 's why the small moon , only one - tenth the size of Titan and one - seventh the size of Earth 's moon , is one of the highest - priority targets for the extended mission .
Cassini discovered geysers of water - ice jetting from the Enceladus surface .
The geysers , which shoot out at a distance three times the diameter of Enceladus , feed particles into Saturn 's most expansive ring .
In the extended mission , the spacecraft may come as close as 25 kilometers ( 15 miles ) from the moon 's surface .
Cassini's observations of Saturn 's largest moon , Titan , have given scientists a glimpse of what Earth might have been like before life evolved .
They now believe Titan possesses many parallels to Earth , including lakes , rivers , channels , dunes , rain , snow , clouds , mountains and possibly volcanoes .
" When we designed the original tour , we really did not know what we would find , especially at Enceladus and Titan , " said Dennis Matson , the JPL Cassini project scientist .
" This extended tour is responding to these new discoveries and giving us a chance to look for more .
" Unlike Earth , Titan 's lakes , rivers and rain are composed of methane and ethane , and temperatures reach a chilly minus 180 degrees Celsius ( minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Although Titan 's dense atmosphere limits viewing the surface , Cassini 's high - resolution radar coverage and imaging by the infrared spectrometer have given scientists a better look .
Other activities for Cassini scientists will include monitoring seasons on Titan and Saturn , observing unique ring events , such as the 2009 equinox when the sun will be in the plane of the rings , and exploring new places within Saturn 's magnetosphere .
Cassini has returned a daily stream of data from Saturn 's system for almost four years .
Its travel scrapbook includes nearly 140,000 images , and information gathered during 62 revolutions around Saturn , 43 flybys of Titan and 12 close flybys of the icy moons .
More than 10 years after launch and almost four years after entering into orbit around Saturn , Cassini is a healthy and robust spacecraft .
Three of its science instruments have minor ailments , but the impact on science - gathering is minimal .
The spacecraft will have enough propellant left after the extended mission to potentially allow a third phase of operations .
Data from the extended mission could lay the groundwork for possible new missions to Titan and Enceladus .
Cassini launched Oct. 15 , 1997 , from Cape Canaveral , Fla. , on a seven - year journey to Saturn , traversing 3.5 billion kilometers ( 2.2 billion miles ) .
It is one of the most scientifically capable spacecraft ever launched , with a record 12 instruments on the orbiter and six more instruments on the European Space Agency 's Huygens probe , which piggybacked a ride to Titan on Cassini .
Cassini receives electrical power from three radioisotope thermoelectric generators , which generate electricity from heat produced by the natural decay of plutonium .
The spacecraft was captured into Saturn orbit in June 2004 and immediately began returning data to Earth .

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Cassini - Huygens mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
War with Syria ?
Peace with Syria ?
A big military operation against Hamas in the Gaza strip ?
A cease - fire with Hamas ?
Our media discuss these questions dispassionately , as if they were equivalent options .
Like a person in a showroom making a choice between two cars .
This one is good , and so is the other one .
So which should one buy ?
And nobody cries out :
War is the height of stupidity !
Carl von Clausewitz , the renowned military theorist , famously said that war is nothing but the continuation of politics by other means .
Meaning : war is there to serve policy and is useless when it does not .
What policies did the wars in the last hundred years serve ?
Ninety - four years ago , World War I broke out .
The immediate cause was the assassination of the Austrian heir apparent by a Serbian student .
In Sarajevo they showed me how it happened : after a first attempt on the main street had failed , the assassins had already given up hope when one of them came across the victim again , by sheer accident , and killed him .
After this almost accidental killing many millions of human beings lost their lives in the following four years .
The assassination served , of course , only as a pretext .
Every one of the belligerent nations had political and economic interests that pushed it into the war .
But did the war really serve these interests ?
The results suggest the opposite : three mighty empires  the Russian , German , and Austrian  collapsed ;
France lost its standing as a world power beyond all hope of recovery ; the British Empire was mortally wounded .
Military experts point to the shocking stupidity of almost all the generals , who threw their poor soldiers again and again into hopeless battles , which achieved nothing but slaughter .
Were the statesmen any wiser ?
Not one of the politicians who started the war imagined that it would last so long and be so horrible .
In early August 1914 , when the soldiers of all the countries marched into the war with merry enthusiasm , they were promised that they would be home " before Christmas . "
No political aim was achieved in that war .
The peace agreements that were imposed on the vanquished were monuments of unbridled imbecility .
It can be argued that the main result of World War I was World War II .
The Second World War was , seemingly , more rational .
The man who launched it practically single - handedly , Adolf Hitler , knew exactly what he wanted .
His opponents went to war because they had no choice , if they did not want to be overrun by a monstrous dictator .
Most of the generals on both sides were far more intelligent than their predecessors .
And in spite of this , it was a stupid war .
Hitler was , basically , a primitive person who lived in the past and did not understand the Zeitgeist .
He wanted to turn Germany into the leading world power  an aim that was wildly beyond its capabilities .
He intended to conquer large parts of Eastern Europe and to empty them of their inhabitants , in order to settle Germans there .
That was a hopelessly obsolete concept of power .
Like all ideas of establishing settlements as a national instrument , it belonged to centuries past .
Hitler did not understand the meaning of the technological revolution that was about to change the face of the world .
It can be said : Hitler was not only an evil tyrant and a monumental war criminal , but ultimately also a thoroughly stupid person .
The only aim that he almost achieved was the annihilation of the Jewish people .
But even this mad endeavor failed in the end : Jews today have a strong influence on the most powerful country in the world , and the Holocaust played an important role in the establishment of the state of Israel .
Hitler wanted to destroy the Soviet Union and reach a compromise with the British Empire .
He belittled the United States and almost ignored it .
The result of the war was that the Soviet Union took over a large part of Europe , America became the main world power , and the British Empire disintegrated forever .
Indeed , the Nazi dictator proved , more than anybody else , the utter futility of war as a political instrument at this point in time .
After the destruction of Hitler ’s Reich , Germany did achieve his goal .
Germany is now the dominant economic and political power in a united Europe  but this was attained not with tanks and heavy guns , without war and military might , solely by diplomacy and exports .
One generation after all the German cities had become heaps of ruins in the Nazi adventure , Germany was already flourishing as never before .
The same can be said about Japan , which was even more militaristic than Germany .
It achieved by peaceful means what the generals and admirals had failed to achieve by war .
From time to time I read enthusiastic reports by American tourists about Vietnam .
What a wonderful country !
What a friendly people !
What good business can be done there !
Only a generation ago , a brutal war was running amok there .
Masses of people were killed , hundreds of villages burned , forests and harvests destroyed by chemical agents , soldiers fell like flies .
Why ?
Because of dominoes .
The theory went like this : if all of Vietnam were to be taken over by the Communists , all the other countries of Southeast Asia would fall .
Each one would bring down its neighbor , like a row of dominoes .
Reality has shown that this was complete nonsense : the Communists took over all of Vietnam , without affecting the stability of Thailand , Malaysia , and Singapore .
When the war memories faded , Vietnam indeed followed the path of its northern neighbor , Red China , but in the meantime China has a flourishing capitalist economy .
In the Vietnam War , the stupidity of the generals competed with that of the politicians .
The champion was Henry Kissinger , a war criminal whose towering ego disguised his basic stupidity .
At the height of the war he invaded the neighboring peaceful Cambodia and broke it into pieces .
The result was a gruesome auto - genocide , when the Communists murdered their own people .
Yet many still consider Kissinger a political genius .
There are those who maintain that for sheer futility , the invasion of Iraq takes the cake even in this fiercely competitive field .
It seems that the political leadership in Washington foresaw the dramatic rise of the worldwide demand for oil .
They decided , therefore , to strengthen their hold on the oil of the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea basin .
The war was intended to turn Iraq into an American satellite and to station there , under a friendly regime , a permanent American garrison that would keep the whole area under control .
The results , up to now , have been the opposite .
Instead of consolidating Iraq as a united country under a stable pro-American regime , a civil war is raging , the state is tottering on the brink of disintegration , the population hates the Americans and considers them a foreign occupier .
The output of oil is less than it was before the invasion , the immense costs of the war undermine the American economy , the price of oil is increasing incessantly , America ’s once elevated position in world public opinion has reached rock bottom , and the American public is demanding that the soldiers be brought home .
There is no doubt that American interests could have been safeguarded far better by diplomatic means , using the economic clout of the U.S.
That would have saved thousands of American soldiers and 10 times as many Iraqi civilians , and trillions of dollars .
But the problematic ego of George Bush , who hides his hollowness and insecurity behind a bluster of noisy arrogance , caused him to prefer war .
As to his cerebral prowess , a worldwide consensus has been achieved even before the end of his term in office .
In the 60 years of its existence , the state of Israel has fought six major wars and several " smaller " ones ( the War of Attrition , the Grapes of Wrath , the two Intifadas , and more . )
The 1948 confrontation was a war of " no alternative , " if one justifies the Jewish intrusion into Palestine by the fact that there was no other solution for the problem of their existence .
But already the second round , the war of 1956 , was an example of incredible shortsightedness .
The French , who initiated the war , were in a state of denial : they could not admit to themselves that in Algeria a genuine war of liberation was taking place .
Therefore , they convinced themselves that the Egyptian leader , Gamal Abdell - Nasser , was the root of the problem .
David Ben-Gurion and his aides ( and particularly Shimon Peres ) wanted to remove the " Egyptian Tyrant " ( as he was then uniformly called in Israel ) because he had raised the banner of Arab unity , which they considered an existential threat to Israel .
Britain , the third partner , was longing for the past glories of Empire .
All these aims were totally negated by the war : France was expelled from Algeria , together with more than a million settlers ; Britain was pushed to the margins of the Middle East ; and the " danger " of Arab unity proved to be a scarecrow .
The price : a whole Arab generation was convinced that Israel was the ally of the nastiest colonial regimes , and the chances of peace were pushed back for many years .
The 1967 war was intended at the beginning to break the siege on Israel .
But in the course of the fighting , the war of defense became a war of conquest which drove Israel into a vertigo of intoxication from which it has not yet quite recovered .
Since then we have been captives in a vicious circle of occupation , resistance , settlements , and permanent war .
One of the direct results was the 1973 war , which destroyed the myth of our army ’s invincibility .
Yet without this being the intent of our government , this war had one positive result : three unusual personalities 
Anwar Sadat , Menachem Begin , and Jimmy Carter  succeeded in translating Egyptian pride over the successful crossing of the Suez Canal into a peace agreement .
But the same peace could have been achieved a year earlier , without war and without the thousands of killed , if Golda Meir had not arrogantly rejected Sadat ’s proposal .
The First Lebanon War was , perhaps , the most hopeless and dimwitted of Israel ’s wars , a cocktail of arrogance , ignorance , and a complete lack of understanding of the opponent .
Ariel Sharon intended  as he told me in advance , to  ( a ) destroy the PLO , ( b ) cause the Palestinian refugees to flee from Lebanon to Jordan , ( c ) drive the Syrians out of Lebanon , and ( d ) turn Lebanon into an Israeli protectorate .
The results : ( a ) Arafat went to Tunis , and later , as the result of the First Intifada , returned to Palestine in triumph , ( b ) the Palestinian refugees remained in Lebanon , in spite of the Sabra and Shatila massacre that was intended to panic them into fleeing , ( c ) the Syrians remained in Lebanon for another 20 years , and ( d ) the Shi’ites , who had been downtrodden and beholden to Israel , became a powerful force in Lebanon and Israel ’s most determined foe .
The less said about Lebanon War II the better  its true character was obvious right from the start .
Its aims were not frustrated  simply because there were no clear aims at all .
Today Hezbollah is where it was , stronger and better armed , shielded from Israeli attacks by the presence of an international force .
After the First Intifada , Israel recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organization and brought Arafat back to the country .
After the Second Intifada , Hamas won the Palestinian elections and later took over direct control of a part of the country .
Albert Einstein considered it a symptom of madness to repeat again and again doing something that has already failed and to expect a different result every time .
Most politicians and generals conform to this formula .
Again and again they try to achieve their aims by military means and obtain contrary results .
We Israelis occupy an honorable place among these madmen .
War is hell , as an American general pronounced .
It also rarely achieves its aims .
There are good reasons to separate state from church but politicians running for office in the United States often forget them .
Barack Obama , scorched by his association with the Rev Jeremiah Wright , found out weeks ago .
Today , however , it is John McCain doing some urgent pastoral penance .
Mr McCain , the Republican nominee , has had to untie himself from two preachers whose backing he once actively sought .
He fell into temptation believing that by accepting their endorsements he would win the affection of Christian conservatives sceptical about his candidacy .
But he did not properly anticipate the cost of accepting them .
If you have seen the video clips of Mr Wright blurting biblical condemnations of America , you might be startled by the rantings now surfacing from the dubious duo of McCain Christian backers , the Revs John Hagee and Rod Parsley .
Late on Thursday , Mr McCain was forced to issue successive statements renouncing the endorsements of both men .
Thus , he finds himself with a pastor problem just like Mr Obama .
But unlike the Democrat Senator from Illinois , he at least was not a member of either man 's church nor does he have children baptised by either of them .
To that extent , at least , the damage may be less significant .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But embarrassed he certainly is .
It was only in February , during a campaign visit to Cincinnati , for example , that the senator appeared on stage with Mr Parsley , of the World Harvest Church of Columbus in Ohio , calling him " one of the truly great leaders in America , a moral compass , a spiritual guide " .
And his courtship of Mr Hagee is also well documented .
Addressing his Christians United for Israel Church last year , he thanked the pastor for his " spiritual guidance to politicians like me " , saying that " it 's hard to do the Lord 's work in the city of Satan " .
That would be Washington DC , of course .
His strategy bore fruit and the two men endorsed him , giving his campaign hope that conservative Christians might at last be rallying to his cause .
What a pity , then , that in this digital age , there was no suppressing the wackier notes each of them have struck from their respective pulpits .
Worrisome utterances by Mr Hagee have been circulating for months , notably his suggestion that the Catholic Church was the whore of the world .
Last week , more of his views began to surface and any notion of keeping Mr Hagee on the McCain roster of supporters became quite impossible .
It was all about how Hitler and the Holocaust were all part of God 's plan to dispatch the Jews back to Israel .
In a sermon from nearly 10 years ago , Mr Hagee said the Holocaust had been foretold in the Bible .
" How is God going to bring them back to the land ?
The answer is fishers and hunters , " he said in reference to the creation of modern Israel .
" A hunter is someone who comes with a gun and forces you .
Hitler was a hunter . "
An uncomfortable McCain was asked about it during a campaign appearance in California .
" I just think the statement is crazy and unacceptable , " he responded .
" I would reject the endorsement of the expression of those kinds of views . "
In a statement later , he claimed he had known about Mr Hagee 's views before accepting his endorsement .
" Obviously , I find these remarks deeply offensive and indefensible , " he said .
And before you could say " Amen " another statement was landing on the desks of reporters , similarly rejecting the endorsement of Mr Parsley .
Suddenly , he was no longer a " truly great leader " but rather an electoral liability .
The snippets broadcast on ABC television earlier in the day saw him terming Islam the " anti-Christ " and Mohamed " the mouthpiece of a conspiracy of spiritual evil " .
At least now the perils of seeking endorsements from the cloth should be clear to the candidates of both parties .
" This is a perfect example of when politicians and religious leaders try to use each other and end up getting hurt , " said Rev Welton Gaddy , president of the Interfaith Alliance .
At the Geek Ranch we recently made a decision to implement some software in Python .
Or , more accurately , I decided and there was no disagreement .
Then Python gets picked as the best scripting language in the LJ Readers ' Choice survey .
That inspired me to write this article ( and get ready for Perl and Ruby fans to start yelling at me ) .
To understand my position , you need to understand my background and experience .
Yeah , this is is going to be long but I think it is necessary .
The first programming language I learned was Fortran with Format over 40 years ago .
Fortran quickly evolved and I learned Fortran II , Fortran IV and Fortran V . For you Fortran folks , I need to explain Fortran V .
Based on Fortran IV , Fortran V was implemented on Univac 1100 - series hardware ( and probably other Univac systems such as the 494 ) by Computer Sciences Corporation in the late 1960s .
It extended Fortran to include parameter statements — basically a way to define constants , conditional compilation , and statement functions — basically macros that produced in - line code .
In 1970 , I went to work for Computer Sciences Corporation working on systems testing of a new timesharing system they were developing called CSTS .
While some of my work was done in assembly language , the majority was done in Fortran V .
For me , it was the " best scripting language " I had available .
( It was also the only language I had available on CSTS itself for a while . )
Except for toying with Sympl , a language designed by CSC for systems programming that I used on CDC Cyber systems , Fortran remained my primary high - level " solve the problem " language until 1980 .
The other languages in my life were assembly language for various processors including the Motorola 6800 , 6809 and 68000 .
The one diversion from that was a bit of time with Pascal .
This was somewhat accidental .
I secured a part - time job teaching a Programming Style class at The Evergreen State College .
The course outline made sense to me and the interview went well .
The surprise was when I accepted the job and my boss said , " oh , here is the text book we use " .
While the class was mostly theory , Pascal was " the tool " used to put theory into practice .
Armed with a Pascal compiler for my SWTP 6809 system , I learned Pascal two weeks ahead of my students and all went well .
Pascal was designed to be a teaching language and it made a lot of sense .
It , for example , forces you to jump through hoops to do type conversion preventing programming surprises .
In 1980 I got a job with a company that made semiconductor wafer probers .
Their past systems had been controlled with little more than a bunch of hardware logic but we were going to make the ultimate prober .
That included the ability to memorize the layout of a chip and then automatically align the prober to the chips when a new die ( a round silicon wafer with multiple chips on it ) was placed on it .
Being the software guru , I needed to decide in what language we would implement this system .
I initially thought Pascal would work and ordered two different Pascal compilers for our CP / M system .
To make a long story short , Pascal was n't ready for prime time .
To make it into a " production language " it was extended badly .
This lead me to a new decision : we needed a UNIX system and we would develop in C .
My boss believed me ( he did n't know anything about software , UNIX or C ) and I ordered everything .
What he did n't know at the time was that I had never seen a UNIX system and had never programmed in C .
UNIX and C proved themselves , the project was a success and I moved on to the next company to pretty much do the same thing .
But , as I got more comfortable with UNIX I decided I needed a higher level language for some of my work .
After looking around a bit , I decided awk was that language .
It was and , to me , still is an amazingly useful language if what you have is some character data that needs to be massaged .
I even went as far as writing a web application which allowed customers to inquire as to the status of their order in awk just to prove it could be done .
And it was n't even painful to do .
In a more " awkish " venture , my old boss who was now at a company that made microprocessor hardware emulators , asked me if I could do a project for him .
They were converting from a 6809 - based emulator to a 68000 - based one and needed to convert thousands of lines of instruction set encode and decode tables from 6809 assembly language to C .
He had estimated a month to do the task assuming it would be done in C .
I did it in about three days using awk and sed .
So , I was now a C programmer and an awk scripter .
The problem was that there was a gap in my toolset .
Unlike Fortran
V where I even found a way to build and execute assembly language code within the Fortran framework , if I wanted to do anything other than process characters , I had to write the code in C .
In most cases this was n't bad but sometimes 99 % of a task could easily be done in a few lines of awk but would require a lot of C .
Well , in 1999 I had the opportunity to interview Guido von Rossum , the father of Python .
While I had already been playing with Python , my chat with Guido ( a lot more than an interview ) inspired me to get more serious .
The interview actually addresses what is wrong with awk and Perl so I wo n't go into more detail here .
While my life in the last almost ten years has not been primarily programming , I do turn to Python as my tool of choice .
Some of what I have done can be called scripting but not all .
For example , I implemented a credit card processing system for Visanet ( the nastiest of all possible credit card protocols ) in Python .
I also have done some work with Karrigell , a web framework implemented in Python .
Ok , I talked about awk 's limitations and Guido helped me beat up Perl in the interview .
Note that my default comment about Perl is that if you do n't know regular expressions and UNIX / Linux shell programming , Perl is not the best way to get to knowing a scripting language .
So , what 's left ?
The obvious choice is Ruby .
Well , this is where my long , boring history of my Pascal experience fits in .
First , let me say that I like Ruby .
It is a nicely - designed and very clean language .
If you do n't already know Python , you should seriously give it a try .
But , is it better than Python ?
I think not .
Ruby , while not really new , just has n't done as much work as Python .
Much like Pascal 30 years ago , Ruby looks good on paper .
Pascal 's claim to fame was that there were no surprises .
Ruby 's is that it is pure object oriented .
Those are both good things .
But , as Ruby does more heavy lifting , it seems likely to me that it will have to evolve .
That is , its purity will get subverted much like the purity of Pascal did .
In any case , I will stick with Python .
It has certainly evolved over the years but that evolution feels like taking a solid base , seeing what makes it more useful and cleanly handling the evolution .
To me , Python 2.5 is easier to explain to someone that Python 1.5.2 .
a one man band with no fans
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Moody 's Investors Service said Wednesday that it may downgrade the Aaa ratings of Ambac Financial and MBIA Inc. because the bond insurers are being hit harder than expected by the mortgage - fueled credit crunch .
MBIA shares slumped 16 % to close at $ 5.63 after the ratings agency 's warning .
Ambac dropped 17 % to $ 2.49 .
Both stocks hit record lows .
" They have no future , " said Sean Egan , chief ratings officer at Egan - Jones Ratings , a rating agency that 's paid by investors rather than issuers .
" They will argue otherwise but as a practical matter they do n't have a future . "
Egan -Jones has non-investment grade , or junk , ratings on MBIA and Ambac and began downgrading the bond insurers a year and a half ago , he noted .
“ ' They have no future .
They will argue otherwise but as a practical matter they do n't have a future . ' ” — Sean Egan , Egan -Jones Ratings
Bond insurers rely on their top ratings to sell guarantees on various types of debt , including municipal bonds , corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs .
But the mortgage meltdown and falling house prices have hit them hard , putting those top ratings in jeopardy .
The market lost confidence in the official triple - A ratings of MBIA MBI , - 4.41 % and Ambac ABK , several months ago , making it virtually impossible for the companies to sell new guarantees .
Without new business , they are essentially already in " run-off , " where insurers stop selling policies and allow their existing book of business to mature and expire , Egan explained .
" It was going to be very difficult anyway , but Moody 's announcement today makes it even more difficult for these companies to climb back , " he added .
MBIA and Ambac raised billions of dollars in new capital earlier this year to protect their top ratings .
But their shares and debt securities are now trading at such depressed levels that it would be very difficult to raise more money now , Egan and others said .
Most likely Aa
Ambac and MBIA MBI , - 4.41 % have weak new business prospects , little financial flexibility and may suffer higher losses on guarantees they sold on mortgage - related securities , Moody 's said in a statement .
The agency put the Aaa ratings of MBIA 's main bond insurance unit -- MBIA Insurance Corp. -- on review for a possible downgrade .
The most likely outcome of the review will be a downgrade to the Aa range .
But Moody 's also warned that it could cut MBIA to single A .
" We would view the loss of this rating as a significant detriment to MBIA 's ability to write new business and raise additional capital , " Catherine Seifert , an insurance analyst at Standard & Poor 's Equity Research , wrote in a note to clients .
" This move , if it comes to fruition , may escalate the downward spiral already underway in MBIA 's shares . "
Moody 's also put the Aaa ratings of Ambac 's main bond insurance subsidiary on review for a possible downgrade .
The most likely outcome of this review will be a cut to the Aa range , the agency said .
$ 900 million stays
MBIA said it disagreed with Moody 's decision and argued that there have n't been any material changes in the company 's operating environment that would warrant a downgrade .
" We are surprised by both the timing and direction of this action and can only conclude that the requirements for a Triple - A rating continue to change , " said Jay Brown , chairman and CEO of MBIA , in a statement .
The bond insurer raised new capital earlier this year and was planning to funnel $ 900 million of that from its holding company into its bond insurance subsidiary MBIA Insurance Corp .
But the company said on Wednesday that it wo n't do that now because the original plan was designed to support the unit 's triple - A rating .
Jack Dorer , a managing director at Moody's , said MBIA 's decision to keep the $ 900 million at its holding company will be taken into account when deciding whether to downgrade the bond insurance unit .
" In terms of the claims - paying ability of the operating company it is certainly better to have money in the operating company than not , " he explained in an interview .
Ambac wo n't raise new capital
Ambac said it was " disappointed " by Moody 's decision , stressing that it 's raised $ 1.5 billion in new capital since March and expects to generate a new capital cushion of $ 500 million by the end of the second quarter .
The bond insurer also said it 's not planning to raise any more new capital .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
When -- after many visits to doctors and hospitals --- Tian Huiping 's son was finally diagnosed with autism , the only advice she was given was to make use of a loophole in China 's " one- child " policy that allows parents with disabled children to have one more .
Tian Huiping considered suicide when she learned her son was autistic .
Instead , she opened an autism school .
Alone with her son after her husband divorced her , Tian became depressed and desperate enough to consider killing herself and her son , Yang Tao .
" I made a poison for me and my son , " she said .
But when she saw her boy smiling up at her happily , she says she could n't do it .
" I thought , I have no right to end his life , and I cannot kill myself and leave him . "
From that horrible moment 18 years ago , there grew an incredible resolve -- the kind of dogged determination borne of a mother protecting her child .
At one of the many hospitals she went to for help in Beijing , Tian came across a small brochure printed by the Taiwan Autism Association , explaining a few basic concepts on how to teach kids with autism .
Watch mom describe being near suicide with autistic child »
She read it over and over again .
" I just tried to work a little bit with my son and another boy we lived with , " she says .
" And it worked -- a little bit -- but I saw hope . "
She rented space in a kindergarten and opened her own school at first , with just six autistic children .
She slept on the floor in a store room to save money .
Two months later , the kindergarten closed her down .
" We did n't make enough money for them , " she says .
But the children had shown progress , even though the teaching was based on a few simple concepts in a few pages of a brochure .
Soon , the word was out .
And more parents with autistic children came to Tian looking for help , all of them with the same fears .

" If my son can not go to school , what will happen with him ?
As a mother this is such a big worry . "
Fifteen years later , Tian and her Stars and Rain Education Institute for Autism help more than 3,000 children a day through her school and its outreach program .
Eighty children of all ages enroll in her school for an 11 - week course with their parents -- many of whom travel hundreds of miles from small villages to get help for their children .
The parents then return to their villages to try to educate the local population .

The Chinese government says there are only about 100,000 people with autism in the entire country , but unofficial estimates put the number between 1 - 2 million people , perhaps even more .
Tian says her institute has a list of just 60 doctors nationwide who are capable of diagnosing autism .
Fifteen years ago , she says there were just three .
Because resources are scarce , the focus at her school is on teaching the parents how to educate their children .
They first help parents to accept their child 's disability and teach basic information about autism awareness .
Programs are individualized for each child , with teachers working on verbal communication , managing tantrums and other early intervention methods .
One of the parents is a woman named Fu Jing .
It took three years and countless wrong diagnoses , before she finally learned why her son Ruoqi was n't talking or playing with other kids , she said .
When Fu leaned Ruoqi was autistic , her world collapsed .
" I thought about committing suicide with my son .
I could not imagine the pain he would suffer when he grew up .
All the unfair treatment from society and schoolmates , " she said .
" As a mother , I felt so much pain . "
But now Fu is learning how to communicate with her son , how to raise him , even how to love him .
" The training here strengthens the acceptance of your kids .
Honestly speaking , as an ordinary person , I get angry and even shout at him , " she said .
" But here , they say we have to accept our kids as who they are .
I feel that I have changed . "
There are no government programs to help parents with autistic children -- and there is no government help for Tian and her school .
" I 'm not used to requesting anything from government , " she says .
" We have grown up in such a situation . "
For the past three years , Stars and Rain has been working with Heartspring , a Kansas - based center for children with special needs .
Teachers from Beijing have been sent to Wichita , Kansas , for training ; and teachers like Connie Coulter have come to Stars and Rain .
When she arrived in February , Coulter found a school with almost no resources and without access to the latest research .
Some parents , she said , would come up to her and ask about a magic pill or vitamin " to cure their child . "
" In the villages where they 're coming from , they 're just viewed as basically throw - away children , " she said .
" To tell [ the parents ] and be able to educate them , it was an exhilarating experience to talk to them about the basic understanding of autism . "
Coulter described her time at the school as a " life - changing experience . "
" There are things that they have taught me about value of family , the passion , the empathy , the sacrifice that I do n't see as much in the United States , " she said .
It 's a sacrifice these parents feel lucky to make -- because in China , if your child has autism and you want to help , there is almost nowhere else to turn .

Barack Obama Co-Sponsored a Bill to Create a National Fingerprint Registry
I first wrote about the Democrats sneaking a national fingerprint registry into the housing bail out bill here .
What I did n’t realize at that time was that Barack Obama was actually a co-sponsor of this bill .
Barack Obama has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration and of the human rights violations he believe the president has committed .
This coupled with his belief that the president is violating people ’s privacy by listening to their phone conversations and trampling the constitution in general , makes me wonder how Barack Obama could possibly agree with a national fingerprint registry .
Never mind co-sponsor it .
Requiring innocent Americans to send in their fingerprints to the feds while doing nothing wrong is perfectly fine to Obama , but listening to the international incoming calls from suspected terrorists is not okay .
That is what Barack Obama is telling us .
That is the type of convoluted , backwards thinking logic that we will be dealing with after Barack Obama becomes president .
It is almost as if he makes up his positions as he goes and does n’t even see the big picture even when it contradicts what he supposedly believes in .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - New Zealand will ban traditional light bulbs in favor of energy - saving alternatives in 2009 , Energy Minister David Parker said on Tuesday .
He said the move would cut lighting energy consumption by 20 percent by 2015 and save up to NZ$ 500 million ( $ 376 million ) by 2020 .
“ It is intended that from late next year , these inefficient incandescent bulbs will be phased out because they waste so much energy , ” Parker said in a statement .
He said a wide range of more energy efficient bulbs using less power and lasting longer , such as compact fluorescent lamps and low voltage halogens , were now available .
New minimum energy standards would mean no fresh stocks of the incandescent bulbs could be imported from October 2009 .
New Zealand is currently estimated to produce about 2.65 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions a year in generating the power for lighting .
The minority centre - left Labor government , a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol , has set a long - term goal of making New Zealand carbon neutral .
Around 60 percent of power the country ’s comes from hydro- electricity , and a hold has been put on new thermal - generated power stations .
More than half of New Zealand ’s greenhouse gas emissions come from 40 million sheep and 9 million cattle , which are the mainstay of the economically key agricultural sector .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Good weather will help the world ’s farmers reap record wheat and rice crops this year , the U.S. government said on Friday , which should allay fears of shortages and help bring prices down from current high levels .

The U.S. Agriculture Department also forecast a record global crop of feed grain , used to feed livestock .
The USDA announcement was expected to calm fears of food shortages , worsened by the cyclone that hit Myanmar ’s rich rice - producing Irrawaddy delta last week , and by a larger than expected 500,000 metric ton Malaysian rice purchase on Thursday .
Disappointing harvests , the boom in biofuels and higher meat consumption have pushed up grain prices in the past two years , raising food prices and sparking protests in some 40 poorer countries whose people have felt the effect most strongly .
Officials at the U.N. Human Rights Council said it would hold a special session on May 23 to assess the effect of the food crisis on the right to food of millions of people suffering from high prices , notably in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia .
“ We ’re keeping our fingers crossed that we get good harvests this year ... and that it brings prices down some from their high peaks , ” said analyst David Orden of the International Food Policy Research Institute , a think tank .
Even with bountiful crops , Orden said , larger international food aid efforts would be vital because prices would be higher than usual for the next couple of years at least .
The USDA said the world wheat crop would rise 8 percent to a record 656 million metric tons in 2008 / 09 .
It projected global rice output at a record 432 million metric tons , up 5 million metric tons from 2007 / 08 .
“ This ought to take the edge off commodity prices ” said private U.S. consultant John Schnittker , making it easier for poor people to buy enough food .
Other signals that the supply crisis might be easing came from India , which said on Friday that it might allow limited rice exports , and from the Philippines , where traders held off purchases hoping for new crops soon from southeast Asia .
India , the world ’s second - biggest rice exporter last year , banned shipments of all rice except basmati in March , one of a series of protectionist measures worldwide that triggered a wave of panic buying .
“ We are reviewing the situation and may allow limited exports , ” Commerce Secretary Gopal Pillai said on the sidelines of a conference in Kochi , adding that the government might also review an export tax on basmati rice .
The USDA forecast depressed wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade , but rice prices rose on the USDA prediction that Cyclone Nargis would reduce Myanmar ’s rice crop by 7 percent .
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation had said it expected Myanmar to export 600,000 metric tons of rice this year .
The soaring cost of food has fuelled unease among governments and street protests from Haiti to Bangladesh .
The situation has worsened as grain exporting nations curb shipments to ensure domestic supplies and keep inflation under control .
The Philippines , the world ’s biggest rice importer , has so far bought about 1.7 million metric tons of the 2.2 million metric tons of rice it needs this year , and officials and traders said they expected prices to fall within a few months .
The USDA said the record harvests expected this year meant there would be an end - year world wheat surplus of 124 million metric tons , despite a rise in consumption of 3.5 percent .
The higher rice crop would leave a stockpile of 82.6 million metric tons , the largest in six years , it said .

Today Ford announced an $ 8.7 billion loss for the quarter .
One might wonder how Ford , GM , and Chrysler have fallen so far so fast .
None of the press coverage mentions what is likely the root cause of the precipitous decline : the 25 percent tariff that the U.S. imposes on “ light trucks ” ( search for “ light truck tariff ” in Google News and you will see how sparse the coverage is ) .
Imported cars are taxed at 2.5 percent .
Imported SUVs , minivans , and pickup trucks are taxed at 25 percent .
Domestic auto manufacturers are forced to compete on the world market when they make cars .
They lose money on nearly every car that they make .
Domestic manufacturers have a built - in 25 percent profit if they can make a pickup truck at the same price as someone in Japan , Eastern Europe , or China .
Ford and GM make money on pickup trucks , though only at the expense of American consumers who pay 25 percent more for their gas guzzlers than they should .
American consumers have finally decided that they do n’t need to pay a 25 - percent premium for vehicles that are not efficient means of personal transportation and hence the collapse in profits and share price .
Without the tariff walls it is not clear that the U.S. operations of Ford and GM , considering their union contracts and pension / health care liabilities , have any value at all .

Code Pink gives Carter ' Badge of Courage ' for meeting with Hamas RAW STORY
Published : Friday April 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Anti-war activist group Code Pink is celebrating former President Jimmy Carter 's recent trip to the Middle East where he visited with leaders of Hamas to discuss an Israeli - Palestinian peace agreement .
" While George Bush 's war mongering has made the U.S. hated all over the world , this week former president Jimmy Carter 's courageous efforts in the Middle East could be crucial steps toward restoring peace to the region , " Code Pink members said in an e-mail to supporters .
" After all , Carter negotiated the only lasting peace in the Middle East -- the Egypt - Israel peace accord that has prevented an Arab - Israeli war ever since . "
Code Pink says Carter 's meeting with Hamas , which the US government considers a terrorist group although it won elections in Palestine in 2006 , struck a blow for peaceful negotiations instead of saber - rattling .
It called on members to send Carter a Pink Badge of Courage .
After a meeting in Damascus with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad and the Hamas leaders , Carter said he had obtained concessions from them that could speed up the Middle East peace process , according to the New York Times .
Mr. Carter said he extracted a promise from Hamas to respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip negotiated by Hamass rivals in the Palestinian Authority if it were ratified by a referendum of the Palestinian people .
Furthermore , Syrian leaders told him , he said , that about 85 percent of the issues between Syrias government and Israel had been resolved in prior negotiations and that it wanted a peace deal as soon as possible . ...
On Monday , Mr. Carter called the agreement on a Palestinian state , obtained from Hamas in writing , important because it appeared to mean that Hamas , which seized control of the Gaza Strip last June , would not disrupt negotiations or implementation of any accord if the Palestinian people supported it in a free vote .
 If the agreement calls for a two - state solution and the recognition of Israel and Palestine , Hamas will , in effect , recognize Israel , if the people agree on the plan ,  Mr. Carter told the Israel Council on Foreign Relations in a speech here .
Carter was widely criticized for meeting with Hamas .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama panned the meeting as he reached out to Jewish voters in the US .
Code Pink , however , said the meeting was a reinforcement of America 's ideals .
" Carter is staying true to America 's democratic principles of recognizing the legitimacy of a representative government , " the group said , " while underscoring the hypocrisy of the US mainstream media and the White House . "
A reader writes :
I was in Europe the past two weeks and it was absolutely stunning .
Everywhere I went , people wanted to speak to me about Obama .
An old woman sweeping the street in Lisbon stopped me when she heard me speaking English and said : " American ?
Obama ? "
I could only shake my head and smile since I do n't speak Portuguese .
The doorman in Frankfurt , the waiter in Munich and the hotel receptionist in The Netherlands all bent my ear for about 10 - 15 minutes about how they are so looking forward to having Obama as President .
Notice that they did n't say " your President " or " the American President " - it was simply " President " .
Everyone feels like they have a stake in this election .
I hope the American public understands just how important it is that we get this one right .
Finally , at a medical conference a doctor from Angola came up to me with tears in his eyes and implored for me to vote for Obama .
I told him that I was an Obama supporter and he thank me over and over .
As he left , he said to me " Only in America .
Only in America . "

Infowars has received an anonymous email reporting that the Department of Justice has placed an order for a large number of ipods with “ Bilderberg 2008 ” engraved on the back and shipping to Chantilly , Virginia , at American tax payer expense .
According to the source , the DOJ is “ freaking out ” because the order will arrive late .
Of course , it should probably come as no surprise a gaggle of global elitists , meeting in secret outside of the District of Criminals to plot their one world agenda , would get engraved iPod freebies .
It is , however , yet another indication that a Bilderberg coterie indeed exists and is meeting in Chantilly , Virginia this week .
Thanks to Alex Jones , Jim Tucker , Daniel Estulin and others , we have a better understanding of the Bilderberg agenda , never mind the concerted effort of the corporate media to characterize the Bilderbergers as a harmless association of politicians and business types .
“ The Bilderberg Group is an elite invitation - only conference of influential members of the business , media and political communities .
Past attendees have included Hillary Clinton , Bill Clinton , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , ” the BBC reported .
“ It ’s officially described as a private gathering , but with a guest list including the heads of European and American corporations , political leaders and a few intellectuals , it ’s one of the most influential organizations on the planet . ”
“ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , ” wrote the political economist Adam Smith over 250 years ago .
For the the Bilderberg attendees , the “ trade ” is globalization and the “ conspiracy ” a one world government .

Adding just the right dash of nanoparticles to standard mixes of lubricants and refrigerants could yield the equivalent of an energy - saving chill pill for factories , hospitals , ships , and others with large cooling systems , suggest the latest results from National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) research that is pursuing promising formulations .
NIST experiments with varying concentrations of nanoparticle additives indicate a major opportunity to improve the energy efficiency of large industrial , commercial , and institutional cooling systems known as chillers .
These systems account for about 13 percent of the power consumed by the nation 's buildings , and about 9 percent of the overall demand for electric power , according to the Department of Energy .
NIST researcher Mark Kedzierski has found that dispersing " sufficient " amounts of copper oxide particles ( 30 nanometers in diameter ) in a common polyester lubricant and combining it with an equally pedestrian refrigerant ( R134a ) improves heat transfer by between 50 percent and 275 percent .
" We were astounded , " he says .
Results of this work have been presented at recent conferences and will be reported in an upcoming issue of the ASME Journal of Heat Transfer .
Just how nanomaterial additives to lubricants improve the dynamics of heat transfer in refrigerant / lubricant mixtures is not thoroughly understood .
The NIST research effort aims to fill gaps in knowledge that impede efforts to determine and , ultimately , predict optimal combinations of the three types of substances .
" As with all good things , the process is far from foolproof , " Kedzierski explains .
" In fact , an insufficient amount or the wrong type of particles might lead to degradation in performance . "
On the basis of work so far , the researcher speculates several factors likely account for nanoparticle - enabled improvements in heat - transfer performance .
For one , nanoparticles of materials with high thermal conductivity improve heat transfer rates for the system .
Preliminary results of the NIST research also indicate that , in sufficient concentrations , nanomaterials enhance heat transfer by encouraging more vigorous boiling of the mixture .
The tiny particles stimulate , in effect , double bubbles -- secondary bubbles that form atop bubbles initiated at the boiling site .
Bubbles carry heat away from the surface , and the fact that they 're being formed more efficiently because of the nanoparticles means the heat gets transferred more readily .
Other interactions , Kedzierski says , also are likely to contribute to the dramatic performance improvements reported at NIST and elsewhere .
Success in optimizing recipes of refrigerants , lubricants and nanoparticle additives would pay immediate and long - term dividends .
If they did not harm other aspects of equipment performance , high - performance mixtures could be swapped into existing chillers , resulting in immediate energy savings .
And , because of improved energy efficiency , next - generation equipment would be smaller , requiring fewer raw materials in their manufacture .
( Natural News ) Seattle - area food cooperative PCC Natural Markets has removed all products containing high - fructose corn syrup from its shelves , and has announced that it will no longer carry any product sweetened with the controversial ingredient .
" I 'm completely happy about that , " said PCC shopper Karen Hunt .
" I try hard not to add that to my family 's diet ; I just do n't think we need to do that .
I 'm sure there 's a lot of arguments on both sides , but I just sort of feel intuitively that it 's better not to .
" High - fructose corn syrup has drawn criticism both as a sweetener in general and also due to its specific biochemical properties .
Studies have indicated that high - fructose corn syrup may be worse for the body than similar sweeteners , and that it may interfere with the brain 's ability to tell when it is full .
Environmentalists have also criticized the techniques used to produce the sweetener .
Because it is so cheap to produce , critics also say that high - fructose corn syrup has encouraged food manufacturers to add empty calories to staples such as breads and cereals , simply to add a bit of sweetness and make the food taste more appealing .
Among the products no longer carried at PCC are Wheat Thins , Kellogg 's Raising Bran and Sara Lee whole - grain bagels .
PCC is the first major retailer to ban high - fructose corn syrup since Earth Fare , a 13 - store natural foods market in North Carolina , did so in 2004 .
" You look at how pervasive [ high - fructose corn syrup ] is , then you start asking yourself , ' How is this stuff produced , anyway ? ' " said Troy DeGroff , Earth Fare 's sales and marketing director .
" It 's not in keeping with natural processes or the tenets of a healthy store .
It 's our obligation to remove this .
We need more retailers who are willing to take a stand " PCC has also banned trans fats and milk produced from cows treated with growth hormones , and does not provide plastic bags for shoppers .

Monotreme 's genome shares features with mammals , birds and reptiles .

A draft sequence of the platypus genome reveals reptilian and mammalian elements and provides more evidence for its place in the ancestral line of animal evolution .
The platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) is endemic to Australia and one of nature 's oddest creatures , seemingly assembled from the spare parts of other animals .
The semi-aquatic monotreme is a venomous , duck - billed mammal that lays eggs , nurses its young and occupies a lonely twig at the end of a sparse branch of the vertebrate evolutionary tree .
Now , the structure of its genome has revealed new clues to how mammals evolved .
“ The analysis is beginning to align these strange features with genetic innovation , ” says Wesley Warren of Washington University in St Louis , Missouri , the lead author of the genome analysis — a huge international project ( see page 175 ) .
Comparisons with the genomes of other mammals will help to date the emergence of the platypus 's distinguishing characteristics and reveal the genetic events that underlie them .
For example , mammals are defined by their possession of mammary glands , which in females can produce milk .
Although the platypus does n't have nipples , it produces true milk — full of fats , sugars and proteins — which the young suck through a glandular patch on its skin .
The analysis shows that the platypus has genes for the family of milk proteins called caseins , which map together in a cluster that matches that of humans .
This is a sign that one of the genetic innovations that led to the development of milk occurred more than 166 million years ago , and after mammals first split from the lizard - like sauropsids that gave rise to modern reptiles and birds .
“ There is nothing quite as enigmatic as a platypus . ”
The genes relating to the platypus 's eggs offer further insight .
The embryos develop within the maternal uterus for 21 days before they are expelled in a thumbnail - sized leathery egg .
After 11 days of incubation , the young hatchlings emerge with their organs not yet fully differentiated .
Like marsupials , they finish developing while nursing .
The platypus shares with other mammals four genes associated with the zona pellucida , a gel - like coating that facilitates fertilization of the egg .
But it also has two matches for ZPAX genes that had previously been found only in birds , amphibians and fish .
And it shares with the chicken a gene for a type of egg - yolk protein called a vitellogenin .
That suggests that vitellogenins , which are found in birds and fish , predate the split from the sauropsids , although the platypus retains only one vitellogenin gene , whereas the chicken has three .
Other characteristics that seem purely reptilian turn out to have evolved independently , the analysis suggests .
Male platypuses have spurs on their hind legs that are loaded with a venom so potent it can kill a dog .
Like the venom of reptiles , the poison is a cocktail of variations on at least three kinds of peptide .
But the variations arose from duplications of different genes in platypuses than in modern reptiles .
The similarity in venom is an example of convergent evolution between the two tetrapods .
“ There is nothing quite as enigmatic as a platypus , ” says Richard Gibbs , who directs the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas .
“ You have got these reptilian repeat patterns and these more recently evolved milk genes and independent evolution of the venom .
It all points to how idiosyncratic evolution is . ”
The platypus has genetic characteristics of both reptiles and mammals .

The sex of the platypus is determined by a set of ten chromosomes , an oddity that sets it apart from all other mammals and from birds .
These chromosomes link during meiosis to form a chain that ensures every sperm gets a set of all Xs or all Ys. Despite the similar designations , none of the platypus X chromosomes resembles the human , dog or mouse X . “ The sex chromosomes are absolutely , completely different from all other mammals .
We had not expected that , ” says Jennifer Graves of the Australian National University in Canberra , who studies sex differentiation and is an author on the paper .
Instead , the platypus Xs better match the avian Z sex chromosome .
Another chromosome matches the mouse X , Graves and her colleagues report in Genome Research ( F. Veyrunes et al. Genome Res. doi:10.1101/gr.7101908 ; 2008 ) .
This is evidence that placental mammalian sex chromosomes and the sex - determining gene Sry — found on the Y chromosome — evolved after the monotremes diverged from mammals , much later than previously thought .
“ Our sex chromosomes are a plain old ordinary autosome in the platypus , ” Graves says .
A team led by Gregory Hannon of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York sequenced microRNAs , which regulate gene expression , that were isolated from six platypus tissues .
Again they found a mix of reptile and mammal examples ( E. P. Murchison et al. Genome Res. doi:10.1101/gr.73056.107 ; 2008 ) .
“ We have microRNAs that are shared with chickens and not mammals as well as ones that are shared with mammals , but not chickens , ” Hannon says .
“ The reptilian characteristics [ of miRNA ] are not convergent features , and this is a feature of the genome as well , ” Hannon says .
“ Morphology did n't have to be reflected at the level of molecular biology , but in this case it was . ”
Adam Felsenfeld , who directs the Large - Scale Sequencing Program at the US National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , says : “ I find it fascinating that genomic features of what are now two separate lineages can coexist in the genome of a single organism . ”

About half of the platypus genome contains non-coding DNA sequences .
Many are ' interspersed repeats ' , copies of transposable elements that are characteristically abundant in other mammalian genomes .
In contrast , repeats of very short sequences called microsatellite DNA are rarer in the platypus genome than in other mammals ' and more closely resemble those of reptiles , with the balance of nucleic acids tipped toward A–T base pairs .
The sequence information has already generated useful genetic markers for studying the population structure of the elusive platypus in the wild .
Differences in repeated elements , for example , separate the Tasmanian population from that on Australia 's mainland , and could be used to improve understanding of the ecology of this enigmatic animal .
There are as yet no plans to sequence the genome of its closest relative , the echidna .

( NewsTarget ) Feeling depressed or down ?
Do n't automatically reach for an anti-depressant .
Do some yoga .
These days , the typical treatment for depression comes in the form of a pill , which can often lead to serious side effects and dependency .
Prior to modern drug companies , however , sages from the East discovered a method of calming the mind and soothing the spirit .
These physical exercises , called " asanas , " are what modern Westerners typically think of when they hear the term " yoga .
"
The roots of yoga date back tens of thousands of years .
Yoga , in the grander sense of the word , is not just physical exercise .
It is more than asanas .
It consists of an entire philosophy and prescription for emotional and spiritual well - being .
Yoga asanas ( or postures ) were developed to prepare the body and mind for long periods of meditation .
Ancient yogis believed that it was difficult to reach heights of spiritual awareness with a body that was suffering from ill health .
The mind also needed to become calm and serene , and this was accomplished through the physical practice of asana .
Through trial and error over thousands of years , yoga evolved to become a powerful and effective mind / body practice .
Thus , yoga is a special form of exercise specifically designed to calm the mind and reduce mental chatter and worry .
Certainly , you might feel some stress relief from jogging or tennis , but yoga , unlike most western forms of exercise , was actually designed to create a sense of peace and serenity .
Western studies have shown that regular exercise can provide relief from depression .
In addition , yoga postures have been specifically shown to increase levels of the neurotransmitter GABA , which may alleviate depression .
Furthermore , as many enthusiastic practitioners of yoga will tell you , yoga seems to go beyond the benefits of general exercise and helps increase overall happiness .
On a physical level , yoga postures are designed to massage the internal organs , increasing and decreasing blood flow to targeted areas .
This circulates the blood and lymph , thus removing stale bodily fluids from vital organs and helping flush toxins .
The physical movement can also stimulate certain hormones and neurotransmitters , leading to positive feelings and emotions .
Additionally , according to the Eastern medical model , yoga exercises are also designed to specifically move the " prana " or life force energy in the body ( traditional Oriental medicine calls this " chi " ) .
Keeping this life force fresh and alive is vital to well - being , according to Eastern philosophy .
Yoga poses stimulate certain aspects of the body 's energetic system , comprised of " chakras " ( energy centers ) and " nadis " ( the yogic term for " meridians " or energy channels ) .
As stuck prana is moved and energized , old emotional wounds manifesting as blockages in the energy centers and channels can be released .
This may explain why so many yoga practitioners experience a sense of emotional release from practicing certain poses , such as a spontaneous expression of tears , providing a sense of extreme relief and peace afterwards .
The special breathing exercises that go along with yoga ( called " pranayama " ) also serve to energize the body by bringing fresh quantities of prana in through the breath .
These breathing exercises can also alleviate anxiety and create a sense of calm and well - being .
Not all yoga is the same .
Since its introduction to the West , yoga has branched off into a variety of styles and flavors .
The type of yoga you choose should reflect your physical requirements as well as your spiritual interests .
Some kinds of yoga are very physically strenuous and can potentially create more stress if you are in a class where everyone is powering through a challenging set , leaving you feeling inadequate or overwhelmed .
Yoga styles such as power yoga or ashtanga can be quite physically challenging .
Yoga flow classes may be more about losing pounds and sweating out calories than creating mental peace and clarity .
Unless you are already an athlete and looking for a strenuous workout , you might consider trying a more relaxed style .
If you are just starting out with yoga , you might try a beginner 's yoga class or a gentle yoga class .
Restorative yoga classes can be wonderfully rejuvenating ; they consist of gentle poses , often using bolsters and props to allow you to rest and relax in the pose .
Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga that involves dynamic , repetitive movements and breath work to move the energy and lift the spirit .
It is the only form of yoga that specifically targets certain glands in the brain , such as the pituitary and the pineal glands , to activate them for improved health and well - being .
( For an excellent book on the subject , seeby Dharma Singh Khalsa , M.D. and Cameron Stauth . ) Ideally , if you are looking to yoga to improve mental health , consider finding a class that combines some meditation before or after the postures .
Meditation has also been shown to increase positive emotions such as loving - kindness and happiness in some studies
With the variety of yoga styles available , you may have to try out a few different classes to see what appeals to you the most .
Do not be discouraged if you are n't immediately drawn to the first class you attend .
Be aware that not all yoga classes are equal .
Some classes include pranayama breath work and others do not .
Some include chanting and others do not .
You may even find yoga classes in your area specifically for Christians , while others may be more secular .
It 's a good idea to check out a few studios and classes and find the one that resonates with you the most .
Remember , yoga alone cannot cure depression if you are otherwise treating your body and your mind badly .
Alcohol , drug use ( including mind - altering prescription drugs ) , poor diet , lack of sleep , and other bad habits can negate the positive effects of yoga .
Doing yoga regularly will also make a huge difference in its effectiveness .
Ideally , practice yoga for at least 20 minutes daily , or at a minimum three times per week .
You can supplement outside yoga classes with a simple , at - home practice .
With the popularity of yoga soaring , DVDs and books on yoga are plentiful .
There 's a reason why people who practice yoga often credit it for changing their lives .
Unlike no other exercise on the planet , yoga provides physical as well as emotional benefits that can create true happiness and well - being .
Best of all , you can do it at home for free , with no negative side effects .

An important component of early genetic material found in meteorite fragments is extraterrestrial in origin , say scientists from Europe and the USA .
They say their research in Earth and Planetary Science Letters provides evidence that life ’s raw materials came from sources beyond the Earth .
The materials they have found include the molecules uracil and xanthine , which are precursors to the molecules that make up DNA and RNA , and are known as nucleobases .
The team discovered the molecules in rock fragments of the Murchison meteorite , which crashed in Australia in 1969 .
They tested the meteorite material to determine whether the molecules came from the solar system or were a result of contamination when the meteorite landed on Earth .
The analysis shows that the nucleobases contain a heavy form of carbon which could only have been formed in space .
Materials formed on Earth consist of a lighter variety of carbon .
Lead author Dr Zita Martins , of the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London , says that the research may provide another piece of evidence explaining the evolution of early life .
She says :
“ We believe early life may have adopted nucleobases from meteoritic fragments for use in genetic coding which enabled them to pass on their successful features to subsequent generations . ”
Between 3.8 to 4.5 billion years ago large numbers of rocks similar to the Murchison meteorite rained down on Earth at the time when primitive life was forming .
The heavy bombardment would have dropped large amounts of meteorite material to the surface on planets like Earth and Mars .
Co-author Professor Mark Sephton , also of Imperial ’s Department of Earth Science and Engineering , believes this research is an important step in understanding how early life might have evolved .
He added :
“ Because meteorites represent left over materials from the formation of the solar system , the key components for life -- including nucleobases -- could be widespread in the cosmos .
As more and more of life ’s raw materials are discovered in objects from space , the possibility of life springing forth wherever the right chemistry is present becomes more likely . ”

Wait a minute , Liar .
It was all Kate harris ' fault because the district belonged to her and there would not have even been a need for an election if that freak stayed to terrorize the people of Sarasota for another 2 years ?
Does that not freak anyone else out ?
Hey liar what makes you think there would n't have been a malfunction of voting machines if Harris was in the race ?
Brad , I hope you do n't take Antonin Scalia 's advice and just get over this .
Why arent ' there a thousand protesters a day at liar 's office calling for LIAR 's resignation .
Signs that say LIAR LIAR and WE DEMAND PAPER TRAILS .
If LIAR 'S loony toons cell phone ringer that just happened to be left on and ringing during LIAR 'S Liefest got LIAR to pee LIAR 'S pants , think what the American people out for justice could do to LIAR .

In the Defense of Kathy Dent this exceptional public official I offer the following ….
a . She was with a “ power users ” group from ES&S at the same convention so what else could she say … .
It was a joint conference ….
b . She was so nervous she did not recall who paid for her way out there and what about social drinks and jet lag …
c. She told them there was an “ SQL ” worm in early voting but she had backup .. now that was exceptional planning … but turns out she just was not clear on the State required election report where it was stated that it was just an “ outage ” with some libraries .. the County IT report stated that the “ hacker captured ” the system operator passwords , , , not any kind of SQL worm know to man .. more like a Trojan horse … in the form of an SQL worm ….. taking over passwords and closing off the system for two hours with voters data sent all over the internet world …..
d . As President of the Florida Supervisors of Election ’s she deserves more respect , , .. activists she said are good and bad just check with Kathy to get the list .. as an example in the recount in Nov 2006 the present Sec of State , ESS Executives , her lawyer a registered lobbyist , lawyers from the State division of elections , the chief of certification for the State of Florida , even the public relations outside consultants for ES&S all in one warehouse .
So many turning out to support her that there was not room for public observers … then one of the “ bad ” activists strikes ! .. and reminds the horde of legal staff that they are not following the Florida Election Code … and the bad activist is armed with a copy of the law the only one in the building … they borrow it and a Judge finds that bad activist is the only one there who knows the law … .
Poor Kathy , President of all the SOE ’s in Florida had to say that it was an “ archaic ” law but just to go that extra mile they would then follow it ….
so much on her mind … .
Like ten machines with broken seals on them and the “ archaic ” law that required calling out the poll tapes …to the public .
e . She told the conference audience about all that security , first mission for her and her staff .. but the speakers time was short so she did not have time to tell the audience that she used 4 “ election ID spare cards ” that did not have logs and which could be given out to anyone and were .. in that secure warehouse …. and that she had to investigate herself when some of the bad activists discovered the widespread use of bogus ID cards on election night , during the recount , and prior to the election …… she did not have time to tell them that they feel now the warehouse with all the special voting equipment in it is now secure with all the changes she made after the election … .
And then there was that VP of ES&S who had an active ID Card even after the election and a history of being in the industry with a voting machine company where the president was found to provide retirement benefits as extra compensation to public officials for purchase of his machines .
How could anyone expect one person to clean up the whole industry and run elections at the same time and how could voters expect her to know that her warehouse was not secure when the State Audit said it was ….
f. Another problem with the time she was given to speak … .
Again she was not able to tell the audience about that contract her husband drafted for her and sent to ES&S which the Canvass board later refused to sign even with her , ES&S and the head of Florida Certification pleading with them … she was only able to tell about how it protected the voters from any PUBLIC election data that ES&S might leak out … .
There just was not time to tell the audience that article # 20 appointed ES&S as a consultant in their own audit of the machines ….. and how she wanted to save the county money by having ES&S “ contact ” her husband for questions as he was not an overworked county employee , restricted from employment according to Florida Laws , thus he would have more time to “ help out ” given she had to deal with silly public document requests from the “ bad ” activists … and the mountain of legal suits .
g . She was so limited with speaker time that she could not tell the audience of the rich heritage Sarasota Florida has as the home of Kathryn Harris former Sec of State when one candidate lost the election for president and Florida helped him out …… they will even have a movie on her HBO May 25 , called RECOUNT .
I am sure Kathy Dent is deserving of her own movie… .
h. Supervisor Dent looks after voters in her county , she knows “ the voters do not know how to vote ” as she told them after the Nov 7th , 2006 election and wants to help them .
She even went as far as ordering in “ Hype over Hacking ” Pro T - Screens reprints in an election that had an active ballot item to do away with the T - Screen voting in Sarasota after she had been “ hacked ” just days earlier .
And again was exonerated in a police investigation for placing them inside the polling area , saying she did not have “ intent ” to influence voters a felony .. she did say in an interview that “ obviously not too many were influenced ” when asked by the press about it ….
“ tell the people it ( the ballot item to get rid of T - Screen DRE voting machines ) passed ” !
i. Supervisor Dent has taken extraordinary steps to educate the voters and the county commission … .
In 2004 appearing in front of them in an official hearing she stated three times “ the machines do not have software ” when discussing voter intent in T - Screen voting Vs. paper ballots and the iVotronic voting machines she purchased instead of scanners .
This look into computer technology shared by Kathy Dent could set back the computing industry to its very roots , but Kathy had the courage to tell us what MIT and Cal Tec would not … .
j. Supervisor
Dent time after time has told the voters how well the T - Screen machines worked and even went as far as keeping secret that all the T - Screen parts in Sarasota County had to be replaced … .
Installing voter “ confidence ” at the price of loss of confidence in herself when the bad activists made it public … now that is dedication .
k. Supervisor Dent has also stated that all this concern about her and the voting machines is just “ sore losers ” talk in elections , , , , and she is supported by her boss the Secretary of State .
In a recent speech he stated that “ sore losers ” were responsible for all the legal suits , and he does know about that , , he filed a suit with Supervisor Dent to repeal the vote in Sarasota County by a majority of its voters , ( to only use scanners and get rid of the T - Screens as well provide a comprehensive audit for its elections . )
Again dedication at any price to the tax payers …
We could go on and on with the dedication of this public official to keep voters confidence up at any taxpayer cost , but what difference does it make , the “ voters do not know how to vote ” anyway , as she told them .…..

Impressive research :
All it took was a $ 500 telescope trained on a reflective object in front of the monitor .
For example , a teapot yielded readable images of 12 point Word documents from a distance of 5 meters ( 16 feet ) .
From 10 meters , they were able to read 18 point fonts .
With a $ 27,500 Dobson telescope , they could get the same quality of images at 30 meters .
Here ’s the paper :
Abstract
We present a novel eavesdropping technique for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen , including the currently prevalent LCD monitors .
Our technique exploits reflections of the screen ’s optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds in close proximity to the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content .
Such objects include eyeglasses , tea pots , spoons , plastic bottles , and even the eye of the user .
We have demonstrated that this attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive , off - the - shelf equipment ( less than 1500 dollars ) from a distance of up to 10 meters .
Relying on more expensive equipment allowed us to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away , demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible from the other side of the street or from a close - by building .
We additionally establish theoretical limitations of the attack ; these limitations may help to estimate the risk that this attack can be successfully mounted in a given environment .
L’Afrique du Sud est aux prises avec une augmentation rapide des infections au coronavirus qui a submergé les hôpitaux et mis à mal son ...
A young , muscled man named Edgar is flat on his back under a tree , clad only in camouflage - print underwear .
The sun is well above the apartment buildings of West Hollywood .
Shawn , a friend , wakes Edgar with a gentle kick .
He explains , when it ’s clear Edgar does not remember , that Edgar brought a date home from a party , then chased him off before passing out in the courtyard .
“ What happened ? ” Shawn asks .
Edgar is in a fog :
“ I just . . . . ”
“ Whore , ” says Shawn .
“ Jealous ? ” asks Edgar .
From its opening scene , the online soap opera “ In the Moment ” pulls no punches -- because , its creators say , it cannot .
The show , which has drawn tens of thousands of viewers in the last few months , is a racy , unvarnished portrait of gay L.A .
It is also , at its core , about HIV and AIDS .
Recent years have brought a wave of new programs designed to reinvigorate outreach in the gay community , as well as a dialogue about men ’s sexuality .
There are colorful trucks that take rapid - response HIV testing to the streets .
Government - funded “ POLs ” -- popular opinion leaders -- scour the town for other socially influential gay men and women , give them risk - reduction training and send them back into the community to spread the word .
There ’s even a proposal to design jeans with built - in “ condom pockets ” to promote the idea that condom use should be a routine part of gay culture , not an afterthought .
But more than anything , said Susan R. Cohen , the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center ’s director of health education and prevention , “ we needed to be where the guys are ” -- on the Internet .
Cohen arrived on the job a year and a half ago ; her first order of business was to revamp an outreach program that was still relying largely on “ rap groups ” to which educators dispensed condoms and safe - sex advice , sometimes with an audience of as few as two or three men .
Among other changes , Cohen greenlighted a proposal to film “ webisodes ” of a drama set in West Hollywood .
The city of West Hollywood covered most production costs .
The first episode , posted in January , introduced the multicultural cast in a “ Peyton Place " - like apartment building -- including Mike and Steve , who have unprotected sex .
In the second episode , posted in March , Shawn scores a date ; the new guy who moved in from Minnesota borrows an Internet connection ( the password is “ handcuffs ” ) ; and Steve moves out when he learns Mike cheated on him .
“ We live in this city of 10 billion hot guys , ” Shawn grumbles , “ and it ’s impossible to get close to anybody . ”
Across the nation , reported diagnoses of HIV and AIDS are increasing again .
They are not rising as sharply as they did during the first wave of the epidemic , and there is some contention that the rise is attributable in part to improved data collection .
Still , there is no question the numbers are up acutely among young gay men -- enough that some believe a second wave could be underway .
Fear , however , is no longer selling as a prevention tactic .
For years , with marked success , healthcare advocates used “ SILENCE = DEATH " - style sloganeering to combat the spread of HIV and AIDS .
But many of today ’s young gays were n’t alive during those first , terrible years -- and “ did n’t grow up watching 15 of their friends die of this disease , ” said Anthony Contreras , 33 , who contracted HIV 12 years ago from a man he met in a West Hollywood club .
He is now a health educator .
What ’s more , today ’s medicine allows many HIV - positive people to live largely normal , healthy lives .
“ I worry about my generation , ” said Dave O’Brien , 31 , the creator of “ In the Moment . ”
“ There is this perception that HIV is not that big of a deal anymore . ”
Meanwhile , health advocates say the social - networking system that they have long relied upon to preach the gospel of prevention has fallen apart .
On the surface , West Hollywood looks as it has for years : the medians of Santa Monica Boulevard decorated with rainbow flags , the street lined with gay boutiques and gay theaters , and a gay bookstore offering books on the front table about Julie Andrews and Grace Kelly and one called “ Since My Last Confession : A Gay Catholic Memoir . ”
But many gay bars where prevention specialists used to do their networking are now just bars , marketed to all , and you ’re as likely to stumble on a bachelorette party as a gay mixer .
One gay club recently became a tapas restaurant , another a straight bar that draws starlets and scenesters .
Gay publications , meanwhile , are less reliably read , health advocates say .
To young men , many messages plastered on bus stops and billboards are as quaint as the public service announcements they were once forced to watch in health class .
In other words , at a worrisome and vulnerable time , many young gay men are n’t thinking much about HIV or AIDS -- and have little communication with the advocates who ought to be reminding them to do so .
“ So we ’ve had to find new ways to engage , ” said James Key , the Gay & Lesbian Center ’s chief public affairs officer .
“ Times have changed .
And we ’ve had to change with them . ”
O’Brien , a filmmaker who recently completed a documentary on U.S. colleges that expel gay students , wrote the scripts with real West Hollywood gay men in mind -- men whose lives are not a daily tragedy , even if they are HIV - positive , but can be complicated .
The question is not whether they know how to use a condom , he said , but whether they decide to use one once real - world X factors come into play : body image , self - esteem , the dynamics of their relationship .
More than 80,000 people have viewed the shows at https://inthemoment.ning.com.
Advocates are pushing the show as a portal to discussions about safe sex and relationships , from whether Steve should have moved out when he learned Mike cheated to whether unprotected sex is ever OK .
Wrote one viewer :
“ It is amazing how much one moment of silence , of inaction , of pleasure , can change your life [ be aware ] . ”
Almost everyone who works on the show is a volunteer , including actors who are cast through a formal process akin to that of regular TV programming .
The short “ webisodes ” have a high - quality appearance , propped up by people such as the supportive owner of a crane who charged $ 50 to allow for the complex overhead shot of Edgar lying under the tree .
Each of the two shows completed so far cost just $ 17,000 to produce .
Most of the money has come from West Hollywood City Hall , which is expected to fund new episodes soon .
The show has struggled to land more government money , largely because the federal government is squeamish about funding images deemed “ explicit . ”
That may have a different definition here than it does in Washington .
One federal agency recently rejected funding for an ad campaign designed to foster discussion among recovering addicts about sober sexuality .
The reason ?
The campaign showed images of two men kissing ; the agency suggested the men hold hands instead .
“ So , 27 years into this epidemic , we ’re still restricted from showing images that would be effective , ” Cohen said .
“ That ’s what we ’re up against . ”

ST PETERSBURG , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s Mariinsky ballet has said farewell to one of its longest - serving artistes : a 21 - year - old female donkey named Monika .
The animal is to be pensioned off after 19 years carrying the knight ’s overweight servant Sancho Panza around the stage in productions of the ballet Don Quixote .
The Mariinsky , previously known as the Kirov , is one of Russia ’s foremost ballet troupes .
At her farewell party , Monika danced a waltz with one of the Mariinsky ’s ballerinas and was presented with retirement gifts of carrot cake , a pinafore and a kerchief .
Her role will be taken over by a female donkey named Alina .
“ She loves to perform and she loves applause , ” said Tatyana Solomatina , a spokeswoman for St Petersburg zoo , where Monika lives between performances .
“ She knew the exact time to appear in the ballet , even without someone accompanying her . ”
Venn Diagram Survey
Symmetric Diagrams
This diagram has a very a pleasing symmetry , namely an n- fold rotational symmetry .
Such diagrams are said to be symmetric .
This simply means that there is a point x about which the diagrams may be rotated by 2 π i / n and remain invariant , for i=0,1 , ... , n - 1 . Any symmetric Venn diagram must be made from congruent curves .
The purpose of this section is to survey what is known about symmetric diagrams .
Henderson first discussed the topic in his early paper [ He ] , and he proved a simple necessary condition for the existence of symmetric Venn diagrams of n curves .
Theorem .
A necessary condition for the existence of a symmetric n- Venn diagram is that n be a prime number .
To understand why the theorem is true , imagine the diagram to be split evenly into n sectors ( pieces of pie ) .
The C( n , k ) 1 different regions representing the k - subsets must be evenly distributed in each of the n sectors .
It thus follows that n divides C( n , k ) for each k = 1,2 , ..., n - 1 . This divisibility restriction implies that n must be prime , via a theorem of Leibnitz [ He , see also Ed96 ] .
There is one other symmetry that we will consider for diagrams drawn in the plane .
A symmetric Venn diagram has polar symmetry if it is invariant under " polar flips " .
Think of the diagram as being projected stereographically onto a sphere with the axis orthogonal to the plane running through the point of symmetry , and then project the diagram back onto the plane from the antipodal point on the axis .
If the corresponding Venn dual graphs are isomorphic as plane graphs , then the diagram has polar symmetry .
The symmetric Venn diagram shown above has polar symmetry , although it is perhaps not readily apparent .
Many symmetric diagrams are known for n = 2,3,5,7 , and a few beautifully complex examples for n=11 ( the large figure that appears twice in the title section of these pages , Victoria , is a simple polar symmetric 7 - Venn diagram ) .
These diagrams , along with counting results establishing the number of symmetric diagrams with different properties , can all be seen on this page :
There are many extensions on the idea of symmetry in Venn diagrams and connected topics ; a few are highlighted on the following page :
Extending symmetry to non-Venn diagrams is discussed on the section on symmetry on the page Generalizations and Extensions .
Recently , Jerrold Griggs , Chip Killian , and Carla Savage [ GKS ] made a major breakthrough by finding a construction for a symmetric Venn diagram for any prime n .
The following page illustrates in detail the ideas used for the general construction :
Briefly , the idea is to create the dual graph of one sector of the diagram by building a series of chains that span a set of strings from the Boolean lattice , with the property that when this dual graph is rotated , the dual of the entire Venn diagram is created .
The difficult part is specifying which strings to choose to form the appropriate subset ( making up 1 / nth of the Boolean lattice ) , using a known rule to build chains out of these strings , and then attaching them together and embedding them to form a planar dual of a sector of the diagram .
The diagrams produced by their construction are monotone and highly non-simple and have the property that there are n vertices through which all n curves pass .
Their diagram for n=11 is shown on the page with examples of symmetric diagrams .
The diagrams have exactly C( n , floor [ n/2 ] ) vertices , which is minimum for monotone Venn diagrams .
In several ways their paper is the culmination of the last decade of research by several authors highlighted in these pages on generating symmetric Venn diagrams .
The result has been widely publicised in the scientific press ( see , for example , the articles [ Ci03 ] and [ Ci04 ] ) , and Donald Knuth presented the result in his annual " Christmas Tree " lecture in 2002 [ KM ] .
In further work , Killian , Ruskey , Savage , and Weston [ KRSW ] showed that more vertices can be added to the construction by applying certain operations ; see the bottom of the page on necklace diagrams for more details .
The number of vertices can be increased to give asymptotically at least 2n - 1 vertices ; in practise the numbers are higher than 2n - 1 , at least for small n , but it appears to be difficult to prove a better bound .
The table below shows the highest known number of vertices in a symmetric diagram , for each n , versus the number of vertices in a simple diagram .
Thus , the search for a simple symmetric Venn diagram of more than 7 curves continues .

More states frustrated over Real ID
Homeland Security starts writing checks but states are still frsutrated
By Zack Martin , Editor
Real ID came out of the 9/11 Commission recommendations suggesting states should do more to identify individuals applying for driver license and state IDs .
This was in response to the fact that some of the 9/11 hijackers were able to obtain multiple driver licenses from different states .
To say the law is controversial is an understatement .
The 2005 legislation is the new boogeyman .
Some say it ’s the first stop toward a national ID and eventually a police state where every citizen will have to present his or her “ papers ” on demand .
Others say it ’s a long overdue initiative to repair holes in a flawed system .
Many or most states , which have to implement new policies and procedures to comply with the law , do n’t like it either and call it an unfunded mandate .
They say billions of dollars will have to be spent in order to comply and what the federal government is giving them is n’t enough .
Some states disagree with the law so strongly they have passed laws saying they wo n’t comply .
Arizona is the latest state to pass a law and at least 12 others have already done so .
Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano signed a bill saying they wo n’t meet the requirements of the law .
Napolitano ’s biggest issue is the cost of Real ID .
She cited a White House estimate that Real ID would cost at least $ 4 billion to implement .
But thus far , she said , the federal government has only appropriated $ 90 million to help Arizona and other states comply with the measure .
Maine is another state that has passed a law saying it wo n’t comply with Real ID .
The state did , however , accept a $ 1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to improve its driver license security .
Listen to the re:ID Podcast Episode 17 : Maine has privacy concerns with Real ID
At least 12 states have passed legislation saying they wo n’t comply with Real ID , the federal mandate to secure state - issues IDs and driver licenses .
Lawmakers in Main have been particularly outspoken regarding the law .
Regarding ID Editor Zack Martin speaks with Maine State Sen. Phil Bartlett about the law and why the state has some concerns .
Listen now .
Maine Gov. John Baldacci told the Bangor Daily News that just because the state took the money does n’t mean it ’s going to comply with the law .
“ This is not Real ID .
The description of the program says specifically that you do not have to be Real ID - compliant to access the funds .
Everybody needs to read the details and see that this keeps us in conformity to the law [ of Maine ] and to the prior law . ”
While publicly states may complain about Real ID , those in the motor vehicle departments know the recommendations make sense and need to be implemented , says Jeremy Grant , senior vice president and identity solutions analyst at the Stanford Group Company .
“ Do you want to be known as the state with the weakest licenses ? ” he asks .
Politically it might not make sense either , Grant says .
Imagine the campaign ads depicting an individual against Real ID and the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission .
States are making noise so they can get the funds to make the necessary changes .
“ Everything we see shows states making the necessary security changes to their licenses , ” Grant says .
And Homeland Security is starting to send some checks .
The agency has announced $ 79 million in Real ID grants .
Verification hub seen by supporters as essential , detractors as ominous
Missouri was awarded $ 17 million to lead the development of the verification hub .
This hub will be used as a central router to provide verification to motor vehicle departments of an applicant ’s source documents .
States will be able to verify the identity , lawful status and Social Security number of an applicant through this common interface .
Four other states – Florida , Indiana , Nevada , and Wisconsin – were awarded $ 1.2 million to partner with Missouri for verification hub testing and implementation .
The Silver Spring , Md. - based National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems has been working with Homeland Security on the hub , says Garland Land , executive director at NAPHSIS .
This has been a challenge because so many of the breeder documents , birth certificates , are still on paper .
Also , there is no standard format for birth certificates and it ’s difficult to tell if it ’s authentic by looking at it .
The hub is a Web application where a DMV employee enters certain information from a birth certificate .
This information is sent to he issuing state and it comes back with a match or no match within a few seconds , Land says .
One of the initial concerns from states was that many of these records were n’t available electronically .
Over the past few years , states have remedied that .
NAPHSIS already has been working with several state DMVs , the U.S. State Department ’s Passport Office and the Social Security Administration on testing the system for the past few years , Land says .

It 's all in the face .
maybe it's the influence of Cars , but we tend to see cars as faces and the Uplander looks like a fat guy who realized he just swallowed a stapler .
It 's so awful looking that , in the press shots , they suggest alternative transportation .

The 2009 Nissan Murano was designed with the intention of capturing a " modern art " feel .

The design of the 2008 WRX STI hatch is n't our favorite , but it manages to capture the rally heritage and weird - aru look of most Subies .

Creating a hardtop convertible version of a four - door car requires making tough decisions , in the case of the Chrysler Sebring we were sort of hoping they'd be able to diminish the features that made the sedan so unappealing .
Not so much .
Somehow the hood strakes seem deeper , the headlights more misshapen and the profile more hunchbacked on the drop - top version .

CIA Scandal Renditions Victim to Sue German Government
A German -Lebanese victim of the CIA 's extraordinary renditions program plans to sue the government in Berlin to force it to issue extradition orders against 13 American intelligence agents involved in his alleged kidnapping .
Cuba is to abandon egalitarian salaries after decades of government control in a bid to improve the nation 's productivity , a senior government official has revealed .
It is thought that an end to the capped wages set up by Fidel Castro in 1959 could spark the beginnings of a new middle class in Cuba .
In an interview published in Granma , the Communist party 's daily newspaper the minister for labour and social security , Carlos Mateu , said the current system gave employees little incentive to excel because everyone earned the same regardless of how much work they put in .
Many government - run companies had already stopped caps on salaries and the rest must do so by August , Mateu said .
" This salary system should be seen as a tool to help obtain better results in output and services , " Mateu said .
" Generally there has been a tendency for people to earn the same , and that egalitarianism is not helpful .
" That is something that we have to fix ... because if it is harmful to pay workers less than they deserve , it also is harmful to pay them what they have not earned , " he added .
He said that the new compensation system fits with the mantra of " socialist distribution " mentioned regularly by new President Raul Castro : " From each according to his ability , to each according to his work . "
For years in Cuba , jobs as varied as farm workers and doctors only had a difference in their wages of the equivalent of a few US dollars a month .
The average monthly wage in Cuba is around $ 20 ( £ 10 ) leaving many Cubans struggling to make ends meet .
Details of the new system have not been specified as yet and it remains unclear if officials plan to pay higher regular salaries for better workers , or if they would just receive bonuses for good performance .
Lizette Fernandez , a former dissident who campaigned for a change in Cuba 's dual currency system until she moved to Florida last year told the Miami Herald : " I think of all the changes made so far , this one is the most important .
" If you worked in an office in Cuba , you often got paid the same as the person who cleaned the office .
Slow and lazy people got the same or even more , because the bosses got their jobs through political connections and did n't do any work . "
In real terms , she added , the change could mean as little as 50 cents .
" Fifty cents may not sound like a lot , but at the end of the month , it 's the difference between being able to buy one bar of soap and two bars of soap , " she said .
" This change offers hope that they will increase salaries even more . "
Raul Castro , 77 , who came to power officially in February taking the place of his older brother Fidel , 81 , when his ailing health finally became too much , has made significant changes allowing Cubans for the first time to buy their own mobile phones , computers and spend nights in hotels .
Some of his policies are still at issue , including opening the country to private enterprise and the freedom for Cubans to travel abroad .

Eliot Spitzer call girl Ashley Dupre can sexually exploit herself just fine , thank you , and does n't need any help from Girls Gone Wild , the video company she is now suing in federal court in Miami .
Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis had offered Dupre $ 1 million to pose for a nude video , but rescinded the offer when he found footage of a 17 - year - old Dupre in his archive of drunken teen nudity .
He repackaged the footage as Hooker Gone Wild , and Dupre is accusing Francis of marketing the video in a way that makes it sound hotter than it actually is , i.e. properly fulfilling his duties as Chief Poontang Officer at Girls Gone Wild :
Dupré 's lawsuit claims Francis promoted the new videos by saying she was " doing a lot of hot lesbian acts , " which she says is false .
The suit also accuses Francis of trying to get the public to believe Dupré " is performing sexual acts ' ' in the videos .
Not true again , she says ...
" Defendants created the false impression that [ Dupré ] has endorsed and / or approves of the graphic , sexual content , including lesbian acts , contained in the video , which in reality she does not , " the suit says .
Dupre is also not happy that Francis registered ashleydupre.net .
She is also arguing that , when she encountered Francis at 17 , she was both too young and too drunk to consent to the video .
Obviously !
Within a few short years she was already making much wiser and healthier decisions about how to live her life .

2 . Buy less meat .
How many ounces of meat is a serving ?
For years , the U.S.D.A. ’s recommendation has been four ounces a person , yet most of us have long figured one - and - a - half to two pounds of meat is the right amount for four people .
( Our per capita consumption of meat has n’t changed much over the years , and remains at about a half - pound a day . )
Change that amount , and both your cooking style and the way the plate looks will change , and quickly .
Image TO BE SAVORED , NOT GOBBLED
Make the most of less meat , as in kebabs with cauliflower and cherry tomatoes .
Credit ... Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times
Remember that most traditional styles of cooking use meat as a condiment or a treat .
This is true in American frontier cooking , where salt pork and bacon were used to season beans ; in Italy , where a small piece of meat is served as a secondo ( rarely more than a few ounces , even in restaurants ) ; and around the world , where bits of meat are added to stir - fries and salads , as well as bean , rice and noodle dishes .
In all of these cases , meat is seen as a treasure , not as something to be gobbled up as if it were air .
For many of us who grew up in the United States in the last 60 years , this is the toughest hurdle .
The message ( remember “ Beef : it ’s what ’s for dinner ” ? ) was in our psyche from before we could hold a fork .
We may have vegetarian nights , or seafood nights , but when we have meat nights , there ’s often a big piece of meat ( or poultry ) on the plate , with starch and vegetable to the side .
3 . Get it out of the center of the plate .
You do n’t have to jump into utterly unfamiliar territory ; just try tweaking the proportions a bit .
You might start by buying skinnier pork chops , or doling out smaller slices of steak .
Build the meal around what you used to consider side dishes  not only vegetables , but also grains , beans , salads and even dessert , if you consider fruit a dessert  rather than the meat .
Nearly every culture has dishes in which meat is used to season rice or another grain .
Consider dirty rice , fried rice , pilaf , biryani , arroz con pollo : the list is almost endless .
Similarly , there is n’t a country in the world that cooks legumes that does n’t toss a little meat in now and then .
And mentioning stir - fries and pasta dishes here seems almost too obvious .
But you need not go transcultural .
When you make stew , soup or another dish with many ingredients , you make a decision about its main ingredient and about the quantity of that ingredient .
If you think of meat stews or soups , chicken pot pie , even lasagna , you ’ll quickly recognize that the decision to load them up with meat or to use meat as an ingredient of equal importance to the others is entirely yours .
Just over 40 years ago in a recording studio in Kingston , Jamaica , a sound engineer named Byron Smith was busy cutting a new song , On The Beach by the Paragons .
Recording straight from the master tape on to an acetate disc , also known as a dubplate , the track was for a local deejay named Ruddy Redwood to play at a dance that evening .
In his haste , Smith forgot to pan up the vocals on the mixing desk , cutting just the backing track on to the dubplate , and accidentally recording the world 's first " 12 - inch instrumental " .
Apologising for his mistake , Smith was about to throw the faulty disc out when Redwood stopped him .
Intrigued by the instrumental version , he took it with him .
That night , using two turntables , he switched between the original mix and the vocal - less version of the song , giving the MC more room to manoeuvre and the crowd space to sing along between verses , sending them crazy in the process and hacking the structure of a song live for the first time .
That night the crowd made him play the dubplate so many times it got completely worn out .
The remix was born .
Forty years later , the idea behind the remix is everywhere you look .
Video game code is deliberately left unlocked so fans can tweak and improve it .
Boeing 's new Dreamliner airplane was designed in collaboration with 120,000 volunteers who signed up to help through the corporation 's website .
Companies like Facebook that are based on user - generated content are worth more than manufacturing giants like Ford .
People have their cars " remixed " on MTV's Pimp My Ride , while people are busy illicitly re-editing and reposting television clips online every day .
Thanks to the efforts of people like Ruddy Redwood pushing new ideas from the fringes of pop culture , the way we use information looks very different today .
In many cases we implicitly understand the value in remixing , redistributing and making copies of other people 's content .
But in others , we do n't .
Sometimes we see people like Redwood as innovators , while in other instances they are regarded as pirates .
This is happening in the music business right now , even though the industry was created by a " pirate " in the first place .
When Thomas Edison invented the phonographic record player , musicians branded him a pirate , out to steal their work and destroy the live music business .
That opinion prevailed until a system was established so everyone could be paid royalties ; a system that formed the backbone of the recording industry and which is still in place today .
Edison , in turn , went on to invent film - making , and demanded a licensing fee from those making movies with his technology .
This caused a band of film - making pirates , including a man named William , to flee New York for the then still wild West , where they thrived , unlicensed , until Edison 's patents expired .
These pirates continue to operate there , albeit legally now , in the town they founded : Hollywood .
William 's last name ?
Fox .
From CEOs to struggling artists , in everything from health care to entertainment to education , many of us are being challenged by the problem of others sharing and using our intellectual property without permission .
This challenge requires a change of attitude , because sometimes piracy is n't the problem , it 's the solution , as my new book , The Pirate 's Dilemma , explains .
Here 's what the pirates have done for us lately ...
Pirates brought pop music to the UK
In the 1950s - despite the best efforts of Elvis - there was n't much to listen to on UK radio besides the shipping forecast .
The radio waves were seen as being far too powerful to be turned over to the people , so there were no commercial stations .
Instead , radio was used for broadcasting news and education by the BBC , with only Pick Of The Pops on the Light Programme catering for pop fans .
That all changed when European pirate radio ships like Radio Mercur took to the seas in the late 1950s , broadcasting rock 'n 'roll to Europe from huge radio masts attached to old fishing and military boats anchored in waters outside state jurisdiction .
The pirate sector exploded in the Beatles - fuelled pop boom of the 1960s when Radio London and Radio Caroline , along with other , smaller stations , raised their masts , making a ton of ad revenue in the process .
These new stations reached millions of people across Europe ; people who liked being able to listen to free rock 'n ' roll on their radios .
European governments realised this was a battle they could n't win - there was too much support for what the pirates were doing - and that they could n't close them down without offering an alternative .
So they did the only thing they could : they decided to co-opt them .
Commercial radio soon became legal all over the continent , and many of the pirates were able to go legit and set up on land .
In the UK , the BBC hired DJs from Radio London ( such as Tony Blackburn and John Peel ) , and created their own imitation , which they called Radio 1 .
Rock 'n 'roll radio was here to stay .
Pirates make cooler trainers
Nike 's Air Force 1 is a basketball shoe that has been customised and re-released by the company themselves over 900 times since its launch in 1982 .
But this did n't stop 22 - year - old Tokyo hip - hop DJ , Nigo , from creating his own version .
Nigo ( who released an album , Ape Sounds , on James Lavelle 's Mo Wax label in 2000 ) redesigned the Air Force 1 specifically for hip - hop fans , never intending it to be used as a basketball shoe .
Taking the Air Force 1 design as his base , Nigo ripped off the " swoosh " logo and stitched on his own shooting star- like emblem .
He used materials and colour combinations even Nike had n't experimented with at the time , and sold them in very limited quantities for upwards of $ 300 a pair .
Nigo 's fashion label , A Bathing Ape , which produces the shoes , is now a multimillion dollar streetwear brand with more than 16 stores in Japan , London and New York .
But what Nike did next is where it gets interesting .
There was a clear case of trademark infringement here , but Nike did n't sue Nigo , because it could see commercial value in what he was doing .
It recognised that his shoe was n't detracting from the Air Force 1 brand , it was actually adding value .
In music , good remixes make the original tracks more popular - the same thing was happening here .
So instead of suing him , Nike looked at Nigo 's remixed shoes , and created their own remixes in response , using a wider variety of materials and colours .
They did n't view Nigo as a pirate , but as a competitor who pushed them to innovate .
And while Nigo 's trainers continue to do well , the ever - evolving Nike Air Force 1 remains the world 's most popular basketball shoe franchise over 25 years after its release .
Pirates create better ads
When an online copy of Scrabble called Scrabulous appeared on Facebook , it quickly amassed 2.3 million fans who played it every day .
It was an amazing user - generated ad campaign , and sales of real Scrabble boards increased .
All Hasbro and Mattel ( the owners of Scrabble ) had to do was swoop in with their cheque books and make it legit ; instead they treated Scrabulous as a simple case of piracy and threatened to sue .
It may have been smarter to cut a deal rather than anger potential customers .
Thousands signed up to the " Save Scrabulous " Facebook group .
One fan threatened a hunger strike .
Hasbro and Mattel are still talking tough , but if the backlash continues they may be forced to eat their words .
Managing directors take note !
Do n't let your legal department make a decision about pirates without talking to marketing first , because pirates can sometimes refresh the parts other ad strategies cannot reach .
Pirates can create awareness for brands , and some large companies are starting to recognise the value in letting people mash up their content , becoming increasingly tolerant of unofficial remixes .
Last year Soulja Boy 's Crank
Dat was one of the major hits of the summer and the video was a YouTube sensation .
Soon , remixed videos were appearing , featuring clips of a variety of copy - protected cartoon characters lip - synching along .
SpongeBob , Shrek , Super Mario , South Park and The Simpsons all got " super- manned " .
Every major Hollywood studio had at least one of their cartoon franchises ripped off , but not one of them bothered to issue a cease and desist notice .
Likewise , when comedy rock band Guyz Nite made a video for their song Die Hard using nothing but clips from the 20th Century Fox - produced Die Hard movies ( and put them online ) , Fox 's legal team initially got them taken down .
But when the marketing bods at Fox found out about the video , they got in touch with Guyz Nite and offered them money to put the video back up , and invited them to the premiere of Die Hard 4.0 .
William
Fox would be proud .
· Matt Mason's The Pirate 's Dilemma ( Penguin ) is out now
Napa girl wanders away , is killed by hit -run driver
A hit - and - run driver struck and killed a 2 1/2 - year - old girl who somehow ended up alone outside her family 's Napa apartment before dawn , police said today .
Mattea Reynolds was found unconscious near the curb of Old Sonoma Road before 6 a.m.
Saturday by a worker at the nearby county juvenile hall .
The girl was pronounced dead at Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa .
At least two witnesses saw the girl walking alone about 5:15 a.m. but did not immediately go to her aid , police said .
One of the witnesses told the juvenile hall worker who was walking in the area , then left the scene .
Mattea 's mother and other relatives live on Oran Court , two blocks from where the girl was found .
Police said the family telephoned police to report Mattea missing at 5:26 a.m. and said she may have wandered away .
As officers responded to the area , the juvenile hall employee made her discovery , police Cmdr. Andy Lewis said .
The other witness who saw the girl told authorities that a car drove east on Old Sonoma Road , which is on the east side of Highway 29 , around the time Mattea was hit .
The car was described only as a white American - model sedan from the 1980s , with four doors and chrome trim on the sides , Lewis said .
Police also are looking for the woman who alerted the juvenile hall employee to the child 's presence on Old Sonoma Road .
The woman was dressed in a navy blue or black windbreaker and dark pants and carried a lunch box or bag .
Anyone with information is asked to call police Detective Don Winegar at ( 707 ) 258-7879 .

Who Are These Guys ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than one million homes are now in foreclosure , the highest rate ever recorded , according to a trade group which warned Thursday that number will continue to climb .
The Mortgage Bankers Association 's first quarter report showed that a record 2.5 % of all loans being serviced by its members are now in foreclosure , which works out to about 1.1 million homes .
That 's up from the 2 % of loans , or about 938,000 homes , that were in foreclosure at the end of 2007 .
The report also showed that 448,000 homes , or about 1 % of loans being serviced , began the foreclosure process during the first quarter .
That 's up from about 382,000 homes , or 0.83 % , that entered foreclosure in the last three months of 2007 .
The seasonally - adjusted rate of homeowners behind on their mortgage payments also hit a record high .
Nearly 3 million home loans , or 6.4 % , have missed at least one payment , while about 737,000 are at least three months past due , but not yet in foreclosure .
Grim numbers
" The figures are n't surprising , but they 're pretty ugly nonetheless , " said Michael Larson , real estate analyst with Weiss Research .
" We 're talking higher delinquencies and foreclosures pretty much across the board . "
And he doubts that there 's much reason to expect the foreclosure crisis to abate until next year at the earliest , adding that it could be a couple of years or more before foreclosure rates retreat to more normal historical averages .
" It 's the same story we 've been seeing for a while now - we had too much reckless lending , and buyers who got over - extended , " he said .
" We 've had an unprecedented decline in home prices on a nationwide basis , which is public enemy number one for mortgage loans .
And now you 've got an overall economy that has slowed adding to this toxic stew . "
Good credit , bad credit
Much of the problem lies with subprime loans given to borrowers with weaker credit records , especially those loans that had adjustable rates .
Nearly four out of ten subprime ARM loans are a month or more late , or in foreclosure .
And subprime ARMs account for 39 % of the loans that fell into foreclosure during the quarter .
Prime fixed - rate loans , which are considered very low risk , have also seen sharp increases in their delinquency and foreclosure rates , although they are performing far better than the riskier loans on the market .
There are 431,000 prime loans in foreclosure , a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.2 % that is more than double the 0.5 % rate a year ago .
The report showed about 1.2 million prime mortgages are now a month or more past due , a seasonably adjusted rate of 3.7 % of those loans .
That 's up from a rate of 2.6 % a year ago .
According to Jay Brinkman , MBA 's vice president for research and economics , the prime loan segment was hurt by so - called Alt - A loans , which did n't require income verification for buyers with good credit .
Prime loans are also getting into trouble in places such as Florida and California , which have seen sharp home price declines .
" You still have people with prime fixed rate loans who lose their jobs , who get a divorce or have an illness come up , and can no longer afford a house , " Brinkman said .
" In areas where there 's been home price appreciation , you can get out of that with the sale of a home or some other negotiation . "
Getting worse before it gets better
This marks the sixth straight quarter in which a record percentage of loans went into foreclosure .
The trend has led to a widespread decline in home prices , as well as huge losses for banks and other financial firms that issued or invested in the loans .
Nearly half of the homes in foreclosure are concentrated in six states .
But those states are undergoing two very different types of housing meltdowns .
California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada have been hit by a hangover after a home building boom in the middle of the decade , which was fueled by rising home prices and investors snatching up real estate using risky mortgages .
Those four states have nearly 400,000 homes in foreclosure , or a third of the nationwide total .
Roughly 3.6 % of all of the loans in these states are now in foreclosure .
" Clearly things in California and Florida are going to get worse before they get better , " said Brinkman .
The other two states that are ground zero for the crisis - Michigan and Ohio - have been hit by the more traditional economic woes stemming from rising job losses , particularly in the automotive sector .
Ohio has about 61,000 homes in foreclosure , while Michigan has about 54,000 .
The foreclosure rate in those two states is 3.9 % .
There is a glimmer of good news .
The rate of homes going into foreclosure in Ohio and Michigan was narrowly lower than it was in the fourth quarter , and 18 other states also saw a decline in that rate .
Brinkman said he hoped that means the crisis is at or near a bottom in much of the country , and that foreclosure prevention efforts have started to have an effect .
But he added that a slight improvement in one quarter does n't necessarily mean the end is near .
Indeed , the rate of homes going into foreclosure continued to climb sharply higher in California and Florida , as has the rate of loans in those states that are 90 days or more past due but not yet in foreclosure .
Brinkman said that in markets like these , where home prices have fallen so far from the market 's peak , finding solutions to keep a home out of foreclosure are more difficult .
He also added that , given the large impact California and Florida are having on the national foreclosure numbers , and the fact that historically foreclosures peak about three years into the loan 's life , he expects the number of foreclosures will continue to rise .

Be aware that magic mushrooms are illegal to possess in many countries . ]
AN ORANGE SLICE was sitting on the kitchen counter , hidden just behind the light .
My head was throbbing mercilessly , the mushrooms just beginning to kick in .
A quarter of an orange — plump , juicy , veined .
I began to laugh .
In fact , I began to laugh hysterically and could n’t stop for the next three minutes .
I could n’t help it — the orange slices reminded me of a vagina .
At their best , magic mushrooms reduce you to a blubbering mess of giggles and bellyache laughter .
At their worst , they make you feel like you just walked out of a harrowing rollercoaster ride : nauseous , dizzy , and bilious .
Prior to my recent foray into the hallucinogenic world , I was what one would consider the uncommon phenomenon of a drug - free , 20 - something writer living in New York City .
I suppose my biggest hesitation with the idea of taking magic mushrooms — or any drug , for that matter — was losing self - control and putting into question the ideas I had about myself .
But then again , maybe that was the point : discovering the unknown part of you , the alter ego lurking just behind the surface .
One day I had too much time , too few obligations , and access to a stash of magic mushrooms .
That ’s when I began to discover the complexities beyond what I thought I knew , and more importantly , who I thought I was .
Part 1 — Prepping for shrooms
Psilocybe , or “ magic mushrooms ” as they ’re more commonly called , are a mild hallucinogen .
They affect each person differently , and unless taken in large amounts , most people do n’t actually hallucinate or have “ visions ” or “ flashbacks . ”
They ’re organic , accessible ( not much more difficult than scoring weed ) , and though it does come with its hazards , there ’s the reassuring thought that if you do n’t like it , your body will simply metabolize the drug and you can get back to normal again .
“ Mostly it ’s just glowing colors , distortions , details popping out … good vibes , ” I was reassured .
“ You ’ll like it . ”
This was followed up with some practical tips :
“ They taste absolutely disgusting , ” experienced shroom - takers all agree .
“ Take them with M&Ms , ” was one suggestion .
“ They ’ll go down easier . ”
“ Stay in a safe , comfortable environment . ”
The setting , I learned , determines largely whether you ’ll have an enjoyable or excruciating trip .
One friend highly recommends taking them on the beach , where the ocean looks like a pulsating blue glow .
“ Make sure you ’re taking them with someone who ’s had them before , ” I was told again and again .
Dave , my boyfriend and experienced shroom buddy , insisted we clean our apartment .
“ You ’ll find that everything clean will look dirty , and everything dirty will look disgusting , ” he said .
“ Good luck , ” a friend of mine wrote before the experiment .
“ You ’re going to learn so much about yourself , others , the world … ”
Part 2 — Is it just me or is the world throbbing ?
Twenty minutes into our first serving of shrooms , I was complaining of their non-effect on me .
“ I feel completely normal !
They probably do n’t even work on me , ” I declared .
“ Let ’s take the rest then , ” Dave said .
We licked the plate clean of mushroom dust .
Within minutes ,
Dave was bouncing around the room , laughing at every little thing and marveling at colors .
I , on the other hand , was spiraling down a dark cave .
My limbs could n’t decide if they wanted to shift restlessly , as they were beginning to do , or lay inert in bed .
My head felt like someone was kneading it , and my stomach kept threatening to launch a revolution .
The mushrooms were not sitting well with my body .
Getting past the initial , debilitating effect of the mushrooms was the most challenging part of my experience .
But once I was outside , navigating traffic and negotiating the New York characters , it became easier to forget how horrible my body felt and how light my mind actually was .
My head was n’t cloudy ( the way one ’s thoughts can be muddled when drunk ) , and with the city an explosion of stimuli , my mind zipped through so many connections .
I was aware of all of them , if only briefly .
Occasionally I would burst out laughing .
At what , I did n’t know or remember , but I just laughed and snorted and wheezed until I was out of breath , stopping mid-giggle to convey how I had no idea what was so funny .
Part 3 — Did I just say that ?
In our heightened state , Dave and I decided to walk to a nearby park .
I still knew how to put one leg in front of the other , but not much else .
Nausea was still invading my body in sporadic bursts , and though I hid behind large sunglasses , I felt everyone in the world could tell I was high .
We found a grassy mound where we lay down and stared at the sky and the trees .
I ’ve heard colors appear to glow when on shrooms , but I was n’t convinced the greens and blues of the park were any more vibrant that day .
Dave noticed every little detail : “ Did you realize all the trees on our block are of the same species ? ”
After studying some puzzling elements around the park — a stuffed pig on roller skates , tourists who asked for directions but never moved , people running to and from a tree with bright , fluttering balloons — he figured out that all these strange , disparate characters were planted by a Disney - sponsored Bingo game .
“ Now it makes sense , ” he said .
I had settled into a mental acuteness unfamiliar to me .
There was a distinct remove between what I was saying and what I was doing , and who the person was behind it all .
It felt like I was observing myself as I was being , and though I ’d lived in New York City for two years , everything felt new again .
Part 4 — An altered perspective
My mind was opening up connections I would n’t normally make .
On our way home , we stopped by a deli and Dave said , “ Let ’s take a bottle of water . ”
I instantly responded , “ But we have to pay for it first ! ”
He looked at me strangely .
I realized I was paranoid about doing something wrong .
My subconscious , I figured out , is more uptight than my conscious self .
Soon , in the comfort of an air - conditioned bedroom , I was waxing existential and listening to music , which is famous for sounding better on hallucinogens .
Lyrics turned into epiphanies .
Sometimes I ’d catch myself mid-sentence , and wonder — do I actually live with this person ( meaning me ) , and do I even like this person ?
It was a strange back - and - forth of ruminations , which I could sometimes convey verbally , sometimes not .
I reveled in this strange but satisfying sentience , and when the drugs wore off less than three hours later , I was left with a lingering curiosity about myself and the world .
Would I take magic mushrooms again ?
Sure , but next time I ’ll do it outside NYC — even when I ’m sober and completely cognizant , the city ’s still a lot to take in .
What do you think of magic mushrooms and their ability to “ open ” the mind ?

BOGOTA ( Reuters ) - French - Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt , three Americans and 11 other hostages held for years in jungle captivity were rescued on Wednesday from leftist guerrillas by Colombian troops posing as aid workers .
The rescue was a huge coup for popular President Alvaro Uribe , an anti-guerrilla hard - liner who has used billions of dollars in U.S. aid to push the rebels onto the defensive , cut crime and spur economic growth .
Betancourt , 46 , was the highest profile captive held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , known as the FARC , Latin America ’s oldest surviving left - wing insurgency .
A former presidential candidate , her dual French - Colombian nationality had helped bring world attention to the plight of hostages held by the rebels .
“ I believe that this is a sign of peace for Colombia , that we can find peace , ” Betancourt said , thanking the Colombian military for her rescue and weeping as she made her first public comments , carried on Colombian radio station Caracol .
Minutes later a pale but smiling Betancourt landed at Bogota ’s military air base , walking down the stairs of the plane and hugging her mother , Yolanda Pulecio , on the runway .
Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said all of the former captives were in reasonably good health despite having been held in harsh conditions , often chained by the neck by their rebel captors .
The rescue was carried out in the southern jungle province of Guaviare , Santos said .
Soldiers posed as members of a fictitious non-government organization that supposedly would fly the hostages by helicopter to a camp to meet with rebel leader Alfonso Cano .
“ The helicopters , which in reality were from the army , picked up the hostages in Guaviare and flew them to freedom , ” Santos said .
Two guerrillas were captured in the operation .
Fifteen long - term kidnap victims were rescued in all , including Betancourt and the three Americans , he said .
“ It ( the rescue ) will go down in history for its audaciousness and effectiveness , ” Santos told reporters .
The FARC has been holding about 40 high - profile hostages it has sought to exchange for jailed rebels .
AMERICANS EN ROUTE HOME
The freed Americans all worked for Northrop Grumman and were captured in 2003 after their light aircraft crashed in the jungles while on a counternarcotics operation .
The three were on their way to the United States on Wednesday evening , the Colombian government said .
In Paris , French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Betancourt was in good health and despatched his Foreign Minister , Bernard Kouchner , in a plane to Colombia .
“ Today a nightmare of more than six years has ended , ” Sarkozy said .

The president ’s office said earlier that Sarkozy had had a long conversation with Uribe .
France had made vigorous efforts to seek Betancourt ’s freedom .
Betancourt was kidnapped by the FARC in 2002 and was last seen in a rebel video at the end of last year looking ill , gaunt and despondent .
“ I am filled with happiness , ” Betancourt ’s sister , Astrid , told Colombian radio .
“ These have been long years of waiting . ”
The freed Americans are former Defense Department contract workers Marc Gonsalves , Keith Stansell and Thomas Howes .

U.S. President George W. Bush spoke by telephone with Uribe .
“ President Bush congratulated President Uribe , telling him he is a ‘ strong leader . ’
President Uribe thanked President Bush for his support and confidence in the Government of Colombia , ” Gordon Johndroe , White House National Security Council spokesman , said in Washington .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice congratulated Uribe .
In a written statement she also urged the FARC to release all other hostages and said the United States held the group responsible for the health and well - being of those still in captivity .
CONDITIONS FOR TALKS
The FARC has demanded that Uribe pull back troops from an area the size of New York City to facilitate talks .
Uribe , whose father was killed in a botched FARC kidnapping years ago , refuses to accept that condition .
But he has offered a smaller safe haven under international observation in an area where there are no armed forces or armed groups .
The outlawed rebel army , once a 17,000 - member force able to attack cities and kidnap almost at will , has been driven back into remote areas and now has about 9,000 combatants .
The guerrillas have lost three major leaders this year .
Listed as a terrorist group by U.S. and European officials , the FARC has used Colombia ’s cocaine trade to fund its operations .
In announcing the rescue operation , Santos called on the guerrillas to give up their arms and negotiate a truce .
Michael Shifter , an analyst at the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington - based think tank , said the rescue showed that the FARC was in a serious organizational crisis .
“ The Colombian government took advantage of the FARC ’s weakness and disarray to carry out the mission .
It was a big gamble , but it worked , ” he said .
“ Uribe is a risk - taker and is full of surprises .
Not that he needs it , but this remarkable turn of events will further boost his popularity . ”
U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who had been visiting Colombia , was informed about the successful rescue operation while en route to Mexico from Colombia .
A spokesman told reporters on McCain ’s plane that on Tuesday night , Uribe and his defense minister pulled aside McCain and the two senators traveling with him to inform them of the rescue operation that was planned for Wednesday .
The three had not learned about the success of the operation before leaving Colombia .

Everyday Anarchy
Part 3 of 7
by Stefan Molyneux
June 3 , 2008
Anarchy and the ' Problem of the Commons '
Ask almost any professional economist what the role of government is , and he will generally reply that it is to regulate or solve the ' problem of the commons , ' and to make up for ' market failures , ' or the provision of public goods such as roads and water delivery that the free market cannot achieve on its own .
To anyone who works from historical evidence and even a basic smattering of first principles , this answer is , to be frank , outlandishly unfounded .
The ' problem of the commons ' is the idea that if farmers share common ground for grazing their sheep , that each farmer has a personal incentive for overgrazing , which will harm everyone in general .
Thus the immediate self - interest of each individual leads to a collective stripping of the land .
It only takes a moment 's thought to realize that the government is the worst possible solution for this problem ' if indeed it is a problem .
The problem of the commons recognizes that where collective ownership exists , individual exploitation will inevitably result , since there is no incentive for the long - term maintenance of the productivity of whatever is collectively owned .
A farmer takes good care of his own fields , because he wants to profit from their utilization in the future .
In fact , ownership tends to accrue to those individuals who can make the most productive future use of an asset , since they are the ones able to bid the most when it comes up for sale .
If I can make $ 10,000 a year more out of a patch of land than you can , then I will be willing to bid more for it , and thus will end up owning it .
Thus where there is no stake in future profitability ' as in the case of publicly - owned resources ' those resources inevitably tend to be pillaged and destroyed .
This is the situation that highly intelligent , well - educated people ' with perfectly straight faces ' say should be solved through the creation of a government .
Why is this such a bizarre solution ?
Well , a government ' and particularly the public treasury ' is the ultimate publicly - owned good .
If publicly - owned goods are always pillaged and exploited , then how is the creation of the largest and most violent publicly - owned good supposed to solve that problem ?
It 's like saying that exposure to sunlight can be dangerous for a person 's health , and so the solution to that problem is to throw people into the sun .
The fact that people can repeat these absurdities with perfectly straight faces is testament to the power of propaganda and self - interest .
In the same way , we are told that free - market monopolies are dangerous and exploitive .
Companies that wish to voluntarily do business with us , and must appeal to our self - interest , to mutual advantage , are considered grave threats to our personal freedoms .
And ' the solution that is proposed by almost everyone to the ' problem ' of voluntary economic interaction ?
Well , since voluntary and peaceful ' monopolies ' are so terribly evil , the solution that is always proposed is to create an involuntary , coercive , and violent monopoly in the form of a government .
Thus voluntary and peaceful ' monopolies ' are a great evil ' but the involuntary and violent monopoly of the state is the greatest good !?
Can you see why I began this book talking about our complicated and ambivalent relationship to voluntarism , or anarchy ?
We see this same pattern repeating itself in the realm of education .
Whenever an anarchist talks about a stateless society , he is inevitably informed that in a free society , poor children will not get educated .
Where does this opinion come from ?
Does it come from a steadfast dedication to reason and evidence , an adherence to well - documented facts ?
Do those who hold this opinion have certain evidence that , prior to public education , the children of the poor were not being educated ?
Do they genuinely believe that the children of the poor are being well - educated now ?
Do they seriously believe that anarchists do not care about the education of the poor ?
Do they believe that they are the only people who care about the education of the poor ?
Of course not .
This is a mere knee - jerk propagandistic reaction , like hearing a Soviet - era Red Guard boy mumbling about the necessity of the workers controlling the means of production .
It is not based upon evidence , but upon prejudice .
If the ' problem of the commons ' and the predations of monopolies are such dire threats , then surely institutionalizing these problems and surrounding them with the endless violence of police , military and prisons would be the exact opposite of a rational solution !
Of course , the problem of the commons is only a problem because the land is collectively owned ; move it to private ownership , and all is well .
Thus the solution to the problem of public ownership is clearly more private ownership , not more public ownership .
Ah , say the statists , but that is just a metaphor ' what about fish in the ocean , pollution in the rivers , roads in the city and the defense of the realm ?
Well the simple answer to that ' from an anarchist perspective at least ' is that if people are not intelligent and reasonable enough to negotiate solutions to these problems in a productive and sustainable manner , then surely they are also not intelligent or reasonable enough to vote for political leaders , or participate in any government whatsoever .
Of course , there are endless historical examples of private roads and railways , private fisheries , social and economic ostracism as an effective punishment for over - use or pollution of shared resources ' the endless inventiveness of our species should surely by now never fail to amaze !
The statist looks at a problem and always sees a gun as the only solution ' the force of the state , the brutality of law , violence and punishment .
The anarchist ' the endless entrepreneur of social organization ' always looks at a problem and sees an opportunity for peaceful , innovative , charitable or profitable problem - solving .
The statist looks at a population and sees an irrational and selfish horde that needs to be endlessly herded around at gunpoint ' and yet looks at those who run the government as selfless , benevolent and saintly .
Yet these same statists always look at this irrational and dangerous population and say : ' You must have the right to choose your political leaders ! '
It is truly an unsustainable and irrational set of positions .
An anarchist ' like any good economist or scientist ' is more than happy to look at a problem and say , ' I do not know the solution ' ' and be perfectly happy not imposing a solution through force .
Darwin looked at the question , ' Where did life come from ? ' and only came up with his famous answer because he was willing to admit that he did not know ' but that existing religious ' answers ' were invalid .
Theologians , on the other hand , claim to ' answer ' the same question with : ' God made life , ' which as mentioned above , on closer examination , always turns out to be an exact synonym for : ' I do not know . '
To say , ' God did it , ' is to say that some unknowable being performed some incomprehensible action in a completely mysterious manner for some never - to - be - discovered end .
In other words : ' I have n't a clue . '
In the same way , when faced with challenges of social organization such as collective self - defense , roads , pollution and so on , the anarchist is perfectly content to say , ' I do not know how this problem will be solved . '
As a corollary , however , the anarchist is also perfectly certain that the pseudo - answer of ' the government will do it ' is a total non-answer ' in fact , it is an anti-answer , in that it provides the illusion of an answer where one does not in fact exist .
To an anarchist , saying ' the government will solve the problem , ' has as much credibility as telling a biologist ' usually with grating condescension ' ' God created life . '
In both cases , the problem of infinite regression is blindly ignored ' if that which exists must have been created by a God , the God which exists must have been created by another God , and so on .
In the same way , if human beings are in general too irrational and selfish to work out the challenges of social organization in a productive and positive manner , then they are far too irrational and selfish to be given the monopolistic violence of state power , or vote for their leaders .
Asking an anarchist how every conceivable existing public function could be re-created in a stateless society is directly analogous to asking an economist what the economy will look like down to the last detail 50 years from now .
What will be invented ?
How will interplanetary contracts be enforced ?
Exactly how will time travel affect the price of a rental car ?
What megahertz will computers be running at ?
What will operating systems be able to do ?
And so on and so on .
This is all a kind of elaborate game designed to , fundamentally , stall and humiliate any economist who falls for it .
A certain amount of theorizing is always fun , of course , but the truth is not determined by accurate long - term predictions of the unknowable .
Asking Albert Einstein in 1910 where the atomic bomb will be dropped in the future is not a credible question ' and the fact that he is unable to answer it in no way invalidates the theory of relativity .
In the same way , we can imagine that abolitionists would have been asked exactly how society would look 20 years after the slaves were freed .
How many of them would have jobs ?
What would the average number of kids per family be ?
Who would be working the plantations ?
Though these questions may sound absurd to many people , when you propose even the vague possibility of a society without a government , you are almost inevitably maneuvered into the position of fighting a many - headed hydra of exactly such questions :
' How will the roads be provided in the absence of a government ? '
' How will the poor be educated ? '
' How will a stateless society defend itself ? '
' How can people without a government deal with violent criminals ? '
In 25 years of talking about just these subjects , I have almost never ' even after credibly answering every question that comes my way ' had someone sit back , sigh and say , ' Gee , I guess it really could work ! '
No , inevitably , what happens is that they come up with some situation that I cannot answer immediately , or in a way that satisfies them , and then they sit back and say in triumph , ' You see ?
Society just cannot work without a government !'
What is actually quite funny about this situation is that by taking this approach , people think that they are opposing the idea of anarchy , when in fact they are completely supporting it .
One simple and basic fact of life is that no individual ' or group of individuals ' can ever be wise or knowledgeable enough to run society .
Our core fantasy of ' government ' is that in some remote and sunlit chamber , with lacquered mahogany tables , deep leather chairs and sleepless men and women , there exists a group who are so wise , so benevolent , so omniscient and so incorruptible that we should turn over to them the education of our children , the preservation of our elderly , the salvation of the poor , the provision of vital services , the healing of the sick , the defense of the realm and of property , the administration of justice , the punishment of criminals , and the regulation of virtually every aspect of a massive , infinitely complex and ever - changing social and economic system .
These living man-gods have such perfect knowledge and perfect wisdom that we should hand them weapons of mass destruction , and the endless power to tax , imprison and print money ' and nothing but good , plenty and virtue will result .
And then , of course , we say that the huddled and bleating masses , who could never achieve such wisdom and virtue , not even in their wildest dreams , should all get together and vote to surrender half their income , their children , their elderly and the future itself to these man-gods .
Of course , we never do get to actually see and converse with these deities .
When we do actually listen to politicians , all we hear are pious sentiments , endless evasions , pompous speeches and all of the emotionally manipulative tricks of a bed - ridden and abusive parent .
Are these the demi-gods whose only mission is the care , nurturing and education of our precious children 's minds ?
Perhaps we can speak to the experts who advise them , the men behind the throne , the shadowy puppet - masters of pure wisdom and virtue ?
Can they come forward and reveal to us the magnificence of their knowledge ?
Why no , these men and women also will not speak to us , or if they do , they turn out to be even more disappointing than their political masters , who at least can make stirring if empty phrases ring out across a crowded hall .
And so , if we like , we can wander these halls of Justice , Truth and Virtue forever , opening doors and asking questions , without ever once meeting this plenary council of moral superheroes .
We can shuffle in ever - growing disappointment through the messy offices of these mere mortals , and recognize in them a dusty mirror of ourselves ' no more , certainly , and often far less .
Anarchy is the simple recognition that no man , woman , or group thereof is ever wise enough to come up with the best possible way to run other people 's lives .
Just as no one else should be able to enforce on you his choice of a marriage partner , or compel you to follow a career of his choosing , no one else should be able to enforce his preferences for social organization upon you .
Thus when the anarchist is expected to answer every possible question regarding how society will be organized in the absence of a government , any failure to perfectly answer even one of them completely validates the anarchist 's position .
If we recognize that no individual has the capacity to run society ( ' dictatorship ' ) , and we recognize that no group of elites has the capacity to run society ( ' aristocracy ' ) , we are then forced to defend the moral and practical absurdity of ' democracy . '
Anarchy and Democracy
It may be considered a mad enough exercise to attempt to rescue the word ' anarchy ' ' however , to smear the word ' democracy ' seems almost beyond folly .
Fewer words have received more reverence in the modern Western world .
Democracy is in its essence the idea that we all run society .
We choose individuals to represent our wishes , and the majority then gets to impose its wishes upon everyone else , subject ideally to the limitations of certain basic inalienable rights .
The irrational aspect of this is very hard to see , because of the endless amount of propaganda that supports democracy ( though only in democracies , which is telling ) , but it is impossible to ignore once it becomes evident .
Democracy is based on the idea that the majority possesses sufficient wisdom to both know how society should be run , and to stay within the bounds of basic moral rules .
The voters are considered to be generally able to judge the economic , foreign policy , educational , charitable , monetary , health care , military et al policies proposed by politicians .
These voters then wisely choose between this buffet of various policy proposals , and the majority chooses wisely enough that whatever is then enacted is in fact a wise policy ' and their chosen leader then actually enacts what he or she promised in advance , and the leader 's buffet of proposals is entirely wise , and no part of it requires moral compromise .
Also , the majority is virtuous enough to respect the rights of the minority , even though they dominate them politically .
Few of us would support the idea of a democracy where the majority could vote to put the minority to death , say , or steal all their property .
In addition , for even the idea of a democracy to work , the minority must be considered wise and virtuous enough to accept the decisions of the majority .
In short , democracy is predicated on the premises that :
A . The majority of voters are wise and virtuous enough to judge an incredibly wide variety of complex proposals by politicians .
B . The majority of voters are wise and virtuous enough to refrain from the desire to impose their will arbitrarily upon the minority , but instead will respect certain universal moral ideals .
C. The minority of voters who are overruled by the majority are wise and virtuous enough to accept being overruled , and will patiently await the next election in order to try to have their say once more , and will abide by the universal moral ideals of the society .
This , of course , is a complete contradiction .
If society is so stuffed to the gills with wise , brilliant , virtuous and patient souls , who all respect universal moral ideals and are willing to put aside their own particular preferences for the sake of the common good , what on earth do we need a government for ?
Whenever this question is raised , the shining image of the ' noble citizenry ' mysteriously vanishes , and all sorts of specters are raised in their place .
' Well , without a government , everyone would be at each other 's throats , there would be no roads , the poor would be uneducated , the old and sick would die in the streets etc. etc. etc . '
This is a blatant and massive contradiction , and it is highly informative that it is nowhere part of anyone 's discourse in the modern world .
Democracy is valid because just about everyone is wise and moral , we are told .
When we accept this , and question the need for a government , the story suddenly reverses , and we are told that we need a government because just about everyone is amoral and selfish .
Do you see how we have an ambivalent relationship not just with anarchism , but with democracy itself ?
In the same way , whenever an anarchist talks about a stateless society , he is immediately expected to produce evidence that every single poor person in the future will be well taken care of by voluntary charity .
Again , this involves a rank contradiction , which involves democracy .
The welfare state , old - age pensions , and ' free ' education for the poor are all considered in a democracy to be valid reflections of the virtuous will of the people ' these government programs were offered up by politicians , and voluntarily accepted by the majority who voted for them , and also voluntarily accepted by the minority who have agreed to obey the will of the majority !
In other words , the majority of society is perfectly willing to give up an enormous chunk of its income in order to help the sick , the old and the poor ' and we know this because those programs were voted for and created by democratic governments !
Ah , says the anarchist , then we already know that the majority of people will be perfectly willing to help the sick , the old and the poor in a stateless society ' democracy provides empirical and incontrovertible evidence of this simple fact !
Again , when this basic argument is put forward , the myth of the noble citizenry evaporates once more !
' Oh no , without the government forcing people to be charitable , no one would lift a finger to help the poor , people are so selfish , they do n't care etc. etc. etc . '
This paradox cannot be unraveled this side of insanity .
If a democratic government must force a selfish and unwilling populace to help the poor , then government programs do not reflect the will of the people , and democracy is a lie , and we must get rid of it ' or at least stop pretending to vote .
If democracy is not a lie , then existing government programs accurately represent the will of the majority , and thus the poor , the sick and the old will have nothing to fear from a stateless society ' and will , for many reasons , be far better taken care of by private charity than government programs .
Now it is certainly easy to just shrug off the contradictions above and say that somewhere , somehow , there just must be a good answer to these objections .
Although this can be a pleasant thing to do in the short run , it is not something I have ever had much luck doing in the long term .
These contradictions come back and nag at me ' and I am actually very glad that they have done so , since I think that the progress of human thought utterly depends upon us taking nothing for granted .
The first virtue is always honesty , and we should be honest enough to admit when we do not have reasonable answers to these reasonable objections .
This does not mean that we must immediately come up with new ' answers , ' but rather just sit with the questions for a while , ponder them , look for weaknesses or contradictions in our objections ' and only when we are satisfied that the objections are valid should we begin looking for rational and empirical answers to even some of the oldest and most commonly - accepted ' solutions . '
This process of ceasing to believe in non-answers is fundamental to science , to philosophy ' and is the first step towards anarchism , or the acceptance that violence is never a valid solution to non-violent problems .
Anarchy and Violence
One of the truly tragic misunderstandings about anarchism is the degree to which anarchism is associated with violence .
Violence , as commonly defined , is the initiation of the use of force .
( The word ' initiation ' is required to differentiate the category of self - defense . )
Since the word ' ambivalent ' seems to be the theme for this book , it is important to understand that those who advocate or support the existence of a government have themselves a highly ambivalent relationship to violence .
To understand what I mean by this , it is first essential to recognize that taxation ' the foundation of any statist system ' falls entirely under the category of ' the initiation of the use of force . '
Governments claim the right to tax citizens ' which is , when you look at it empirically , one group of individuals claiming the moral right to initiate the use of force against other individuals .
Now , you may believe for all the reasons in the world that this is justified , moral , essential , practical and so on ' but all this really means is that you have an ambivalent relationship to the use of force .
On the one hand , you doubtless condemn as vile the initiation of the use of force in terms of common theft , assault , murder , rape and so on .
Indeed , it is the addition of violence that makes specific acts evil rather than neutral , or good .
Sex plus violence equals rape .
Property transfer plus violence equals theft .
Remove violence from property transfer , and you have trade , or charity , or borrowing , or inheritance .
However , when it comes to the use of violence to transfer property from ' citizens ' to ' government , ' these moral rules are not just neutralized , but actively reversed .
We view it as a moral good to resist a crime if possible ' not an absolute necessity , but certainly a forgivable if not laudable action .
However , to resist the forcible extraction of your property by the government is considered ignoble , and wrong .
Please note that I am not attempting to convince you of the anarchist position in this ( or any other ) section of this book .
I consider it far too immense a task to change your mind about this in such a short work ' and besides , if you are troubled by logical contradictions , I might rob you of the considerable intellectual thrill and excitement of exploring these ideas for yourself .
Thus in a democracy , we have a highly ambivalent relationship to violence itself .
We both fear and hate violence when it is enacted by private citizens in pursuit of personal ' and generally considered negative ' goals .
However , we praise violence when it is enacted by public citizens in pursuit of collective ' and generally considered positive ' goals .
For instance , if a poor man robs a richer man at gunpoint , we may feel a certain sympathy for the desperation of the act , but still we will pursue legal sanctions against the mugger .
We recognize that relative poverty is no excuse for robbery , both due to the intrinsic immorality of theft , and also because if we allow the poor to rob the less poor , we generally feel that social breakdown would be the inevitable result .
The work ethic of the poor would be diminished ' as would that of the less poor , and society would in general dissolve into warring factions , to the economic and social detriment of all .
However , when we institutionalize this very same principle in the form of the welfare state , it is considered to be a noble and virtuous good to use force to take money from the more wealthy , and hand it over to the less wealthy .
Again , this book is not designed to be any sort of airtight argument against the welfare state ' rather , it is designed to highlight the enormous moral contradictions in ' and our fundamental ambivalence towards ' the use of violence to achieve preferred ends '

Why Pork ?
The pork Martini serves many needs on many levels !
In these pomo days , when old formulas are reborn with futile twists for our fickle tastes , the meat cocktail stands out above cranberry - tainted attempts at bar trendiness .
This Martini , abandoning the olive garnish for that of a pork - rind wedge , bridges social strata by merging the flavors of the working class with that of wealthier ones .
It has the humanitarian goal of bettering the nutrition of alcoholics , offering protein for those who prefer their lunches liquid : since meat digests longer , it will both inebriate and offer nutrients for longer periods !
It will open new markets to pork consumption , adding American jobs to every level of the meat - industrial complex .
And , finally , it looks really weird .
The Infusion
To begin the quest , approximately three ounces each of : Sweet dried pork ( an excellent Chinese snack food ) ,
Pan -sauteed ground pork ( from the patty interior ) ,
Boiled , sliced sweet Italian dinner sausage , and
Briefly sauteed Spam
were steeped separately in approximately four ounces each of 100 - proof Absolut vodka , in covered glasses , for up to two weeks .
The pork patty and Spam were first sauteed in canola oil , which was tipped away early to avoid influencing the taste of the meats .
The dried pork , being the least permeable , was given a few extra days to infuse .
Although gin makes the only true Martini , vodka was chosen as the less distracting base for these cocktails , especially for the sake of the sausage Martini , the fennel and cracked pepper of which might clash with the complex botanicals of gin .
The Transmogrification
After two weeks or more of stewing in Absolut , all four pork products showed minor physical changes .
The Chinese sweet dried pork had been lightly pink and rough to the touch .
After infusion , the meat was pale gray and the surface velvety soft , although the pork strips retained their stiffness .
The vodka was murky with particulates .
What first appeared to be traces of oil on the surface turned out to be aggregates of those pork particles .
Its bouquet was simply that of vodka .
The ground pork , which had never been very pretty to begin with , reminded me of some tumors I had seen at the Army Medical Museum at Walter Reed .
Its vodka was the clearest of all .
However , brownish - yellow droplets of pork oil clung to the surface at the rim .
Its bouquet was distinctly meaty , with a slightly burnt overtone .
The sausage retained its cooked gray color but its surface appeared muddied , softened .
The sausage 's fat chunks remained distinctly white .
This vodka was tinged yellow .
The bouquet smelled clearly of sausage , though it was less overpowering than that of the ground pork vodka .
The Spam had changed the most dramatically in its alcohol bath .
Its bright pink meat was now as dull a gray as any of the other porks , and its vodka was heavily clouded , yet quite bright with the finest of particulates .
Oil droplets obscured the entire surface of the vodka .
The bouquet reeked of acid .
I asked a science - editor friend about the color change , wondering if the alcohol was reacting with the nitrite preservative of the meat , wondering if it would kill me .
He rejected that possibility , at least the first half of it , in favor of the hypothesis that it was the pork that was leaching oxygen from the water in the alcohol .
This was far scarier , but much more interesting , and if it had the side effect of increasing the strength of the drink , so much the better .
The pork - infused vodkas were decanted from their glasses through a triple layer of cheesecloth into mixing glasses .
This removed most pork solids , but no attempt was made to skim any oils present .
The vodkas were separately mixed 1:5 dry with Martini & Rossi extra - dry vermouth , and were chilled only moderately so as not to disguise subtle flavorings .
The Martinis were stirred , strained of their ice , then poured into fresh Martini glasses .
Were any animals were harmed during the course of this experiment ?
Of course !
The pork animals !
The Tasting
Tasting was overseen by a collection of sprightly , generic - yet - authentic Cole Porter oldies such as " Let 's Do It , " " I 've Got You Under My Skin , " and " Always True To You in My Fashion . "
Hot , salted Chinese " imitation " egg noodles and tap water were on hand to clear the palate .
And there was even a lovely blond in the room : me .
The sweet dried pork Martini , despite the lack of apparent surface oil , coated the bottom of my upper lip with a tangy pork greasiness .
I was casually impressed , though I began to worry about what the more visibly oily pork vodkas would later offer .
The chilled Martini had a piggy bouquet beyond its plain pork - vodka aroma .
Was that the endothermic effect of the chilled liquor alerting the nose , or the action of the herb - steeped vermouth ?
I sipped a little .
No aftertaste or aftereffect beyond the expected tummy warmth .
Little flavor at all , in fact .
Dried meats would seem less than optimum .
The ground pork Martini 's scent was powerful with essence of pork patty .
This is not a cocktail for the pork Martini dilettante :
Like specifically demanding from your bartender a " vodka Martini " instead of the understood default gin Martini , you 'll have to specify the " pork patty Martini " instead of a vanilla version , and make sure he or she fries the pork just right , searing the surfaces , draining the fat , and not letting it burn while you chase Naomi or Leonardo into a restroom .
Come back when it 's mixed .
Wow .
This Martini packed a pork wallop .
The aroma was overpowering , I have to admit .
But that masked the oil ; I saw the oil before , really , see my comments under " Transmogrification , " supra , but I tasted no oil .
I declaim this a Martini you will love or hate , no middle ground .
You could get drunk on the bouquet alone , a secondary high .
Your neighbor will notice -- and I mean your next - door neighbor , as you mix this at home , not the crackhead on the next barstool -- and ask " Hey , is that pork you 're drinking ? "
" Yes ! " you trumpet proudly .
A great way to make new friends .
Unless he or she is a vegetarian .
But who wants a vegetarian friend ?
Here comes the sausage !
Forgive me : I accidentally doubled the vermouth .
The yellow cast was gone .
But it was as distinctively sausagey in odor as the ground pork was groundy .
The cheesecloth let lots of pork particulate through :
This was a cloudy one , people , best served in the dark .
Lots of fat on top , another downer .
But the taste was crisp , and it had an aftertaste .
Further pork Martini experiments must play with the full sequence of flavors to restore the crisp Martini bite to the previous two drinks .
The seeds -- dill ? -- are n't even masked by the extra vermouth .
The pork sausage Martini was a winner , more generic than the ground pork Martini , but as strong and fine .
Look for it at a street - fair truck near you , with a green - pepper garnish .
Spam time .
N.B. : I do n't like Spam .
I hate it .
I can't believe that Spam is so hip nowadays .
Have its apologists actually tasted it ?
Canned cat food is strip steak next to the foul , pink , greasy , Dachau - invented excrescence that is Spam .
Spam tastes sour .
It has no texture .
It overpowers any attempts at seasoning .
But here it is .
If the Spam Martini holds its own within the esthetic parameters of Spam , my staring at that pickled - fetal - tissue imitation for two weeks will have been worth it .
I admit that the bouquet is odd , neither of Spam nor of gelatin , not that it could be the latter since I 'd washed that off .
The sausage particulates had been chunky , but the Spam fragments are uniformly tiny and stay suspended in the cocktail like Orbitz Gummi spheres .
Shake the strained Spam Martini lightly and they all move in unison .
This is more than oxygen depletion .
I am convinced that the Spam has changed the specific gravity of the vodka .
But I do n't have the equipment to test that .
Oh , wait .
I have to taste this , do n't I. Hm .
Hm .
I do n't want to do this .
I 'm holding my nose .
Here goes .
I can't believe I made a Spam Martini .
Good - bye , Wendy , I love you .
Huh .
Hey .
I lived !
God .
It 's salty .
You ca n't taste the ham .
You can't even taste Spam .
It 's pure salt .
Not tingly Margarita rim-encrusting salt , but oily , slimy salt .
I am majorly clearing my palate here .
Little noodles all over the place .
Sipping water .
Once again .
Faugh .
Pbbbbbft .
Bleah .
I am pouring the water into the drink .
Tasting .
Whimper .
Forget it .
This is a loser , people .
Spam doth not a Martini make .
Word to your bartender .

Following the open source model for collaborative software development can cut costs while providing a basis to create other innovative networks to develop technology specific to your company .
While few have tried to develop industry - specific or vertically oriented open - source solutions up to now , it could become the future of software development .
Open - source software ( OSS ) is a development process that requires collaboration between individuals and organizations that is n't necessarily driven by a traditional hierarchy of command and control .
Simultaneously , IT departments are driven to be more efficient while creating innovative new solutions to meet their business needs .
More and more companies are turning to external sources for ideas that drive innovation .
A series of books by Henry Chesbrough has coined the term innovation networks to discuss R&D departments that treat their systems as open — meaning , how do you include your partners , customers and even competitors as part of an extended R&D team ?
For Open Source Advice from the Experts
Are your users clamoring to use open source but you 're unsure about implementing it at the enterprise level ?
For the week of June 2 , CIO.com has invited a dozen renowned open - source experts to examine its risks and benefits .
It 'll cover the virtues of contribution , finding providers safe for enterprise adoption , choosing licensing models , and discovering what market consolidation and fragmentation could mean for you .
Join the interactive blog - based discussion June 2 through June 6 , 2008 .
The question is , can OSS be used to establish innovation networks for IT departments ?
What steps are required to establish a successful software innovation network , and what are the resulting benefits for organizations ?
The Drive for Collaboration
Determining the scope of collaboration is often the most challenging aspect of starting an open - source project .
The key challenge is to understand the areas of technology that are a core business value of the organization .
Based on previous experiences in the software industry , OSS tends to lead to two logical strategies for collaboration :
Collaborating on the implementation of industry standards or protocols , and Establishing an industry platform to grow a market .
Collaborating on Open Standards
Globalization and government regulation have increased the importance of industry standards and protocols .
There are many examples of consortiums that define standards and protocols for specific technologies or specific industries .
However , the implementation of these standards is often left to ISVs or individual IT organizations .
Software vendors were expected to implement technology standards such as HTTP , XML , Java , etc. , in their products , but the implementations provided very little differentiating features and customer value add .
Open - source software provides an effective mechanism for creating a common implementation that drives the adoption of these standards ; the Apache HTTP Web server is a great example of driving the httpd standard .
For more on collaborative software development , see Grady Booch 's 10 Tips to Help Employees Collaborate .
A similar case can be made for IT organizations that need to implement specific industry standards and protocols .
The actual implementation of these standards provides very little benefit to the core business of an organization .
Today , IT organizations typically rely on ISVs or internal development groups to implement these standards and thus incur the costs of sourcing the implementation .
The drive for collaboration is propelled by the need for IT organizations to quickly and efficiently implement new regulations or standards for their business .
Organizations within the same industry can join together as a software - innovation network to create a shared implementation of a standard .
A common implementation would mean that the cost is shared and the common deployments would result in greater interoperability .
For more on corporate involvement in open - source applications , see The Enterprise Committer : When Your Employee Develops Open - Source Code on the Company Payroll .
Collaborating on a Common Platform
Creating a common industry platform can address the IT challenge of integrating solutions from different vendors and help accelerate the growth of a fragmented market .
A consistent requirement of IT organizations is the need to integrate solutions from different vendors .
For instance , CRM systems often need to be integrated with e-mail systems ; financial institutions need to integrate data feeds from many providers ; and large - scale manufacturers , such as automotive or aerospace OEMs , have extensive supply chains that need to integrate across the product lifecycle .
Typically , the integration is a cost of doing business , not a core value , so creating a common platform that is adopted by a number of industry players effectively streamlines the integration requirements .
Establishing a common platform in a fragmented market of providers can help grow the entire industry .
In fragmented markets , significant investment is often duplicated across solution providers but provides no real customer value .
In addition , a valuable market ecosystem cannot develop because the market share of each provider is not big enough to sustain investment on one particular platform .
Therefore , if multiple players agree to collaborate on a common platform , it can reduce the barriers for increasing the size of the overall market .
Factors to Consider When Establishing a Software - Innovation Network
Open - source software development provides a proven model for creating shared implementations , however , the ultimate goal of a software innovation network is to increase business value .
Therefore , we need to consider several aspects of OSS that allow for value creation and value capture when establishing a collaboration amongst equal partners .
Read CIO Editor - in - Chief 's thoughts about Enterprise Innovation with Open Source
Open-Development Process
The success of OSS development in facilitating collaborative development is in an open - development process .
Most major open - source communities , such as Apache , Eclipse and Linux , work on the following principles :
Openness : being open to participation by any individual or organization , including competing organizations .
Meritocracy : Openness does not mean democracy ; in fact , successful open - source projects work on the principle of a meritocracy .
Therefore , newcomers are invited to participate based on their proven merit and ability .
Transparency : having important project discussions , plans and meeting minutes available in a transparent manner so anyone can view them .
Enabling a Governance Model for Collaboration
All successful long - term organizations require a set of rules that establish a governance model for setting policies and strategies .
Governance becomes even more important if the organization is a collaboration among competitors .
It is , therefore , critical that the governance model not allow a single player to control or influence the organization .
The perception or reality that a single participant controls the overall community can inhibit the participation of others .
Intellectual - Property Management
Intellectual - property management is a critical consideration when you are creating a shared technology base .
Effective IP management includes the selection of an appropriate software license , legal agreements for participants that cover the contribution of IP , and scanning of source code to ensure pedigree and license compatibility .
For instance , the Eclipse Foundation has a well - established IP management system .
All participants in the Eclipse community sign the same exact agreement and follow the same IP processes .
All Eclipse open - source project committers sign a " committer agreement " that specifies that their contribution is licensed under the Eclipse Public License ( EPL ) .
All source code that is contributed to Eclipse projects is automatically scanned to ensure that all of the code is licensed under the EPL or a compatible open - source license .
The result is that the technology created in the open - source projects has clear software license and IP pedigree .
Creating a Community
Tim O'Reilly coined the term architecture of participation to describe how open - source projects are able to build and engage a community .
The idea is that an open - source community forms around the ability of an individual , regardless of his or her affiliation , to participate .
An architecture of participation is created by :
Making it easy to extend the technology , and Having an open development process that is transparent to all .
Participation then occurs when those individuals contribute directly back to the project or build new technology on top of the base technology .
The end result is an ecosystem that adds the needed components for quick adoption of new technology .
The network effect of smaller communities within the larger communities has also proven very beneficial for starting new projects .
A significant challenge for any new community is generating awareness and participation .
Organizations such as Apache and Eclipse allow new projects to leverage the larger community to raise their profile with potential community members .
Establishing the IT Infrastructure
The IT infrastructure to host a community - oriented software - innovation network is nontrivial .
Typically , open - source collaborations will require a website , source - code repository , bug - tracking database , wikis , mailing lists and newsgroups .
Consideration needs to be given into the ongoing administration and management of the infrastructure .
Open Business Models
A goal of a software innovation network is to create an ecosystem of organizations , commercial and not - for - profit , that benefit from a common platform .
These organizations will employ a variety of business models and strategies .
Therefore , it is important to ensure that the choice of license and governance model allow for maximum flexibility .
Where Do We Go from Here ?
Most IT organizations have reduced software - licensing costs by being users of OSS .
The next step to additional IT efficiencies will be their participation in OSS projects .
Open - source communities like Apache , Eclipse and Linux have demonstrated a model for collaborative software development that can be the basis for any software - innovation network .
Visionary IT departments have already begun to leverage this model to collaborate on the development of technology specific to their domain .
Over the next few years , open software - innovation networks could very well be the future of software development .
Ian Skerrett is the director of marketing at the Eclipse Foundation , a not - for - profit corporation supporting the Eclipse open - source community and commercial ecosystem .
In this role , he is responsible for implementing programs that raise awareness of the Eclipse open source project and grow the overall Eclipse community .
How to Quickly Free up Space in Gmail and Properly Organize Labels
Is your Gmail full of clutter ?
Are you having a hard time searching for files ?
Do you see the number of unread emails reaching over a thousand ?
Then you badly need to organize your email .
But what if Gmail tells you that it is almost out of space ?
Then you need to learn how to free up space in Gmail .
Unfortunately , it is one of those problems most people do not know how to resolve quickly .
They try all sorts of remedies like clearing their spam folder or deleting some photos here and there but to no avail .
The warning still remains .
You are close to consuming the 15 GB storage space that Google gave when you created your account .
So how do you free up some space in your Gmail ?
What are the steps that will help you retake 15 GB of storage ?
Continue reading below to find out .
What Takes Up Your Gmail Space ?
Before we head to the steps , let us first break down the items that take up most of your Gmail storage .
As we mentioned earlier , you get 15 GB of free storage upon signing up .
Though 15 GB of storage is a lot , sooner or later it will dwindle .
But what exactly takes up your Gmail space ?
If you perform a storage space analysis , you will see the three sections that share your 15 GB storage .
These are Drive , Gmail , and Google Photos .
Go here and check which of the three takes up much of your storage .
From there , you will have an idea of which of the three you need to free up to make more room for your Gmail .
Keep in mind that if you fail to free up space , some of your emails , especially the ones that come with large attachments , may not be able to go through .
How To Free Up Space In Gmail Fast
Freeing up space on Gmail is oftentimes set aside by many .
Until the time comes when they can no longer receive emails and other files will people start to scramble for solutions .
Let ’s take a look at the most effective ways to free up space in Gmail .
Start With The Old Ones
Let us start with your inbox .
The first thing you need to visit is your older emails .
These are emails that you will likely never open and use again .
Thus , you can discard them accordingly .
Go to the Gmail search box at the top of the screen .
Enter the words “ older_than :3y . ”
This will open a list of all your emails that are at least three years old or more .
Tick the select all option and click that trash button to delete .
Discard Files
Aside from your very old emails , you also need to discard some of your files , especially the large ones .
You can search for specific files using the search box .
Try typing “ filename:mov ” or “ filename:mp3 . ”
You can also type “ size : ” then follow it up with the minimum size in bytes .
Gmail employs a 25 MB size limit for messages and attachments .
But if there are large files that you cannot discard , consider downloading local copies .
To do this , switch on IMAP or POP via the settings page .
This way , you can download emails into a desktop program then save them afterward .
In case you ’re using a Mac computer , go to https://setapp.com/how-to/delete-mail-downloads to learn how to delete email downloads .
Check Your Photos
When you analyze your Google space storage , you will likely notice that your photos are taking up the most space .
Go to the settings page and check if you are saving photos in their Original resolution or High Quality .
If the setting is in Original , change it to High Quality .
Switching to High Quality reduces the file size of your photos while maintaining great visual quality .
Do you receive newsletters from various companies ?
Then perhaps it ’s time to unsubscribe to the ones that you do n’t even care to open .
To do this , open an email from the sender you wish to unsubscribe from .
Look for the “ Unsubscribe ” or “ Change Preferences ” option beside the sender ’s name and click it .
Empty Your Trash
Last but not least , you need to empty your trash regularly .
Sure , your Gmail trash empties itself after 30 days .
But if your goal is to clear up space immediately , you need to delete the contents of your trash right now .
Go through the left sidebar and click “ More . ”
From there , look for “ Trash ” that comes with a garbage can icon .
Open your trash and click “ Empty trash now ” at the top of the list .
How To Organize Your Labels
Downsizing your photos , deleting old emails , and clearing out your trash is great .
But it is only half of the battle .
The next phase is to organize your Gmail by using labels .
Labels work by helping you categorize your messages .
For example , you can create a label where all your work - related emails will fall under .
And within this “ Work ” label , you can create more labels like “ Follow Up , ” and “ Urgent , ” depending on what you wish to add .
To label your emails , go to the sidebar menu and scroll down .
Click “ Create a new label ” to open a small window .
In the window , insert a name for your label .
The good thing about these Gmail labels is the room for customization .
You can assign a color for each label to distinguish them faster .
Aside from the labels , you can also explore the Tabs .
These are the categories of your messages .
To use Tabs , click the Settings on your inbox and click the “ Configure inbox ” tab .
From there , you can tick the categories that you do not wish to see in your Tabs section .
In turn , Gmail will move these emails to your “ Primary ” tab .
Maximize Your Gmail
Learning how to free up space in Gmail is a must for all Google account owners .
It helps you organize your messages and keep your inbox away from clutter .
But there is a lot more to learn beyond increasing storage space .
Optimize and maximize your Gmail by reading our other articles .

Resveratrol , a natural product derived from grape skins and other plant sources , is widely ( but not universally ) believed to be an activator of the longevity assurance genes known as sirtuins .
Despite some debate about its mechanism of action , the compound has received a great deal of attention as a possible pharmaceutical remedy for diseases of aging such as late - onset diabetes .
Most famously , resveratrol has been reported to increase the median lifespan of mice fed a high - fat diet , but that study has been subject to numerous criticisms .
The diet in question was so unhealthy it would have made Morgan Spurlock blush , raising questions about its fairness as a model even for the most deranged Western diet .
Furthermore , the quantity of resveratrol administered to the mice in the study corresponded to something like 1000 bottles of red wine per day .
A skeptical reader could fairly claim that such a study , in which ridiculously high doses of a compound have an effect on an obscenely unhealthy animal , teaches us exactly nothing about what manageable doses of the same compound might accomplish in reasonably healthy people ( which is , arguably , the point ) .
So : do manageable doses of resveratrol have health benefits — specifically , with respect to diseases of aging or aging itself ?
The first evidence in the affirmative has recently been published by Barger et al. , who demonstrate that mice eating a normal ad libitum calorie - controlled * diet supplemented with resveratrol ( at a much lower dose than in previous studies ) undergo many of the same transcriptional changes as animals undergoing caloric restriction ( CR ) :
A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice Resveratrol in high doses has been shown to extend lifespan in some studies in invertebrates and to prevent early mortality in mice fed a high - fat diet .
We fed mice from middle age ( 14 - months ) to old age ( 30 - months ) either a control diet , a low dose of resveratrol ( 4.9 mg / kg per day ) , or a calorie restricted ( CR ) diet and examined genome - wide transcriptional profiles .
We report a striking transcriptional overlap of CR and resveratrol in heart , skeletal muscle and brain .
Both dietary interventions inhibit gene expression profiles associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle aging , and prevent age - related cardiac dysfunction .
Dietary resveratrol also mimics the effects of CR in insulin mediated glucose uptake in muscle .
Gene expression profiling suggests that both CR and resveratrol may retard some aspects of aging through alterations in chromatin structure and transcription .
Resveratrol , at doses that can be readily achieved in humans , fulfills the definition of a dietary compound that mimics some aspects of CR .
In addition to altered gene expression , the resveratrol - treated mice also exhibit delays in aging parameters ( cardiovascular , endocrinological , metabolic ) comparable to those caused by CR .
The physiological and gene expression changes are observed in multiple tissues ; taken together , they strongly support the hypothesis that resveratrol acts as a CR mimetic .
Based on patterns of SIRT1 activity , however , the authors conclude that a subset of these changes ( specifically , the delay in age - related cardiac decline ) are not due to activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol .
The next question : Given that resveratrol and CR stimulate similar transcriptional changes , and that resveratrol yields some of the same physiological benefits as long - term CR , does low - dose resveratrol also have a favorable effect on median or maximum longevity ?
Based on these findings , I know how I ’d bet , but for the ultimate answer , we ’ll have to wait for the next paper .

Most people consider the Amish an interesting collection of throwbacks who have turned their backs on the modern world .
On a recent trip to Lancaster , Pennsylvania with my wife and kids , I found this popular stereotype quite mistaken .
Beneath the pastel shirts and black trousers and horse - and - buggies portrayed so vividly in Witness ; behind the cornfields and customs that sway layer upon layer back to 17th - century Swiss / high - German roots , the Amish have not so much said no to high - tech as developed an ingenious strategy for getting the most out of it .
To begin with , the Amish are not one , but a variety of subtly , and in some cases drastically , different groups with a wide range of attitudes towards modern devices .
Most importantly , no Amish group has rejected technology outright - rather , they struggle with the appeal of technologies , usually accepting a new machine at first , agonizing over its real and projected social consequences , and then deciding whether and to what extent it will be used .
They come the closest I have seen to a living embodiment of a philosophy for technology .
In most cases , the Amish in fact accept new technology , while straining the limits of creativity to keep it from disrupting their social order .
Electricity from central power companies is forbidden - sockets in the wall are appendages of an uncontrollable , huge , external , political - economic power structure - but electricity from 12 volt , self - sufficient batteries is all right .
Phones are frowned upon ( not absolutely forbidden ) in the homes of most Amish , but since the 1930s , phone " shanties " on the edges of property have been permitted .
These booths are seen as affording most of the advantages of the phone , while strengthening the communal use which the Amish see as crucial to a healthy life .
As McLuhan pointed out , the phone line in the home makes our private lives more public than a walk outside .
The Amish proscription on centrally supplied electricity dovetails nicely with its religious - ethical dislike of mass media - like television , which usually can't run on batteries - and its content .
But a new device has crept into some Amish homes and businesses : a clever little " inverter , " which transforms 12 - volt battery current into a reasonable likeness of the 110 - volt power that comes from the socket .
How exquisite the irony , then , when TV and yes , even computers are now connected to inversion 110 - volt power .
Pocket calculators that run on batteries and sun are already in widespread use .
As far as I could see , laptop and notebook computers are not yet used , but the profound decentralizing effect of these media makes them natural allies of the Amish .
Leapfrogging is a well - known feature of technological evolution .
The key insight here is that what 's usually wrong with technology is that there 's not enough of it .
Surprisingly , many Amish seem to understand this better than we " English " of the larger world .
How intriguing to think that the Amish , and their deep sense of privacy and independence , could be a source or even a spearhead for enlightened digital technology to empower the individual and the pioneering community in the next century .

Suffix trees are simple , yet powerful , data structures :
Fill an array with pointers to every position in a string , sort the array , then quickly search the string for long phrases .
A few lines of code suffice to implement this structure , which can be near optimal in time and space .
In this column , I 'll introduce the structure with a simple problem , then apply it to a more subtle task .
Given an input file of text , how can a program find the longest duplicated substring of characters ?
For instance , the longest repeated string in " Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country " is " can do for you , " with " your country " a close second .
How would you write a program to solve this problem ?
If the input string is stored in c [ 0 .. n - 1 ] , a simple program could compare every pair of substrings with the following pseudocode :
maxlen = - 1 for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ ) for ( j = 0 ; j < n ; j++ ) thislen = comlen ( &c [ i ] , &c[j ] ) if thislen > maxlen maxlen = thislen maxi = i maxj = j
The comlen function returns the length that its two parameter strings have in common , starting with their first characters :
int comlen ( char * p , char * q ) i = 0 while *p && ( * p++ == * q ++ ) i++ return i
Because the algorithm looks at all pairs of substrings , it takes time proportional to n2 , at least .
Suffix arrays give a faster algorithm .
The program processes at most MAXN characters , which it stores in the array c :
# define MAXN 5000000 char c [ MAXN ] , * a[ MAXN ] ;
The suffix array is the array a of pointers to characters .
As the program reads the input , it initializes a so that each element points to the corresponding character in the input string :
while ( ch = getchar ( ) ) != EOF a[ n ] = &c [ n ] c[ n ++] = ch c[ n ] = 0
The final element of c contains a null character , which terminates all strings .
The element a [ 0 ] points to the entire string ; the next element points to the suffix of the array beginning with the second character , and so on .
On the input string " banana , " the array will represent these suffixes :
a [ 0 ] : banana a [ 1 ] : anana a [ 2 ] : nana a [ 3 ] : ana a [ 4 ] : na a [ 5 ] : a
The pointers in the array a together point to every suffix in the string , hence the name " suffix array . "
If a long string occurs twice in the array c , it appears in two different suffixes .
The program therefore sorts the array to bring together equal suffixes .
The " banana " array sorts to the following :
a [ 0 ] : a a [ 1 ] : ana a [ 2 ] : anana a [ 3 ] : banana a [ 4 ] : na a [ 5 ] : nana
The code then scans through this array comparing adjacent elements to find the longest repeated string , which , in this case , is " ana . "
The suffix array structure is that simple :
Fill an array with pointers , and sort them .
It has been used at least since the 1970s , though the term was introduced in the 1990s .
The program will sort the suffix array with the qsort function :
qsort ( a , n , sizeof ( char * ) , pstrcmp )
The pstrcmp comparison function adds one level of indirection to the library strcmp function .
This scan through the array uses the comlen function to count the number of letters that two adjacent words have in common :
for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) if comlen ( a [ i ] , a [ i+1 ] ) > maxlen maxlen = comlen ( a [ i ] , a [ i+1 ] ) maxi = i printf ( " %.* s\en " , maxlen , a[ maxi ] )
The printf statement uses the " * " precision to print maxlen characters of the string .
Suffix arrays represent every substring in n characters of input text using the text itself and n additional pointers .
On typical text files of n characters , the algorithm runs in O ( nlogn ) time , due to sorting .
The complete program in Listing One found the longest repeated string in the 4,460,056 characters of the King James Bible in about 36 seconds on a 600 - MHz Celeron processor ( check out the seventh chapter of the " Book of Numbers " ) .
Markov Text
How can you generate random text ?
A classic approach is to let loose that poor monkey on his aging typewriter .
If the beast is equally likely to hit any lowercase letter or the space bar , the output might look like this :
cbczqpbtvfbyak zfw ecrodtgdd bautfxqkdajxoc
This is pretty unconvincing English text .
If you count the letters in word games ( like Scrabble or Boggle ) , you notice that there are different numbers of the various letters .
There are many more As , for instance , than there are Zs. A monkey could produce more convincing text by counting the letters in a document  if A occurs 300 times in the text while B occurs just 100 times , then the monkey should be three - times more likely to type an A than a B .
This moves a small step closer to English :
saoo nte on sch wirT , hhths fewr loieseium rase
Most events occur in context .
Suppose that you wanted to generate randomly a year 's worth of Fahrenheit temperature data .
A series of 365 random integers between 0 and 100 would n't fool the average observer .
You could be more convincing by making today 's temperature a ( random ) function of yesterday 's temperature :
If it is 85 degrees today , it is unlikely to be 15 degrees tomorrow .
The same is true of English words :
If this letter is a Q , then the next letter is quite likely to be a U .
A generator can make more interesting text by making each letter a random function of its predecessor .
You could , therefore , read a sample text and count how many times every letter follows an A , how many times they follow a B , and so on for each letter of the alphabet .
When the generator writes the random text , it produces the next letter as a random function of the current letter .
The Order - 1 text was made by exactly this scheme :
Order - 1 . Hixt oftorawa opikie the wanos ?
sof I thincks my beehimofove , f fonemar
Order - 2. ligs art myrrh lover comousalipper goodge shing spould bely , he not hart socks galhat is the
Order - 3 . Many of scarly of Israel .
What spices .
Thy love ; and , and the like the us sword my belove ; forth , and my spousalem , bund gold lilie art flook not .
Order - 4 . We hath banners .
The foxes , as the lions ?
My belove , new and frankince 's daughters of smote merchant ?
I would none throught handles of being house ;
This idea extends to longer sequences of letters .
The Order - 2 text was made by generating each letter as a function of the two letters preceding it ( a letter pair is often called a " digram " ) .
The digram TH , for instance , is often followed in English by the vowels A , E , I , O , U and Y , less frequently by R and W , and rarely by other letters .
The Order - 3 text is built by choosing the next letter as a function of the three previous letters ( a trigram ) .
In Order - 4 text , most words are English , and you might not be surprised to learn that it was generated from the King James Version of the " Song of Solomon . "
( See the " Further Reading " section at the end of this column for more examples of randomly generated text . )
Readers with a mathematical background might recognize this process as a Markov chain .
One state represents each k - gram , and the odds of going from one to another do n't change , so this is a " finite - state Markov chain with stationary transition probabilities . "
You can also generate random text at the word level .
The dumbest approach is to spew forth the words in a dictionary at random .
A slightly better approach reads a document , counts each word , and then selects the next word to be printed with the appropriate probability .
More interesting text , though , is produced by using Markov chains that take into account a few preceding words as they generate the next word .
Here is some random text produced from my book Programming Pearls :
Order - 1. the STL also adds the same sequence of the large they did n't , they are those structures , design can sometimes decrease storage allocation is trivial program in increasing y- order ,
order , Order - 2 . The 40 - pass algorithm in Solution 4 ) to run out of order with its push - button encoding , sort by column then row , and then bring together all words with the sizeof structures .
We therefore used a total of 96 megabytes .
structures .
We therefore used a total of 96 megabytes .
Order - 3 . I despise having to use a binary search .
These techniques apply to any piecewise - linear functions .
3 . This C code implements the sorting algorithm , using the functions defined in Solution 2 .
The Order - 1 text is almost readable aloud , while the Order - 3 text consists of very long phrases from the original input , with random transitions between them .
For purposes of parody , Order - 2 text is usually juiciest .
( See the " Further Reading " section for many more examples of word - level Markov text . )
Automating Parody
I first saw letter - level and word - level order -k approximations to English text in Shannon 's 1948 classic Mathematical Theory of Communication .
Shannon describes how he generated such text :
To construct [ order - 1 letter - level text ] for example , one opens a book at random and selects a letter at random on the page .
This letter is recorded .
The book is then opened to another page and one reads until this letter is encountered .
The succeeding letter is then recorded .
Turning to another page this second letter is searched for and the succeeding letter recorded , etc .
A similar process was used for [ order - 1 and order - 2 letter - level text , and order - 0 and order - 1 word - level text ] .
It would be interesting if further approximations could be constructed , but the labor involved becomes enormous at the next stage . "
Programs have been automating this laborious task since the early 1950s .
Shannon 's method scans the input text for the current k - gram to generate the next word ; this approximation works well when k is small , but gives biased output when there are uneven gaps between k - grams .
Fast machines can instead scan the complete input text to choose a truly random successor .
A program at http://www .programmingpearls.com / implements this approach , but it generates only a few outputs per second when processing the 4 - million characters in the King James Bible .
A suffix array lets a program search for the next phrase more efficiently .
The Order-k C program will store at most 5 MB of text in the array inputchars :
int k = 2 ; char inputchars [ 5000000 ] ; char * word [ 1000000 ] ; int nword = 0 ;
It will employ the array word as a suffix array pointing to the characters that start on word boundaries ( a common modification ) .
The variable nword holds the number of words .
It reads the file with the following code :
word [ 0 ] = inputchars while scanf ( " %s " , word [ nword ] ) != EOF word [ nword + 1 ] = word [ nword ] + strlen ( word [ nword ] ) + 1 nword ++
Each word is appended to inputchars ( no other storage allocation is needed ) , and is terminated by the null character supplied by scanf .
After reading the input , the program sorts the word array to bring together all pointers that point to the same sequence of k words .
The following function does the comparisons :
int wordncmp ( char * p , char* q ) n = k for ( ; * p == * q ; p++ , q++ ) if ( * p == 0 && -- n == 0 ) return 0 return *p - *q
It scans through the two strings while the characters are equal .
At every null character , it decrements the counter n and returns equal after seeing k identical words .
When it finds unequal characters , it returns the difference .
After reading the input , the program appends k null characters ( so the comparison function does n't run off the end ) , prints the first k words in the document ( to start the random output ) , and calls the sort :
for ( i = 0 ; i < k ; i++) word [ nword ] [ i ] = 0 for ( i = 0 ; i < k ; i++) print word [ i ] qsort ( word , nword , sizeof ( word [ 0 ] ) , sortcmp )
The sortcmp function , as usual , adds a level of indirection to its pointers .
The space - efficient structure now contains a great deal of information about the k - grams in the text .
If k is 1 and the input text is " of the people , by the people , for the people , " the word array might look like this :
word [ 0 ] : by the word [ 1 ] : for the word [ 2 ] : of the word [ 3 ] : people word [ 4 ] : people , for word [ 5 ] : people , by word [ 6 ] : the people , word [ 7 ] : the people word [ 8 ] : the people ,
For clarity , this picture shows only the first k+1 words pointed to by each element of word , even though more words usually follow .
To find a word to follow the phrase " the , " a program looks it up in the suffix array to discover three choices : " people , " twice and " people " once .
The program may now generate nonsense text with the pseudocode in Example 1 .
The loop is initialized by setting phrase to the first characters in the input ( recall that those words were already printed on the output file ) .
The binary search locates the first occurrence of phrase ( it is crucial to find the very first occurrence ) .
The next loop scans through all equal phrases , selects one of them at random .
If the k - th word of that phrase is of length zero , the current phrase is the last in the document , and an early exit is taken from the loop .
The complete pseudocode ( see Example 2 ) implements those ideas , and also puts an upper bound on the number of words it generates .
Listing
Two is the complete C program .
( See " Further Reading " for a description of a more typical program for generating Markov text that does n't use suffix arrays .
The suffix array approach is about half the length in code , has similar run time , and uses an order of magnitude less memory . )
Principles
Need to search for phrases in a long string ?
Create an array of pointers to every relevant position in the string ( every character or every word ) , and sort it .
The resulting suffix array gathers together similar strings , and lets you look up a string using binary search .
It requires only a few lines of code to build , n extra pointers of space , and a small and fast binary search to answer a query .

David Chisnall takes a look at two of the recent competitors to the venerable GNU compiler collection and tries to see where they will fit in an evolving Free Software landscape .

Since its creation , the C language has been tightly tied to UNIX .
C was designed as a portable assembly language for reimplementing UNIX , to make it easier to port to different platforms .
In 1984 , Richard Stallman began the GNU ( GNU ’s Not UNIX ) Project to provide a clone of the UNIX operating system using entirely Free Software .
Because a C compiler is a core component of any UNIX - like operating system , he wrote one : the GNU C Compiler ( GCC ) .
Over the years , GCC was rewritten a few times , and support for various languages was added .
When it began to support more languages than just C , the name was changed to the GNU Compiler Collection , keeping the same GCC abbreviation .
As with other parts of the GNU Project , GCC uses the GNU General Public License , although it has a special exception for any parts of the compiler that are embedded in the compiled output .
The BSD Issue
Although the GNU Project has GCC , and most proprietary UNIX systems have their own compilers , the BSD projects typically have none .
In the base system of any BSD system , GCC is the largest piece of GPL ’d code .
Over the years , it periodically looked as though TenDRA might replace it .
TenDRA , a BSD - licensed C compiler originally started by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency ( the institution that used to be the UK ’s equivalent of DARPA ) focuses on correctness , and would be a good match for systems like OpenBSD , but progress has been slow .
Recently , another option appeared from an unexpected direction .
Back in the 1970s , Stephen Johnson of Bell Labs wrote the Portable C Compiler ( PCC ) .
Unlike many earlier compilers , it had a clean separation between the parser and code - generation stages , allowing it to be ported to new architectures easily — a feature present in most newer compilers .
This compiler was included with a lot of UNIX variants , including 4.3BSD - Reno .
PCC never underwent the same degree of growth as GCC , and remains a very small project .
The source code is under 1 megabyte ( compressed ) , and compiling it on a 1 GHz machine takes only a few seconds , whereas compiling GCC on the same machine takes most of an afternoon .
PCC is n’t as strong in terms of optimization as GCC , but its small size makes it much easier to verify that the output is correct .
In September 2007 , PCC was imported into the OpenBSD source tree , with the aim of evaluating it as a GCC replacement for future releases .
A simple compiler is very attractive to the BSD communities — particularly one that ’s portable .
GCC has a habit of changing the interface to the back end , orphaning architectures .
This behavior has resulted in some ports of NetBSD , for example , having to stick with old versions of GCC , since no one with the expertise to maintain the compiler port is willing to do so .
It ’s difficult to overstate the relative complexity of GCC versus PCC .
The codebase for GCC is almost 100 times the size of the PCC codebase .
The OpenBSD team hopes that this difference in scale will make getting involved with PCC development a lot less daunting than getting involved with GCC .
PCC began life on the VAX , and did n’t support x86 until very recently .
The port took one person less than a week , which makes supporting other architectures seem quite plausible ; the total amount of x86 - specific code comes to less than 4,000 lines .
Where Do People Still Use Cassette Tapes ?
The answer : in prisons , where CDs are routinely banned because they can be shattered and the shards refined into shivs .
MP3 players are unavailable in most prisons , as are , one imagines , turntables .
California - based entrepreneur Bob Paris got the idea five years ago to sell cassettes by mail to the 2.3 million people locked up in federal , state , or local prisons across America .
Now he finds himself with a thriving analog business in a digital music industry beset by piracy and plummeting sales .
See this Reuters article for more details , including Paris ’s best selling albums .
Recent years have seen the resurgence of vinyl record sales ( outside of prisons , of course ) , and even punch cards seem to have been saved from the dustbin of history .
The telegraph lasted until 2006 before the medium finally died , but its clipped vernacular lives on in text messaging .
Are there other examples of media that should have gone extinct but found a nice niche in which to survive ?

I just got back from a nice vacation with no laptop .
What do I do on long plane rides or while listening to the waves lap against the beach ?
Dead - listing .
Dead - listing is analyzing the raw disassembly of some target software and figuring it out using only pen and paper .
This is great for vacations because your laptop wo n’t get sand in it .
You usually have a long period of time to muse about the code in question without interruptions , something hard to find at home these days .
And I ’ve gotten some of my best ideas after setting aside my papers for a while and going for a long swim .
Before you leave , pick an interesting target : not too big , not too small .
Not just x86 either — ever wondered how one of your cellphone ’s applications worked ?
Never looked at a familiar application ’s Java bytecode ?
Then , get a copy of a disassembler for your target and run it .
I often use IDA but for less common CPU architectures , any one will do .
Remember that you do n’t need full analysis at this point , although it ’s useful to be able to separate data from instructions and get basic symbols resolved .
Search the assembly code for any external libraries that might be important .
Disassemble them too .
While you ’re at it , see if you can find the source code or API reference for any of those files .
Code reuse helps you reduce the amount you have to reverse yourself .
Now take the listing file and do some cleanup .
I like to use a small font that prints well and convert all the call ( subroutine ) instructions to bold .
I insert some extra empty lines before each call target to allow me room to write notes .
Finally , I print the listing in landscape with two columns per page .
This leaves room for notes on the righthand side of each column and some at the bottom .
A binder clip makes it easy to keep pages in order or remove them to compare .
Since you wo n’t have access to the Internet , you ’ll need to find some basic reference materials .
The key is to get the basics without carrying a ream of paper .
For an embedded system , I usually find or make a small instruction set reference sheet including status flags , I / O port table , PCB layout photos , and any integrated peripherals I find during a brief search of the data accesses .
Print these out and put a full copy of all the files on a USB flash drive .
You might stop by an Internet cafe if you find you really need to read a missing page .
I ’ve never found that necessary though .
If I ca n’t infer the function of a particular I/O access , I ’ll just look at the whole block ’s general effect and take a guess .
The most important part is to stay light .
You do n’t need exhaustive manuals ( e.g. , instruction timing ) .
Instead , treat these barriers as a challenge .
For example , most timing loops are relative to each other .
You can figure out that one loop is twice as slow as the other without knowing its exact delay in nanoseconds .
Doing hexadecimal conversions on paper builds character .
Once you ’re away , enjoy doing a little bit at a time .
I ’d often work through a subroutine or lay out a switch statement over coffee before the family gets moving , then set it aside for the rest of the day .
Before putting it down , keep a separate log of open questions and tasks , marking them off as you solve them .
I usually reserve a page in this notebook as my “ symbol table ” , marking down function names / addresses as I finalize them .
I mostly work through the code in two modes : looking for high level blocks or walking through a single subroutine in detail .
Was this compiled C or C ++?
How does the optimizer work ?
When accessing hardware , where did the author use inline assembly ?
Draw arrows , bracket blocks , use highlighters if that ’s your style .
Since it ’s more free - form than working on a computer , you ’ll find new ways to annotate it .
The amount of marks per page gives a good idea as to code coverage so you can start a day by refining an existing page or try to take a broad guess what a blank page does .
I am always surprised how much I accomplish in only a little bit of time using this method .
It ’s also so much fun .
Throw in reading a few interesting but unrelated books and you may wax philosophical on the meaning of life or why the compiler suddenly switched to byte instead of word operations for a single function .
I hope you have a great summer .
Be sure to stop by my Blackhat 2008 talk , “ Highway to Hell : Hacking Toll Systems “ .
I ’ll be posting more details about it here in the coming weeks .
Back in January we posted on Shepard Fairey ’s posters in support of the Barack Obama campaign .
At the time , some comments cast doubt over how effective the posters would be .
Not only is Obama now assured of the Democratic nomination but , we can reveal , sales of Fairey ’s posters ( shown above ) raised over $ 400,000 to help him get there …

Christina Aguilera often has a " healthy glow " about her " There is nothing attractive or fashionable about a fake tan , and its application has nothing to do with youth , but is all tied up with a desire to look rich ( ie giving off the impression that you spend most of your time lying prone in the Caribbean ) . "
Go back to Victorian times and a tan was a sign of lower social status , connected with manual outdoor labour - but with the advent of mass tourism to sunnier climes , it has spent many years being associated with the ability to afford regular holidays .
Now after years of being on the cosmetic menu for women , fake tanning lotion is being widely marketed to men , with magazines advocating its use for both sexes in increasingly solarphobic times .
Tatler editor Geordie Grieg believes it is wrong to associate fake tan with aspirations of affluence .
" It has no connotations of people 's wealth and background .
There is nothing worse than someone who is orange looking like they spent the whole morning with a bottle .
But if they look like they just stepped off a plane from Martinique , everyone is envious .
It 's not what you do but the way that you do it .
" It is a question of getting good products , good advice and not overdoing it .
Anything can be sophisticated , any cosmetic addition , if it 's not obvious .
Subtlety is the watchword . "
Donatella Versace is often mocked
And perhaps that 's the real antipathy people have towards fake tan - not appearing tanned when you are not , but trying to appear tanned and failing .
To be fair to Ascot , organisers say they are perfectly happy with fake tanned people entering the Royal Enclosure , and merely humorously drew attention to the undesirability of streaky fake tan lines .
To Simon Fanshawe , author of the Done Thing , it 's all about the British dislike of anything unsubtle and inappropriate .
" It 's like Frank Sinatra : ' if they can see us working we are n't working hard enough ' .
There 's nothing worse than a bad fake , it 's like a bad cover version . "
Mismatched tan
And the failure to realise the right place and the right time draws opprobrium .
On EastEnders this week , Dawn gave her baby a fake tan for a beautiful baby competition , to be asked : " Is that jaundice ? "
It must be very sunny in south Wales
Those making an overt grab for glamour can expect raised eyebrows at the very least .
" There is a certain degree to which overt sexual flirtation in Britain is looked down on .
It 's regarded as inappropriate , " says Mr Fanshawe .
He is not of the opinion that fake tan will ever be regarded as sophisticated .
" It absolutely can't .
It is God 's way of telling you you 've got too much money and time .
Very , very few people can ever do it properly .
Most people look like they have been accidentally dropped in a tanning vat . "
There is a sense that there is something rather strange in any kind of tan these days .
We hear so much about the dangers of skin cancer , or the more mundane problem of wrinkles and skin deterioration , that it almost seems hard to believe anybody would have a real nut - brown year - round tan , says Mary Killen , who writes the Spectator 's Dear Mary column .
" I 've used it myself when it first came out in the 1970s and people used to say , ' That looks amazing ' .
But I could n't do my face so I used to have a white face and brown legs . "
But it is still hard to believe even the most subtly applied tan .
" Although it might be very natural looking and it's not orange or streaky , no - one in their right mind would have sunbathed to achieve it , " she says .
That might be the major barrier to tan in a bottle ever achieving complete acceptance .
However widespread fake tan advocacy is in magazines , we are now a little suspicious of all tans .
And if users continue to resemble basted turkeys , fake tan will continue to be the target of snobbery .

The Pirate Bay likes to get involved in Swedish politics every now and then , to stand up for their rights and those of others .
Today they take a stand against a new law proposal that would make it possible for the government to track phone calls , emails and everything else people do on the Internet .
Yesterday we reported that the Swedish Left Party voted in favor of a motion that would legalize the uploading and downloading of copyrighted material for personal use , as long as it is not done for commercial purposes .
This is a clear indication that at least some politicians are still in touch with reality .
Next week , the Swedish parliament will vote on a new “ wiretapping ” law that may severely invade the privacy of Swedish citizens .
If the new law is passed , all email , web traffic and phone calls will be monitored by the FRA , the National Defence Radio Establishment , without the need for court orders or similar authorization .
As always , one of the arguments in favor of such legislation is that it will be easier to hunt down terrorists .
However , there ’s a huge fear this will be used in the wrong way , to track down whistle - blowers for example .
That aside , the law is also a huge invasion of people ’s privacy , both online and offline .
The Swedish parliament will vote on this proposal on June 17th , and The Pirate Bay is urging their Swedish users to make their voices heard on this issue .
“ We want to let you understand more and read up on what this means – and make your voice heard about this !
This is a major threat against our civil rights and we must act .
We must act now ! ” they write on the Pirate Bay blog , pointing their users to a website where they can take action .
Rick Falkvinge , leader of the Swedish Pirate Party is with the Pirate Bay on this issue , as he told The Local : “ Democracy is reliant on the transparency of power , not the transparency of citizens .
All places where the opposite has been the case – where it has been impossible to examine the powers that be , while citizens lack any right to a private life – have been really nasty places to live . ”
Let ’s hope members of Parliament come to their senses , and make the right decision next week .
To be continued .
The world 's most powerful finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in Washington tomorrow ; but as they preoccupy themselves with the global credit crunch , another crisis , far more grave , is facing the world 's poorest people .
A dramatic rise in the worldwide cost of food is provoking riots throughout the Third World where millions more of the world 's most vulnerable people are facing starvation as food shortages grow and cereal prices soar .
It threatens to become the biggest crisis of the 21st century .
This week crowds of hungry demonstrators in Haiti stormed the presidential palace in the capital , Port - au - Prince , in protests over food prices .
And a crisis gripped the Philippines as massive queues formed to buy rice from government stocks .

There have been riots in Niger , Senegal , Cameroon and Burkina Faso and protests in Mauritania , Ivory Coast , Egypt and Morocco .
Mexico has had " tortilla riots " and , in Yemen , children have marched to draw attention to their hunger .
The global price of wheat has risen by 130 per cent in the past year .
Rice has rocketed by 74 per cent in the same period .
It went up by more than 10 per cent in a single day last Friday – to an all - time high as African and Asian importers competed for the diminishing supply on international markets in an attempt to head off the mounting social unrest .
The International Rice Research Institute warned yesterday that prices will keep going up .
The buffers stocks of staple foods that governments once held are being steadily exhausted .
Rising prices have triggered a food crisis in 36 countries , says the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation .
The hike in prices means the World Food Programme is cutting food handout rations to some 73 million people in 78 countries .
The threat of malnutrition on a massive scale is looming .
The impact is beginning to be felt in the rich world , too .
More expensive wheat has caused large rises in the cost of pasta and bread in Italy where consumer groups staged a one - day strike that brought pasta consumption down 5 per cent .
The price of miso , a fermented rice and barley mixture , is up in Japan .
France and Australia have launched national inquiries into rising food prices and are pressing food producers and supermarkets to absorb price rises .
In Britain , the price of bread is rising in line with the cost of wheat .
Governments have begun to negotiate secretive barter arrangements as the price of agricultural commodities leap to record highs .
Ukraine and Libya are close to a deal on wheat .
Egypt and Syria have signed a rice - for - wheat swap .
The Philippines has just failed in a rice deal with Vietnam .
All across the world , cereals , meat , eggs and dairy products are becoming dearer .
" Food prices are now rising at rates that few of us can ever have seen before in our lifetimes , " said John Powell of the World Food Programme .
Prices are likely to remain high for at least 10 years , the Food and Agriculture Organisation is projecting .
A complex interaction of factors has provoked the panic among dealers in international food markets .

Diets are changing radically in nations such as China , India , Brazil and Russia , where economic growth has boosted meat consumption .
In China , it is up by 150 per cent since 1980 .
In India , it has risen by 40 per cent in the past 15 years .
The demand for meat from across all developing countries has doubled since 1980 .
Because cattle and chickens are fed on corn – it takes 8 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of beef – the price has risen .
The new market for biofuels has raised grain prices .
Corn is being used to produce energy and the market is anticipating hugely increased production in the coming decade .
George Bush wants 15 per cent of American cars to run on biofuels by 2017 , which will mean trebling maize production .
Europe has a set a transport fuels target of 5.75 per cent from biofuels by 2010 .
As a result , the price of corn has begun to track that of oil quite closely .
The soaring cost of oil , which last week topped $ 105 ( £ 53 ) a barrel for the first time , has another impact .
It increases the price of fertiliser , and also the costs of food processing and transport .
Climate change is taking its toll .
Droughts and floods are affecting harvests .
Floods in central China this year displaced millions of people and devastated rice and corn crops .
Overall China 's grain harvest has fallen by 10 per cent over the past seven years .
Last year , Australia experienced its worst drought for more than a century , causing the wheat harvest to fall by 60 per cent .
The UK wheat harvest is expected to be 10 per cent down this year , partly because of the flooding .
Worldwide , an area of fertile soil the size of Ukraine is lost every year because of drought , deforestation and climate instability .
There is also increasing demand from a rising world population which is expected to grow from 6.2 billion today to 9.5 billion by 2050 .
The World Bank predicts global demand for food will double by 2030 .
Government policies do not help : the rich world subsidises agriculture not to feed the world but to enrich its farmers .
There is an increasing recognition of the gravity of all of this among the leaders of the industrialised world .
On Thursday , Gordon Brown called on the Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , the current chairman of the G8 , to devise an international plan to deal with rising food prices with the World Bank , the IMF and the UN .
There is increasing concern about the rush to biofuels .
Britain 's new chief scientist , Professor John Beddington , has said cutting down rainforest to produce biofuel crops was " profoundly stupid " .
It was , he said , " very hard to imagine how we can see a world growing enough crops to produce renewable energy and , at the same time , meet the enormous increase in the demand for food " .
Lennart Båge , the president of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development , suggested that those opposed to GM crops should take another look at the productivity gains they can unleash and bring changes as massive as the " green revolution " of the 1960s , when crop yields in India and other developing nations jumped because of of better seeds , fertilisers and improved irrigation .
That change brought down food prices , freeing millions from hunger .
If world leaders cannot come up with something similar again , the food riots could spread across the globe .
nil => nil nil.
present ? => false nil.andand.present ? => true
class Object def present ?
! blank ?
end end
module AndAnd class BlankSlate instance_methods .each { |m| undef_method m unless m =~ /^__/ } def initialize ( me ) @me = me end end class MockReturningMe < BlankSlate def method_missing ( *args ) @me end end end
class Nullo def nil ?
true end end
Pete Forde of Unspace emailed to say that the very first time he tried andand , he discovered a bug : Reg : Embarrassing .
Pete : No sir .
Not embarrassing , because no one ’s ever going to find out they ’re down here .
Because you ’re going to spot them , and you ’re going to air them out .#present ? is defined in Edge Rails as : # blank ? is also defined in Rails in Object , String , and NilClass .
Hmmm .
It did n’t take long to figure out what was happening .
Internally , andand uses a BlankSlate class to implement proxies for returning nil or for forwarding a method .
When you write nil.andand .
present ?
What happens is this : nil.andand returns MockReturningMe.new ( nil ) , and that object returns nil whenever you send it a method it does n’t understand .
Since it inherits from BlankSlate , we do n’t expect it to understand # present ? , so we expect it to return nil .
( Before you ask , nil.nil ?
returns true , but nil.andand.nil ?
returns nil .
That ’s intentional , because nil && nil.nil ?
returns nil , not true . )
So back to the bug .
The BlankSlate wipes all of its instance methods out when it is first initialized .
But what happens if the #present ?
method is added to Object after andand initializes its BlankSlate ?
Ta da !
The MockReturningMe class does handle the method , so it never gets to use its method_missing magic .
And as it happens , a MockReturningMe object is not nil , therefore it is not blank , therefore it is present and #present ?
returns true .
If , that is , #present ? is added to Object after AndAnd : : BlankSlate is created .
If #present ? is added to Object before AndAnd : : BlankSlate , you get entirely different behaviour .
WTF ‽I ’m stating facts here , not rendering judgement :
This is another example of multiple metaprogramming whatsis doohickeys all gleefully re-plumbing the same core classes and stepping on each other ’s toes .
Even when they are n’t redefining the same methods .
Reg :
It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public .
Avdi : Replicants are like any other machine .
They ’re either a benefit or a hazard .
If they ’re a benefit , it ’s not my problem .
Update : Coderrr pointed out that the version of BlankSlate included in Rails ( amongst other gems ) fixes the problem by hooking the Object class .
There are some subtleties in how this works or does not work , especially when several different pieces of code are all hooking the same events .
After discussion with Nathan Weizenbaum , I decided that I certainly did n’t want andand being that invasive , but on the other hand if you have already decided you can live with a BlankSlate class …
So version 1.3.1 works as follows :
If you already have a BlankSlate class defined , such as if you have installed Rails and used BlankSlate , or if you explicitly require BlankSlate before you require andand , andand will make use of the existing class and whatever mechanism that class uses to avoid this problem .
If you do n’t have a BlankSlate class defined but you do have a BasicObject class ( such as from Ruby Facets ) , andand will use that instead .
And if you have neither a BlankSlate nor a BasicObject , andand will roll its own fairly uninvasive BlankSlate that wipes instance methods when it is instantiated ( this is a performance hit compared to wiping them when they are created , however no hooks are required ) .
Pete is now happy .
But this really encourages me to redouble my efforts on rewrite .
Opening core classes to add certain kinds of functionality is very cool .
But I believe it is unsustainable .
Methods like # present ? , #andand , and even #nil ?
really do n’t seem to work as polymorphic methods on objects .
They need to be deeper .
For example , you can define your own class where #nil ?
return true : But guess what ?
This makes little sense in Ruby because your Nullo class is still truthy .
( And no , you cannot write class Nullo < NilClass . ) I ’ve been kvetching a little lately about Ruby not being turtles all the way down .
I guess I ’m doing that here as well : it is very hard to write things that extend or modify Ruby ’s semantics consistently and safely , which i why I ’m looking at rewriting .
With rewrite , for example , both #present ?
and #andand can be expressed as rewrite rules rather than as methods .
( # blank ?
is a little bit more complicated , since you may want the luxury of writing a # blank ?
method for your own classes . )
When you build semantic abstractions our of rewrite rules instead of methods in core classes , you benefit from restricted scope and you benefit from being able to work directly with Ruby ’s existing semantics .
And then I kind of doubted it myself .
I remember thinking , “ That sounds kind of extreme , even from a pinko lefty like me . ”
But then I thought , “ Could I ? ” meaning could I make that argument ?
I decided to try because , among other reasons , I am going to play Rock Band with my friend David Wain in about an hour and I had some time kill .
Like most gay - seeming Jewish showbiz types , I place myself firmly on the opposite side of the political spectrum than this , although I certainly hold many conservative positions ( which I will not get into now because they are irrelevant to the body of this post , but one of which is that I think we should go back to the gold standard because gold is pretty ) .
As we were talking , though , I found myself saying , “ I think you could strong case that George W. Bush is guilty of treason . ”
He disagreed .
I have a second job .
Regular readers to this blog know that this second job is playing poker at the fantastic Commerce Casino in the great city of Los Angeles ( “ fantastic ” and “ great , ” of course , both being highly subjective terms ) .
While in Los Angeles for the month , I have been spending inordinate amounts of time at my second job .
Last night , I got into a conversation with a fellow at my table , a man notable for his friendly demeanor , beady eyes , and ability to drink fourteen Bud Lights without pause .
He was also a conservative .
Keep in mind I am an actor and a comedian , not a lawyer .
Not only do I have no legal training , I have never even played a lawyer , although on the TV show “ Ed , ” my character Phil worked for a lawyer who owned a bowling alley .
That is about as close to legal training as I have ever come .
Even so , I will attempt to make my case .
Because treason is such a loaded word , I decided to do something that I find utterly loathsome in writing , which is to inject a dictionary definition into my prose .
I do this because , if I am going to make the case for treason against the president , it seems like I have to define the term in a way that everybody can see .
For this , I choose the most trusted source on language , the built - in dictionary that came with my Mac .
This is an abridged definition , but it serves my purposes .
Treason : noun ( also high treason )
the crime of betraying one 's country , esp. by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government : they were convicted of treason .
I believe the president ’s most sacred duty is that of commander - in - chief ( followed closely by master of ceremonies at the annual White House Easter egg hunt ) .
As commander - in - chief , it is the president ’s responsibility to choose when and if to send our soldiers into harm ’s way .
I understand that Congress has the responsibility of declaring war , which they essentially ceded to the president with the H.J. Res 114 “ The Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 , ” which was probably not such a great idea .
In fact , I ’m going to go out on a limb and say that Congress passing this act ?
Not a great idea at all .
For this of you unclear as to what this act was – it gave the president the authorization to use force against Iraq when and if he saw fit .
As it turns out , he saw fit .
Why did he see fit ?
The reason we were given at the time , as all of you know , was that Iraq was a grave and imminent threat to the United States .
After all , we ’re the USA .
We do n’t just go invading other countries willy - nilly without there being a reason , do we ?
Apparently we do .
Or I should say , the true reason was never given .
If you ask , as I do , people why we went into Iraq , nobody really knows .
Was it weapons of mass destruction ?
Was it oil ?
Was it establishing a beachhead for Middle Eastern democracy other than Israel ?
Why did we invade ?
It seems to me if you are going to war , the Commander in Chief should have a pretty compelling reason .
Historically , nations leading offensive campaigns define their reasons for doing so defensively , which is what we did .
For the year or so leading up to the war , various administration officials paraded in front of television cameras attempting to gin up fear for a country that had never expressed any intention of attacking the United States .
They were , however , lumped in with an organization that did : Al Qaeda .
Repeatedly , the administration attempted to establish linkage between the government of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda .
In fact , this linkage ( which did n’t exist ) was referred to in the bill authorizing force :
Within the body of the Joint Resolution we read ( among many other things , all of which begin with the word “ Whereas , ” which in my opinion sounds very fancy . )
“ Whereas members of al Qaeda , an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States , its citizens and interests , including the attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 are known to be in Iraq . ”
Let me just point out – not true .
And :
“ Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding requested by the President to take the necessary actions international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such persons or organizations . ”
Of course , al Qaeda was never based in Iraq , and none of the hijackers who flew the planes on September 11 were from Iraq .
They were mostly from Saudi Arabia , which to my knowledge , we have not attacked .
And also :
“ Whereas the President and Congress are determined to continue to take all appropriate actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such persons or organizations . ”
All of these passages explicitly link al Qaeda to Iraq , a tie that has been disproved .
Incidentally , for those of you who think “ Al Qaeda in Iraq ” is the same thing as al Qaeda – it ’s not .
It was created after the invasion , and did not exist beforehand .
Unfortunately , its creators could not think of a more creative name .
For the record , when I create my terrorist organization I ’m going to call it “ The Kimbo Slice All - Star Freakout Terrorists and Ragtime Band . ”
We will probably not have an actual ragtime band in the organization just as al Qaeda in Iraq is not ( or at least was not ) actually part of Bin Laden ’s al Qaeda .
Why is it important that these false passages were included in the Joint Resolution ?
Again , to give us defensive cover for invading a nation that had never threatened to invade us .
The other means of doing this was , of course , the weapons of mass destruction .
There ’s no need to recount this debate , but to remind readers who may still be wearing protective chemical suits and cowering behind duct tape covered doors and window sills , no weapons of mass destruction were ever found .
The president can say whatever he wants about the intelligence he was given in the run-up to the war regarding Saddam Hussein ’s stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons ( not to mention the famous mushroom cloud that National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice warned us would be blooming over American cities if we did n’t do something about Iraq RIGHT NOW !!! ) , but the fact is there was conflicting intelligence about this matter , and there were also United Nations weapons inspectors in country at the time looking for those same weapons .
Not surprisingly , they did n’t find any .
Why ?
Because they did n’t exist .
In other words , the two main reasons we were given for going to war , linkage to al Qaeda and Saddam ’s stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction were both false .
False .
Another word for a falsehood is a lie .
The nation was lied to about why the United States was going to invade a sovereign nation .
In my mind , when somebody lies to me , I feel betrayed .
When you lie to a nation , and that lie results in the deaths of over four thousand Americans , the wounding of tens of thousands more , the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars , and utter calamity caused to Iraq , the Middle East , and the reputation of the United States , I would say that the lie rises to the level of betraying one ’s country , which as we ’ve seen by my built - in dictionary , is the definition of treason .
George Bush and his cronies , for whatever reason , betrayed this country when they set in motion a plan to make war on Iraq .
This was an aggressive , unnecessary war that defied everything I believe this nation to stand for .
Whether or not we ultimately emerge “ victorious ” is irrelevant .
When a nation invades another nation , there better be a damned good reason .
Over five years after the fact , we are still waiting for that reason .
I am not advocating impeachment or bringing the man up on charges or anything else because I think such actions would be counterproductive and would probably greatly affect future airings of “ Desperate Housewives ” for network coverage of the proceedings .
I ’m just pointing out that one could make the argument that George W. Bush committed treason .
Now , as I said , I ’m not a lawyer .
Did not major in political science .
Visited Washington once , but mostly hung out at Hooters when I was there .
So I know that I am not the most qualified person to take on this subject , but I do know that my president betrayed his country , and one of the reasons I am such a staunch patriot is that I have the right to post my feelings of betrayal on my blog , which is usually reserved for observations about the Hulk and half - baked attempts at erotic fiction .
And it is to both of those that I now return .
I also want to point out that I wrote this in about twenty minutes .
You should n’t be able to make a case for treason against the president in twenty minutes while waiting to play a video game at your buddy ’s house .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City risks losing more than 20,000 jobs in the high - paying financial sector over the next two years as the crisis in mortgage markets drives down Wall Street ’s profits , according to a report issued on Monday .

The city ’s Independent Budget Office , in its report , estimated that Wall Street ’s profits for 2007 will sink by more than 80 percent to the lowest level since 1994 .
Profits for 2007 are expected to total just $ 3.2 billion , down from $ 20.9 billion in 2006 , the report said .
Banks and brokerages account for almost 35 percent of all salaries and wages in New York City .
Fallout from investments in the risky subprime mortgage market has forced Wall Street banks to write - down more than $ 150 billion -- and more red ink is expected .
“ The economic situation is particularly precarious .
If the problems affecting Wall Street and housing worsen , the recession will be deeper and the fiscal pressures on the city will quickly mount , ” said Ronnie Lowenstein , director of the Independent Budget Office .
Lowenstein said the projections do not include any impact from the buyout of Bear Stearns & Co Inc by JPMorgan Chase .
JPMorgan agreed to buy Bear , which until recently had been the fifth - biggest Wall Street investment bank , after Bear collapsed 10 days ago because large subprime losses and failing confidence in the firm prompted a run on the bank .
Wall Street ’s profits in 2008 , however , are expected to double to $ 6.6 billion and rise again in 2009 to $ 12.2 billion , the agency said .
The bulk of Wall Street ’s job cuts , meanwhile , are expected to occur this year , with an estimated reduction of 12,600 , followed by 7,600 cuts next year , the report said .
Bear Stearns , whose work force of 14,000 includes about 8,000 employees in the city , is widely expected to make extensive job cuts .
CNBC , citing unnamed news sources , has said that JPMorgan expects to cut about half of Bear ’s total work force .
Cuts on Wall Street have a ripple effect , because each financial industry job can create two to three positions in other sectors , from legal to leisure .
Private employers may cut 8,000 jobs this year but still hire 9,100 other workers , the report said .
One gauge economists monitor shows that banks and brokers , whose salaries average more than $ 200,000 a year without counting bonuses , are already feeling the pinch .
Income tax refunds have soared so far this year , to more than double year - ago levels , as individuals who must pay quarterly estimated taxes overestimated how much they would owe , perhaps because they expected to at least match the previous year ’s income .
Typically , higher - income workers are the ones subject to paying estimated quarterly taxes .
Lowenstein said the forecasts assume a “ relatively brief and mild recession , ” and even that outcome would take a big bite out of revenues .
The report estimated that New York City ’s tax revenues could drop 2.6 percent this year to $ 36.5 billion , partly due to the downturn in the financial industry .
Tax revenues are forecast to drop a further 2.9 percent in 2009 , which would push the total down to $ 35.4 billion .
Such declines would be quite a turnaround .
In this century , New York City ’s tax revenues have fallen fell once , in 2002 , after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center intensified an existing downturn .
Meanwhile , New York City ’s real estate market has fended off much of the weakness seen around the nation , but the pace of deals has slowed .
Because office space should remain scarce until new buildings open in 2011 , landlords likely will be able to keep raising rents , the report said .
But apartment owners outside Manhattan , where interest by foreign buyers continues to support demand , could see prices soften .
One bright spot is the tourism industry , as New York City benefits from the weak dollar in drawing overseas visitors .
Legal Analysis : Boumediene v. Bush / Al Odah v. United States
In February 2002 , the Center for Constitutional Rights and our co-counsel brought the first habeas case in federal court on behalf of detainees held at Guantánamo .
Initially , the Bush Administration successfully argued that the detainees were in a legal black hole , without any right of access to the federal courts to challenge whether they were lawfully held .
Two years later , in Rasul v. Bush , the United States Supreme Court ruled that our clients ’ habeas cases could go forward under the federal habeas statute , but Congress attempted to overturn the decision with a series of laws , the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) in 2005 and the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) in 2006 , that amended the federal statute to eliminate habeas jurisdiction for any “ enemy combatant ” held in U.S. custody .
As a substitute for habeas review , the amendments created a much more limited review proceeding in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for individuals to challenge only the military ’s classification of them as “ enemy combatants . ”
CCR argued that the truncated DTA process fell fall short of habeas and could not correct the plethora of due process violations that occurred during the Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) at Guantánamo .
Today , the United States Supreme Court ruled that the part of the Military Commissions
Act that attempted to block the federal courts from hearing the claims of our clients at Guantánamo was unconstitutional .
In an historical decision , the Court unambiguously rejected the political branches ’ attempts to cut the federal courts out of the process .
In Boumediene v. Bush , the Court held that the Center ’s clients detained at Guantánamo have a constitutional right to file petitions for habeas corpus in U.S. federal court challenging the lawfulness of their detention .
With Justice Kennedy writing for the majority , the opinion begins with a lengthy survey of historical habeas cases in which common law courts considered cases of noncitizens imprisoned without trial .
Acknowledging the uniqueness of the Administration ’s practices at Guantánamo , the Court found that no historical habeas case offered by either side was directly on point and , instead , turned to the fundamental principles underlying the purpose of habeas corpus : to allow the courts to act as a check against the abuse of Executive power .
“ [ F ] rom an early date , it was understood that the King , too , was subject to the law . ”
The Court emphasized that the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution was designed by the Founders to “ protect against the cyclical abuses of the writ by the Executive and Legislative Branches . ”
It noted that the “ Framers view freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty . ”
And central to the protection of this liberty is the “ duty and authority of the Judiciary to call the jailer to account . ”
These separation - of - power principles guided the Court ’s reasoning throughout its opinion .
In considering the extraterritorial application of the Constitution to Guantánamo , the Court adopted a practical approach it has applied in past cases .
The Court strongly criticized the President and Congress ’s attempt to declare that because Guantánamo was outside the sovereign territory of the United States , the Constitution did not apply .
The Court firmly stated that “ To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they , not this Court , say ‘ what the law is . ’ ”
Several factors warranted application of the Suspension Clause to Guantánamo , including ( 1 ) that the petitioners are noncitizens who dispute their status as “ enemy combatants ” as determined by CSRTs in an unfair proceeding , ( 2 ) the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control over Guantánamo , with no other country ’s laws applying , and ( 3 ) no credible arguments exist that habeas proceedings would impede any military mission at Guantánamo .
The Court concluded that the individuals at Guantánamo have a right under the Suspension Clause to challenge their detention , and the pragmatic approach it took in reaching that conclusion still leaves space for similar challenges to U.S. detention facilities elsewhere in the world .
The Court then concluded that the DTA review was not an adequate substitute for a habeas petition .
Fundamentally , a habeas proceeding – and any substitute – must afford the petitioner an effective and meaningful ability to correct any errors in the decision under review ( here , the determination that the petitioner is an “ enemy combatant ” ) , an opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of the government ’s evidence , and the opportunity to present and have a court consider exculpatory evidence not considered by the tribunal below .
From the initial proceedings in pending DTA cases and the statute itself , the Court concluded that it failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas .
Specifically , the DTA statute fails to provide for release from custody as a remedy , offers no procedures for petitioners to present new , exculpatory evidence and to bring the full range of legal challenges available in a habeas proceeding .
As a result , the Court struck down that portion of the DTA that deprived the petitioners of their constitutional right to habeas .
Throughout the opinion , the Court heeded the Center ’s emphasis on the lengthy imprisonment of our clients without trial .
“ The gravity of the separation - of - powers issues raise by these cases and the fact that these detainees have been denied meaningful access to a judicial forum for a period of years render these cases exceptional . ”
The Court refused to countenance further delay of the merits of the detainees ’ challenges to their imprisonment .
Rather than wait for the Court of Appeals to rule on the lawfulness of the DTA proceedings or attempt to construe the DTA in a manner that rendered it constitutional , the Court brought much needed finality to this drawn - out struggle .
“ [ T ] he cost of delay can no longer be borne by those who are held in custody .
The detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing . ”
Two dissenting opinions written by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Scalia capture the viewpoints of the conservative wing of the Court that the prisoners at Guantánamo are not entitled to the writ of habeas corpus , and that the rights to which they are entitled are fully satisfied by the review mechanism Congress established in the DTA .
Chief Justice Roberts ’ dissent asserts that Congress has designed a system that protects “ whatever rights the detainees may possess , ” and that the Court should therefore not even be reviewing this case .
Repeating one of the military ’s favorite ( and inaccurate ) talking points , the Chief Justice began his dissent by saying “ [ t ] oday the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants . ”
Justice Scalia ’s dissent asserts further that “ aliens abroad ” are not entitled to the protection of the writ of habeas corpus , and never have been .
Going a step beyond the Chief Justice ’s dissent , Justice Scalia contends that the Suspension Clause has no relevance for the prisoners at Guantánamo , and thus the majority ’s intervention cannot be justified .
Notably , Scalia begins his dissent with a rare exploration of what he perceives to be the “ disastrous consequences ” of the majority ’s decision , including the astonishing assertion that “ It [ the majority opinion ] will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . ”
Justice Kennedy , the majority opinion ’s author , has a reputation for pragmatism that comes forth in today ’s opinion , which is rooted in a sound practical sense and firmly depoliticizes the legal questions raised by Guantánamo .
The decision today allows courts to do what they do best : to decide whether the government has the right to hold someone in detention , sorting out claims of factual innocence by weighing the evidence .
We hope that the lower courts will quickly move to hold hearings in the 200 - odd pending individual habeas corpus cases where detainees are challenging their indefinite detention without charges .
Already , today , the Chief Judge of the District Court for the District of Columbia has called for a meeting of the judges to determine how to proceed .
Numerous lawyers filed notices and motions today in pending habeas cases to move them forward immediately .
We anticipate that many of these cases will be decided swiftly because the government lacks any factual or legal basis for imprisoning the men .
Without today ’s decision these men might have remained in detention forever without ever having a real chance to argue for their release before an impartial court .
With habeas these men – so many of whom have been officially cleared for release by the military – would never have been locked up and abused because no court was watching .
We believe the majority of them will be released once the executive is forced to show up in front of a federal judge and justify their detention with hard evidence .
The decision ’s impact upon the pending military commission cases is indirect .
It is likely those trials will continue to progress at their current halting pace .
Today ’s opinion only means that the defendants in those commissions proceedings – less than 20 men are currently charged – may commence parallel proceedings arguing that they should not have ever been detained in the first place .
Other significant issues may be litigated as well : most detainees are being held in solitary confinement , including dozens who are cleared for release ; most are losing their minds as a result .
In habeas proceedings , petitioners should be able to argue for more humane conditions of confinement .
Many detainees are also cleared for release to countries where they may face torture ; these men are basically in the position of refugees and countries that can offer them asylum will have to be found before they can be released .
A significant issue for the habeas cases will also be challenges to the government ’s reliance upon information obtained through torture or unlawful coercion to justify the detentions .
Major General Jay Hood , former commander at Guantánamo , admitted to the Wall Street Journal that “ [ s ] ometimes we just did n't get the right folks , ” but innocents remain at the base because “ [ n] obody wants to be the one to sign the release papers .
... there 's no muscle in the system . ”
Historically , the federal courts have been that muscle .
Today ’s decision ensures that they will be .
Ultimately , the administration ’s strategy with Guantánamo was to run out the clock and leave its mess – much like the war in Iraq – to the next president to clean up .
Today ’s decision – a historic victory for Executive accountability to the courts – will , we hope , prevent this administration from doing so .
Financial speculators reap profits from global hunger
By Stefan Steinberg
24 April 2008
A series of reports in the international media have drawn attention to the role of professional speculators and hedge funds in driving up the price of basic commodities — in particular , foodstuffs .
The sharp increase in food prices in recent months has led to protests and riots in a number of countries across the globe .
On Tuesday , April 22 , a UN spokesperson referred to a “ silent tsunami ” that threatens to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger .
Josette Sheeran , executive director of the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) , noted : “ This is the new face of hunger — the millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago but now are . ”
A recent article in the British New Statesman magazine , entitled “ The Trading Frenzy That Sent Prices Soaring , ” notes that increases in global population and the switch to bio-fuels are important factors in the rise of food prices , but then declares :
“ These long - term factors are important , but they are not the real reasons why food prices have doubled or why India is rationing rice , or why British farmers are killing pigs for which they ca n’t afford feedstocks .
It ’s the credit crisis . ”
The article states that the food crisis has developed over “ an incredibly short space of time — essentially over the past 18 months . ”
It continues : “ The reason for food ‘ shortages ’ is speculation in commodity futures following the collapse of the financial derivatives markets .
Desperate for quick returns , dealers are taking trillions of dollars out of equities and mortgage bonds and ploughing them into food and raw materials .
It ’s called the ‘ commodities super - cycle ’ on Wall Street , and it is likely to cause starvation on an epic scale . ”
World prices for basic commodities such as cereals , cooking oil and milk have risen steadily since 2000 , but have escalated dramatically since the developing financial crisis in the US began to bite in 2006 .
Since the start of 2006 , the average world price for rice has risen by 217 percent , wheat by 136 percent , corn by 125 percent and soybeans by 107 percent .
Under conditions of growing debt defaults arising from the US subprime crisis , speculators and hedge fund groups have increasingly switched their investments from high - risk “ bundled ” securities into so - called “ stores of value , ” which include gold and oil at one end of the spectrum and “ soft commodities ” such as corn , cocoa and cattle at the other .
The article in the New Statesman points out that “ speculators are even placing bets on water prices ” and then concludes :
“ Just like the boom in house prices , commodity price inflation feeds on itself .
The more prices rise , and big profits are made , the more others invest , hoping for big returns .
Look at the financial web sites : everyone and their mother is piling into commodities ....
The trouble is that if you are one of the 2.8 billion people , almost half the world ’s population , who live on less than $ 2 a day , you may pay for these profits with your life . ”
Investment in “ soft commodities ” is currently highly recommended by leading market analysts .
According to Patrick Armstrong , a manager at Insight Investment Management in London , “ Raw materials can prove to be the best investment class for hedge funds because the market is so inefficient .
This results in more chances for profit . ”
Much of the international speculation in food commodities takes place on the Chicago Stock Exchange ( CHX ) , where a number of hedge funds , investment banks and pension funds have substantially increased their activities in the past two years .
Since January of this year alone , investment activity in the agricultural sector has risen by a quarter at the CHX , and , according to the Chicago firm Cole Partners , involvement by hedge funds in the raw material sector has trebled in the past two years to reach a total of $ 55 billion .
Large - scale investors such as hedge and pension funds buy futures — shares in basic goods and foodstuffs to be delivered at a fixed date in the future .
When the price of the commodity rises significantly between the time of the investment and the time of delivery , the investor is able to take home a large profit .
In light of the current food crisis , substantial returns of profit are guaranteed .
According to CHX figures , wheat futures ( for delivery in December ) are expected to rise by at least 73 percent , soybeans by 52 percent , and soy oil by 44 percent .
Major ecological disasters , such as the recent drought in Australia , which hit food production and drive up basic commodity prices , are good news for the corporate investor .
Substantially reduced harvests in Australia and Canada this year have led to soaring wheat prices .
Deutsche Bank has estimated that the price for corn will double , while the price for wheat will rise by 80 percent in the short term .
Such ecological disasters , which can ruin ordinary farmers and mean poverty for millions through increased food prices , are an aspect of the “ inefficiency ” of the raw materials market referred to above , which currently makes “ soft commodities ” such an attractive prospect for major speculators .
An article headlined “ Deadly Greed ” in the current edition of the German weekly Der Spiegel gives some details of the activities of hedge funds in food market speculation .
The magazine cites the example of the hedge fund Ospraie , which is generally regarded as the biggest of the management funds currently dealing in basic foodstuffs .
The manager of the fund , Dwight Anderson , is nicknamed “ the raw materials king . ”
Already , in the summer of 2006 , Anderson was recommending the “ extraordinary profitability ” of agricultural crops to his shareholders .
While Ospraie is reluctant to publicise its profit levels from speculation in basic commodities , a leading German investor is less reticent .
Andreas Grünewald started up his Münchner Investment Club ( MIC ) in 1989 with seed capital equal to just € 15,000 .
MIC now controls a volume of € 50 million , of which € 15 million is from investment in raw materials .
According to Grünewald , “ Raw materials are the mega - trend of the decade , ” and his company intends to intensify its involvement in both water and agricultural stocks .
MIC investment in wheat alone has already yielded profit levels of 93 percent for the 2,500 members of the club .
The Spiegel article points out that MIC and its members give little thought to the catastrophic consequences of their speculative investment policy for undeveloped countries .
“ Most of our members are rather passive and orientated to profit , ” Grünewald notes .
MIC , with its € 50 million , is a minor player compared to the finance giant ABN Amro , which recently acquired a unique certificate allowing it to speculate on behalf of smaller investors on the CHX .
In the wake of the hunger revolts that took place a few weeks ago , ABN Amro put out a prospectus noting that India has enforced a ban on exports of rice , which , together with poor harvests in a number of countries , has led to a worldwide decline in rice reserves .
“ Now , ” ABN Amro notes in its prospectus , “ it is possible for the first time to have a share in the number one foodstuff in Asia . ”
According to the Spiegel report , those responding to the ABN Amro appeal were able to realise a 20 percent rate of profit in the space of three weeks — a period that saw a huge increase in investment in rice in Chicago and other major centres .
Another particularly lucrative investment sector contributing substantially to the current global food crisis is biofuels .
Initially championed as a means of protecting the environment , biofuels have become increasingly identified by big business as a profitable alternative to increasingly expensive oil .
Within the space of a few years , biofuel has become a booming private industry capable of generating large rates of profit .
Huge tracts of land across the planet have in recent years been switched from food crops to the production of ethanol or biofuel , aimed primarily as a supplement to oil - based gasoline .
Next year , the use of US corn for ethanol is forecast to rise to 114 million tonnes — nearly a third of the entire projected US crop .
In the words of Jean Ziegler , the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to food , the switch to biofuels at the expense of traditional forms of agriculture is nothing less than a “ crime against humanity . ”
Although maize production worldwide is growing , the increase is being more than absorbed by biofuel diversification .
According to the World Bank , global maize production increased by 51 million tonnes between 2004 and 2007 .
During that time , biofuel production in the US alone ( mostly ethanol ) rose by 50 million tonnes , absorbing almost the entire global increase .
Subsidised by the US government , American farmers have diverted fully 30 percent of corn production into the ethanol scheme , driving up the cost of other , more expensive , grains that are being bought as substitutes for animal feed .
The European Union , India , Brazil and China all have their own targets to increase biofuels .
The EU has declared that by 2010 , 5.75 percent of all gasoline sold to motorists in Europe must stem from biofuel production .
This month , a UK law enforced a mandatory mix of 2.5 percent biofuel in gasoline sold to motorists .
A similar law stipulating a staggered 10 percent increase in biofuel share in gasoline was recently struck down in Germany following opposition from the auto industry , as well as ordinary car owners who would be forced to buy new cars to accommodate the new fuel .
In addition to the rapidly rising price of basic commodities as a result of the decreased production of grains for food purposes , the switch to crop production of biofuels has served to orient food prices to the high price of fuel .
An equivalence is emerging between the price of food and the price of oil .
According to Josette Sheeran of the World Food Programme : “ We are seeing food in many places in the world priced at fuel levels , ” with increasing quantities of food “ being bought by energy markets ” for biofuels .
With oil topping $ 100 a barrel , the biofuel sector is currently regarded as a potential source of huge returns for investors .
The drive for maximum profits by the biofuels sector was summed up in the advertisement for a congress held in 2006 , which declared :
“ Biofuels Finance and Investment World is Europe ’s definitive investor congress focusing exclusively on the value chain evolving around the new biofuels economy .
Investors and financial institutions will gather with key industry stakeholders to discuss future investment opportunities , the risks and areas with huge potential for profit . ”
The April 22 edition of Money Week recommends that investors stung by the subprime crisis switch their funds to the lucrative biofuels market .
Money
Week sides with Fortune magazine in identifying the oil multinational Royal Dutch Shell group as a guarantor of good returns : “ We love it because it makes huge profits and is very cheap , but apparently it also has a large stake in Iogen , a Canadian firm with an exciting - sounding ‘ potential breakthrough in ethanol technology . ’ ”
In a news conference early this week in a gloomy Rose Garden , President Bush argued the main reason gasoline prices were so high was a lack of domestic oil production .
While his silly assertion was widely disputed by reputable sources on NPR , his claim got me to thinking , “ what exactly was his stance on energy before he was elected ? ”
So , I took a peek back at his campaign ’s energy vision from the year 2000 :
“ The Bush campaign supports a comprehensive energy reform bill which includes initiatives for energy conserving technologies as well as decreasing the foreign dependence on oil through increased domestic production and the use of non-fossil fuel based energy production methods . ”
Non-fossil fuel based energy production sources ?
That means no oil and coal , right ?
Of course it does .
So pretty good for solar and wind power advocates , right ?
Well , it ’s been 8 years since that proclamation was made .
Let ’s take a look at the United States total percentage of solar equipment production compared to the rest of the world three years before he got into office ( From the NYTimes , I created the nifty figures ) :
As you can see above , in 1997 , the United States produced about 40 % of the entire world ’s solar energy equipment .
Now , take a look at where we are in relation to the rest of the world in 2007 :
Whoa !
From 40 % to 8 % !
Wha’ happened ?
I ’ll tell you what happened .
Nothing .
No incentives were put in place to foster a nascent industry here .
In that time period , Bush failed to lead and congress has been unable to agree to any legislation to make renewable energy incentives last longer than 2 years .
TWO YEARS .
Take a look at how our incentive timeframes compare to Germany and Japan :
In fact , solar and wind incentives were eliminated altogether from the 2009 energy package .
Who still gets incentives ?
Oil and coal companies .
This is completely reprehensible .
Now , Germany is the leader in solar technology and is poised to continue to dominate the rest of the world in production of renewable energy .
Meanwhile , domestic companies , full of really bright people who are making great headway in developing more efficient solar cells are looking to manufacture equipment not in Ohio , Indiana , or North Carolina .
Where ?
Right .
Germany .
First Solar is an extremely well financed company that is profitable and is about to open up a huge production facility there .
540 jobs .
Straight to strengthen the Euro against the dollar .
Check out First Solar ’s stock performance over the past year since its IPO :
Not too shabby , right ?
Yeah that ’s a 1080.23 % return over a year and a half .
Maybe by the time you finish reading this , a cup of coffee in Germany may cost you $ 6 instead of $ 4 .
Now , in a way , these figures are n’t that surprising to me .
Why ?
Well , Bush is linked to his father , his father linked to Reagan , who ripped the solar panels off the White House that Jimmy Carter installed .
Ah , Jimmy Carter .
The last “ bad presidency ” .
This reddit.com comment by JohnStanier
I thought did him a little bit of justice he deserves ( However , he ’s not winning points with me in regards to the Palestinian / Israel situation ) :
“ He got dealt a bad hand .
The taking of the hostages was n’t his fault , it was blowback .
And that they were released the day Reagan was inaugurated is a pretty huge coincidence , especially considering Reagan had a former CIA head as his running mate .
Also , the oil crisis hit during his presidency .
He probably would have rolled with the hostage situation , but having gas lines and price controls and asking people to voluntarily use less energy ?
That did him in .
American people are selfish .
( Hey , I ’m American , I ’m not that much better than my peers ) .
And then stagflation , which I think is the result of earlier Keynsian policies , hit .
Ouch .
Add onto that , Carter was a true Washington outsider , and was n’t liked in the Congress , and you have the makings of a “ bad presidency . ”
I do n’t think he was that bad , but then again , I ’m not like most Americans that expect more , more and more from the government , instead of having to potentially make a sacrifice . ”
I did a bit more digging and found a speech Carter gave I felt was a little unnerving , foretelling , and well worded : April 18 , 1977 .
Since it was given over three decades ago , when many of the reporters in Bush ’s White House were still playing with toy tanks , I can understand why many seem oblivious to it .
However , this speech established the strategic petroleum reserve , gave birth to the modern solar power industry , led to the insulation of millions of American homes , and established America ’s first national energy policy .
I excerpted some pieces from it that I urge all of you beseech the next administration carefully consider .
We ’ve been regressing for quite some time now :
“ With the exception of preventing war , this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes .
It is a problem we will not solve in the next few years , and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century .
We must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren .
We simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources .
By acting now , we can control our future instead of letting the future control us …
The most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe .
Further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation .
[ This is t]he ‘ moral equivalent of war ’ — except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy .
We can be sure that all the special interest groups in the country will attack the part of this plan that affects them directly .
They will say that sacrifice is fine , as long as other people do it , but that their sacrifice is unreasonable , or unfair , or harmful to the country .
If they succeed , then the burden on the ordinary citizen , who is not organized into an interest group , would be crushing .
There should be only one test for this program : whether it will help our country . ”
Kind of strange to think that speech was given so long ago and yet we ’re still crippled by those issues Carter warns of , huh ?
By the way , those are the same special interest groups that removed our solar incentives from the 2009 energy bill .
When amortized over the life of a typical mortgage , installing solar power in a house in most parts of the US is cheaper than drawing power from the grid .
Meanwhile , most of us sit idly by while we ’ve enacted an energy bill that includes billions of dollars in welfare payments to oil businesses who continually shatter profit records on an annual basis .
While we struggle to pay for gasoline , this administration has passed vehicle emissions standards that barely reach 35 mpg while there is technology out there that can easily increase mpg past 100 .
Whoever the new president is , please help us consider that we can do better .
GIS : Tool or Science ?
This paper appears in
The Annals of the Association of American Geographers , 87 ( 2 ) : 346-362 , 1997 .
Dawn J. Wright , Michael F. Goodchild , and James D. Proctor Demystifying the Persistent Ambiguity of
GIS as " Tool " Versus " Science "
Abstract
Is GIS a tool or a science ?
The question is clearly important in the day - to - day operations of geography departments that need to distinguish between GIS as a tool to be taught at the undergraduate level , or a science and thus a legitimate research specialty of faculty and graduate students .
We summarize a debate on this which occurred on the GIS -L electronic listserver in late 1993 .
In evaluating this discussion it became clear that GIS could be understood not by the two distinct positions taken by the GIS - L discussants but as three positions along a continuum from tool to science , focusing on the several meanings attached to " doing GIS " rather than to GIS alone .
These are : 1 ) GIS as tool , involving the use of a particular class of software , associated hardware tools , and digital geographic data in order to advance some specific purpose ; 2 ) GIS as toolmaking , involving the advancement of the tool 's capability and ease of use ; and 3 ) the science of GIS , concerning the analysis of the fundamental issues raised by the use of GIS .
Recognizing the importance of understanding what is meant by " doing science , " as well as what is meant by " doing GIS , " we conclude that only one position , " the science of GIS , " is found to provide a sufficient condition for science .
The debate is certainly problematic in light of the variety of perspectives on science and on GIS .
The persistence of the issue suggests , however , that the GIS community should continue to work toward a resolution .
Key Words : GIS -L , nature and philosophy of science , nature of geographic information systems , geographic information science , geographic thought .
Introduction
The purpose here is not to review the various positions on GIS , which range from the view of GIS as the savior putting the " geographic Humpty Dumpty " back together again ( Openshaw 1991 ) to dismissal as " non-intellectual expertise " ( Jordan 1988 ) ; from excitement over positivism 's second coming ( Heywood 1990 ) to the characterization of GIS as a last - ditch rally by its battered survivors ( Taylor 1990 ) .
More interesting are the social implications of GIS - the messages it sends , who it empowers , and the responsibility its developers should bear for its eventual use ( Smith 1992 ; Pickles 1994 ; Harvey and Chrisman in press ) .
In the U.K. , these debates within the discipline have caught the attention of even so authoritative a source as the Times Higher Education Supplement ( Davies 1995 ) .
At heart , these debates arise out of the ambiguity of GIS as a tool and GIS as science .
While Tomlinson was clear enough in his definition of a GIS as a computer application designed to perform certain specific functions ( Coppock and Rhind 1991 ) , it is not at all clear what is meant by " doing GIS , " " the GIS community , " or " GIS research , " since in all these cases the etymological path between acronym and phrase has become hopelessly muddied .
At face value , " doing GIS " seems to imply nothing more than interacting with a particular class of software ; " the GIS community " is no more than a group of individuals with an intense interest in that software ; and " GIS research " seems an oxymoron .
By examining the tension between GIS as a tool and GIS as a science , a tension that ultimately defines what it means to be " doing GIS " in geography , we hope to shed some light on these issues .
These questions are clearly important in the day - to - day operations of geography departments .
Departments need to know if GIS is a tool that should be taught at the undergraduate level , or a science and thus a legitimate research specialty of faculty and graduate students .
Are students who " do GIS " doing substantive science ?
Is an association with GIS sufficient to ensure that research is substantive , or if not , what other conditions are necessary ?
Much of the motivation for this paper derives from a debate which occurred on the GIS -L electronic list server in late 1993 .
These electronic lists or " invisible colleges " ( Crane 1972 ) as it were , span the barriers between disciplines .
Since its inception GIS-L has provided a forum for a variety of discussions of GIS issues ( Mark and Zubrow 1993 ; Thoen 1996 ) .
During the months of October and November 1993 , the topic " GIS as a Science " generated 64 postings from 40 individuals in 8 states and 6 countries ( Figure 1 ) .
The unusual length and intensity of the discussion made it clear that the " tool versus science " debate sparked great interest among many scientists , technicians , and practitioners , whatever their discipline .
One of the objectives of this paper is to explore the relationship between this electronic debate and current debates within the discipline of geography .
The " tool versus science " debate has received little mention in the published literature of geography , all of which is surprising given the attention given to in the past decade .
The closest the literature comes to the debate is in Goodchild 's ( 1992 ) paper on " geographic information science , " Sui's ( 1994 ) discussion on reconciling the differences between GIS enthusiasts and critics , and the articles on " Automated Geography " appearing in The Professional Geographer in 1993 , a series of reflections on developments in the ten years since Dobson ( 1983 ) announced that advances in analytical methods and computer technology had made it possible to automate several aspects of geographical research and problem - solving .
In the discussion that follows , the electronic debate on GIS - L serves as the point of departure for an exploration of " doing GIS " from the perspectives of both geography and the society in which the discipline is embedded .
The paper frames the tension between " GIS as a tool " and " GIS as a science , " summarizes the GIS - L debate , considers the implications of the debate , explores the positions adopted , and finally , proposes a solution and discusses its implications for the profession .
One note on terminology is necessary .
The term " geographic information science " has appeared with increasing frequency in the geographic literature , as noted above in Goodchild 's ( 1992 ) study , as well as in several others ( e.g. , Rhind et al .
1991 ; Rhind 1992 ; Abler 1993 ; Cromley 1993 ; Dobson 1993 ; Fedra 1993 ) .
GIS has done much to remove the traditional isolation between the fields of photogrammetry , remote sensing , geodesy , cartography , surveying , geography , computer science , spatial statistics , and other disciplines with interests in the generic issues of spatial data .
Goodchild ( 1992 ) argued that these are the disciplines of geographic information science , and that it made more sense for the research community to decode the GIS acronym in this way .
However , in this paper every reference to the GIS acronym is to " system " not to " science . "
The GIS - L Debate
Documenting Electronic Discussions
Scholarly interaction is being revolutionized by the Internet applications of electronic mail , discussion lists , the World Wide Web , electronic journals , and digital libraries ( for an analysis of the Internet 's impact on oceanography , see Hess et al. 1993 ; and likewise on traditional journals , see Odlyzko 1995 ) .
Subscribers to an electronic list such as GIS - L reach hundreds of colleagues around the world to discuss an issue or ask a question , thereby crossing all of the traditional structures of the research community within minutes ( save perhaps structures based on language ) .
While it is impossible to determine exactly how many individuals read GIS -L and with what level of interest , Mark and Zubrow ( 1993 ) reported that at the time of their analysis the list contained approximately 1100 individual Internet addresses and was redistributed to over 30 additional lists worldwide .
Once registered as a subscriber to an unmoderated electronic discussion list , any individual with an Internet address automatically receives all messages posted by any other subscriber .
The essential informality of this system of communication is both a blessing and a source of difficulty to anyone attempting to synthesize discussion .
Many of the discussants do not have the time , the inclination , or perhaps the energy to research the
positions they adopt on such topics as , in our case , philosophies of science , geographic methodology , or the interplay between science and technology .
Electronic comments posted to a discussion list are not as carefully thought out as writings in the scientific
literature .
A written synthesis is thus perhaps more akin to the proceedings of a workshop , in which useful ideas are expressed but not yet consolidated or put into perspective .
Another challenge is how best to present the discussion ; in other words , how to properly cite communication from an electronic conference .
As on - line newspapers , journals , libraries , and data archives become more prevalent on the " information superhighway , " and it becomes necessary to refer to information that may exist only in electronic form , formal methods of citation will have to emerge that are as robust and persistent as conventional methods .
The use of Universal Resource Locators ( URLs , the electronic World Wide Web addresses that commonly begin with " http : / / " ) to cite information available through the World Wide Web is already causing problems
with " broken URLs , " which occur whenever information is deleted or moved from its existing site , or the name of a server or its file structure is changed .
Until better methods are devised , material posted on electronic discussion lists and bulletin boards is
essentially in the realm of " personal communication . "
However , unlike verbal communication , electronic mail provides a more or less permanent record of communication and is precisely quotable .
The approach taken in this paper is to follow the electronic citation style of Li and Crane ( 1993 ) .
A final issue is that of confidentiality .
For this study , all participants in the GIS - L discussion were notified of our intent to present and synthesize their comments in a published manuscript , and given the option of having quotations and references to their comments removed .
Before the manuscript was submitted for publication , participants were sent a draft version for review and comment .
It should be noted that the views expressed by GIS - L discussants do not necessarily reflect the views of their institutions or organizations .
Summary of the GIS - L Discussion
Many of those who argued on the " tool side " of the issue ( Table 1 ) could not see how a computer application could be described as a science ( e.g. , McCauley 1993 ; Moll 1993 ; Skelly 1993a and 1993 b ) .
They saw GIS as a tool or technique in the same sense that Curran ( 1987 ) defines remote sensing as a technique .
From this perspective , GIS on its own is meaningless ; it gains meaning only by its goals , which generally involve the application of knowledge by scientists , but not science itself ( Table 1 ; McCauley 1993 ; Moll 1993 ; Skelly 1993 b ) .
In the GIS - L discussion , those who defined GIS as a tool did so in the sense of a physical entity and also as a technique ( Table 1 ; Crepeau , 1993a ; Feldman 1993 b ; Halls 1993 ; Moll 1993 ) .
Viewed in this way , GIS may belong more to the field of engineering than to science ( Table 1 ; Feldman 1993d ; Skelly 1993c and 1993d ) .
Discussants identified engineering as a problem - solving activity , while science was linked to discovery and problem understanding ( Table 1 ; Al - Taha 1993 ) .
That said , the boundaries between the two are often muddied , particularly at the level of basic research where engineers may use scientific methods to identify and understand the problems they will eventually attempt to solve ( Table 1 ; Al - Taha 1993 ) .
Some on the " tool side " of the issue ( Table 1 ) seemed to feel that if GIS had any scientific aspect , it derived from GIS 's place within the discipline of geography ( Crepeau 1993a ; Feldman 1993 c ; Halls 1993 ) .
GIS is thus a tool applied when going about the business of geographic science ( Table 1 ; Halls 1993 ) .
If " doing geography " is a science , then " doing GIS " amounts to a science ( on the " geography as science " issue , see Couclelis and Golledge 1983 , Hart 1982 , Johnston 1979 and 1986 , Smith 1992 , and Unwin 1992 ) .
Those on the " science side " of the GIS - L discussion ( Table 1 ) spoke mainly about the use of GIS as a method or body of knowledge for developing and testing spatial theories ( Brenner 1993 ; Laffey 1993 ; Sandhu 1993 b ; Wright 1993a ) , not about the physical entity GIS itself .
While they agreed that the " toolbox " view of GIS was accurate , it was at the same time very limiting ( see Table 1 ; Bartlett 1993 b ; Sandhu 1993a ; Wright 1993 b ) .
As important as are the hardware / software components of GIS , it is the conceptual elements of GIS ( e.g. , the rules governing the creation of spatial models for GIS , the measurement and modeling of error propagation through a GIS , or proofs of theorems on data structures ) that enable GIS to claim a place as a science ( see Table 1 ; Bartlett 1993a ; Carlson 1993a ; Wright 1993 b ) .
Some discussants raised more fundamental questions : " what exactly is science ? " and " what specifically allows us to call GIS a science ? " ( see Table 1 ; Feldman 1993 c ; Piou 1993 ) .
Although no simple consensus on science emerged , discussants accented the conceptual elements mentioned above , along with activities such as " obtaining theoretical knowledge to form the design of a model , " " developing theory on entities such as time and spatial phenomena , " and " developing algorithms to test a theory . "
These were thought to be parts of the scientific enterprise ( see Table 1 ; Crepeau 1993a ; Sandhu 1993a ; Wright 1993b ) , and hence a possible basis for testing the scientific status of a given activity .
There was also a distinction made between " formal science " ( purely abstract thought , as in mathematics ) and " substantive science " ( phenomena that exist outside of thought ) ( see Table 1 ; Feldman 1993c ) .
Accordingly , one must consider the implications of his or her definition of science so as not to arbitrarily exclude or delegitimize certain reasonable forms of knowledge ( see Table 1 ; Feldman 1993a ; 1993 c ; 1993d ) .
These attempts at defining science naturally led to the question of whether GIS is significantly distinct from sciences such as computer science or geography .
In other words , if GIS is a science in some respects , is it a science unto itself , with its own unique , logically coherent object of knowledge ?
( see Table 1 ; Carlson 1993 b ; Feldman 1993d ; Skelly 1993d ) Hence Dobson 's ( 1993 ) query : " Is GIS prompting a scientific revolution ?
The most severe test would be whether there are hypotheses and theories that can only be conceived and tested through GIS . "
GIS is special in that it is uniquely visual and able to make explicit the implicit features of data .
However , those on the " science " side or in the middle of the GIS - L discussion ( Table 1 ) did not seem to require a separate body of knowledge for GIS .
Instead , they viewed the science of GIS as a subdiscipline of geography or computer science ( the way that biogeography or geomorphology are sciences within the larger field of geography , or paleontology is a science within the broader field of geology ) ( see Table 1 ; Bartlett 1993a ; Calef 1993 ; Wright 1993 b ) .
Discussants voiced strong agreement that the connections between GIS and the science of geography are the strongest , and that GIS is not merely a subset of computer science ( see Table 1 ; Bartlett 1993a ; Wright 1993 b ) .
It was pointed out that many of GIS 's early pioneers were geographers ( e.g. , Coppock , Rhind , Bickmore , and Unwin in Britain ; Tomlinson , Garrison , Berry , Tobler , and Marble in North America ; Bartlett 1993 b ) and that geographers more than anyone else actually identified , conceptualized , and formalized the initial connections between spatial concepts and computer technology ( see Table 1 , Bartlett 1993 b ) .
Putting the Debate Into Perspective : Definitions of Science
A lengthy foray into the philosophy and sociology of science is beyond the scope of this paper , but some consideration of these matters is unavoidable in order to know what scientists do , the significance of what they do , and the relationship of science to other knowledge - generating mechanisms .
There is one caveat at the outset : there are probably as many definitions and viewpoints of science as there are scientists ( Feibleman 1972 ) , and not all of these are necessarily correct !
A concise definition of science cannot hope to capture the full meaning of the term .
Science encompasses a wide range of fields that differ widely from each other in philosophy , knowledge content , and methodology .
The term " science " may be viewed as a shorthand for a logical and systematic approach to problems that seeks generalizable answers .
This is the position taken by Robinson et al. ( 1984 ) in describing how cartography employs " the scientific method " in constructing its products .
Given Robinson et al .'s emphasis on logic , most computer applications would pass the test of being " scientific , " though it leaves unanswered the question of whether " doing cartography " is " doing science . "
Nonetheless , many participants in the GIS - L debate were probably unaware of the finer shades of meaning conveyed by the term " science , " or that many users of GIS might think of themselves as " scientists " in the unqualified sense of that term .
Depending on one 's inclination , there are several different approaches to science , each with its own ontology , epistemology , and methodology .
These so - called " - isms " are defined variously by geographers .
For instance , Johnston ( 1986 ) uses the terms " positivism , " " humanism , " and " structuralism " to describe human geography 's three main scientific approaches ; Haines - Young and Petch ( 1986 ) accent " empiricism , " " positivism , " " relativism , " and " critical rationalism , " and Cloke et al. ( 1991 ) focus on " Marxism , " " humanism , " " structuration theory , " " realism , " and " post- modernism . "
Thus to ask the simple question , " Is GIS a science ? , " is usually to presume the superiority of one or another approach to generating knowledge .
For example , the GIS - L discussion pointed out that the concept of " basic laws " is part of science only in the positivist approach , not necessarily in approaches such as realism or humanism ( Feldman 1993 b and 1993d ) .
Many argue that the positivist approach is privileged with regard to GIS ( Heywood 1990 ; Taylor 1990 ; Smith 1992 ; Lake 1993 ; Shepherd 1993 ) .
However , Goodchild ( 1994 ) sees in the growing literature on the epistemology of GIS ( e.g. , Pickles 1991 ; Wellar et al. 1994 ) the entire spectrum of approaches , from the positivist to the post - modernist .
If in the past certain approaches to science have been preferred in GIS , GIS need not preclude other approaches in the future .
If aspects of GIS are to be considered as " science , " according to what philosophical approach are they scientific ?
This issue was raised briefly in the GIS - L discussion ( see Table 1 ; Feldman 1993b ; 1993c ) , but it was not examined in detail .
In the long - standing debates that have occurred in geography over the appropriateness of different approaches , " positivism " and the " critical rationalism " of Karl Popper ( Popper 1959 ) are conventionally associated with " science " ( Haines - Young and Petch 1986 ; Johnston 1986 ) .
However , the rigorous collection and evaluation of data in the production of knowledge are not exclusive to positivism or critical rationalism ( e.g. , Keat and Urry 1975 ; Johnston 1986 ; Sayer 1992 ) .
It is not our wish to downplay the explanatory power of these alternative , non-positivistic approaches ; indeed various philosophies of science have succeeded at undermining positivism 's claims to being a superior method for understanding the world ( e.g. , Willer and Willer 1973 ; Hindess 1977 ; Couclelis and Golledge 1983 ; Sheppard 1993 ) .
Why Does Science Matter ?
Why should one care whether GIS is a science or not ?
The technological ( toolbox ) face of GIS is widely successful in government , business , and education , and it appears to have affected and improved the lives of far more people than have many theoretical advances ( e.g. , the theories of spatial data and of data structures , data models , and algorithms ) .
Technology in general has the potential to contribute greatly to society and culture .
However , science is often held in high regard , and labeling a field as a science may sometimes help to ensure it a place in the academy or to secure it greater funding and prestige .
" Science " is often used as a generic synonym for " research , " particularly research of a basic , systematic , and generalizable kind .
Thus " science " often functions as a rather crude but convenient shorthand for academic legitimacy ; if " doing GIS " is " doing science " then its claim to a place in the academy , as a topic of research and graduate - level instruction , is clearly strengthened .
In the GIS - L discussion , some implied ( Table 1 ; Groom 1993 ; Petican 1993 ) that those arguing for " GIS as science " might be driven by ulterior motives .
Some participants warned of having too high a regard for science , especially in believing that it provides the " truth " ( Table 1 ) .
In the opinion of these correspondents , science does indeed greatly influence our everyday lives and our ideas about the world , but does it deserve special reverence ?
Is there something special about science and the contributions it has made ?
One must strike a balance between debunking science and dragging it off its pedestal , on the one hand , and falling into scientism ( the claim that the scientific method is the only true method of obtaining knowledge ) on the other .
The point has already been made eloquently by Bauer ( 1992 : 144 ) :
That science does not have all the answers does not mean that it has no answers .
That science now has inadequate answers in some areas does not mean that the answers will not become adequate in the future ; in fact , history teaches that science 's answers become better and better as time goes by .
That science is fallible does not mean that science is entirely fallible or that it is as fallible as such other modes of human knowledge and belief as folklore , religion , political ideology , or social science .
That science has no answers in some matters -- such as the value of human life or the purpose of living -- does not mean that it has no answers in other areas -- those areas that are within its purviews , matters of forces and substances and natural phenomena .
And that science has no direct answers on matters of human purpose does not mean that its answers on other matters have no bearing on how , and how well , we are able to think about human purpose , free will , and other such things .
Clearly it does matter whether or not " doing GIS " is " doing science , " if for no other reason than " doing science " is often considered a code - phrase for academic legitimacy .
We will now argue that " doing GIS " may express at least three meanings that are represented by three positions .
Our strategy , therefore , is to examine the role and legitimacy of each of these four positions within the academy in general and within the discipline of geography in particular .
Three Positions on GIS
In synthesizing the general themes of the GIS - L discussion it became clear to us that GIS could be understood not by the two distinct positions taken by the GIS - L discussants but as three positions along a continuum from tool to science , focusing on the several meanings attached to " doing GIS " rather than to GIS alone .
These are : 1 ) GIS as tool ; 2 ) GIS as toolmaking ; and 3 ) the science of GIS .
It seems clear from the GIS -L discussion that the label " GIS " is simplistic , since it fails to indicate by itself whether the topic involves fundamental scientific questions and hypotheses , or whether it merely adds gloss to the research through the use of an admittedly complex and sophisticated tool -- whether it decodes as " science " or " system . "
We have derived three positions on GIS from the GIS - L discussion because what is probably needed to fully describe the entity " GIS " is a qualitative shift from bureaucratic , " black - and - white " boxes of description to " fuzzy " continua , where it is explicitly recognized that labels are not perfect .
Although these three positions do not capture all of the nuances of argument made during the GIS - L debate , they do represent three major points along a " tool - science " continuum .
The " GIS is a tool " position sees GIS as the use of a particular class of software , the associated hardware tools such as digitizers and plotters , and digital geographic data in order to advance some specific purpose .
The tool itself is inherently neutral , its development and availability being largely independent of its use which is driven by application .
The " toolmaking " position sees GIS in an academic setting as concerned with advancing the tool 's capabilities and ease of use .
Besides using the tool , toolmakers are likely to promote the adoption of GIS , play a role in educating its users , and work to ensure its responsible use .
Finally , the " science of GIS " position insists on a more intimate and reciprocal connection between tool and science , involving research on a set of basic problems , each of which probably existed prior to the development of GIS , but whose solution is more pressing now because of the technology .
This practice of collecting sets of basic problems under new names has a long history in science .
It occurred , for example , with the emergence of computer science , when the development of computing technology provided the impetus for solving certain fundamental research problems that had previously been associated with mathematics .
Discussion of the Three Positions on GIS
GIS is a Tool
For those who take this position , " doing GIS " amounts to making use of a tool to advance the investigation of a problem .
If the investigation merits the label " research , " then " doing GIS " is probably " doing science " as well .
However , the existence and use of the tool are separable from the substantive problem .
The documentation and write - up of the research tend to focus on the substantive problem , and indeed the tool may not be mentioned at all .
In some cases , GIS may be only one of a number of tools used , each of which has been selected strictly for its efficacy in the research project .
In these cases the tools do not drive the research .
If the research objectives are to some degree " methodological , " then the rules of engagement with tools such as GIS may be somewhat different , as may the content of the paper documenting the research .
In these cases , the tool may assume a greater role in directing the research , and hence be given greater prominence in documentation , and case studies may be used to illustrate the technique rather than to provide generalizable empirical results .
In papers of this sort , phrases such as " The use of GIS in ... " may appear in the paper 's title , although the processes responsible for the tool 's development are independent of the substantive research problem .
Because their primary motivation is to advocate the use of the tool , methodological demonstrations of GIS are more appropriately included under the second position discussed in the next section .
Scientists use many types of tools in their research .
Some such as the typewriter or telephone are generic in nature , with no particular association with any discipline .
Others are developed strictly for one discipline , or even for one project or for one group of scientists .
GIS falls somewhere in the middle , being of interest , in principle , to any discipline dealing with the distribution of phenomena on the surface of the Earth .
It seems neither a generic tool whose use is so ubiquitous that one can reasonably assume universal familiarity ( word processor , calculator ) , nor the exclusive tool of a single discipline .
Perhaps a useful analogy is the tool of statistics which in some disciplines ( e.g. , agronomy ) is close to universal , while in others ( e.g. , anthropology ) usage is mixed and its value is the subject of continuous debate .
For these less - than - universal tools , the academy traditionally provides the necessary infrastructure in the form of technical courses and technical support .
But in addition the academy satisfies the need for education in the associated concepts .
In the case of statistics , for example , it would not be adequate to provide a laboratory of statistical tools without at the same time providing courses to ensure that students have the necessary understanding of concepts .
The same distinction between technical training in the use of tools and education in the underlying concepts applies to GIS .
While the concepts of GIS may be familiar to professional geographers , they must be taught anew to each generation of students .
Without conceptual courses , the use of GIS is likely to degenerate to data management and map making , however complex the tool 's capabilities for scientific analysis and modeling .
If GIS is a tool of particular value to geography , and if geography has traditionally taught many of the concepts that the tool implements , then it would seem that formal courses in GIS are most appropriately taught in geography .
In the absence of departments of geography , universities have found a variety of solutions to the need for GIS instruction .
In some cases , courses are taught by faculty or staff in computing facilities ; in others , they are taught in departments such as surveying , civil engineering , or forestry ( Morgan and Fleury 1993 ) .
But wherever they are taught , these courses serve two purposes - they prepare students to do their own research and they provide students with useful job skills .
While this technical line of argument provides a solution that is satisfactory for students , it creates problems for the faculty assigned to teach them , particularly untenured faculty .
Technical courses require very heavy commitments of faculty time , and teaching them is unlikely to boost the instructor 's scholarly research career .
The time required to maintain the GIS teaching laboratory and to deal with students ' technical problems cuts down on the time available for research - and for securing tenure .
Some departments deal with this issue by relying on sessional teaching staff or on technical staff , much as they did in the past when offering courses in technical areas such as cartography or remote sensing .
GIS is Toolmaking
Advancing along the continuum between " GIS as tool " and " GIS as science , " we reach the middle position on GIS , that of toolmaking .
For toolmakers , the tool is inseparable from the substantive problem , i.e. , " doing GIS " implies involvement in the
development of the tool itself .
Geographers who are makers of the GIS tool participate directly in its specification , development , and evaluation , as well as in its use .
In reality , the developers of GIS tools have backgrounds in many disciplines , including computer science , engineering , design , and mathematics , as well as geography .
Few geographers have the necessary technical skills to build major software systems or to write " industrial - strength code ; " but for that matter academics in general are not regarded as suited to the development of reliable software .
Most current GISs originated in the private sector in companies employing a mix of disciplines ( GRASS and Idrisi are notable exceptions ) .
Geographers possess two unique and powerful abilities as GIS toolmakers .
The first of these is an excellent understanding of the geographic concepts that form the primitive elements of GIS databases and processing and the ways that these concepts are embedded in theories , methods of analysis , and models .
Second is that geographers are trained in a discipline that integrates understanding of a wide range of processes influencing phenomena on the earth 's surface .
Both of these abilities are essential to " doing GIS " if one adopts the position that " doing GIS " is toolmaking .
A GIS toolmaker thus requires a basic education in geography together with technical courses that emphasize critical analysis of the technology 's capabilities .
At the research level , the view of the toolmaker presumes critical analysis and reflection .
The result is an extensive research literature that focuses on GIS as a generic tool ( Goodchild , Rhind , and Maguire 1991 ) ; at the same time there is remarkably little published research on specific systems , perhaps because of the proprietary nature of most GISs and because of scholarly fears that principles of academic freedom and the First Amendment would not protect against a suit brought by a private sector GIS vendor against publication of a critical academic evaluation of a product .
Critical analysis and reflection extends beyond the techniques of toolmaking to encompass questions about the social responsibilities of toolmakers and the social implications of the widespread adoption of the tool ( Smith 1992 ; Pickles 1991 ; 1994 ; Harvey and Chrisman in press ) .
This involves evaluating a tool that has applications spanning the full range of human activities - from economy to politics to society .
In this case , the issues become complex indeed .
The scope of research is determined not by the tool 's value to geographers , but rather by the multifarious applications of GIS , to include all of the effects of the computerization of geographic information on society , and for whatever purpose .
Whether " GIS " can withstand the stress of such varied usages remains to be seen .
The Science of GIS
It was evident from the GIS - L debate that GIS is widely viewed outside the discipline of geography as a subset of geographical science .
Although Geography is a small , unevenly represented discipline , and doubts about its legitimacy in the academy are widely held ( Smith 1987 ) , the recent growth of GIS and its affiliation with the discipline has meant increased visibility in the academy .
Moreover GIS is associated with clear physical imagery , hence it is much easier to imagine " doing GIS " than " doing geography " if one has no familiarity with the latter .
Geography 's affiliation with GIS thus pairs it with the computer ( however inappropriately ) .
Computerization automatically confers precision , rigor , and replicability in the popular imagination , all of which contribute to the flawed notion of GIS as a subset of geographical science .
The very rapid growth of technology and the emergence of a technology - based society in recent years has prompted new groupings and priorities within science .
Few would have predicted , for example , that the development of the digital computer would eventually lead to the discipline of computer science , or that information would itself become the basis of a scientific discipline .
Four conditions seem necessary for the emergence of a science out of a technology : first , the driving technology must be of sufficient significance ; second , the issues raised by its development and use must be sufficiently challenging ; third , interest in and support for research on those issues must be inadequate in the existing disciplines ; and fourth , there must be sufficient commonality among the issues to create a substantial synergy .
Two terms have evolved to describe the emergence of a science based on GIS .
The first is geomatics , a term favored in many countries because of its simplicity and its ease of translation into French ; the second , geographic information science , is a term that is well - known in the English - speaking world .
The latter is used here .
Geographic information science , the science of GIS , is concerned with geographic concepts , the primitive elements used to describe , analyze , model , reason about , and make decisions on phenomena distributed on the surface of the earth .
These range from the geometric primitives of points , lines , and areas to the topological relationships of adjacency and connectivity through the dynamic relations of flow and interaction to domain - specific concepts as such as neighborhood , geosyncline , or place .
In their current state of development GISs are comparatively crude digital systems for representing and manipulating geographic concepts , capable of handling only the most primitive of geographic concepts .
But while current technology may constrain the science of GIS , it does not limit its development , just as computer science is not limited by the current state of computer technology .
Indeed the research problems raised by GIS and their solutions will help to define the future form of GIS technology .
Perhaps the most crucial of these problems for geographic information science is the limitation of digital representation ; i.e. , are there geographic concepts which can never be represented in or manipulated by GIS ?
The digital representation and manipulation of geographic concepts raise a number of fundamental research issues , many of which , though long - standing in traditional disciplines , have been re-energized by the development of GIS .
Although the capabilities of GIS are improving , geographers who use it still look forward to the stage at which all geographic concepts and procedures are implemented digitally ( Dobson 1983 ; Couclelis 1991 ; Dobson 1993 ) .
In the interim , GIS research will most likely implement those concepts and procedures that are the simplest , most logical , and most rigorously defined , i.e. , the most primitive and / or the most scientific .
These include issues of recognition and measurement in the field ; the choice between alternative representations ; the roles of generalization and multiple representations ; the representation of uncertain information ; methods of analysis and modeling ; problems of describing the content of geographic data and evaluating its fitness for use ; and methods of visualization .
These sorts of issues underscore the multidisciplinary nature of geographic information science .
Besides geography , it includes such traditional geographic information disciplines as geodesy , surveying , cartography , photogrammetry , and remote sensing along with the spatially oriented elements of such other disciplines as information statistics , cognitive science , information science , library science , and computer science .
Evaluation
In light of the three perspectives on GIS , what can now be said about the significance of " doing GIS " ?
If " GIS is a tool , " then its use has little to do with the legitimacy of the research ; in this case , significance derives strictly from the progress made on the substantive research problem .
In this sense " doing GIS " is not necessarily the same as " doing science ; " the latter depends on the methods deployed on the substantive problem , i.e. , are they scientific ?
Courses in GIS are more likely to be offered at the undergraduate level and reflect their essentially technical , service orientation .
A geography department using GIS on this basis probably would not claim GIS as a research specialty , nor would it encourage its students to regard GIS as a substantive subfield of the discipline .
The toolmaking position confers a more significant status on GIS .
In this case , GIS includes case studies that demonstrate the methodology , advocacy of GIS usage , and , perhaps also , the development of software .
In the absence of indisputable instances of scientific insights uniquely attributable to the use of GIS , toolmaking will remain more akin to engineering than to science .
Consequently , tests of toolmaking 's progress would be based on indicators of improvements in the tool 's utility .
Critical reflection on and the evaluation of GIS are also included in the toolmaking position .
While these are clearly legitimate activities of the academy , they are not as easily characterized as " doing science " ( or " doing engineering " ) .
A department adopting the toolmaking position would probably offer a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in GIS , including courses in the toolmaker 's tools - programming languages - and the faculty would regard GIS as a research specialty and encourage students to make significant contributions as toolmakers .
But such a department might also expect continuing tension between research and teaching in GIS and in more substantive fields ( i.e. , where research is measured by the accumulation of knowledge rather than by the improvement of tools ) .
The third position , " the science of GIS " is concerned with the analysis of the fundamental issues raised by the use of GIS in geography or any other discipline .
As noted earlier , these issues may not be unique to GIS , but rather are remotivated by it ; many of them continue to be regarded as problems in cartography or surveying or spatial cognition .
A department taking this position with regard to specialization in GIS would recognize it as a substantive research field on par with other such fields and would measure progress based on the accumulation of research results and contributions to human understanding , rather than from improvements in the tools themselves .
This position is therefore the only sufficient grounds on which " doing GIS " is " doing science , " and the only sufficient grounds for legitimacy as a research field in the academy .
However within this position one must be careful not to confuse the use of GIS itself ( e.g. , entering a sequence of spatial analysis commands ) , with an analysis of the issues surrounding the use .
Some may try to derive legitimacy from the proposition that GIS is so uniquely fundamental to geography that to do GIS is necessarily to do science - or , more extremely , that to do GIS is to do geography scientifically .
This argument is somewhat flawed because it implies that GIS is vastly more effective than it currently is , and because it ignores the limitations of current GIS in dealing with time , the third spatial dimension , scale , interactions , and a host of other sophisticated geographic concepts .
Whether GIS is a geographical science in and of itself depends on both the rigor with which the tool is employed and the scope of the tool 's functionality given the nature of the substantive problem .
These issues clearly must be resolved on a case - by - case basis .
Therefore the use of GIS is not a sufficient condition for science .
Conclusion
Debates arising out of the ambiguity of GIS as tool or science must be understood within the context of broader trends in science and in society generally .
Older notions of science as the equivalent of " hard science " are being replaced by a more open view .
Warning against conflating science and its positivistic expression , Johnston ( 1986:6 ) proposes a more generous view of science as " the pursuit of systematic and formulated knowledge , and as such [ it ] is not confined to any particular epistemology . "
In this context , GIS may represent a new kind of science , one that emphasizes visual expression , collaboration , exploration , and intuition , and the uniqueness of place over more traditional concerns for mathematical rigor , hypothesis testing , and generality ( Goodchild 1992 ; Kemp et al .
1992 ; Rhind 1993 ; Fedra 1993 ; Muller 1993 ; Burrough and Frank 1995 ) .
As a discipline , geography has long struggled with the tension between the general and the particular ( Bunge 1962 ) .
Maps and geographic data capture the essence of the geographically particular , the boundary conditions that influence the outcome of physical and social processes ; and in that sense GIS illuminates the particular .
But unlike maps , the purpose of GIS is to maintain geographic data in a state (s ) that may be transformed , processed , and analyzed in ways that are geographically uniform .
Thus GIS is a technology of both the general and the particular , implementing the former in its formalized algorithms , concepts , and models , and the latter in the contents of its data sets .
GIS as a technology seems uniquely appropriate for geographic research and , more specifically , for transforming geographic knowledge of processes into predictions , policies , and decisions .
In this sense GIS captures geography 's tensions between basic research and application , and between the geographically general and the geographically particular .
The demands for basic and applied knowledge are several in the new worlds created and encountered by GIS .
Whether GIS serves as a technological means to acquire and develop knowledge or as an end for scientific inquiry in its own right , these systems will undoubtedly play a central role in knowledge making in the future .
But it is important to understand what is meant by " doing science , " as well as what is meant by " doing GIS . "
This paper has identified three well - defined positions on this matter but only one of these positions confers the kind of academic legitimacy associated with " doing science . "
In other cases " doing GIS " is more akin to using a tool ( to be evaluated by the appropriateness of the tool to the substantive problem ) or to engineering better tools ( to be evaluated on the degree of improvement in the tool ) .
In such cases , GIS appears not to constrain its users to any particular epistemological stance .

Return to Dawn 's home page
Bob Barr ’s announcement that he is making a run for the White House on the Libertarian ticket has many advocates of a non-interventionist foreign policy hopeful , even excited  and I include myself among them .
A successor to Ron Paul is right around the corner , or so it seems , and the continuing education of the American voters  a long - term project , to be sure  is still on track .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that the candidate himself may need some educating , particularly when it comes to the issue of U.S. intervention in South and Central America .
In a recent article for the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , written just before his announcement , Barr averred :
“ Iraq and Afghanistan continue to enjoy top billing in America ’s newspapers and on our television news programs .
With untold billions of dollars flowing regularly into that part of the world and American soldiers continuing to be killed there , it ’s no surprise our government and our media pay close attention .
South America remains an afterthought for government policy - makers and news show producers .
Whether we like it or not , that may soon change , as well it should . ”
True : we are being distracted by our reckless Iraqi adventure .
Furthermore , we would do well to attend to our own hemisphere , where trade relations , the immigration issue , and the history of U.S. intervention in the region continue to produce a smoldering “ Yankee go home ” mentality that does not redound to our interests .
But it does n’t take long for Barr to go off the rails .
He raises none of the aforementioned concerns and , instead , segues into a description of the “ military tensions between Venezuela and Colombia ” that is not merely inaccurate , but outright disingenuous .
The cause of these tensions , we are told , is Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez , who “ massed armed forces at his country ’s border with Colombia and threatened military action .
This saber rattling , Chavez said , was in response to Colombian President Alvaro Uribe ordering a small military force into its western neighbor , Ecuador , to track down and kill a Colombian guerrilla leader operating from what had been the safe haven of a neighboring country ( and who reportedly maintained contacts with Chavez ) . ”
It has been relaibly reported exactly nowhere how many Colombian troops violated Ecuador ’s sovereignty , so we do n’t know how “ small ” this incursion was .
At any rate , Barr fails to mention the Colombian air strikes , which took out the FARC encampment .
It was an act of startlingly brazen aggression , made possible by the billions in military aid we have funneled into the Colombian regime since the Cold War era .
In the wake of the Soviet Union ’s dissolution , the “ war on drugs ” displaced the war on international communism as the rationale for hemispheric interventionism , and Colombia ’s government has been the main beneficiary .
Barr seems to have been taken in by this narrative .
Quite aside from the issue of drugs and their illegality , the consequences of U.S. intervention in Latin America have been similar to the “ blowback ” we ’ve suffered on account of our Middle Eastern meddling , albeit less intense and less newsworthy .
In Latin America , as in the Middle East , we have engendered anti-Americanism by supporting local despots and standing futilely against the rising tide of nationalism .
U.S. support for various right - wing generals , caudillos , and paramilitary death squads has created a backlash , which left - nationalists like Hugo Chavez  and , while we ’re on the subject , Fidel Castro  have ridden to power .
The U.S. government has made a point of humiliating Chavez and makes no secret of its plans for “ regime change ”  openly funding groups to promote the American version of “ democracy ” and using the good offices of the U.S. State Department as a propaganda sounding board for Chavez ’s weak , divided , and disorganized internal opposition .
Yet fulsome U.S. support for the Colombian invasion of neighboring Ecuador fatally undermines the opposition , which has been valiantly fighting the authoritarian socialism  really , national socialism , with an emphasis on the nationalist aspect  represented by Chavez and his “ Bolivarian ” movement .
Chavez can now mobilize the Venezuelan nation against the very real threat of Colombian aggression , using war hysteria as a club against his political opponents much as George W. Bush and the Republicans have maligned the patriotism of antiwar Democrats ( as well as antiwar Republicans , notably Ron Paul ) .
Our pundits and politicians are prone to make sweeping pronouncements on subjects they know nothing about , the former because it greatly simplifies matters and makes their job a lot easier , the latter out of pure opportunism and a need to come up with quick answers .
Both frame the recent crisis in terms of a familiar bipolarity : Colombia ’s Uribe versus the Venezuelan Castro , with President Correa of Ecuador caught in the middle .
This analysis , couched in terms of political personalities , is semi-accurate , as far as it goes .
Yet what is missing here is the historical backdrop , or any sense of moral and political ambiguity , factors well - known to the inhabitants of the region .
Barr , like most of the “ mainstream ” media in the cosmopolitan West , gets the story wrong .
His effort to paint Uribe as some sort of saint , a heroic fighter against the drug cartels , is a fairy tale .
As I explained here , Uribe is a product of these forces , not their opponent .
What puzzled Western observers of the latest Latin American fracas was how it ended , with Uribe , Chavez , and Correa practically kissing and making up , in a somewhat ludicrous public display of mutual forgiveness .
What gives ?
The mystery is cleared up , to a large degree , by noting that these three nations  Venezuela , Colombia , and Ecuador  were once part of the same nation , Gran Colombia , the creation of Simon Bolivar and the Venezuelan adventurer - soldier - scholar Francisco de Miranda , who first envisioned the republic of Great Colombia .
Miranda ’s vision , and Bolivar ’s , was symbolized in the red , blue , and yellow flag he designed , the battle flag of the regionalist independence movement that kicked out the last rotten timbers of the decaying Spanish empire .
The same color scheme is replicated today in the flags of Venezuela , Colombia , and Ecuador .
This family quarrel ended , as they often do , in all - is - forgiven mode .
While this may be a temporary lull in hostilities , outsiders have to realize it ’s familial theatrics , more than anything else , that drives the participants .
Whether it ends in war  what would , in reality , be a civil war  depends , to a large degree , on the role of the U.S. government .
Who can doubt that Uribe cleared the cross - border strike with President Bush before daring to undertake such a bold adventure ?
Acting as Washington ’s proxy , Colombia ’s shot across the bow was directed at Chavez as much as the FARC guerrilla group .
Barr need n’t worry : it looks like the Bush administration is paying attention to the region , and that is n’t good .
The whole affair had all the hallmarks of a typically clumsy and faintly ridiculous Bush White House operation .
The propaganda campaign accompanying the invasion was rife with reports of direct communication between Chavez and the FARC leadership  not to mention alleged representatives of a certain Democratic presidential candidate !
Not since the Niger uranium forgeries has such an incompetent fabrication been foisted on the public in the service of the War Party .
Barr , for his part , seems to understand very little of the historical and political background of this latest outbreak .
He writes :
“ Although the publicly stated reasons for the tensions between the Colombian and Venezuelan leaders relate to Colombia ’s efforts to eradicate the leftist guerrilla threat that has plagued the country for decades , most observers know it is Colombia ’s openly pro-U.S. stance that really rankles Chavez .
The entire South American continent has long chafed under the benign neglect of one U.S. administration after another . ”
Quite aside from the laughable proposition that U.S. policy in the region qualifies as “ benign , ” Barr frames the Latin American scene in familiar , bipolar terms .
He acknowledges the reconciliation between the Bolivarian brothers  albeit without seeming to understand the historical context  but downplays this as superficial .
He also seems stuck , as do all too many old - time conservatives , in a Cold War time warp .
Barr refers to the “ leftist guerrilla threat ” to Colombia , yet , for some reason , no mention is made of rightist paramilitaries that rely on the drug trade , kidnapping , extortion , and terror to maintain and expand their influence , just like the FARC .
( Although , to be fair , he does mention them in another piece . )
Barr also misses the main problem with our Latin American policy .
By pouring military and economic aid into Colombia , we empower Uribe to go much further than he might otherwise dare .
There is nothing “ benign ” about that .
Instead , it marks Washington as the instigator and enabler of yet another internecine conflict , a role similar to the one we play in Iraq , where we ’re now taking sides in the intra-Shi’ite sectarian conflict .
Barr opposes U.S. intervention in Iraq ’s unfolding civil war , yet the same principle of staying out of foreign quarrels may not apply to Colombia , at least according to Barr .
As he puts it :
“ While Washington ’s current national security worldview remains focused like a laser beam on Iraq and Afghanistan , fires smolder and burn elsewhere .
Shifting at least a portion of that concern and those resources to South America , and especially to the Andean region that currently is near the boiling point , is critical to our security .
There may not be weapons of mass destruction lurking in the jungles of Venezuela , Colombia or Ecuador ( there were n’t in Iraq either , of course ) , but arms are flowing into the area .
Venezuela , for example , is buying billions of dollars worth of Russian military equipment .
Leftist guerrillas and narco - terrorists remain firmly entrenched in the region , and evidence that other terrorist groups are using the area for problematic purposes is mounting . ”
Those Russians  they ’re at it again !
Why , it ’s almost like we ’re back in 1968 , and the cry is heard throughout the land : “ To arms !
To arms !
The Russians are coming ! ”
What “ resources , ” by the way , does Barr suggest we move to the Andes  should we send our troops to Bogota instead of Baghdad ?
Well , then , why not both ?
In principle , Barr could have no objection , and the rest of the argument would consist of identifying the bona fides of the latest “ terrorist threat , ” which Barr assures us lurks in the jungles of Latin America .
As for the Russian arms sale to Venezuela , that is nothing compared to the missile “ defense ” shield we are positioning in Central and Eastern Europe , which directly threatens Moscow .
Add to that U.S. arms sales and military aid to the government of Georgia , which is in a standoff with the Kremlin over disputed territories .
The Russian sale of a few Kalashnikovs to the Venezuelans is nothing compared to our deliberate policy of provocation , encirclement , and serial regime - change , a campaign with one target in mind : Moscow .
If leftist guerrillas and “ narco - terrorists ” are “ firmly entrenched in the region , ” as Barr says , then what will U.S. intervention do to counter these forces and make the region safe for U.S. interests , which , Barr not so subtly indicates , consist of oil ?
The vague threat that Chavez will somehow take his oil off the market and refuse to sell it to American consumers is never explicitly stated by Barr , yet it hangs over his discourse like a vague , obscuring cloud .
This is sheer nonsense , blown away by the first gust of economic common sense .
As Barr himself states , Chavez ’s power and influence in the region is made possible by Venezuela ’s oil wealth  the source of which is consumption in the U.S. and Europe .
Why Chavez would want to cut off that source is a mystery known only to Barr .
I can see the U.S. imposing economic sanctions on Venezuela ; it is highly unlikely that Chavez would impose those sanctions on himself .
It is the U.S. government  an interloper  that is “ using the area for problematic purposes . ”
The Bush administration is using Uribe as its regional proxy , to pick fights with Chavez and stir up trouble in a region of the world where our record is , frankly , atrocious .
This is the crucial point missed by Barr , and one that most conservatives fail to understand , because they react in a knee - jerk fashion to Chavez ’s leftism  and the socialist politics of the various popular insurgencies that have erupted over the years , from Nicaragua to Venezuela and most countries in between .
While this is no place to engage is a lengthy analysis of the roots of Latin American statism in the feudal structures of the colonial era , suffice to say here that the Latin American Left has taken care to appeal to very real grievances against both feudal landowners and foreign corporate entities , which have manipulated successive governments to their own economic advantage  and have n’t hesitated to use force , including the U.S. military , to accomplish their ends .
Hemispheric interventionism is no more justifiable than the “ benevolent global hegemony ” of the neocons , whose candidate , John McCain , wants to intervene everywhere .
To oppose this sort of hubris with a somewhat modified version  U.S. hegemony on only two continents , instead of all seven  is to concede the argument in advance and reduce the foreign policy debate in this country to a minor quarrel among members of the same interventionist family .
As noted in this space previously , I am certainly cheered by Barr ’s clear statement , as exhibited on his Web site , of a principled stance on behalf of a non-interventionist foreign policy .
The trick is in applying this abstract principle consistently , across the board , without fear or favor .
As a candidate , Barr is clearly on a learning curve , but I would warn him  if he does n’t already know  that Libertarians ( as in members of the Libertarian Party ) are notorious sticklers for doctrine .
To a large degree , this can characterized as a charming idiosyncrasy , which at the end of the day has to be subordinated to a certain degree of political practicality .
But there is a limit .
Barr has two advantages : he is well - known , and he is apparently sincere .
He joined the LP a while back , with no clear intention to run for anything , and his rejection of interventionism seems quite genuine .
I would hate it if he gave further ammunition to the sticklers and obstructionists , not to mention whatever covert Republican operatives would be eager to sabotage Barr ’s nomination .
A recent poll showed Barr running at 7 percent of the vote  a massive vote by traditional third - party standards , and a veritable dream - come - true for the Libertarians .
This would doubtless come at the expense of the GOP .
If I were the Republicans , I would immediately dispatch a special “ task force ” to disrupt the Barr campaign  and , who knows , perhaps they already have .
In any event , Barr is doing himself and his campaign no favors by engaging in this sort of off - the - cuff “ analysis ” of foreign affairs .
As a libertarian ( small -l ) , I ’m willing to put up with the nonsensically - termed “ fair tax , ” and I ’m even mildly enthusiastic about his opposition to legalizing “ hard ” drugs , such as methamphetamine ( this will doubtless prove his undoing over at Reason magazine ) .
However , when it comes to foreign policy  and such a clear - cut case as South America , scene of so many U.S. depredations that it would be tiresome to even list them , let alone elaborate on them  that ’s where I draw the line .
ALBEMARLE , N.C. –Jeff Carstensen was spooked when he learned his grandmother planned to buy him a $ 100,000 life insurance policy – and name herself the beneficiary .
" She told me that people of our stature have insurance policies on each other , " he said .
" That way , if something happens to you , you take care of me , and if something happens to me , I take care of you .
It was all too suspicious .
So I got out of there any way I could , as soon as I could . "
As he and many others who came into Betty Neumar 's orbit have learned , bad things tend to happen to the people around her .
The 76 - year - old Georgia woman sits in a North Carolina jail , accused of hiring a hitman to kill fourth husband Harold Gentry .
Authorities are re-examining the deaths of her first child and four of the five men she married , including Gentry .
Records and interviews with relatives and police paint Neumar as a domineering matriarch consumed by money .
Al Gentry pressed North Carolina authorities for 22 years to reinvestigate his brother Harold 's death .
" You ca n't trust her .
You can't believe a word she says . "
She collected at least $ 20,000 in 1986 when Harold Gentry was shot to death in his home .
A year earlier , she had collected $ 10,000 in life insurance when her son died .
Ohio police are probing the death of Carstensen 's stepfather Gary Flynn .
Flynn was found shot dead in his apartment in November 1985 .
The death of Betty Neumar 's son was ruled a suicide but his family have questions .
A decision on reopening that case is pending .
She also had a life insurance policy on husband No. 5 , John Neumar , who died in October .
The official cause of death was listed as sepsis , but authorities are investigating whether he was poisoned .
Al Gentry saw Neumar for the first time in many years yesterday in Stanly County District Court .
Later , he called her orange jail jumpsuit " the prettiest outfit I 've ever seen her in . "
Judge Lisa
Thacker refused to lower Neumar 's $ 500,000 bond and set Aug. 11 for a probable - cause hearing .
Defence lawyer Charles Parnell argued his client was not a flight risk , calling the bond " completely excessive . "
He claimed Neumar has less than $ 1,000 in assets and no overseas bank accounts .
But Assistant District Attorney Tim Rodgers said she has used 28 aliases on passports , driver licences and credit cards and is being investigated in other jurisdictions .
To outsiders , she was Bee – a friendly woman who ran beauty shops , attended church and raised money for charity .
Carstensen saw another side : fist fights at family functions , use of obscenities and belittling of relatives , how she would act " one way in public – especially church – and another behind closed doors . "
Interviews , documents and court records provide an outline of her history in North Carolina , Ohio , Florida and Georgia , all states where she was married .
Born Betty Johnson in 1931 in Ironton , a hardscrabble Ohio town , she graduated from high school in 1949 , marrying Clarence Malone in November 1950 .
She was 18 , he was 19 .

In December 1951 , she claimed in court papers that Malone abused her .
It 's unclear what happened to that complaint or when the marriage ended .
Their son , Gary , was born March 13 , 1952 .
A single shot to the head killed Malone , outside his auto shop in a small town southwest of Cleveland in November 1970 .
His death was ruled a homicide .
Gary Flynn ( née Malone ) was adopted by Betty Neumar 's second husband , James A. Flynn .
It 's unclear when they met and married .
She told investigators he " died on a pier " somewhere in New York in the mid-1950s .
They had a daughter , Peggy .
His is the only death officials are not reinvestigating .
Florida records show her living in Jacksonville and enrolled in beauty college in 1960 as Betty Flynn .
Her third husband , Richard Sills , was found dead in his apartment in the Florida Keys in 1965 .
Neumar told police they were alone in a room arguing when he pulled out a gun and shot himself .
Authorities , who ruled it a suicide , are now reinvestigating .
Three years later , Neumar married Gentry .
Five years after he died , she married John Neumar .
While living with him in Augusta , Ga. , in the mid-1990s , former friends and kin said , she persuaded more than 200 people to invest in a get - rich - quick scheme , telling them they would get up to $ 100,000 for every $ 100 they put toward legal expenses of a rich European family that died with no heirs .
Seven ringleaders in the scam pleaded guilty in 1997 .
Neumar was never charged .
John Neumar was worth $ 300,000 when they wed in 1991 .
Nearly 10 years later , they filed for bankruptcy , with more than $ 206,000 due on 43 credit cards .
There was a time , not long ago , when 17 - year - old Jennifer Ogle of Braintree drove her Mercury Mystique to her part - time job at a local CVS .
Matthew Gill , 17 , of Tewksbury used to drive his Chevrolet Blazer to school twice a week and would buy a soda every afternoon .
Eric Warren , 17 , of Burlington freely ferried friends in his Volvo .

The AP follows up today on my March story about an assault on a popular epilepsy support forum , in which internet griefers used JavaScript code and flashing computer animation to trigger migraine headaches and seizures in some users .
RyAnne Fultz , 33 , says she suffered her worst epileptic attack in a year after she clicked on the wrong post at a forum run by the nonprofit Epilepsy Foundation .
Photo courtesy RyAnne FultzThere 's really only one bit of new information in the report .
Apparently the FBI is now investigating the attack .
That 's interesting because , assuming the Bureau is able to find some of the culprits , it could lead to the first federal prosecution under an anti-cyber terrorism provision passed in 1996 as part of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act .
The law created a new crime of attacking a computer to cause " physical injury to any person . "
Some of us laughed at that provision at the time , and as far as I know it 's never been used .
But in this case it just might fit .
To get there , prosecutors would have to show that the attackers intentionally damaged the Epilepsy Foundation 's forum .
Since the attack flooded the forums with hundreds of embedded pictures , links to pictures , and browser - hijacking redirect code , that might not be too high a hurdle .
The attackers also would have to be guilty of gaining unauthorized access to the computer , or , perhaps more apt in this case , caused the " transmission of a program , information , code , or command " that damaged the forum and injured the victims .
The US has about 17,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan
A US couple checking their answering machine heard a frightening three - minute recording of their son caught in a battle in Afghanistan .
Stephen Phillips , 22 , was fighting insurgents when his mobile phone was pressed , causing it to dial his parents ' number in Otis , Oregon .
Most of the sounds were gunfire , but swearing and shouts of " more ammo ! " and " incoming ! " could also be heard .
Nobody was wounded or killed in Mr Phillips ' unit during the battle .
He is serving with the Army 546th MP Company 3rd Platoon and has been in Afghanistan for about a year .
The recording has since been posted on the video - sharing website YouTube , where it has been listened to more than 200,000 times .
' Embarrassed '
Mr Phillips had spoken to his parents on his mobile phone a few hours before the battle , and amid the confusion of the fight , he somehow hit the redial button .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
His mother , Sandie Petee , and her husband , Jeff , heard the message after returning home from shopping .
" His friend died a year ago in Iraq and I 'm thinking , ' Oh my God , this may be the last time I hear my son's voice on the phone ' , " Mrs Petee said .
Mr Petee said : " It 's something a parent really does n't want to hear .
It 's a heck of a message to get from your son in Afghanistan . "
The couple frantically tried to contact Mr Phillips , and eventually reached him a few hours later .
When he was played back the message , he said was embarrassed by all the swearing .
" He said , ' Do n't let Grandma hear it ' , " Mrs Petee said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. phone companies would be shielded from potentially billions of dollars in lawsuits under an anti-terror spy measure that appears headed toward approval , congressional sources said on Wednesday .

House of Representatives Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer , a lead negotiator on the bill , said , “ We ’re very close to having an agreement , ” and a House vote could come as early as Friday .
Democratic and Republican aides and a lobbyist familiar with negotiations said the House would likely approve the measure overwhelmingly .
Despite opposition from its top two Democrats , the Senate would then likely give it final approval , clearing the way for President George W. Bush to sign it into law .
Bush has been pushing for retroactive immunity for any telephone company that participated in warrantless domestic surveillance program he began after the September 11 attacks .
One Democratic aide said the backers definitely seem to have the votes .
Other Democratic and Republican aides , all speaking on condition of anonymity , agreed .
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Assistant Senate Democratic Leader Dick Durbin oppose immunizing telephone companies from lawsuits and voiced opposition this week to the proposal .
“ I will not support that , but a lot of people will , ” Reid said on Tuesday .
Hoyer argued the bill would provide greater protection of civil liberties than one the Senate approved in February .
House Democratic leaders have refused to bring the Senate bill up for a vote in their chamber , forcing compromise talks .
The Senate bill would grant retroactive immunity to any phone company that participated in Bush ’s spying program .
The proposed compromise would allow a federal district court to dismiss a suit if the company was provided written assurances that Bush authorized their participation in the spy program and that it was legal , sources said .
About 40 civil lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Nextel Corp of violating Americans ’ privacy rights in helping the domestic surveillance program .
Damages could total billions of dollars .
The White House and Democratic - led Congress have been trying for months to reach an agreement to modernize the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , which requires the government receive secret - court approval to conduct surveillance on foreign targets in the United States .
Critics charge Bush violated the law in authorizing warrantless surveillance .
Bush maintains he had the wartime power to do it .
He later put the program under FISA jurisdiction but its terms remain secret .
As part of any law to update FISA , Bush has demanded retroactive immunity for any telephone company that participated in his spying program .
Critics , including civil rights groups and many Democratic lawmakers , argue it should first be determined what the phone companies did before deciding whether to give them immunity .

An Interview With Jonny Scaramanga
A news report dated Sunday , June 24 , in the Herald Scotland , revealed that “ American fundamentalist schools are using Nessie to disprove evolution ” :
These private schools follow a fundamentalist curriculum including the Accelerated Christian Education ( A.C.E ) programme to teach controversial religious beliefs aimed at disproving evolution and proving creationism …
… One A.C.E. textbook – Biology 1099 , Accelerated Christian Education Inc. – reads : “ Are dinosaurs alive today ?
Scientists are becoming more convinced of their existence .
Have you heard of the ‘ Loch Ness Monster ’ in Scotland ?
‘ Nessie ’ for short has been recorded on sonar from a small submarine , described by eyewitnesses , and photographed by others .
Nessie appears to be a plesiosaur . ”
Unfortunately , there are students worldwide who are being taught these lessons — it ’s not just an issue for the United States .
Fortunately , however , there are activists who are working to raise awareness about these Accelerated Christian Education programs and aim challenge what these programs provide in the name of “ education . ”
One such person is Jonny Scaramanga .
Jonny Scaramanga is an independent musician , singer , songwriter , guitarist , and teacher in Bath .
He once attended an A.C.E. school and questions whether the system has done the right thing by him and thousands of students worldwide , at “ Leaving Fundamentalism . ”
***
Jonny Scaramanga : I went to an A.C.E school as a preschooler .
I was there when I was three .
I remember absolutely nothing [ from that time ] , but then I was there again from when I was eleven until I was almost fifteen .
At the time , I was a fundamentalist myself and I liked it .
People tell me , “ Oh , do n’t criticize the system just because it did n’t work for you . ”
If anything , I ’m someone that it did work for , to an extent — at least to begin with !
Accelerated Christian Education is a fundamentalist curriculum that started in Texas , and now it ’s used in more than 5,000 schools around the world .
Australia is one of the bigger , busier clients for accelerated Christian education outside of the U.S.
It ’s not localized to the U.K. , but I concentrate on what ’s happening with it in the U.K. because it ’s what I know about .
They teach creationism as fact and many things of that nature .
But the thing that I really have a problem with …is the fact that the students have to work in silence in these cubicles that they make for them , and there ’s no social interaction .
I think that educationally it ’s quite damaging .
They ’re not allowed to question anything .
I think that the purpose of education has to be to learn how to find stuff out for yourself .
You ca n’t do that if you ’re telling children , “ No , this is all that you ’re allowed to know , and this is all that you ’re allowed to think . ”
Kylie Sturgess :
It sounds like the students are undergoing battery hen - like conditions when it comes to their education .
Was it like that for you ?
Scaramanga : Yes , absolutely .
They would say that 50 percent or 60 percent of the working week is to be completed in that way .
Then you ’d have I guess more typical education the rest of the time .
But I struggle to see how you can have , really , a typical education half of the week and brainwashing the other half .
It was very much like being battery henned .
It suited me OK , because I like reading and working in silence .
But there are other students that I knew that did n’t suit them , that could n’t sit still because they ’re the kind of students that need to be active to learn , like a lot of students are .
They would just get beaten for disobedience .
Sturgess :
Is your family particularly religious ?
Was that why they encouraged you to go to that school and attend the program ?
Scaramanga :
Yes , but I ’m really super proud of my mom because she left a comment on my blog where she said , “ I just completely renounce everything that Johnny was ever taught in that school and I should never have sent him there . ”
Most parents can’t admit that .
Everyone else that I ’ve spoken to that was involved in the system all still stick up for it rather than question that they may have done something wrong .
Sturgess :
You ’ve mentioned on your site that the school you went to eventually closed down , but obviously A.C.E. is still continuing , around the world ?
Scaramanga :
Well , it ’s independent schools that use the system .
In the U.K. , for example , which is where I have the expertise , it ’s not a recognized qualification .
The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation ( OFQUAL ) is the government body , which gives recognition to qualifications so that employers and universities know what they ’re dealing with .
They do n’t recognize Accelerated Christian Education ’s qualifications in the U.K .
But a government body called the National Academic Recognition Information Centre ( NARIC ) , which is responsible for judging the equivalence of international qualifications , has said that they do consider A.C.E. ’s certificates in this country to be comparable with Alevels , which is what you would consider the equivalent of graduating from high school in the U.K .
That ’s really bad news that NARIC has done that , because I think it ’s a very illinformed decision that they ’ve made .
But A.C.E. in the U.K. are just crowing about it and using it to claim that they have recognized qualifications .
Sturgess :
So why challenge them now ?
You ’ve left school ; you ’ve left your religion behind and gone on to have a successful career .
Why come back and start questioning what they ’re doing ?
Scaramanga :
Well , I started writing a memoir just because I realized that people think that fundamentalism only happens in America .
Every time I tell someone about my life when I was younger — which for years was this guilty secret , and I tried not to let people know about it , but I gradually started to tell people , “ Hey , I used to be a fundamentalist , and you would n’t believe the stuff I used to believe . ”
People are fascinated to know that this happens in the U.K. , and that actually it ’s reasonably common the U.K .
Then when I got to writing the parts about my education , I got to those as I was qualifying to become a teacher myself .
When I ’m not touring the world being an “ intergalactic rock star , ” I teach music at undergraduate level in the U.K .
I was learning as a teacher about what constituted a good education , and the more I learned , the more I realized that “ This is exactly the opposite of how fundamentalist education works . ”
I think we can learn something more about good education by looking at what makes a bad educational experience .
I think that there are still thousands of kids — there are probably 2,000 kids in the U.K. that are being educated with A.C.E. , so it must be tens of thousands around the world , at least .
Sturgess :
In fact you are so eager to find out what they ’re saying you ’ve been buying their A.C.E. packages and analyzing them .
What are some of the messages that they ’re telling young people ?
Scaramanga :
Well , they ’re telling students that the world is 6,000 years old and that evolution is essentially a conspiracy .
I think it ’s fair to say the overall point that you get from their curriculum is that scientists know that this evolution business did n’t really happen , but they really do n’t want to believe in God , so they ’re all teaming up to argue for the sinking ship of evolution just so that they can deny the existence of God and not have to be Christians .
That ’s the kind of message they have about science !
The political course has a message too : that God is rightwing , and anything to the left of that is a rejection of God ’s will .
God wants low taxes ;
God does n’t want health care ;
God does n’t want free education .
God does n’t want any kind of welfare benefits for the poor , because that ’s not the government ’s job .
God has apparently decided that the church should take care of that , but government should have nothing to do with it .
Oh , and that Christians should get involved in politics .
Luckily , Accelerated Christian Education has such a small influence on education that it ’s not having a huge impact politically outside of the Christian right - wing in America .
But they ’re encouraging , actively , their students to get involved in politics and push for this really extremeright agenda .
All of history is told from this point of view .
There are , and I have talked on my website about racism within their program , but it would be inaccurate to say that they ’re being deliberate or connivingly racist .
I think that it ’s written by ignorant people , and that ’s obvious from their science curriculum and their politics curriculum .
But we ’re not dealing with people who really hate people of other races .
We ’re just talking about people that are just clueless about anything which is n’t Protestant America .
Sturgess :
So everyone has to be on the same terms as teachers : “ This is our curriculum .
It includes A.C.E. ; do not question it ” ?
Scaramanga : Yes , A.C.E. makes up pretty much the entirety of the curriculum .
The children do tests based on Accelerated Christian Education , which make up the qualifications that they do instead of whatever the normal qualifications are in that country .
Sturgess :
That ’s astounding .
So , essentially , a child is graduating with a different kind of high school qualification than every other student in the state system ?
Scaramanga :
Yes ; it ’s just ludicrous to say it ’s equivalent to final year high school , because even if you take out the lies and misinformation in the A.C.E.s and just look at it academically …
They could just put nonsense answers in the blanks they ’re given in the packages , go up to the score station , find out the right answers , and memorize them .
Then , if they memorize , by rote , without necessarily understanding anything , they will get 100 percent on the test .
Then that is the qualification they ’re getting , which says they ’ve had an education .
It ’s nonsense to say that that is equivalent to any proper qualification , because the child may have learned nothing , may have learned everything by rote , and their score would be the same as if they had learned everything perfectly .
It ’s not a meaningful system of assessment .
Sturgess :
What happens to the students afterwards ?
Are they likely to get into university , into other careers ?
What sort of qualifications are they walking away with ?
Scaramanga :
In my view , it ’s a worthless qualification .
But the fact that employers are not going to have heard of it means that now that U.K. NARIC has said that this is equivalent to Alevels that ’s more or less a lot of students who just walk in with their NARIC letters that says this is equivalent to Alevels .
The employer , having no other knowledge of the system , is going to have to accept that .
Many students in the U.K. have gone from Accelerated Christian Education into decent universities .
This is interesting , that certain students have gone on to university .
Part of me wishes that universities would n’t take these students because it seems to give credibility to Accelerated Christian Education .
But then , on the other hand , if a student has gone through that system and somehow still shows an academic promise at the end then they ’ve been punished enough , really .
Sturgess :
Have other science or rationalist groups shown any interest in helping you , like the British Humanists or any secular groups out there ?
This is clearly infringing on their territory as well .
Scaramanga : The British Humanist Association — people such as Andrew Copson have been great .
When my Times Education supplement article appeared questioning A.C.E. first appeared , he wrote to U.K. NARIC every week for months hassling about it .
He is still aware of the situation and he retweets my articles on the subject .
So I feel I have an ally there .
Australia , out of all of the countries , showed the most resistance .
It seems to have caved now , but in the late ’ 80s and early ’90s , there were even Christians , and not just secular educators , that were all trying to refuse registration for A.C.E schools in Australia .
The best academic article I found about Accelerated Christian Education was by Cathy Speck and David Prideaux , who were at the University of South Australia at the time .
Now , they are at Flinders University in Adelaide .
If anywhere , Australia has shown the most resistance .
I am working on making a case for saying that it should be illegal .
Now , obviously , I ’m still researching this because there are big issues to do with religious and civil liberties that need to be considered .
But I think that when you ’re talking about lies being taught as fact to children , things that we know [ are untrue ] not things that we think are untrue .
I ’m not talking about the areas of belief , which may be debatable , but within A.C.E we ’re talking about things that we know are untrue are being taught as fact .
In order for that to happen , the scientific method is being entirely distorted .
That ’s not a science education .
I certainly think that there is a need for the regulation of education , saying , “ If you ’re going to have a lesson that ’s called science , you have to teach science . ”

I no longer think this is a good theory .
An inquiry into the use of Tasers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) has found the weapons were being used too often and too indiscriminately .
The probe came after a Polish immigrant died last year at the Vancouver International Airport , shortly after he was hit with a Taser by police officers .
The Public Complaints Commissioner for the RCMP , Paul Kennedy , found that officers were using the Taser too often and in cases where they were not warranted such as against people dodging transit fares , and in one instance against an elderly man lying on a stretcher .
Mr Kennedy also found that the national police force has no comprehensive tracking of the Taser use .
The report recommends that officers with less than five years experience should not be issued with a Taser .
The Government says it will act on the recommendations quickly .
New Haven , Conn . --
A team of astronomers looking at the universe 's distant past found nine young , unusually compact galaxies , each weighing in at 200 billion times the mass of the Sun .
The findings appeared in the April 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
These young galaxies are the equivalent of a human baby that is 20 inches long , yet weighs 180 pounds .
" Seeing the compact sizes of these galaxies is a puzzle , " said Pieter G. van Dokkum of Yale , who led the study .
" No massive galaxy at this distance has ever been observed to be so compact , and it is not yet clear how one of these would build itself up to be the size of the galaxies we see today . "
The galaxies , each only 5,000 light - years across , are a fraction of the size of today 's " grownup " galaxies but contain approximately the same number of stars .
Each could fit inside the central hub of the Milky Way .
" These ultra - dense galaxies , forming the building blocks of today 's largest galaxies , might comprise half of all galaxies of that mass at this early time , " van Dokkum said .
But , van Dokkum noted that they would have to change a lot over 11 billion years -- they would have to grow five times bigger , " While they could get larger by colliding with other galaxies , such collisions may not be the complete answer , " he said .
Astronomers used NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope and the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea , Hawaii , to study the galaxies whose light has been traveling toward us for 11 billion years .
" What we see now is the way these compact galaxies existed 11 billion years ago , when the universe was less than 3 billion years old , " van Dokkum explained .
" Only Hubble and Keck can see the sizes of these galaxies because they are very small and far away . "
In 2006 , the research team also studied the galaxies with the Gemini South Telescope Near - Infrared Spectrograph , on Cerro Pachon in the Chilean Andes .
Those observations provided the galaxies ' distances and showed that the stars are a half a billion to a billion years old , and that the most massive stars had already exploded as supernovae .
" In the Hubble Deep Field , astronomers found that star - forming galaxies are small , " said Marijn Franx of Leiden University , The Netherlands .
" However , these galaxies were also very low in mass .
They weigh much less than our Milky Way .
Our study , which surveyed a much larger area than in the Hubble Deep Field , surprisingly shows that galaxies with the same weight as our Milky Way were also very small in the past .
All galaxies look really different in early times , even massive ones that formed their stars early . "
Van Dokkum speculated on how these small , crowded galaxies formed .
He said , one way could have involved an interaction in the emerging universe between hydrogen gas and dark matter -- an invisible form of matter that accounts for most of the universe 's mass .
Shortly after the Big Bang , the universe contained an uneven landscape of dark matter .
He said that hydrogen gas could have been trapped in puddles of the invisible material which began spinning rapidly in dark matter 's gravitational whirlpool , forming stars at a furious rate .
The astronomers estimated that the stars in the compact galaxies are spinning around their galactic disks at roughly 1 million miles an hour ( 500 kilometers a second ) .
Stars in today 's galaxies , by contrast , are traveling at about half that speed because they are larger and rotate more slowly .
These galaxies are ideal targets for the Wide Field Camera 3 , which is scheduled to be installed aboard Hubble during Servicing Mission 4 in the fall of 2008 .
The team says that the new images should lead to a better understanding of the evolution of galaxies early in the life of the universe .

Tony Curtis , Hollywood legend and star of the Billy Wilder classic Some Like It Hot , is sitting on a balcony in London giving me a welcoming stare from underneath a Stetson hat .
Curtis - who had an affair with Marilyn Monroe , has been married five times , including to Hitchcock actress Janet Leigh , and , by his estimation , has slept with 1,000 women - attempts an unusual opening gambit .

Heart - throb : Tony Curtis alongside Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot
Gripping my hand in his gnarled paw , he says : " It 's such a relief to be sitting here with you - without feeling sexually aroused . "
If Curtis was n't 82 and recovering from a mild illness , I think I might slap him .
" Do n't get me wrong , " he continues in that famous Bronx drawl , as thick as molasses , " I 've been sick for most of my life , in my head .
" This showed itself in a lot of ways .
I was insecure about women , so I wanted to go to bed with them all .
I was insecure about being a poor Jewish boy ( Curtis was born Bernie Schwartz , the son of a Hungarian immigrant tailor ) .
I was insecure that Hollywood never gave me an Oscar . "
His eyes , which are periwinkle blue - if a little rheumy - gaze directly into mine .
" For the first time in my life , I think I am at ease .
I just want to paint .
I 've painted since I was young and it's my passion . "
( Harrods is showing an exhibition of his work , which is heavily influenced by the Post - Impressionists . )
Then the man who makes Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg with his mere 30 lovers look like a choirboy , states : " I do n't want any woman except my wife , Jill , and for the first time in my life it is n't just lust . "
Jill Vandenberg , whom he married in 1998 , is a 6ft tall , voluptuous blonde 43 years his junior .
She is hovering discreetly in the background .
Tony Curtis is a bundle of contradictions .
He 's a street - fighting boy from the Bronx , yet he hand - kisses like a count in an Austrian operetta .
He speaks with candour about his private life , as if he were discussing the merits of smoked salmon versus cucumber sandwiches .
" But you see , " he explains , " it is only by being candid that I have been able to overcome the awful things in my life . "
The dark - haired celluloid Apollo who became such a world - famous heart - throb that even Elvis Presley copied his black quiff , and female fans tore at his clothes , had an unpropitious start in life and has suffered genuine tragedies .
He has overcome heroin addiction and the death of his eldest son , Nicholas , at 23 , from a drugs overdose .
His remarkable story began in his father Emmanuel 's tailor shop in New York .
The young Curtis saw little of his impoverished male parent and was maltreated by his mother , Helen , who was a schizophrenic .
" She beat me up .
Hit me all the time .
She did n't dare do that to my father , so it was me she struck .
If I did n't finish my soup , she would throw me against the wall .
She was crazy . "
When Curtis was 12 , his nine - year - old brother , Julius , was hit by a truck and he had to identify the body .
" It was Hell .
She did n't care . "
I ask him if he has a sort of warped Oedipus complex .
Did it affect his relationships with women , particularly his usually short - lived marriages ?
" I am Oedipus , " he responds .
" Of course it ruined my relations with women .
I had - what is the word ? "
After a pause , he finds the correct word : " satyriasis " , a compulsion to sleep with everything in a skirt .
He beams .
" That 's it .
I was permanently aroused .
Because of my mother , I did n't see women as people with intellects .
All I wanted was big breasts and sex .
I was trying to prove something .
Then again , I was so good - looking . "
Scroll down for more ...
Feeling old : ' It 's such a relief to be sitting here with you - without feeling sexually aroused , ' Curtis told Petronella Wyatt
While telling me about his anxieties , Curtis repeatedly reminds me how good - looking he was .
After serving in the Navy in 1945 , he was discovered by a New York talent agency and sent to Hollywood .
In 1948 , aged 23 , he was put under contract by Universal Pictures .
" This is because I was the handsomest of all the boys , " he confides , attempting an expression of modesty .
" I was resented and hated because I was so good - looking and Jewish .
It 's true .
This is not paranoia . "
I look questioningly at him .
" But Tony , were n't most of the studio heads , like Sam Goldwyn and Louis B Mayer , as well as directors like Billy Wilder , Jewish ? "
" That made no difference .
You had to pretend not to be .
Then because the men found me too much of a competition sexually , they even started rumours I was homosexual .
They put me in baggy trousers and made me go naked from the waist up like a girl . "
It is true .
One particularly unsuitable piece of casting was to make him play the role of an English medieval knight in The Black Shield Of Falworth .
Critics howled when he came out in sheer Bronxese with : " Yondda lies de cassle of my fuddah . "
Film - goers , however , fell for his charms .
If his looks and overall " package " were a hindrance to his being taken seriously , he managed to perform some extremely good acting in such films as the Sweet Smell Of Success and Trapeze ( both with Burt Lancaster ) .
" You know something , " says Curtis , who is suddenly shedding his insecurities , " I became a really good actor . "
He complains that the film industry never appreciated him and failed to give him an Oscar , preferring the " method - acting bulls * *t " .
He has a point .
Curtis was able to segue from comedy as light and as perfect as a souffle into the rawest of anguish .
When I tell him this he is ecstatic .
He dips his Stetson in gratitude , showing a completely bald pate .
" I 'm not wearing my toupee at the moment .
Ca n't be bothered , " he grins .
" But I 'm glad you appreciate me .
I was more than just a guy who had two girls a day . "
In 1951 , Curtis married Janet Leigh .
" She had a magnificent bosom , " he muses .
Although he says " women usually treated me badly " , I point out that he could not have been an ideal husband .
" Janet was unfaithful to me , " he says .
I venture he must have chased other women .
" Yes , I did , " he replies in an off - hand way .
" But only when , as with Janet , I could n't take the lunacy at home any more . "
And he claims that the prim Leigh , " who did n't really appreciate sex " , tried to " turn me into her idea of a gentleman .
She found me crude and clumsy , and then she went mad " .
He then tells me a story astonishing for its frankness .
One night , he was watching her sit at her dressing table .
She had a bottle of sleeping pills in her hand .
" She took all 14 pills out and started popping them in her mouth .
I hit her really hard on the back so they all flew out of her .
Then I knew the marriage was over . "
The couple had a daughter , the actress Jamie Lee Curtis .
Curtis concedes in a melancholy way that he was a neglectful father .
" I feel Jamie does n't love me , maybe because I could n't stand to be around the house any more . "
After leaving Leigh , he married the German starlet Christine Kaufmann in 1963 .
It lasted three years .
" She was anti-Semitic .
I worry about that .
I think that because of the Iraq war , anti-Semitism is on the increase again . "
He pauses .
" But I do n't get involved in politics . "
He then wed Leslie Allen , a model , before absconding with a teacher , Lisa Deutsch ( they divorced in 1994 ) .
Then tragedy struck when Nicholas , his son by Allen , died of a heroin overdose .
" You never get over that , " he mumbles .
" The death of a child .
No .
Ca n't talk about it . "
He squeezes my hand as if seeking silent reassurance .
Curtis had been dabbling with drugs himself .
In 1973 , he was busted for marijuana possession and then went on to harder narcotics , as his film career faded .
" I could have killed myself , " he recalls .
He went to the Betty Ford Centre and then took whatever film parts were available , consoling himself by painting .
( His pictures fetch up to £ 8,000 a canvas . )
He had much to console himself about .
He played roles in farces as Tarzan In Manhattan and Lobster Man From Mars .
" Did you play the lobster or the man ? " I ask .
He grins .
" Yeah , they were pretty bad .
But in those days , before Jill and full - time painting , I wanted to act - in anything .
I look back at the great films I did and am happy with that . "
Curtis will always be associated most with the cross-dressing Billy Wilder masterpiece Some Like It Hot , which co-starred Marilyn Monroe .
After filming that , he said , on being asked what it was like to kiss Monroe : " It was like kissing Hitler . "
This sentence has become part of movie lore .
Today , he says : " I said it as a joke .
I mean , it was such a darn stupid question , so I gave a stupid answer . "
Monroe and Curtis also had a history .
When they were both struggling in Hollywood in the early Fifties , the two became lovers .
Their brief liaison is described by Curtis with unabashed detail .
" She found it hard to reach orgasm .
We were both inexperienced , 22 or something .
It was a messy business . "
When they worked on Some Like It Hot , he says she had " gone funny .
Her mind was all over the place .
She had lost confidence " .
In one scene , Curtis and Monroe romance each other on the sofa of a yacht .
" It was awful , " he says .
" She nearly choked me to death by deliberately sticking her tongue down my throat into my windpipe . "
In the film , Curtis parodied the voice of his idol and friend Cary Grant , while pretending to be an eligible millionaire .
It was a brilliant piece of acting .
" I was really proud of that , " he says .
" They are all dead now .
Cary , Jack Lemmon , Sinatra , all my Hollywood friends .
Sometimes I feel so lonely . "
Today , he lives with Jill , who rescues horses , in Las Vegas , disdaining modern Hollywood and its " so - called stars " .
" Actors today achieve nothing , " he sighs .
" Nor do they have any glamour .
They seem more interested in adopting babies than films .
All the films are terrible , too , because the scripts are so bad and there are no decent film - makers .
So I stick to Jill and my paintings . "
Curtis met Jill in a restaurant .
She has short blonde hair and a very generous figure .
" But this time it 's not about her body , " Curtis tells me .
" It 's about talking , communicating . "
So the two - girl - a - day man has lost all interest in the hurly - burly of the chaise longue ?
" If the urge comes , it comes .
But you know , it 's a relief that it does n't bother me any more .
I finally feel free .
Sitting here now , I am so content . "
The last heartthrob from Hollywood 's Golden Age smiles and borrows a line from Sunset Boulevard : " And when my time comes , I 'm ready for my close - up , Mr De Mille . "
London Guardian | June 11 , 2008
The world is not running out of oil and can continue to produce hydrocarbons for the next 40 years provided restrictions are lifted on where companies can operate , the head of BP said today .
The Arctic and currently closed areas off the coast of America should be considered for exploration if rising global energy demand is to be met in future , said chief executive Tony Hayward .
He insisted that all other forms of energy , whether clean - tech or otherwise , also need to be developed simultaneously while rising carbon emissions could still be curbed .
" Declining oil production in the OECD highlights the fact that , while resources are not a constraint globally , the resources within reach of private investment by companies like BP are limited , " said Hayward .
" Political factors , barriers to entry , and high taxes all play a role here .
In other words when it comes to producing more oil , the problems are above ground , not below it .
They are not geological , but political , " he added .
Some of the difficulties of access were in nations such as Venezuela , Russia and the Middle East which have adopted clear policies of resource nationalism where the state has grabbed assets previously in the hands of independent oil companies , but Hayward also noted the 92 % of the US is off - limits and the Arctic needed opening up .
The BP boss was talking at the launch of his company ’s annual statistical review of world energy which showed that world oil consumption grew by 1.1 % in 2007 , or 1 m barrels a day , slightly below the 10 - year average , while production fell by 0.2 % , or 130,000 barrels a day , the first decline in five years .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Barack Obama is shaking his head .
" No , no , no , no , no . "
His slim figure had been bent forward in a folding chair ( prime position to radiate outsized charm ) .
But my question - does he consider corporate America a destructive force ?
- prompts him to bolt upright to a more defensive pose .
It 's a purposely provocative query , but a fair one :
When Obama talks about business , it 's usually to complain about corporate tax breaks or trade deals or jobs shipped overseas .
High - paid CEOs are the familiar villains in his stump speeches , including the one he has just given on this Raleigh fairground .
Free - market critics look at his varied plans to raise taxes and pronounce him hostile to wealth creation and market growth .
And in a small but telling episode during the Indiana primary , his campaign used a 2007 Fortune cover story - " Business Loves Hillary " - to attack Clinton , as if " business " were a dirty word , not the nation 's economic engine .
So ?
" There 's a reason why the business community in Chicago as a whole has been very supportive of me , " he says .
" They know I am a pro-growth guy , and I 'm a pro-market guy .
And I always have been .
What I do get frustrated with is an economy that is out of balance , that rewards a very few - with rewards that are all out of proportion to their actual success - while ordinary , hardworking Americans continue to get squeezed .
Over the last decade or so , this economy grew substantially , and more than half of the total growth was captured by the top 1 % . "
Here , the great reconciler pauses , just briefly , to give due to forces that are n't easy targets of political blame .
" Now part of that has to do with globalization and with global capital being able to move everywhere it wants .
It has meant a winner - take - all environment . "
But , he adds , quickly returning to Washington politics , " a lot of it has to do with tax policies " that favor the big winners .
That means President Bush 's policies , and by extension those of Obama 's rival , John McCain .
We are sitting in a bare , cinderblock room next to the hall where he has just kicked off a two - week tour to promote his economic plan .
" I love the heat - I just do n't like wearing suits in the heat , " he explains as we take refuge from a 100 - plus - degree North Carolina afternoon , and he politely asks permission to take off his suit jacket and drape it on the back of his chair .
I think back to the first Obama campaign rally I covered , picking through treacherous ice patches in the parking lot of an Iowa high school gym , where earnest troops of volunteers operated under the motto Respect , Empower , Include , as if they were prepping for a Boy Scout jamboree .
The first - term Senator from Illinois - unheard of on the national scene until his " audacity of hope " speech at the 2004 Democratic convention - was an improbable nominee .
Yet five months later , this political upstart had dashed a former First Lady 's carefully laid plans , and with Kennedy - like cool , laid claim to the Democratic nomination .
Now November suddenly looms , and Obama must court an audience far larger than the nearly 18 million voters who checked his name in the Democratic primaries - most of whom told pollsters they were either " liberal " or " very liberal . "
He must win over not only skeptical independents but also a like number of Democratic Clinton voters - many of them in key swing states and some of whom worry that Obama is too far to the left or too inexperienced to govern .
Toward the business community , he will build on a message of " tough love " that he has delivered since he landed in Detroit a year ago to tell the auto industry he would impose strict emissions standards , but in return help them with crippling health - care costs .
In the coming months voters will hear that a decade - long middle - class squeeze hurts business , because it " reduces demand for the stuff that companies are selling , " says his economic advisor , Austan Goolsbee .
Therefore , he argues , business should support Obama 's plan to shift the tax burden toward the wealthy and raise the federal minimum wage to $ 9.50 over two years ( under current law it goes to $ 6.55 in July ) .
As Obama says on the campaign trail , " In America , prosperity has always risen from the bottom up . "
Likewise , he argues , increased regulatory oversight , capital requirements , and transparency standards will help capital markets by injecting stability .
More federal spending on education and basic science will improve workforce quality .
" I still believe that the business of America is business , " Obama told Fortune .
" But what I also think is that with all that power and talent , and all those resources at their disposal , comes some responsibilities - to not game the system , to not oppose increased transparency in the marketplace , to not oppose fiscally prudent measures to balance our budget . "
Obama insists that he 's a pragmatist , not an ideologue .
" We 're not an ideological people , " he says .
" We 're a commonsense people who say , ' What 's going to work ? ' and ' Let 's figure it out . ' "
His voting record , however , is among the most liberal in the Senate , reflecting the sensibility of a former community organizer who for 20 years belonged to a church that urged congregants to disavow the pursuit of middle - classness .
During the primary campaign , his rhetoric was sharply populist , denouncing big business and blaming the shift of jobs overseas on free - trade agreements .
" He 's the least influenced by corporations and CEOs " of any candidate , proclaimed Anna Burger , president of the union coalition Change to Win. Obama was so tightly aligned with labor leaders , embracing a legislative measure to promote union organizing , that it 's still hard to find any points of disagreement .
Yet there are hints that the presumed Democratic nominee 's economic agenda remains a work in progress - and will evolve toward his ambition to win in November .
Already his circle of advisors has expanded beyond a small core of academics to include veteran capitalists inside the Democratic Party .
In late March he gave a thoughtful if sometimes vague speech on the need for more financial - markets supervision , which was heavily influenced by advice from former Fed chairman Paul Volcker .
He is frequently on the phone with billionaire CEO Warren Buffett ( " one of my favorite people , " says Obama , " he 's just completely down - to - earth and as smart as they come " ) , a critic of the financial industry and of tax breaks for the rich who also happens to understand capital markets better than just about anyone .
Obama calls on Apple 's Steve Jobs to help him " think about how to be successful and nimble in the current global environment . "
Advice also comes from Wall Street veterans like J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Centerbridge Partners founder Mark Gallogly - as well as longtime Chicago friends Penny Pritzker of Hyatt ( who runs his campaign finances ) , Ariel Capital 's John Rogers , and investor James S. Crown .
In his first management act as de facto Democratic nominee , Obama signaled that he might inch toward the center .
He enraged labor leaders and liberal activists by appointing Jason Furman to run his economic team .
Furman directed the Hamilton Project , a Brookings Institution -- based initiative sponsored by former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , a centrist and pariah among hard - core liberals .
Furman has defended free - trade agreements , and at a time when unions were on the warpath against Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , he produced a research paper arguing that the chain 's low prices are a boon to low - income consumers .
On the same day that Furman 's appointment was announced , Obama told CNBC he might consider deferring some of his tax increases if the economy remains in bad shape .
According to Furman , Obama will consider cutting the corporate tax rate while revising the tax code to eliminate business incentives to accumulate more debt and to discourage moves offshore .
And in Obama 's interview with Fortune , the candidate suggested that his overheated rhetoric on NAFTA was just that - overheated rhetoric .
Asked what single economic concern worries him most and will be uppermost on his mind if he steps into the Oval Office next January , Obama said energy supplies .
" It 's not a problem I think we can drill our way out of , " he says .
" It can be a drag on our economy for a very long time unless we take steps to innovate and invest in the research and development that 's needed to find alternative fuels , to make our transportation system more energy efficient , retool our industry and our buildings . "
But to encourage a transition toward alternatives , Obama favors legislation that would make fossil fuel more expensive .
Does n't that mean more pain to come under an Obama presidency ?
" There is no doubt that in the short term , adapting to this new energy economy is going to carry some costs . "
But , he adds , citing the coal industry 's ability to adapt to stop acid rain in the 1980s , " I would never underestimate the power of American innovation . "
****
During this year 's long , hard - fought primary campaign , Obama had about the same effect on his audiences as Bruce Springsteen did on his breakout Born to Run tour .
This time they had seen the future of the Democratic Party , and its name was Barack Obama .
In Iowa they braved below - zero wind gusts ; in balmy Oregon they had to contend with each other : a throng of 70,000 human beings gathered on the Portland waterfront .
By contrast , this June kickoff to the general election campaign is oddly subdued - as if the excitement over the freshness of his candidacy , his message of unity and optimism , has n't carried over to the mostly traditional Democratic policy prescriptions he offers in the small print of his campaign .
Here in Raleigh , there are empty seats sprinkled about rather than hourlong lines to get in .
His audience is respectful but lacks the mass energy that transformed this 46 - year - old Harvard Law graduate into a national phenomenon .
And anyone hoping for an innovative response to the previous week 's outpouring of bad economic news will be disappointed .
At the climax of his speech , Obama offers ... another $ 50 billion federal stimulus plan .
Bill Clinton jumped to the front of the pack in 1992 with a commitment to break with liberal orthodoxy , promising to balance the budget and " end welfare as we know it . "
Obama has praised Ronald Reagan for bringing optimism , dynamism , and a sense of entrepreneurship that changed the " trajectory of America . "
Likewise , Obama burst on the scene as an inspiring and inclusive leader , one offering a " politics of practicality vs. ideology . "
A standard applause line was , " It 's easy to be against something .
It 's harder to be for something . "
Money poured in , and he used it to build a nimble , efficient , and admirably honorable campaign operation .
His critics say that , unlike Reagan or Clinton , there 's not much that is daring or innovative in his economic policies .
The core of Obama 's economic plan is
( a ) more government spending : $ 65 billion a year for universal health insurance , $ 15 billion a year on alternative energy , $ 20 billion to help homeowners avoid default , $ 60 billion to bolster the nation 's infrastructure , $ 10 billion annually to give students college tuition in exchange for public service , and on and on ;
and ( b ) shifting the tax burden upward : ending the Bush tax cuts on families making more than $ 250,000 and raising payroll taxes on those same higher - income earners ( the latter meant to bolster Social Security without cutting benefits or raising the retirement age ) .
Middle - class earners would receive tax cuts , and low - income seniors would pay no income tax .
Combined with a tax rebate as part of this new $ 50 billion stimulus plan , he argues , putting more money in the hands of middle - class consumers will help them cope with the income squeeze as well as rising energy prices .
Obama also wants to raise a range of other taxes on business and investment .
He would increase the 15 % capital gains tax rate - probably to 25 % , according to advisors , though he excludes small businesses and new ventures from the tax altogether .
He would raise the dividends tax , reinstate a 45 % tax on estates worth more than $ 3.5 million , and close $ 1.3 trillion in " corporate tax loopholes . "
The thinking behind those tax hikes comes in part from Goolsbee , a University of Chicago economist who has studied behavioral response to economic policies .
Goolsbee believes the Republican argument that lower tax rates - by spurring investment and productivity - end up generating more revenue than they lose is overblown .
( He notes that Obama wants to go back to the rates of the '90s , when the economy was booming . )
Instead , he believes the tax code should be used to ease financial pressures on the middle class .

In mid-February , as the Democratic primary contest between Obama and Clinton moved toward the Rustbelt , the populist rhetoric of both candidates sharpened .
Both candidates blamed free trade for factory closings .
And in a move that unnerved leaders around the globe and prompted top House Democrats to distance themselves , both Obama and Clinton vowed to opt out of America 's most important standing free - trade agreement , NAFTA .
The pact linking Mexico , Canada , and the U.S. into a North American free - trade zone was Bill Clinton 's signature accomplishment , but NAFTA is also the bugaboo of unions , liberal activists , and plenty of angry Midwesterners looking for a root cause of factory closings .
Obama jumped right into the antitrade waters with Clinton , calling NAFTA " devastating " and " a big mistake " - even though a 2005 Congressional Research Service study showed the pact had a mild positive effect on the U.S. and Mexican economies .
Obama 's own advisor , Goolsbee , had argued that America 's wage gap was the result of a globalized information economy - not free trade .
There were signs back then that Obama 's view was more conflicted .
On Feb .
8 , Goolsbee met with the Canadian consul general in Chicago and offered assurances that Obama 's rhetoric was " more reflective of political maneuvering than policy , " according to a Canadian memo summarizing the meeting and obtained by Fortune .
" In fact , he mentioned that going forward the Obama camp was going to be careful to send the appropriate message without coming off as too protectionist . "
With the primary contest over , I asked Obama to clarify his remarks on NAFTA .
" I think that sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified , " he concedes .
Did his ?
" Politicians are always guilty of that , and I do n't exempt myself . "
During a debate before the Texas and Ohio primaries , Obama said , " We should use the hammer of a potential opt - out " to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA .
Now , however , he says he does n't plan to unilaterally reopen NAFTA , that he had just spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that morning ( Harper had called to congratulate him on the nomination ) , and that " I 'm looking forward to a conversation with him .
I 'm a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people . "
Obama also argues that " there are costs to free trade " :
He notes that under NAFTA , a more efficient and modernized U.S. agricultural industry displaced Mexican farmers , producing more immigrants .
We " ca n't pretend that those costs are n't real .
My job as President is to take those into account . "
Otherwise , he says , it feeds " the protectionist sentiment and the anti-immigration sentiment that is out there in both parties . "
***
The Author of " Dreams From My Father " and " The Audacity of Hope " is , at root , a storyteller .
So he has a narrative on the troubled U.S. economy behind his stump - speech observation : " We did not arrive at the doorstep of our current economic crisis by some accident of history .
This was not an inevitable part of the business cycle that was beyond our power to avoid . "
Today 's mortgage - market troubles , according to the Obama camp , are the inevitable result of a middle - class squeeze that President Bush never addressed .
" It left people with no margin for error , " notes Goolsbee .
" The savings rate goes to zero .
People start taking money out of their houses .
And a powder keg gets lit when a downturn comes . "
The next potential implosion , he says , is credit card debt , and Obama has proposed a consumer bill of rights that restricts card companies ' ability to raise rates and creates a federal credit - card rating system .
At the center of Obama 's plan to help ease the middle - class crunch would be a requirement that nearly all businesses provide health insurance or contribute to a government - backed " purchasing pool " that includes private plans and one public plan like Medicare .
Since there is no mandate that adults buy insurance ( as there was in Clinton 's plan ) , critics note that healthy young people will opt out altogether , making an expensive government program even more costly .
( Obama says he will pay for the program by ending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy . )
While Obama insists that " we do n't need more heat , we need more light " in Washington , his plans to increase spending and taxes - to " make the most fortunate pay more of their fair share , " as he puts it - is certain to generate plenty of heated opposition from business and taxpayer advocates .
Already , though , Team Obama is on the prowl for areas of consensus , pointing to growing calls by business leaders for health - care reform , for energy independence , for a more skilled workforce , for investments in the country 's physical infrastructure - roads and bridges and communications networks .
Obama argues that American business needs government help to stay competitive in the global economy .
He has made believers out of Chicago 's business leaders - now he has four months to persuade the rest of America that it 's not just spending he wants , it 's investment in the future .
This weblog post is at least a decade in the making .
Seriously .
I wrote the original version of this sometime in the late ’90s as a mailing list post , then revised it again when someone at Apple asked for tequila recommendations .
Likely forwarded it a dozen times or so in the interim years .
Every time I forward it , I said “ I should weblog this thing ” .
So , here it is — with some additional edits , too .
Like my “ So you wanna buy a big green egg ” post , I ’ll likely edit this over the coming years , too .
I ’m going to break this into two separate posts ; one about tequila and one about margaritas .
Eventually , I ’ll make a third post about cooking , agave , and tequila .
First , Cuervo Gold is not good tequila .
It is actually a really terrible product , quality wise , backed by some brilliant market .
Sadly , most of the tequila consumed in the United States is Cuervo Gold or something equally as bad .
And by “ bad ” , I mean bad taste and vicious hangover .
Good tequila is almost always a tequila that is made from alcohol distilled from 100 % blue agave .
Specifically , the species Agave Weber Tequilana .
This plant of the class Liliopsida ( Lilies ) has nothing to do with cactus .
Blue agave is grown primarily in the Mexican state of Jalisco .
More specifically , Cuervo gold is a Tequila Mixto , Joven Abocado or , more precisely , young and adulterated tequila .
By Mexican law , adulterated tequilas are at least 51 % blue agave .
The other 49 % is generally comprised of the absolute cheapest , nastiest , sugar cane based liquor .
If you are familiar with big city corner bodegas , the cheap rum in the plastic bottle on the bottom shelf behind the counter .
“ Bum rum ” we called it in NYC .
Adulterated tequila would not have any color .
To give it color and take a bit of edge off , Cuervo ( and others ) add caramel .
This ultra-nasty combination of cheap cane sugar alcohol and low quality agave distillate is the reason for the vicious hangover .
Those massive nasty sugar molecules ( Nonsense — massive nasty adultrants , as Sean points out in comments ) break down into all sorts of evils that take your body a long time to metabolize .
Hence , a Cuervo / adulterated tequila hangover is a trip through hell .
If all you have had is Cuervo ( or Mezcal with a worm in it ) , then you really ought to give a true 100 % blue agave tequila a chance … it is a night and day kind of experience .
Not all adulterated tequilas are bad .
There are some excellent adulterated tequilas available , but they are very hard to find .
Visit Tommy ’s and Julio has ’em all .
Of the 100 % blue agave tequilas , there are 3 4 kinds ; blanco , reposado , anejo , and extra anejo .
Extra anejo was created in 2006 as a new market segment identifier .
It is important to note that , in all segments , there are examples of tequilas that are excellent for sipping straight and others that are really only appropriate in a mix .
Blanco or Silver
A relatively unaged tequila .
That is , the tequila is made from alcohol fermented from sugars found in the blue agave plant and then distilled .
This is generally filtered such that it is bottled as a clear liquid , typically once fermentation is finished .
Some blancos will be rested for upwards of 45 days , typically in large stainless steel tanks .
Some distilleries will oxygenate the tequila during this period of time , taking a bit of the edge off of the flavors .
Blanco or silver tequilas are generally fruitier and will have a bit of a bite to them .
Personally , a good blanco margarita is my favorite kind .
El Tesoro , Herradura , and Fortaleza all make stellar blanco tequilas .
Note that El Tesoro Platinum ( blanco ) has just a tiny bit of color .
Unlike most tequilas , it is actually distilled to proof — that is , distilled to the bottling strength and not diluted down to bottle strength with water .
It has less filtration and , thus , just a bit of color usually .
El Tesoro Platinum provides one of the most herbaceous of the silver tequilas , offering the distinct flavors of the highland agave from which it is made .
The Partida bottle on the right in the first picture in this post is Partida ’s excellent blanco , the absolutely clarity of which is obvious in that picture .
The tequila pouring out of the spout and through the bit of cheese cloth is about 70 % alcohol agave distillate that , with water added to bring it down to 40 % ABV , would be Centinela blanco .
Reposado
This is a slightly aged or “ rested ” tequila .
The tequila in this segment is aged for more than 2 months but less than a year in oak barrels of any size ; often hundreds of gallons .
The aging process takes a bit of the bite and fruitiness off of the tequila , replacing it with a touch of the wood within which the liquid is stored .
Many common and relatively cheap , decent quality , brands are often reposados .
Some examples include Hornitos ( a Sauza brand ) , Cazadores , and Cabrito .
Of the three , Cabrito — Centinela ’s discounted label — is , by far , the best .
Of these , I would only use them in margaritas .
I prefer reposados because they carry forth both the distinct flavors of the agave used in production and the style of distillation and aging implied by the distillery .
My two favorite general purpose sipping ( i.e. awesome quality casual sipping or mixing tequilas ) tequilas are both reposados .
From the town of Tequila in the heartlands of Jalisco comes Fortaleza , made by Guillermo Erickson Sauza ( fifth generation in the Sauza family ) .
El Tesoro Reposado is made in the highlands town of Arandas by the Camarena family .
In the united states , once you move beyond the mixtos , the most commonly sold tequilas are either silvers or anejos .
Not so in Mexico .
The most commonly sold tequilas in Jalisco are reposados .
When a family — an extended family in US terms — gathers for a meal , you ’ll typically see a bottle of reposado or two on the table .
Some drink it straight , some mixed with grapefruit juice and / or fresca .
This is n’t surprising .
Reposados offer a bit more smoothness — more sippable oakiness — than blancos , while still preserving the characteristic vegetal flavors from the agave .
And they are considerably cheaper than anejos .
Nothing beats a lazy sunday afternoon meal of tortillas , carnitas , various veggies and salsas , accompanied by a great reposado and a handful of different refreshing fruit juices and sodas to mix it with !
Anejo
To be in this class , a tequila must be aged in small oak barrels .
Typically , in 55 gallon bourbon , whiskey or cognac barrels ( though occasionally aged in anything from port to new oak barrels ) .
Due to the aging in small batches in previously used liquor barrels , an Anejo tequila will take on the flavor of whatever was aged in the barrel .
Aging can last anywhere from 1 to 3 years , after which it becomes an extra anejo .
Some tequilas are aged in multiple kinds of barrels and then blended afterwords , possibly with more aging and often falling , again , in the category of extra anejo .
During aging in these smaller barrels , upwards of 20 % of the liquid in the barrel is lost per year due to evaporation .
This loss is called the angel ’s share and , given the volume lost , there must be some awesome angel parties in Mexico .
The loss can be reduced by humidifying the aging warehouse / cave , but doing so both changes the nature of the resulting product and runs the risk of molds or other evil bugs taking up residence in the barrel wood , potentially ruining whole barrels .
Flavors for well made Anejos move more towards scotches , whiskeys , bourbons , and the like .
That is , you ’ll taste more of the wood , it will typically be smoother , and there will be less of a vegetal flavor .
Extra Anejo
This category was created in 2006 to provide an at - a - glance means of identifying the relatively rare tequilas that are aged for more than 3 years .
Obviously , the angel ’s share for a 3 + year old tequila is significantly larger and , thus , most of the tequila ’s in this class are considerably more expensive .
This is also the category where you will find tequilas that have been aged in multiple barrel types , blended and then aged more .
Flavors in this category tend to be more unique and more intense , with some extra anejos approaching 20 + year old scotch in intensity and smoothness .
Interestingly , tequila really does n’t change much when it is left in the barrel for more than 7 years .
Because the evaporation rate is high , the claim is that the aging process is accelerated .
That does seem to be the case in that tequila picks up the flavors of the wood and gains an aged smoothness much more rapidly than scotches .
Certainly , after 7 years in the barrel with 10 % or 15 % of the remaining volume lost per year , the concentration of the flavors in the remaining liquid will increase rapidly !
There exists awesome tequilas in all of the above market segments and any good tequila will make a good margarita , too .
A good margarita should carry through the flavors of the tequila used , though some of the subtleties of an anejo or extra anejo will be lost .
I have been harsh on Cuervo .
Cuervo does make some great tequilas .
Their “ Reserva De L’Familia ” line is 100 % blue agave and it is quite delicious .
However , it is relatively expensive and I find the flavors to be overwhelming .
For considerably less money , it is easy to find much better quality products .

I recently discussed with a friend how to handle irregular paychecks .
Her husband is a teacher and will be getting a lump sum payment at the beginning of the summer .
She was concerned about how to make the money last .
It reminded me of a couple other situations , such as how we handled my 5 month unpaid maternity leave and how to handle irregular paychecks for a small business or freelance work .
Here ’s how you can approach each of these situations without overspending .
Lump Sum
Let ’s walk through the example I gave with my friend – getting a payment upfront for a given amount of time .
Put the money away immediately .
I directed her to put the money in an ING account .
I like ING because you can create separate accounts for different purposes .
Create a new “ paycheck ” account to hold this money .
Calculate a paycheck amount .
If the money should last all summer , and he was used to what would normally be 7 bi-weekly paychecks during the summer , divide the lump sum by 7 .
Schedule your paychecks .
In ING you can set up a set of transfers .
Schedule all 7 transfers to your checking account bi-weekly for the whole summer .
Adjust your budget .
You may find that the “ new paychecks ” will be lower than your old ones .
Various things could impact this based on the way the employer calculated the time period or because of the differences in tax withholding .
Adjust your budget to cover any shortfall .
Relax .
You no longer have to worry that in August you ’ll have already run through all the money , as your newly scheduled “ paychecks ” will arrive as scheduled .
Small Business or Irregular Paychecks
When you run your own small business or typically receive irregular paychecks due to freelance or contract work it may be easier to smooth your income into your checking account .
Consider yourself your own employee and create a schedule of paychecks .
Create a holding account .
Similar to the steps above you ’ll want to create a separate account to house all your incoming money .
Calculate a minimum .
Determine the least amount of money that you can get by on each pay period .
This will be your “ minimum paycheck . ”
Calculate a target .
Determine how many times you predict that you wo n’t bring in the minimum to pay yourself your paycheck and by how much .
Total these amounts and add some additional money just in case .
This target number is how large of a buffer you ’ll want in your account .
Transfer your paychecks .
Each pay period , transfer your “ minimum paycheck ” to your checking account .
Leave any additional money in the account to build the buffer .
This will enable you to still get your minimum paycheck at times when your incoming money is n’t enough to meet the minimum paychecks .
Give yourself more money .
At some point it ’ll be time for a bonus or a raise .
Once you reach your target , if you see that your holding account is continually growing , you can either raise the minimum paycheck or give yourself a one - time bonus .
Saving for Unpaid Time
I used a similar approach for handling 5 months without a paycheck .
Calculate the total unpaid time off .
Determine the total amount of money that you wo n’t receive and how long of a time period it will cover .
Set a savings goal .
Divide the total amount by how much time you have until the event begins .
For example , if you want to save $ 5,000 in the next 8 months before a baby is born , you ’ll want to set aside $ 625 per month .
Save the money .
Put the money in a holding account so you are n’t tempted to spend it on something else .
Calculate and draw paychecks .
Once your unpaid time begins , calculate and schedule the paychecks similar to the lump sum method above .
Action Plan
I ’m currently working on establishing a paycheck system similar to the one above for our business .
It helps a lot with planning , budgeting and the overall stress level of money management .
My next step is to calculate a target amount for the months with a shortfall .
Have you dealt with irregular paychecks ?
How did you handle it ?
This article is featured in : Carnival of Personal Finance , # 159 : The First Zero-Emissions City .
You may have also recently seen Dan Rather 's report The Ethanol Solution , in which he gushes over Brazil 's ethanol success and wonders why we do n't heed their example .
Perhaps you heard Frank Sesno on CNN's We Were Warned ask why the U.S. is not following Brazil 's example .
The mainstream media have it figured out .
The politicians have it figured out .
Many ordinary Americans have it figured out .
We just need to apply the Brazilian example to the U.S. , and we will end our dependence on foreign oil .
But is it as simple as that ?
Let 's investigate .
According to Per Capita Oil Consumption and Production , oil consumption in Brazil is 4.2 barrels per person per year .
In the U.S. , oil consumption is 27 barrels per person per year , 6.4 times as much per person as Brazil's .
However , we do produce much more oil per person than Brazil .
Each year the U.S. produces 11 barrels per person , compared to 3.35 barrels per person for Brazil .
In order to achieve energy independence , the gap between demand and production must be closed .
Brazil has to close a gap of 0.85 barrels per person per year ( 4.2 - 3.35 ) .
They produce sufficient ethanol to close this gap , and therefore they are energy independent .
The U.S. , on the other hand , has to close a gap of 16 barrels per person per year .
The U.S. gap in production / demand is almost 19 times greater than the production / demand gap in Brazil .
Clearly , the U.S. has quite a large gap to close .
But this is a difficult proposition .
Not only do we use more energy per person , but the population of the U.S. is 110 million greater than that of Brazil .
According to my calculations , we can't possibly hope to close the production / demand gap with grain ethanol .
Others have shown the futility of closing that gap with cellulosic ethanol here and here .
The Real Lesson from Brazil
Yes , Brazil has in fact " figured it out " with respect to energy independence .
But the reason they achieved energy independence is primarily because of their frugal energy usage , not because of ethanol .
Increase their energy usage to U.S. levels , and the " energy independence miracle " would quickly vanish .
This is the factor that the media and the politicians have overlooked .
On the other hand , if the U.S. had the same per capita energy consumption as Brazil , we would be net oil exporters .
In fact , our per capita energy consumption could be 11 barrels per person per year - triple the consumption of Brazil - and our production and demand would be in balance .
We would be energy independent .
The real lesson from Brazil is that energy independence can be achieved by slashing our energy usage .
It is simply not realistic to expect the U.S. to achieve energy independence with biofuels - unless we sharply curb our consumption .
The next time you hear someone say we should emulate Brazil 's example , ask them to calculate the amount of ethanol this would require , and ask them how we are supposed to produce that much .
It is time to start demanding details from the " Brazil believers " .
In doing so , we may convey the gravity of the situation to those who think ethanol will lead us to energy independence .
Americans see the link between a country ’s education system and its economic prosperity .
But few appreciate how far behind U.S. schools have fallen .
Nearly nine in 10 of those surveyed by the Associated Press in a poll released on Friday said the quality of education in a country has a large impact on the nation ’s [… ]
New media meme : candidate flip - flops no longer matter
In 2004 , the Bush - Cheney campaign decided early on in the race exactly how they ’d define John Kerry : “ flip - flopper . ”
The charge was quickly parroted by the media , and reinforced the Republican campaign ’s narrative : in the first post - 9/11 election , in a time of war , we do n’t want someone who ’s inconsistent .
Four years later , it ’s the Republican who has reversed course on literally dozens of issues .
And now , the media has decided that the dreaded flip - flops really do n’t matter after all .
Time ’s Michael Scherer sounds bored with all the talk about policy reversals .
[ T ]he legacy of Bush / Cheney ’04 remains , and Democrats have apparently learned their lesson .
The core message of the Obama / DNC campaign is that McCain has flip - flopped on all his old maverick image .
The key message of the McCain / RNC campaign is that Obama is an opportunist who will flip - flop when it helps him politically .
And so it goes .
Every day , flip - flop charges bang up against the political press like moths on a screen door .
And we let some of them in , sometimes with the unexamined conceit that any shift in position is a window into the candidate ’s lack of character , toughness or principle .
Andrew Sullivan agrees that flip - flops no longer mean much .
It ’s often a completely idiotic way to analyze a candidate .
Sometimes a flip - flop is a sign of real maturity in a politician responding to new events or facts .
And sometimes , rigid consistency is disastrous .
The Washington Post ’s Ruth Marcus argued today that these policy reversals may actually be a good quality in a candidate , a sign of “ welcome pragmatism , ” and “ evidence of open - mindedness . ”
Marcus encouraged us to “ not flip out too much about flip - flops . ”
CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer came to a similar conclusion a couple of weeks ago , “ There ’s nothing wrong with people changing their minds .
We all do it – all the time . ”
What a remarkable coincidence .
When Kerry is charged as a flip - flopper , policy reversals become the central focus of the presidential campaign .
When McCain is exposed as having reversed course dozens of times , leading media voices announce , “ On second thought , all this flip - flop talk is kind of annoying . ”
To reiterate an argument I raised a few weeks ago , as the self - designated keeper of the Official List of McCain Flip - Flops , I thought I ’d take a moment to respond to this new , more tolerant , media perspective .
In short , there ’s nothing substantively wrong with what any of these journalists have argued .
I ’m very much inclined to agree that there ’s nothing offensive about a political figure changing his or her mind .
Policy makers come to one conclusion , they gain more information , and then they reach a different conclusion .
That is , to be sure , a good thing — it reflects a politician with an open mind and a healthy intellectual curiosity .
Better to have a leader who changes his or her mind based on new information than one who stubbornly sticks to outmoded policy positions , regardless of facts or circumstances .
So why do McCain ’s flip - flops matter ?
Because all available evidence suggests his reversals are n’t sincere , they ’re cynically calculated for political gain .
This is n’t indicative of an open mind ; it ’s actually indicative of a character flaw .
And given the premise of McCain ’s presidential campaign , it ’s an area in desperate need of media scrutiny .
I wo n’t bother republishing the full list of 48 that I ’ve come up with over the last several months —
I just ran it recently , Keith Olbermann promoted it on Monday , and I ’ll have an updated version next week — but go ahead and look it over , keeping an eye on the ideological trend .
Some of the reversals are because McCain is embarrassed by what he used to believe — he argued , for example , that the war in Iraq would be easy , which looks ridiculous now , and which leads him to argue that he knew all along that the war was “ probably going to be long and hard and tough . ”
Most of the flip - flops , though , show McCain dropping his centrist / moderate credentials in order to be more in line with today ’s Republican mainstream .
Tax cuts , foreign policy , immigration , abortion , the religious right , the environment , detainee policy , campaign finance reform .
In every instance , McCain was a “ maverick , ” willing to break with his party .
Now , he is n’t .
The perception people have of McCain is outdated , reflective of a man who no longer has any use for his previous persona .
What ’s wrong with a politician who changes his or her views ?
Nothing in particular , but when a politician changes his views so much that he has an entirely different worldview , and that new worldview is conveniently necessary to win his party ’s presidential nomination , is it unreasonable to wonder whether it ’s entirely sincere ?
Especially when there ’s no other apparent explanation for four dozen significant reversals ?
What ’s wrong with political leaders simply saying they ’ve had a change of heart ?
Nothing , just so long as it ’s genuine .
Given the circumstances , one would have to be hopelessly naive to think McCain , all of a sudden , out of the blue , just happened to reinvent himself and his policy agenda based on nothing more than a simple “ change of heart . ”
Are there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one ’s mind about a policy matter ?
Sure .
McCain has been in Congress for decades ; he ’s bound to shift now and then on various controversies .
But therein lies the point — McCain was consistent on most of these issues , right up until he started running for president , at which point he conveniently abandoned literally dozens of positions he used to hold .
The problem is n’t just the incessant flip - flops — though that ’s part of it — it ’s more about the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip - flops .
That the media still perceives McCain as some kind of “ straight talker ” who refuses to sway with the political winds makes this all the more glaring .
As Josh Marshall recently put it , “ McCain is absolutely gung - ho and certain that he ’s right about whatever his position and ‘ principles ’ are at the given moment .
But they change repeatedly . ”

A proposed new law in Sweden ( voted on this week , after much delay ) will , if passed , allow a secretive government agency ostensibly concerned with signals intelligence to install technology in twenty public hubs across the country .
There it will be permitted to conduct a huge mass data - mining project , processing and analysing the telephony , emails , and web traffic of millions of innocent individuals .
Allegedly these monitoring stations will be restricted to data passing across Sweden 's borders with other countries for the purposes of monitoring terrorist activity : but there seems few judicial or technical safeguards to prevent domestic communications from being swept up in the dragnet .
Sound familiar ?
The passing of the FRA law ( or " Lex Orwell " , as the Swedish are calling it ) next week is by no means guaranteed .
Many Swedes are up in arms over its provisions ( the protest Facebook group has over 5000 members ; the chief protest site links to thousands of angry commenters across the Web ) .
With the governing alliance managing the barest of majorities in the Swedish Parliament , it would only take four MPs in the governing coalition opposing this bill to effectively remove it from the government 's agenda .
As with the debate over the NSA warrantless wiretapping program in the United States , much of this domestic Swedish debate revolves around how much their own nationals will be caught up with this dragnet surveillance .
But as anyone who has sat outside the US debate will know , there is a wider international dimension to such pervasive spying systems .
No promise that a dragnet surveillance system will do its best to eliminate domestic traffic removes the fact that it * will * pick up terabytes of the innocent communications of , and with , foreigners - especially those of Sweden 's supposed allies and friends .
Sweden is a part of the European Union : a community of states which places a strong emphasis on the values of privacy , proportionality , and the mutual defence of those values by its members .
But even as the EU aspires to being a closer , borderless community , it seems Sweden is determined to set its spies on every entry and exit to Sweden .
When the citizens of the EU talk to their Swedish colleagues , what happens to their private communications then ?
When revelations regarding the United Kingdom 's involvement in a UK - US surveillance agreement emerged in 2000 , the European Parliament produced a highly critical report ( and recommended that EU adopt strong pervasive encryption to protect its citizens ' privacy ) .
Back then , UK's cavalier attitude to European communications , and its willingness to hand that data to the United States and other non-EU countries , greatly concerned Europe 's elected legislators .
Already questions are being asked in the European Parliament about Sweden 's new plans and their effect on European citizen 's personal data .
Commercial companies like TeliaSonera have moved servers out of Sweden to prevent their customers from being wiretapped by the Swedish Department of Defence .
Sweden 's own business community have expressed concern that companies may move out of Sweden to protect their private financial data .
Sweden has often led the charge for government openness and consumer advocacy , and has , understandably , much national pride in seeing its past policies exported and reflected in Europe and beyond .
Before Sweden 's
MPs vote next week to allow its government surveillance access to whole Net , they should certainly consider its effect on their Swedish citizens ' privacy .
But it should also ponder exactly how their vote will be seen by their closest neighbors .
If the Lex Orwell passes , Sweden may not need something so sophisticated as a supercomputer to hear what the rest of the world thinks about their new values .
Marks on the skulls showed they had been hit by an axe
Prehistoric man may have executed rivals from neighbouring tribes to steal their women , research has found .
A study of 7,000 - year - old skeletons , led by Durham University scientists , found that one of the burial groups consisted only of men and children .
This indicated that the women were spared and their capture could have been the motive for the attack .
The findings , from a burial pit in Talheim , Germany , are published in the journal Antiquity .
The 34 skeletons were discovered in the 1980s , but new studies of different types ( isotopes ) of atoms in their teeth show that they came from three groups - locals , cattle - herders and a " family " of a man , woman and two children .
All the skeletons bore marks to the left side of the skull showing that they were hit in the head with an axe , indicating they were executed while bound .
' Tribal warfare '
The scientists concluded the absence of local females meant they were captured instead .
Dr Alex Bentley , from Durham University 's Anthropology Department , said : " It seems this community was specifically targeted , as could happen in a cycle of revenge between rival groups .
" Although resources and population were undoubtedly factors in central Europe around that time , women appear to be the immediate reason for the attack .
" Our analysis points to the local women being regarded as somehow special and were therefore kept alive . "
Dr Bentley added : " It looks like tribal warfare on a small scale .
" It 's crucial for a group which has a very small population to have access to mates . "
First time in Gallup history a majority see their financial situations as worse than the year before
PRINCETON , NJ --
A majority of Americans say they are worse off financially than a year ago , marking the first time in Gallup 's 32 - year history of asking the question that more than half of Americans give this pessimistic assessment .
The previous high on this " worse off than a year ago " measure was back in 1982 , in the first years of the Reagan administration , when 47 % of those interviewed said they were worse off .
When Gallup last asked this question in late January / early February of this year , 44 % said they were worse off .
Only 26 % of Americans now say they are better off financially than a year ago .
This is one point shy of the all - time low reading on this measure , 25 % , recorded several times from 1982 to 1990 .
At the same time , Americans remain on a relative basis at least somewhat optimistic about the future .
Fifty - two percent believe they will be better off financially a year from now than they are now , while just 31 % say they will be worse off .
This " optimism " measure is actually quite a bit more positive than it has been at other times .
The lowest reading on the " will be better off " measure is 33 % , recorded in 1979 , and the readings have been below 50 % at several other points since then .
The highest optimism reading occurred in March 1998 , when 71 % said they anticipated being better off in a year than they were at the moment .
Implications
The bad news from these data is clear : A record number of Americans have become convinced that their personal financial situations have deteriorated over the last year .
Perhaps the high price of gasoline and the impact it is having on Americans ' budgets is a major factor in these perceptions ( although it should be noted that the negative read on the measure is worse than at other times when there was a sudden run-up in the price of gas ) .
Because Americans are usually more positive about their personal situations than the situation " out there " more broadly , the record - high negative reading when the public is asked about its own financial situations suggests that the current economic downturn is having a significant personal impact .
The good news is that Americans have not lost their typical pattern of optimism : a little more than half retain some optimism that their financial situations will get better in the year ahead .
In fact , a review of the history of asking these two questions shows that optimism is certainly the rule .
There has never been a time when Americans have been more pessimistic than optimistic about their finances ; and despite the sharp uptick in negative mood , that generally more optimistic attitude continues today .

WIRED VISION に掲載された、日本のカレーをこよなく愛する米国人記者の文章が話題になっている。
「 その豊かでクリーミーな味わいを出すのにどんな材料を使っているのか、私にはほとんど分からなかったが、クラックコカインが入っていることはまず間違いないと思われた」など、暴君ハバネロとアメリカ人上司のコピペを思い起こさせるノリノリな文体がなんとも可笑しいが、これで「抄訳」だってどれだけ熱くカレーについて書いてんだよ！
しかし、この著者はただのカレーキチガイではなく、Wired の Game | Life Blog を執筆する 、Wikipedia にもページがあるゲームジャーナリストなのよね。
彼には二冊著作があり、そのうち一冊は邦訳もされている。我々はこういう人をもっと大切にしなくてはならんよ。
Cassel :
If the president deems that he's got to torture somebody , including by crushing the testicles of the person 's child , there is no law that can stop him ?
Yoo : No treaty .
Cassel : Also no law by Congress -- that is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo ...
Yoo : I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that .
-- Human rights expert Doug Cassel and John Yoo , 12/1/05
Why the President thinks he needs to do that is , apparently , the ticking time - bomb scenario , a thought - experiment first proposed some thirty years ago and now widely regarded as reflecting the real world .
Here 's another thought - experiment : Attorney General Mukasey admits that he personally would consider waterboarding torture , but can't say whether waterboarding is legally torture because if the bad guys know it 's illegal then their awful plots are safe from being revealed by waterboarding .
Therefore , the only way to make sure terrorists think they will be waterboarded is to keep secret whether it 's legal or illegal .
Presumably the AG knows whether waterboarding is legally torture or not ; we also understand that the success of his mission ( indeed , his very job ) depends on not telling the truth .
We decide the best way to find out if torture is legal is to waterboard him .
And so , wet and sputtering , ( remember , it 's only a thought - experiment ) he finally says " Yes it 's legal " or " No , it 's not legal . "
Now what ?
We still have to decide whether he told the truth .
If he says it 's legal do we know that it is , or only that he said that to stop the torture ?
If he says it 's illegal - same business .
Better waterboard him again ... and again ... until we get the answer we want ?
or until he drowns ?
In fiction and fantasy , what the victim says under torture is a ' truth ' that justifies the rest of the story .
In the real world , real outcomes suggest that what people say under torture is almost never the truth .
Claims that torture stopped an attempt to blow up a dozen trans -Pacific aircraft in 1995 are false .
When the Manilla police arrested Abdul Hakim Murad they found his entire bomb plot on his laptop computer .
Murad was beaten and tortured for 67 days after that , but added no real intelligence - only confirmed some fabrications of his torturers .
Arguments for torture run up against practical , real - world problems .
Torture might be theoretically justifiable in certain very narrow circumstances within certain logical systems built on certain moral premises .
But these same constraints make it highly unlikely that all these conditions would converge at the same time and place .
Simply having the right terrorist in custody when the time - bomb starts ticking is highly unlikely .

Furthermore , a large and complex ( and expensive ) oversight system would be necessary to ensure that any torture was in fact appropriately justified and properly carried out .
Then there is a human dimension : a top FBI expert in interrogations noted : " Only a psychopath can torture and be unaffected .
You do n't want people like that in your organization .
They are untrustworthy , and tend to have grotesque other problems . "
" Ticking time bomb " scenarios are entirely fictional and highly improbable , but very compelling .
It 's easy to see why commercial news and entertainment media employ them : they work .
We buy them , not only commercially , but psychologically and socially , and we buy vast quantities of products and services , policies and wars associated with them .
There is a black market in torture , and a regular market -- our own CIA buys torture from biddable states .
Wars and all kinds of terrorism are collective torture , and mercenaries and arms - merchants are privateers in the business of selling torture and the implements of torture .
We need to ask ourselves why so many of us indulge in these brutal thought - experiments and engage with their underlying illogic , counterproductiveness and inhumanity .
We need to understand how human weakness for bullying , hurting , power , revenge , and anger can be so easily exploited for power , profit and pleasure .
And , critically , because the use of torture by people in power reflects an inability to deal in constructive ways with perceived threats , we need to know if candidates for president know the difference between a " ticking time bomb " fiction and the practical realities of government , laws , treaties , human values and humane relations with our neighbors .
Here 's how three candidates said they 'd handle the " ticking time bomb " thought - experiment :
McCain : " Should [ an interrogator use torture ] and thereby save an American city or prevent another 9/11 , authorities and the public would surely take this into account when judging his actions and recognize the extremely dire situation he confronted . "
Hillary Clinton : " Those are very rare , but if they occur , there has to be some lawful authority for pursuing it .... [ If ] we have sufficient basis to believe that there is something imminent , yeah , but then we 've got to have a check and balance on that . "
Obama :" The secret authorization of brutal interrogations is an outrageous betrayal of our core values , and a grave danger to our security ... torture is not a part of the answer - it is a fundamental part of the problem ....
Torture is how you create enemies , not how you defeat them .
Torture is how you get bad information , not good intelligence ...
When I am president America will ...[ stand ] up to these deplorable tactics .
When I am president we wo n't work in secret to avoid honoring our laws and Constitution , we will be straight with the American people and true to our values . "
A wide - ranging police study has concluded that the surge in immigrants from eastern Europe to Britain has not fuelled a rise in crime , the Guardian has learned .
The findings will be presented to the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , tomorrow when she meets chief constables to discuss the issue .
Several of them had complained that they needed more money to deal with increases in migrant populations in their areas .
However , the study prepared for the Association of Chief Police Officers challenges claims that up to 1 million people from EU accession countries have caused a rise in criminality .
The report finds that , despite newspaper headlines linking new migrants to crime , offending rates among mainly Polish , Romanian and Bulgarian communities are in line with the rate of offending in the general population .
A senior source with close knowledge of the report said : " Any rise has been broadly proportionate to the number of people from those communities coming into this country .
People are saying crime is rising because of this influx .
Given 1 million people have come in , that does n't make sense as crime is significantly down . "
The fall in the annual crime rate in England and Wales is accelerating , with a drop of 9 % recorded by police in the year to September 2007 , according to Home Office figures published earlier this year .
The report by Grahame Maxwell , chief constable of North Yorkshire , and Peter Fahy , who leads the Cheshire force , says that " resentment and misunderstanding " about why new migrants are coming to Britain has stoked tensions .
It calls for businesses benefiting from the new workers to do a better job of explaining the economic benefit of migrant workers .
The report says : " While overall this country has accommodated this huge influx with little rise in community tension , in some areas sheer numbers , resentment and misunderstanding , have created problems . "
It adds that the immigration from eastern Europe has been different to previous arrivals , because it happened much more quickly .
The report says that new migrants may be more likely to commit certain types of offences .
Polish people are linked to drink - driving , and problems have arisen in central London with some Romanian children being used by adults to commit petty robberies .
There are also problems with people trafficking and exploitation , but while these may be more likely in some migrant communities , other types of offences are less likely to occur .
The reports calls for new agreements with east European countries to share intelligence and information on less serious crimes , such as domestic violence and serial theft .
It also calls for immigration authorities , schools and the health service to share information with police about new nationalities in their areas .
The report is primarily based on intelligence gathered by detectives about crime patterns in different areas of England and Wales .
Police recording codes only contains the category " white Europeans " covering people originating from France to the Urals .
The report says more analysis is needed .
The source with close knowledge of the report said : " Given the number coming into the country , the problems have been very few in terms of criminality , increases in crime or community tensions .
" Most are coming here to earn money , most are professionals with qualifications , and they work then go home . "
The report says areas that have faced most demands include Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire because of the demand for agricultural workers , as well as Slough .
Cambridgeshire 's chief constable , Julie Spence , has warned of increased demands on her force and Kent 's chief constable , Mike Fuller , also reportedly wrote to ministers saying that the government 's failure to give his force more money was not taking account of the extra demands on his officers .
More than a century ago , Canadian physician William Osler prescribed diets low in sugar and fruits to prevent gout , an excruciatingly painful swelling of the joints that was known to mostly afflict middle - aged men overly fond of the drink and meat - rich meals .
Now research suggests
Osler may have been prescient in thinking a sweet tooth also contributed to what 's been dubbed " the disease of kings and the king of diseases . "
( Women also get gout , but far more rarely . )
A 12 - year study of more than 46,000 midlife men has found that men who frequently consume sugar - loaded soft drinks , fruit juices or whole fruits are vastly more likely to develop gout than those who ingest far more modest amounts .
Gout , thought to have afflicted Henry VIII and diagnosed in Charles Darwin and Benjamin Franklin , is caused by an excess of the waste product uric acid .
Too much uric acid in the blood causes crystals to be deposited in the joints , which can lead to severe inflammation and often intense pain .
Gout most often affects the big toe but can also occur in the ankle , knee , foot , hand , wrist or elbow .
Principal investigator Dr. Hyon Choi , a rheumatologist at the University of British Columbia , said study participants who consumed on average five servings of sweetened soft drinks per week had an 85 per cent higher risk of gout than those who drank less than one serving a month – or " less than a Coke per month . "
" The reason that sugar - sweetened soda drinks increased the risk is because of the sugar part of that drink , which is fructose ... from high - concentrated corn syrup , " Choi said from Vancouver .
However , consuming diet soft drinks containing no fructose did not raise gout risk , concluded the study published in today 's issue of the British Medical Journal .
Choi and his fellow researcher , Dr. Gary Curhan of Harvard Medical School in Boston , also looked to see whether it was just fructose from corn syrup – or also fructose in fruit juices and whole fruits that bumped up the chance of gout .
" Actually the latter is what we found to be true , " he said , noting that drinking large amounts of fruit juice or eating lots of ``oranges , apples " cranked up the likelihood of getting the ailment by 80 per cent compared to those with low intake .
" The main determinant is the sugaryness , the sweetness of the fruit , " he said .
More than 750 men in the study – all U.S. health professionals aged 40 or older when the research began – developed a red , swollen joint at some point during 12 years of followup .
The link to sweet drinks and fruits was independent of other risk factors for gout , such as body mass index , age , use of diuretics ( water pills ) , high blood pressure , alcohol intake and a diet rich in red meat and seafood .
Dr. Gregory Choy , a rheumatologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto , called the research " one of the best - done lifestyles studies on gout that has come out for a long time . "
Choy , who is no relation to the B.C. researcher and was not involved in the study , said the fact the risk of gout rose as the amount of fructose ingested increased " lends strength that this is indeed a real finding rather than a fluke of statistics . "
Steven McNair , president and CEO of the Arthritis Society , said such studies are important for developing a deeper understanding of prevention and treatment for gout , which affects up to 500,000 Canadians , four times more men than women .
" It is important that people diagnosed with gout follow the treatment advice surrounding diet , exercise and medications as prescribed by their physicians , " McNair said by e-mail .
Choi of UBC advises that anyone with a family history of gout or who has previously had it or is currently being treated for the condition should cut out fructose - laden soft drinks from their diet or switch to sugar - free pops .
" But in terms of fruit , that 's difficult to just make one single recommendation like we can do with sugar - sweetened soda because of those known benefits for other major disorders such as lowering blood pressure , heart disease , stroke and certain types of cancer . "
" If you have a bad , terrible gout , maybe you have to limit sweet fruits , " he said .
As for the effects of desserts and other toothsome treats , Choy of Sunnybrook said previous small studies suggest that patients with gout who adopt a low - caloric , diabetic diet " do much better " than those who stick to their usual fare .

Eating a low - cal diet – including one that avoids too much sugar in whatever its form – also helps prevent obesity , Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that can lead to heart attack or stroke , he said .
" This should be looked at as a bigger picture , " Choy said .
" So less simple sugary drinks , be it in soft drinks or otherwise , would help . "
Discuss , praise , criticize , do what you will .
My list of the five most significant moments in atheism from the past ten years :
5| March 16th , 2001 : The case of Madalyn Murray O’Hair ’s disappearance finally closes :
More than five years after O’Hair , her son , and her granddaughter had “ vanished ” from the Austin , TX headquarters of American Atheists ( which O’Hair had founded ) , forensics experts identified a set of bones found at a ranch outside San Antonio as those of the murdered atheist family , finally putting an end to the horrific saga — as well as rumors that they had fled the country .
It also signified the end ( literally and figuratively ) of O’Hair as the unofficial spokesperson for atheism .
David Waters , one of the kidnappers and former AA office manager , died in 2003 while in a prison hospital .
4| November 2nd , 2002 : The Godless Americans March on Washington takes place :
On this day , over two thousand non-religious people gathered on the Mall in Washington , D.C. to rally for church / state separation and show Americans ( and our elected officials ) that we deserve to be heard .
Not every aspect of the event was received with open arms by everyone — including the non-religious .
In fact , it was due to the “ negative ” connotation of the word “ Godless ” used in the event ’s title that a more “ positive ” movement called The Brights was born .
3| March 12th , 2007 : Rep. Pete Stark ( D - CA ) comes out as the first openly non-theistic member of Congress in U.S. history :
In late 2006 , the Secular Coalition for America held a contest to identify the highest ranking , openly non-theistic elected official in America .
The winning entry was not the name of a local mayor , school board president , or dogcatcher , as some might have thought .
Instead , it was a national congressman from California , Pete Stark , who issued a statement regarding his non-belief in a Supreme Being thanks to the SCA ’s work .
Even more amazingly , this announcement was fairly uncontroversial , perhaps signaling that non-religious people will be able to play a role in national politics in the future .
Incidentally , Stephen Colbert mentioned Stark in his book I Am America ( And So Can You ! ) :
Card - carrying members of BS [ Big Secularism ] have snaked their way into every branch of the federal government , except for the judicial and executive .
Did you know that in the House of Representatives and the Senate , there are as many as one self - described atheist currently serving ?
Democratic Representative Pete Stark of California ’s 13th district , to name just one .
Just think of it — how are any pro-faith initiatives going to make it into law when Congress is held hostage by the anti-God caucus of Stark , his self and him ?
2| September 11th , 2001 : Religious fundamentalists carry out terrorist attack :
There ’s not much to say about this day that has n’t been said already , so I ’ll keep this short .
For many people , this may have been the first time they saw the extent of how evil religion could be :
What can happen when religious beliefs go unquestioned ?
Of course , religion was n’t the only reason for the attacks , but it ’s tough to deny its central role .
In addition to the attacks themselves , Christian fundamentalists like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson made their viewpoints seem more demented than usual by blaming “ abortionists , ” “ feminists , ” and “ gays ” for what happened .
While I obviously wish these attacks had never happened , I would guess that more atheists were “ born ” on this day than any other in our nation ’s history .
1| August 16th , 2004 : The publication of Sam Harris ’ The End of Faith ushers in New Atheism :
While other books about atheism were in the works when Harris ’ came out , his was the first in recent memory to bring no -holds - barred atheism and criticism of religion to the masses in a way no one else had done .
He also inadvertently helped introduce a new genre of books , making publishers everywhere want to put out more of the “ New Atheist ” literature .
Thanks to Harris and those whose books came out soon after ( e.g. Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens ) , atheism was the subject of magazine covers and lead stories , and the authors ’ success re-energized a number of Christian apologists to write “ response ” books of their own .
You will see dozens of popular books on atheism over the next several years , and they exist in large part due to the success of The End of Faith .
…
There are a few other major events not on the list that still warrant mention :
August 23rd , 2007 : Mother Teresa ’s letters are made public , revealing that she had “ felt no presence of God whatsoever ” for approximately the last 50 years of her life .
It ’s debatable how much impact this revelation had for proponents of atheism .
June 26th , 2002 : Pledge of Allegiance found to be unconstitutional due to “ Under God ” phrase .
The decision was eventually reversed by the Supreme Court — they said atheist Michael Newdow did not have legal standing to bring the case on behalf of his daughter because of a custody dispute .
January 13th , 2006 : Freedom From Religion Foundation wins court case to allow taxpayer challenges over violations of the First Amendment Establishment Clause — including being able to sue the White House over faith - based initiatives .
This case was later taken to the Supreme Court … which unfortunately ruled against FFRF ( PDF ) in 2007 .

Is " live blogging " still a thing ?
In the Conrad Black case , I was the first guy to " live blog " a criminal trial , to the point where one of the defense counsel laughed out loud in court reading on his Blackberry my near contemporaneous mockery of the prosecution 's closing argument .
But blogging faded , and the last time we tried this was Election Night four years ago .
Still , we 'll give it a go - unless , as my old chums at The Spectator have it , the most anticipated showdown in decades turns out to be just the usual yawneroo .
The tediously over - formatted debates preferred by American TV tend inevitably to go that way , and one notes that the choice of topics announced for tonight seems consciously to avoid many subjects that might ...

A round the beginning of July 1933 , the first overt move was made in one of the most fantastic plots in American history .
A representative of a group of conspirators opened negotiations with a noted military man to head a 500,000 - man army , seize the Government of the United States , put an end to American democracy and supplant it with a dictatorship .
The McCormack - Dickstein House Committee , investigating un-American activities , turned its attention to the plot , but that probe ended abruptly .
Even a generation later , those who are still alive and know all the facts have kept their silence so well that the conspiracy is not even a footnote in American histories .
It would be regrettable if historians neglected this episode and future generations never learned of it .
When the plot actually began , or whose inspiration it was , is not known , for the Committee avoided probing into these aspects .
News of the plot , reported to have backing of " three million dollars on the line and three hundred million ... should it be necessary , " reached the nation in a time which saw greater changes in political systems than any previous period .
The takeover plot failed because although those involved had astonishing talents for making breathtaking millions of dollars , they lacked an elementary understanding of people and the moral forces that activate them .
In a money - standard civilization such as ours , the universal regard for anyone who is rich tends to persuade some millionaires that they are knowledgeable in fields other than the making of money .
The conspirators went about the plot as if they were hiring an office manager ; all they needed was to send a messenger to the man they had selected .
In this case , as recorded in sworn testimony before the Congressional Committee , the messenger was a bond salesman named Gerald C. ( " Jerry " ) MacGuire , who earned about $ 150 a week .
I record his wage not as proof of his competence or lack of it , but because , as brought out in the testimony , when he was ready for the first overt move to get the conspiracy off the ground , his bank account flowered with cash deposits of over $ 100,000 for " expenses . "
MacGuire was a short , stocky man tending toward three chins .
His bullet - shaped head had a silver plate in it due to a wound received in battle .
His close - cropped hair was usually topped by a black derby , the popular headgear of the day .
A reporter described his bright blue eyes as glittering with the sharpness of a fox about to spring .
MacGuire worked for a leading brokerage house headed by Grayson Mallet - Prevost Murphy , a West Point graduate who had seen action in the Spanish - American War and WWI .
Murphy had extensive industrial and financial interests as a director of Anaconda , Goodyear Tire , Bethlehem Steel and a number of Morgan - controlled banks .
His personal appearance was impressive : tall , heavy - set and giving evidence that in his younger years , he must have been quite handsome .
I heard rumors [ of the fascist plot ] in Washington more than a month before news of it broke .
The talk was that the American Legion would be the nucleus for a fascist army which would seize Washington .
Even in a city notorious as a gossip center , this sounded like something out of a Central American " banana republic . "
According to these early rumours , the Committee knew about the conspiracy and that Major General Smedley Darlington Butler , until his retirement a few years earlier the highest ranking officer in the U.S. Marines , had been chosen to head the putsch .
For the first time a name was mentioned , and it was a famous name ....
Butler was first approached by two former state commanders of the American Legion .
One [ Bill Doyle ] dropped out of the picture after the initial meeting .
" The other said his name was Jerry MacGuire , " the General told the Committee : " MacGuire said he had been State Commander , the year before , ... in Connecticut . "
These men , Butler later told me , eventually described " what was tantamount to a plot to seize the Government , by force if necessary . "
The General placed little stock in what his visitors said until they showed that they meant business by displaying a bank book listing cash deposits of over $ 100,000 for " expenses . "
Butler :
They took out a bank book and showed me deposits of $ 42,000 on one occasion and $ 64,000 on another .
I said ...
There is something in this , Jerry MacGuire , besides what you have told me ....
He said , " Well , I am a business man ... [ and ] if you want to take my advice , you would be a business man , too . "
Butler testified that the first suggestion made to him was to lead a movement to unseat the ruling group of the American Legion by taking 200-300 Legionnaires to its annual convention in Chicago ; the second was to deliver a prepared speech to that convention , urging passage of a resolution favoring the gold standard .
Here is the story in the General 's own words :
" Butler : I said , ' Listen .
These friends of mine , even if they wanted to go [ to the Legion convention ] could not afford to go .
It would cost them $ 100 - $ 150 dollars to go there and stay for 5 days and come back . '
They said , ' Well , we will pay that . '
I said , ' How can you pay it ?
You are disabled soldiers .
How do you get the money to do that ?'
' Oh , we have friends .
We will get the money . '
I began to smell a rat ... [ and ] said , ' I do not believe you have got this money . '
It was then or the next time , ... they hauled out a bank deposit book ..
The next time I saw [ MacGuire ] was about the first of September , in a hotel in Newark .
I went over to the [ Legion 's 29th Division ] convention .
Sunday morning he walked into my room and asked if I was getting ready to take these men to Chicago ....
I said , ' You people are bluffing .
You have not got the money ' ... he took out a big wallet ... and a great , big mass of thousand dollar bills and threw them on the bed .
I said , ' What 's all this ? '
He said , ' This is for you , for expenses .
You will need some money to pay them . '
' How much money have you got there ? '
He said , '$ 18,000 . '
I said , ' Do n't you try to give me any thousand dollar bills .
Remember , I was a cop once .
Every one of the numbers on these bills has been taken .
I know ... what you are trying to do ....
If I try to cash one of those thousand dollar bills , you will have me by the neck .... I know one thing .
Somebody is using you .
You are a wounded man ....
You have got a silver plate in your head ....
You were wounded .
You are being used ... and I want to know the fellows who are using you .
I am not going to talk to you any more .
You are only an agent .
I want some of the principals . '
He said , ' Well , I will send one ... to see you . '
I said ' Who ? '
He said , ' I will send Mr. [ Robert Sterling ] Clark ....
He is a banker .'....
A few days later , Clark called Butler and asked if he could visit .
They lunched at the General 's home on Sunday .
Butler continues :
Clark said , ' You got the [ gold standard ] speech ? '
I said , ' Yes . .
They wrote a hell of a good speech , too . '
He said , ' Did those fellows say they wrote that speech ? '
I said , ' Yes , they did .
They told me that was their business , writing speeches . '
He laughed and said , ' That speech cost a lot of money .'..
He thought it was a big joke that these fellows were claiming authorship ..
Clark said , ' I have $ 30 million .
I do not want to lose it .
I am willing to spend half of the $ 30 million to save the other half .
If you go out and make this speech in Chicago , I am certain that they will adopt the resolution and that will be one step toward the return to gold , to have the soldiers stand up for it .
We can get the soldiers to go out in great bodies to stand up for it . '
[ Clark then offered Butler a bribe , saying : " Why do you want to be stubborn ?
Why do you want to be different from other people ?
We can take care of you .
You have a mortgage on this house ....
That can all be taken care of .
It is perfectly legal , perfectly proper . "
When Butler declined the offer , Clark used the General 's phone to call MacGuire at Palmer House , an exclusive Chicago hotel .
In Butler 's presence , Clark told MacGuire : ' General Butler is not coming to the convention ....
You have got $ 45,000 .
You can send those telegrams .
You will have to do it that way ....
I am going to Canada to rest .....
You have got enough money to go through with it .'
Butler later told the Committee that : " The convention came off and the gold standard was endorsed ....
I read about it with a great deal of interest .
There ... some talk about a flood of telegrams that came in and influenced them ...
I was so much amused , because it all happened right in my room . "
MacGuire continued to arrange sporadic meetings with Butler , doggedly trying to enlist his support .
After Butler 's return from a cross-country speaking tour , Butler got another call from MacGuire who insisted on an immediate meeting to discuss " something of the utmost importance . "
Butler agreed to meet at a fancy hotel in Philadelphia .
It was August 22 , 1934 , three days after the plebescite that confirmed Hitler as Nazi fuhrer . ]
MacGuire said , ' I went abroad [ Dec. 1 , 1933 - Aug. 1934 ] to study the part that the veteran plays in the various setups of the governments ... abroad .
I went to Italy for 2 or 3 months and studied the position that veterans occupy in the fascist setup of government , and I discovered that they are the background of Mussolini .
They keep them on the payrolls in various ways and keep them contented and happy .
They are his real backbone , the force on which he may depend , in case of trouble , to sustain him .
But that setup would not suit us .
The soldiers of America would not like that .
I then went to Germany to see what Hitler was doing , and his whole strength lies in organizations of soldiers , too .
But that would not do ....
Then I went to France , and I found just exactly the organization we are going to have .
It is an organization of super - soldiers . '
[ Later testimony revealed this to be the Croix de feu which assisted a failed coup attempt in France on Feb 6 , 1934 . ]
He told me they had about 500,000 [ members ] and that each one was a leader of 10 others , so that it gave them 5,000,000 votes .
And he said , ' Now , this is our idea here in America - to get up an organization of this kind ... to support the President . '
I said , ' The President has got the whole American people .
Why does he want them ?'
He said , ' Do n't you understand the setup has got to be changed a bit ?
Now , we have got him .
We have got the President . '
I said , ' This great group of soldiers , is to sort of frighten him ? '
' No , no , no ; not to frighten him .
This is to sustain him when others assault him ....
Did it ever occur to you that the President is overwork - ed ?
We might have an Assistant President ... to take the blame ; and if things do not work out , he can drop him . '
He [ said ] that it did not take any Constitutional change to authorize another Cabinet official ... to take over the details of the office - take them off the President 's shoulders .
He mentioned the position would be a secretary of general affairs - a sort of super - secretary .... or a secretary of general welfare , I cannot recall which ....
They talked about the kind of relief that ought to be given the President .
[ MacGuire ] said : ' You know the American people will swallow that .
We have got the newspapers .
We will start a campaign that the President 's health is failing .
Everybody can tell that by looking at him , and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second .'..
There was something said in one of the conversations ... that the President 's health was bad , that he might resign , and [ Vice President John N. ]
Garner did not want it anyhow , and then this super - secretary would take the place of the Secretary of State ... in the order of succession [ and ] would become the President .
That was the idea .
I said , ' Is there anything stirring about it yet ? '
' Yes , ' he said ; ' you watch ; in 2 or 3 weeks you will see it come out in the papers .
There will be big fellows in it .
This is to be the background of it .
These are to be the villagers in the opera .
The papers will come out with it . '
He did not give me the name of it , but he said it would all be made public ; a society to maintain the Constitution , and so forth . "

The formation of the American Liberty League , " to combat radicalism " and " defend and uphold the Constitution , " was announced shortly afterward .
Heading and directing this organization were men from the du Pont and J.P. Morgan companies .
It is common for public officials to develop close friendships with certain newsmen who become their confidants ....
Butler had learned to trust Paul Comly French , a reporter for the Philadelphia Record and the New York Post .
Butler ... told French about the propositions ... by MacGuire and asked him to check on the bond salesman and find out " what the hell it 's all about . "
When Butler finished testifying to the Committee ... , French was sworn in .
He told of calling on MacGuire on Sept. 13 , 1934 , in his office on 52 Broadway .
The entire floor was occupied by Grayson M. - P. Murphy & Co. Before the bond salesman would talk with French , he phoned Butler to be sure the General had sent him .
French told the Committee :
I have here direct quotes from him .
As soon as I left his office I got to a typewriter and made a memorandum of everything he told me .
' We need a fascist government in this country ... to save the nation from the communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America .
The only men who have the patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader .
He could organize a million men overnight . '
He told me he had been in Italy and Germany during the summer of 1934 and had made an intensive study ... of Nazi and fascist movements ....
He said he had obtained enough information on fascist and Nazi movements and the part played by the veterans , to properly set up one in this country ..
He warmed up considerably ... and said , ' We might go along with Roosevelt and then do with him what Mussolini did with the King of Italy ' [ i.e. , stripping him of power and making him a figurehead . ]
It fits in with what he told the General , that we would have a Secretary of General Affairs , and if Roosevelt played ball , swell ; if he did not , they would push him out ..
During the conversation .... he brought in the names of former national commanders of the American Legion , to give the impression that , whether justly or unjustly , a group in the American Legion were actively interested in this proposition .
French had written an article naming the very prominent Americans revealed in Butler 's testimony .
When the hearing finished , the sensational story was already on the news - stands .
The General 's reputation for honesty and patriotism made what he said under oath impossible to ignore .
The Secretaries of War and the Navy , U.S. Senators and Representatives urged that the Committee get to the bottom of the conspiracy .
McCormack assured newsmen : " We will call all the men mentioned in the story . "
Co-chairman Dickstein added : " From present indications Butler has the evidence .
He 's not going to make any serious charges unless he has something to back them up .
We 'll have men here with bigger names than his . "
Dispatches from Philadelphia reported that Butler , former head of the Marine Corps. , had told friends that General [ Hugh Samuel ] Johnson , the former NRA [ National Recovery Administration ] administrator , had been chosen for the role of dictator if Butler turned it down ; also considered was General Douglas MacArthur .
The Committee subpoenaed MacGuire and ... his reports from Europe :
McCormack : Now , in your report dated May 6 , 1934 , from Paris ... you say that the ... Croix de feu " is getting a great number of new recruits , and I recently attended a meeting of this organization and was quite impressed with the type of men belonging .
These fellows are interested only in the salvation of France , and I feel sure that the country could not be in better hands because they are not politicians , they are a cross section of the best people of the country from all walks of life , people who gave their ' all ' between 1914 and 1918 that France might be saved , and I feel sure if a crucial test ever comes to the Republic that these men will be the bulwark upon which France will be saved " ..
[ The Committee examined reports on fascist veterans groups such as Italy 's Black Shirts and Germany 's Brown Shirts that MacGuire mailed to his backers .
Examining another report sent by the witness , McCormack said : ]
And in this report you also said :
" I was informed that there is a Fascist Party springing up in Holland under the leadership of a man named Mussait who is an engineer ... who has approximately 50,000 followers ... , ranging in age from 18 to 25 years ....
It is said this man is in close touch with Berlin and is modeling his entire program along the lines followed by Hitler . "
After French published his story , there was a noticeable sense of public uneasiness when not one of those named was called to testify ....
The talk was that those named in Butler 's testimony were too powerful , and nothing would be done about the plot ...
The only person known to have been called to testify was California banker Frank N. Belgrano , who was very influential in the American Legion ....
Without being asked one question , he was abruptly told to go home ....
Congressman McCormack refused to answer questions about him .
Co-chairman Dickstein told me that he did not know why Belgrano was sent home ....
As speculation grew , ... the Committee issued a press release :
" This Committee has had no evidence that would in the slightest degree warrant calling before it such men as John W. Davis , Gen. Hugh Johnson , ... or Hanford MacNider . "
The Committee will not take cognizance of names brought into the testimony which constitutes mere hearsay . "
On December 17 , McCormack announced that Albert Christmas , Clark 's attorney , had returned from Europe and would testify in two or three days .
The Committee questioned him in executive session .
Though national concern about the plot was keen , the attorney was not questioned publicly until , for all practical purposes , the Committee was dead and could do nothing about what the witness said .
Christmas was heard on the last day of the Committee 's life and then the questions were limited only to money given to MacGuire by the lawyer and Clark .
No questions were asked about conversations or correspondence between an alleged principal in the plot and his attorney .
In explaining the large sums of money given to the go - between , there was an item of some $ 65,000 which MacGuire had testified he had used for traveling and entertaining in Europe .
None of the prominent persons named in Butler 's testimony were questioned .
Had the Committee found that the plot was too hot to handle ?
Too Hot to Handle
Not long after the Committee 's explanatory news release , a correspondent told me , " I hear some of Butler 's testimony has been deleted . "
" It 's possible .
Probably some stuff involving national security . "
" What 's been cut has nothing to do with national security . "
I had a good deal of confidence in him .
It was from him that I had first heard of the plot , and I knew that his list of contacts and news sources was amazingly long .
I had met both McCormack and Dickstein .
Athough I wrote for a magazine [ New Masses ] which they touched only with extra-long fire tongs lest they be contaminated , they knew that I was intensely concerned about Nazi activities here .
It looked as if the Committee would die in a matter of weeks , and I asked to see the transcript of Butler 's testimony for possible leads that I could follow up .
Since news stories and the Committee 's own press release had named some of the prominent persons Butler mentioned , I persisted in asking why , if there were no secrets involving the national security , I could not see it .
Other newsmen joined me in asking for the Butler testimony .
Presumably to quiet the growing public concern over why it was not made public , the Committee published a 125 - page document containing the testimonies of the General and others .
The report was clearly marked " Extracts . "
On the last page , a note appeared saying that " the committee had ordered stricken ... certain immaterial and incompetent evidence , or evidence which was not pertinent to the inquiry . "
The extracts held me spellbound ; this was living history - personalities , colorful characters , secret maneuvers on national and international scales .
This was a planned gamble with the most powerful government in the world as the stakes .
The reasons given for making public only extracts of the Committee testimony smelled like what my cat does in his pan .
The Committee had already published hearsay evidence , and this sudden sensitivity about publishing similar testimony was puzzling .
For days I tried to learn what Butler testimony had been cut out .
All of my efforts were fruitless .
A wall of granite had suddenly appeared , but all that did was whet my appetite to know what was going on .
The Committee had announced that it intended to subpoena all of those named by Butler , yet it later issued an announcement that it had no evidence on which to question the prominent persons named .
I met for a drink with a correspondent who was very knowledgeable about what was going on in the capital and was as perturbed by a fascist threat as I was .
I asked if he had any idea why the Committee had published only extracts .
" I was told that a member of the President 's Cabinet asked that certain testimony be deleted , " he said .
" Any idea of what was cut out ? "
" Names , mostly .
Two were Democratic candidates for President . "
" The Committee 's press release mentioned John W. Davis .
Who was the other ? "
" Al Smith . "
" In a fascist plot ?
I do n't believe it ! "
Davis had been a candidate in 1924 and was now one of the chief attorneys for J. P. Morgan & Company .
It was possible that , without being told everything , he had been drawn into some aspects of the conspiracy , though he had publicly denied writing the speech Butler was asked to deliver at the Legion convention in Chicago .
But Alfred E. Smith , " the happy warrior , " a man who had risen to political heights from the sidewalks of New York , a very good Governor whose trusted adviser was Jewish , would certainly not be pro-fascist or pro-Nazi !
I knew that he was bitter against Roosevelt , but that was for personal reasons .
Yet , Al Smith was very close to John J. Raskob and was a co-director with him and Irénée du Pont of the American Liberty League .
The idea of Al Smith being mentioned in connection with this plot was incredible , but such things had happened in other countries faced with severe political and economic stress .
I resumed my search for what had been deleted , but I still got nowhere .
Even usually garrulous politicians walked about with padlocks dangling from their lips .
The McCormack - Dickstein Committee had asked the House to extend its life to January 3 , 1937 , so that it could continue with its investigations , but the House refused ; the Committee died .
It even seemed possible that the Committee had been killed because unidentified , influential forces feared that public opinion might compel a deeper investigation into the fascist plot and concluded it would be better to forego even investigations into communist activities than risk that .
On January 11 , 1935 , about a week or so after the Committee died , Congressman Dickstein gave me a letter of introduction to Frank P. Randolph , the Committee 's secretary , saying , " Will you please permit him to examine the official exhibits and make photo - static copies of exhibits which were made public . "
Randolph , harried by the mountain of work required to close the Committee 's records , gave me stacks of documents , exhibits and transcripts of testimony .
Among them I was amazed to find not only the Butler testimony in executive session which I had tried so hard to get , but also a typed copy of the Committee 's report to the House on its investigations .
The report to the House was lengthy , but the heart of it was contained in a few paragraphs :
In the last few weeks of the committee 's life , it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country ..
There is no question that these attempts were discussed , planned and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient .
This committee received evidence from Maj. Gen. Smedley D. Butler ( retired ) , twice decorated by the Congress of the United States .
He testified before the committee as to conversations with one Gerald C. MacGuire in which the latter is alleged to have suggested the formation of a fascist army under the leadership of General Butler .
MacGuire denied these allegations under oath , but your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made to General Butler , with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization .
This , however , was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal Robert Sterling Clark , of New York City , while MacGuire was abroad studying the various form of veterans ' organizations of Fascist character .
I compared the transcript of Butler 's testimony in executive session with the one made public and marked " Extracts . "
The names French mentioned in his news story were not the only ones deleted , and not everything cut from Butler 's and French 's testimonies was hearsay .
I copied the parts ... deleted from Butler 's description of his talk with Clark .
This was direct evidence of a conversation with a named principal in the conspiracy .
[ Clark ] said , " You know the President is weak .
He will come right along with us .
He was born in this class .
He was raised in this class , and he will come back .
He will run true to form .
In the end he will come around .
But we have got to be prepared to sustain him when he does . "
Butler then Clark offered him a bribe
[ Clark ] said , " Why do you want to be stubborn ?
Why do you want to be different from other people ?
We can take care of you .
You have got a mortgage on this house ....
" That can all be taken care of .
It is perfectly legal , perfectly proper . "
" Yes , " I said , " but I do not want to do it , that 's all . "
Finally I said , " .... You are trying to bribe me in my own house .
You are very polite about it ... but it looks kind of funny to me , making that kind of proposition .
Deleted from Butler 's testimony was the new organization [ American Liberty League ] set up by Irénée du Pont , known for his financial support of reactionary groups , an organization of which Raskob and Al Smith were directors .
The treasurer was Grayson Murphy , for whom MacGuire worked .
Also deleted was Butler 's testimony that MacGuire had advance knowledge of Alfred Smith 's plans to break with President Roosevelt and attack him :
Butler : I said , " What is the idea of Al Smith in this ? "
" Well , " he [ MacGuire ] said , " Al Smith is getting ready to assault the Administration in his magazine .
It will appear in a month or so .
He is going to take a shot at the money question .
He has definitely broken with the President . "
About a month later he did , and the New Outlook took the shot that he [ MacGuire ] told me a month before they were going to take .
This fellow has been able to tell me a month or six weeks ahead of time everything that happened .
Such testimony certainly warranted asking the go - between from whom he got such accurate information about moves that seemed related to a fascist plot .
Though McCormack and Dickstein , questioned MacGuire about many things , nothing was asked about how the bond salesman knew of Al Smith 's plans .
Butler quoted MacGuire : " Morgan interests say you can not be trusted ..
They want either [ Douglas ] MacArthur or [ Hanford ] MacNider .
You know as well as I do that MacArthur is the son - in - law of [ banker Edward ] Stotesbury ...
Morgan 's representative in Philadelphia . "
Instead of asking MacGuire who told him what the Morgan interests were doing in this , the Committee simply deleted this from the published testimony .
In Paul Comly French 's testimony of his talk with MacGuire , the following was deleted :
" French : [ MacGuire ] said he could go to John W. Davis or [ James H. ]
Perkins of the National City Bank , and any number of persons and get it [ money for the organization ] ..
We discussed the question of arms and equipment , and he suggested that they could be obtained from the Remington Arms Co. on credit through the du Ponts .
I do not think that at that time he mentioned the connection of du Pont with the American Liberty League , but he skirted all around it .... he suggested that Roosevelt would be in sympathy with us and proposed the idea that Butler would be named as head of CCC [ Civilian Conservation Corps ] camps by the President .
The CCC was a government work project giving employment to young men of military age .
Another fascist army using CCC men was allegedly proposed by a Wall Street operator who said he controlled $ 700 million which he could make available ; this second plot - if it was a separate one - did not attract as much attention as the one involving General Butler . "
These illustrative passages , crying for more probing , were deleted by the Committee .
[ For more examples of what the Committee deleted from it 's witnesses testimony , read " Wall Street 's Fascist Conspiracy : Testimony that the Dickstein MacCormack Committee Suppressed , " by John Spivak in the New Masses , Jan 29 , 1935 . ]
I knew that the Constitution authorized Congress to delete such matters as required secrecy .
This was usually interpreted to mean matters of national security .
Certainly national security was involved , but this was a plot that the people were not only entitled to know about , but had to know about , for their own protection .
I felt a very definite resentment against this Committee , for which I otherwise had strong approval .
It had subpoenaed Nazis , fascists and communists , yet did not question those whose names were mentioned in testimony about a treasonable plot against the U.S.
The rich and influential seemed to have a unique ability to avoid being called before a committee investigating un-American activities .
So far as I could determine , there had not been even one phone call to these personages to ask - just for the record and with the greatest apologies - if they had ever heard of this plot .
Instead , it did not even ask MacGuire who told him the things he told the General .
It was possible , of course , that the deletions were not due to pressures by any of those named by Butler , but to a policy decision on the highest level .
What would be the public gain from delving deeper into a plot which was already exposed and whose principals could be kept under surveillance ?
Roosevelt had enough headaches in those troubled days without having to confront men of great wealth and power .
Was it avoidance of such a confrontation that curtailed the investigation ?
Was it a desire by the head of the Democratic Party to avoid matters which could split the party down the middle , considering that Davis and Smith , two former party heads , were among those named by Butler ?
I was both angry and troubled that after a conspiracy of this magnitude had been disclosed by a national hero and verified by a committee of the Congress , nothing was being done .
Since MacGuire had denied essential parts of Butler 's testimony , which the Committee said it had proved by documents , bank records and letters , I went to the Department of Justice to ask what it planned to do about MacGuire 's testimony .
I was told that it had no plans to prosecute .
I interviewed Congressman McCormack .
When I got to the sixth or seventh question , dealing with deletions from Butler 's testimony , he said abruptly : " I do n't have to give you an interview ....
I 'll take your questions and answer such of them as I wish . "
Among the questions I left with him were : " Did you ever look into the potentially fascist groups like the American Liberty League , Father [ Charles Edward ] Coughlin 's organization , the Crusaders , etc ? "
To one of my questions , McCormack gave me definite assurances :
You were ... anxious to find out if the Nazi movement in this country is as active today as when the investigation started .
As a result of the investigation , and the disclosures made , this movement has been stopped and is practically broken up .
Unhappily , the Congressman was incorrect .
It was in this very period that the invasion of the U.S. by Nazi secret agents , along with an intensification of anti-democratic and hate propaganda , was moving towards its peak .
I am sure McCormack , Dick - stein and their colleagues believed that disclosures before their Committee had broken up the Nazi propaganda and spy rings .
They saw no threat from Nazis , though they did see a dangerous one from U.S. communists .
The country was bedevilled by seemingly endless strikes , and these were attributed chiefly to communists - as if communists created conflict between employers and employees .
I went to co-chairman Samuel Dickstein , who said the Committee had deleted certain parts of the testimony because they were " hearsay . "
I asked : " Why was n't Grayson Murphy called ?
Your Committee knew that Murphy 's men are in the anti-Semitic espionage organization Order of ' 76 ? "
He replied : " We did n't have the time .
We 'd have taken care of the Wall Street groups if we had time .
I would have [ had ] no hesitation in going after the Morgans . "
I assumed General Butler did not know that portions of his testimony had been deleted .
If he knew and said so publicly , he would reach a vastly greater audience than I could through the New Masses .
I phoned him at his home , said I was from the New Masses and wanted to see him about his testimony before the Committee .
" Come on out , " he said heartily .
He was a slender , almost spare man , with receding hair , lined and sunken cheeks , thick eyebrows and furrowed lines between his keen eyes .
His nose was generous , his underlip set in a permanent pout .
He looked at me almost with affection as he extended his hand .
There are people one meets and may never meet again with whom something clicks at the moment when hands clasp .
I felt a strong attachment to him immediately .
I heard later of highly complimentary comments he made about me .
I felt as if I had known him all my life and apparently he felt the same about me .
He said , " I think you 're the man I 've been hoping to run into to help me do an autobiography .
There are things I 've seen , things I 've learned that should not be left unsaid .
War is a racket to protect economic interests , not our country , and our soldiers are sent to die on foreign soil to protect investments by big business . "
Butler was occupied with the thought that American boys were being killed not to protect their country , but to protect investments .
He returned to this theme several times in the hours we talked .
His life , his adventures and activities and what he had learned from first - hand experience would have made a fascinating book .
I would have liked to do it , but I begged off .
Nazi activities in the U.S. were assuming alarming proportions and no publication , other than the New Masses , had shown any interest .
The Government seemed to ignore these activities completely .
When I said I should concentrate on anti-Nazi activities , he nodded approvingly and offered to help .
He too was troubled by the hate propaganda gaining momentum almost daily .
He said things about big business and politics , sometimes in earthy , four - letter words , the like of which I had never heard from the most excited agitators crying on street corners , from socialists speaking on the New Haven Green or , later , from communists .
He was describing a primitive variation of what we are learning today [ 1967 ] about the activities of our CIA .
We use military power to enforce our political and economic policies .
It is always done , according to official announcements , for high , shining moral objectives .
In our schools , our churches and synagogues , as in unctuous pronouncements by heads of state , we are told to live by a set of nobly - expressed morals but are expected to acquiesce when governments openly or surreptitiously violate them .
We still tamper with governments that displease us ; we still instigate revolutions in countries which will not accept our " guidance ; " we still send our men to fight in foreign lands , to kill and be killed , without having declared war .
If any average citizen violated the U.S. Constitution as constantly and consistently as those who took solemn oaths before God and their fellow men to uphold , defend and protect it , he would be behind bars in short order .
I had heard radicals of every stripe say similar things , but now the man who had commanded our occupying and shooting forces in foreign countries was saying them , adding matter - of - factly such comments as : " We supervised elections in Haiti , and wherever we supervised them our candidate always won . "
When speakers on the Green denounced our military invasions and " dollar diplomacy , " I was always conscious that they were political radicals , theoreticians who had read histories , economic philosophies and mountains of statistics , and concluded that " war is a racket " and took to their stands to tell all passersby .
But this thin man was not a bookish theoretician ; Butler had directed our Marines to land on foreign soil to protect American investments , and he was saying things stronger than I had ever heard on the Green .
I explained again that I was from the New Masses .
" It 's supposed to be a communist magazine , " I said .
" So who the hell cares ? " he said .
" There would n't be a United States if it was n't for a bunch of radicals . "
An impish look came over his face .
" I once heard of a radical named George Washington .
As a matter of fact from what I read he was an extremist - a goddamn revolutionist ! "
I gave him copies of what had been deleted from his testimony .
I explained that although the Committee reported to Congress that it had verified the plot , it did nothing about MacGuire 's denials under oath .
When I finished , he said : " I 'll be god - damned !
You can be sure I 'll say something about this ! "
I made public [ in New Masses , Jan. 29 , 1935 ] the parts that the Committee had edited out of his testimony .
On Feb. 17 , Butler got on national radio and denounced the Committee .
When the Committee 's report appeared , Roger Baldwin , who did not look with friendly eyes on communists , issued a statement as director of the American Civil Liberties Union :
The Congressional Committee investigating un-American activities has reported that the Fascist plot to seize the government ... was proved ; yet not a single participant will be prosecuted under the perfectly plain language of the federal conspiracy act making this a high crime .
Imagine the action if such a plot were discovered among Communists !
Which is , of course , only to emphasize the nature of our government as representative of the interests of the controllers of property .
Violence , even to the seizure of government , is excusable on the part of those whose lofty motive is to preserve the profit system .
The Committee 's report gave 6 pages to the threat by Nazi agents in this country , 11 pages to the threat by communists and one page to the plot to seize the government and destroy America 's democratic system .

write rhymes .
As you write , on a word to find a rhyme for it ...
Trying to pass legislation that impacts how games can be sold or what has to be put on them is a popular and expensive way of sending the message that you 're concerned about the issues that affect the youth of today .
Although every law attempted has gone down in flames , and has cost taxpayers at least $ 1 million through the years , politicians continue to line up to give it a go .
The newest bill is A11717 , proposed by Assemblyman Joseph Lentol , and it has already passed through the New York State Assembly .
Now it 's on to the State Senate .
It 's a familiar story , but in this case the New York government is asking for things the industry is already doing .
The legislation would require game consoles to include parental locks for mature content but , while this sounds good on paper , every current - generation console already has parental controls .
Not only that , but the ESRB has done a great job of getting the word out on how to use said controls .
The bill also wants to force games to show their ESRB ratings on the cover of the title , which is also something that is done industry - wide .
Every game sold at retail has the ESRB rating on the front cover , with more detailed information on what content the game includes on the back of the box .
Given that industry compliance on showing the ratings on games is already at 100 percent , it 's unclear what the law would achieve .
Fighting youth violence , at least twice a year
Here 's were things get a little silly : the bill also says that there will be a group created to make recommendations about game ratings and the effects that games have on youth violence .
The group will have 16 members , appointed by the governor , who will each serve for three years .
While there is no schedule for how often this group shall meet , the bill is strict : it has to be at least twice a year .
The bill uses a lot of legalese to say the group will meet and try to stop youth violence , including racial and gender - motivated violence , and violence against law enforcement .
They will do this by talking about video games , at least twice a year .
With no pay .
The Entertainment Software Association has already mobilized its forces against this law .
Richard Taylor , Senior VP of Communications and Research contacted Ars , and he did n't have kind words for the bill .
He points out that the ratings already appear on games , the consoles already have parental controls , and this is much more political than practical .
" By now I 'm sure we 're all well aware of the Federal Government ’s own statistics on video game sales ; a recent Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) report showed that retailers prevented the sale of M- rated games to kids 80 percent of the time , far better than movie theaters preventing kids access to R- rated movies ( 65 percent of the time ) and retailers preventing the sale of R- rated DVDs ( 53 percent of the time ) , " he told Ars .
" This kind of investigation then is clearly part of Senator Lanza 's crusade against video games and a waste of taxpayers ' time and money . "
The Video Games Voters Network has a form letter if you 'd like to contact the politicians behind this bill .
This law seeks to legislate issues that the industry has already taken care of , so the only gain would be some form of government control over gaming content .
Of course , the movie , music , and publishing industries have resisted efforts to bring entertainment content under government control , so this appears to be the latest candidate for a judicial smackdown from a long line of failed bills .
In the end , the politicians will get some publicity since they 're trying to protect children against the so - called evils of gaming , the ESA will get any law passed struck down , and New York 's taxpayers will get stuck with the bill .
Every time a new console comes out , there 's a flood of accessories made to help people get the most out of their gaming session .
Customized colors , shapes , decals for the style conscious , game genies for those who like to play a game on God Mode and comfort grips for the endurance gamer .
Then there are accessories made by companies that are clearly run by mad scientists .
6 The Wii Car Adapter

The idea :
You can play the Wii in your car .
The Reality :
You can crash your car while playing the Wii in your car .
We do n't think that manufacturers actually decided to build these specific power adapters and LCD screens for the Wii , but rather decided to throw a Wii tag on stuff they had lying around in the warehouse .
No thought was given to the horrible , horrible consequences .
Do n't get us wrong , setting up a small screen hooked up to a PlayStation 3 or an Xbox 360 in your SUV or minivan can be a great way to pass the time on a long trip .
If you 're the kid you wo n't get bored and start whining , and if you 're the parent who wo n't have thoughts about late - age adoption or vasectomies .

But then we have the Wii , a machine based entirely on the concept of flailing your arms around while you play .
Only now it 's confined to the cozy backseat where you 're three inches away from the passenger beside you ( instead of the recommended three feet for some Wii games ) and within arm 's reach of the driver 's head .
Yes , to play the Wii in your car is to laugh in the face of death .
In a couple of years , we wo n't see teenagers drag racing , they 'll be pairing up and playing cross-car matches of Wii tennis .
The United States has an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants , a record number .
Its last mass amnesty program , which began in 1987 , legalized 2.7 million .
President Bush proposed an immigration plan that would give some workers a path to legalization .
But it died last year under assault from people who said it would lead to more illegal immigration .
Europe has held at least 20 legalizations in the past 25 years , giving residency papers to about four million people .
Italy and Spain account for about two - thirds of the total , to the consternation of northern Europeans who see the south as the Continent ’s weak back door .
With free movement across much of Europe , legalized immigrants can easily head north , alarming those worried about job competition , welfare costs , cultural clashes or terrorist threats .
Southern Europe ’s tolerance for illegal immigration has several explanations .
Its aging populations and booming economies created a need for foreign workers .
Its proximity to northern Africa and eastern Europe places it close to countries that supply them .
And its economies have traditionally depended more on off - the - books workers .
No country has run more legalization programs than Spain , which has carried out six since 1985 .
As recently as a decade ago , immigrants made up less than 2 percent of the population .
Now they are more than 10 percent .
About 40 percent come from eastern and northern Europe ; 38 percent come from Latin America ; and 20 percent from Africa .
Despite the rapid change , until recently there was little political conflict , with legalizations occurring under both conservative and socialist governments .
Spain even offers immigrants free health insurance , whether they are legal or not .
“ The attitude toward unauthorized migrants is much more relaxed than in the United States , ” said Joaquín Arango , a sociologist at Complutense University in Madrid .
The acceptance has been attributed to newfound prosperity , the need for workers , the progressive culture of post - Franco Spain and the shared language with Latin Americans , which spares Spain a major source of tension in the United States .
Tobacco ban " makes no sense " Plans to ban the open display of cigarettes in shops have been announced by the Scottish Government .
Public Health Minister Shona Robison said giving them " pride of place " on shelves did not fit with the drive to tackle smoking - related illness .
It is two years since Scotland led the UK in banning smoking in public places , and six months since the legal age for buying cigarettes was raised to 18 .
Pro-smoking campaigners said the plans would not cut the habit .
Ms Robison announced a series of other measures to the Scottish Parliament , which also include tobacco licensing and outlawing the sale of cigarettes in packs of 10 .
We will soon be living in a country where pornographic magazines will be on display in shops and not cigarettes
Neil Rafferty
Forest Several areas of the action plan , welcomed by anti-smoking group Ash Scotland , will need to be taken forward with support from the UK Government .
Legislation is likely to be brought forward in 2009 .
Ms Robison told MSPs : " Despite tobacco advertising having been banned in 2002 , there are growing concerns that prominent displays of cigarettes and other tobacco products in shops and other points of sale are undermining our wider tobacco control efforts to denormalise smoking . "
The minister said she recognised concern in the retail sector about banning displays , but said they were clearly being used as a promotional tool , telling parliament similar moves in other countries had not seen a dramatic impact on businesses .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is never going to prevent smoking Kevin , Manchester " The protection of children and young people from the impact of tobacco must be paramount and there are instances - and this is one - when the benefits to the public health of the nation must take precedence , " she said .
Smoking - one of Scotland 's biggest killers - is responsible for about 13,000 deaths and 33,500 hospital admissions each year at a cost of £ 200 m to the health service .
But hitting out at the plans , Neil Rafferty of pro-smoking group Forest , said : " We will soon be living in a country where pornographic magazines will be on display in shops and not cigarettes .
GOVERNMENT SMOKING PLAN
Restrict shop display of tobacco products Tobacco licensing scheme , including fixed fines for law - breakers Outlaw sale of cigarettes in packs of 10 Help councils better enforce tobacco sales law Crackdown on smuggled and counterfeit cigarettes
Move to plain packaging for cigarettes Increase education on smoking - related risks " These measures are about making smokers feel bad about themselves and encouraging society to shun them until they learn to behave in a government - approved way . "
But NHS public health director Laurence Gruer said the action plan was the right package of " tough but sensible " measures to tackle smoking addiction .
Ash Scotland chief executive Sheila Duffy added : " At present , nearly a quarter of adults in Scotland die early from tobacco - related diseases . "
She went on : " Promotional displays in shops are one of the last bastions of tobacco marketing .
Putting cigarettes out of sight will support smokers who are trying to quit and reduce the tobacco industry 's influence on children . "
Elspeth Lee , Cancer Research UK 's head of tobacco control , said : " We strongly welcome these proposals which will help reduce the numbers of smokers and improve the health of the country now and for future generations . "
The government plan was welcomed by opposition parties , although Labour public health spokesman Dr Richard Simpson warned some anti-smoking budgets were " flat lining " , while the Tories ' Jackson Carlaw said action to deter youngsters from taking up smoking should start with parents .
The Liberal Democrats urged the government enforce the plans as soon as possible .
Dr Andrew Buist , of the British Medical Association 's Scottish council , urged Westminster to get behind the Scottish plan , adding : " Tackling children 's addiction to tobacco is rightly a top priority for this government .
A lifetime addicted to tobacco is a death sentence . "

More than just concepts , Nintendo and SEGA had big hopes for these two game consoles to the point of actually manufacturing prototypes .

Nintendo Advanced Video System
Before the Nintendo Entertainment System , there was the “ Advanced Video System ” ( AVS ) , which was one of Nintendo ’s earliest Famicom - like concepts for the North American market .
This console was publicly shown at CES in 1985 — consisting of a keyboard , gamepads , joystick , light gun , and data storage unit .
Surprisingly enough , all the components featured wireless technology via infrared .
SEGA Neptune
The SEGA Neptune was basically a two - in - one game system ( Genesis / 32X ) , planned for release in 1995 .
Unfortunately , by the time a working protoype was ready , the SEGA Saturn took the spotlight — fortunately .
Surprisingly enough , SEGA produced two non-working prototypes that were just empty shells .
It was supposed to retail at approximately $ 200USD — picture courtesy of GDD
Anzac Day commemorates the involvement of Australian and New Zealand troops in a World War I campaign on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey .
The campaign 's aim was to land troops on the Aegean sea side of the peninsula then move inland to take the Turkish forts which secured the Dardanelles - a narrow strait which became tactically vital on Turkey 's entry into the war - on the other side of the peninsula .
The landings near Ari Burnu in Turkey took place at dawn on April 25 , 1915 .
While they began well , steep rugged terrain and a fierce counter - attack by Turkish forces prevented the Allied troops from making much progress .
They dug in , and over the course of the next seven and a half months more than 8,000 Australians and 2,500 New Zealanders died in the fighting .
British losses were far greater - around 21,000 men - and in all the Allies lost more than 46,000 men during the campaign at Gallipoli .
Around 86,000
Turks died in defence of the peninsula .
The Allies eventually withdrew from Gallipoli in December 1915 having failed to achieve their objective .
The landing site is now known as Anzac Cove .
Involvement by Australians in the campaign is commemorated at dawn services around Australia on April 25 .
It is a national holiday and marks the involvement of Australian troops in all theatres of war .
Symbol of nationhood
Coming just 14 years after federation , the Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians .
As such , it has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity .
Reports from the frontline certainly gave the impression that the Australian troops were fighting above their weight .
Phillip Schuler , war correspondent for The Age newspaper , wrote of the Australians ' " unflinching courage " and " magnificent gallantry " .
Reporting on the battle of Gaba Tepe , he wrote : " They held and won the position .
Can more be said ; can greater acknowledgment be made ?
" The young army 's first battle found it cruelly christened ; it left the men uncrushed , victorious , and ready to face the foe .
It may be called the battle of Gaba Tepe , and in those words , or one of them at least , is sufficient to commemorate the deed .
Gaba meaning great . "
While the link between Anzac Day and nationhood is rejected by some , it has been reinforced in recent years by the views of the Returned and Services League ( RSL ) , historians and politicians .
WWI battlegrounds in Europe , in particular the shores of Gallipoli , draw young Australian tourists in their thousands around April 25 .
The journey is seen by many as a rite of passage .
In Australia , while fewer and fewer veterans are able to march in Anzac Day parades , the dawn services around the nation and the parades that follow them have been embraced by their descendents and are enjoying a renaissance over the past decade .
Woman locked in filthy bedroom dungeon for 18 YEARS after having a baby out of wedlock
A woman kept prisoner by her family for 18 years for having a baby out of wedlock was last night dramatically freed by Italian police .
Maria Monaco , 47 , was found huddled in the corner of her bedroom living in a state of squalor surrounded by filth and excrement .
Maria was found by police at Santa Maria Capua Vetere , a small town just outside Naples , Italy , after an anonymous tip - off and last night her brother and sister were in custody accused of detaining her .
Police point at the filthy bed in the room where Maria Monaco was kept prisoner
Footage on Italian TV showed a squalid stained single mattress in her bedroom with dirt and grime on the floor and walls and the bathroom she used was covered in filth .
Police said that Maria , whom they say was suffering from psychological problems , was kept a prisoner shortly after falling pregnant with her child - now a 17 - year - old student .
The adjoining bathroom was squalid and covered in excrement
Her mother Anna Rosa Golino , 80 , brother Prisco , 44 , a farmer and sister Michelina , 54 , a primary school teacher took action after she had an affair with a mystery man and got pregnant .
Captain Carmine Rosciano , of Santa Maria Capua Vetere police , said : ' We received an anonymous tip - off that a woman was being held and we raided the family home in rural land on the outskirts of the town .
' Maria was found in her locked bedroom in a confused state and surrounded with filth and excrement - she was living in squalor . '
Ms Monaco 's mother Annarosa Golino and her siblings Michelina and Prisco Monaco kept her prisoner to punish her for having a baby out of wedlock
Ms Monaco was kept inside the family 's house in Santa Maria Capua Vetere , southern Italy
Last night Maria was in hospital in Naples being treated for her trauma while her mother was bailed but her brother and sister kept in custody .
Police were also questioning Maria 's 17 - year - old son whom they said was living with his grandmother and ' fully aware of the situation ' .
Attempts were also being made to track the father of the boy who police refused to name but they said it was proving difficult to question Maria .
Josef Fritzl kept his daughter Elisabeth prisoner in the basement of their family home in Amstetten , Austria for 24 years
The case was alarmingly similar to that of Austrian man Josef Fritzl who kept his family locked in an underground dungeon for 24 years before being discovered earlier this year .
The 73 - year - old lured his daugher Elisabeth into the cellar under their house when she was 18 .
He raped her repeatedly and fathered her seven children , one of which died .
In public Mr Fritzl appeared to be a regular man and a pillar of thecommunity , living in Amstetten with his wife Rosemarie , with whom he had seven grown - up children .
Mr Fritzl remains in police custody .
He has not yet been charged .
Police say he has confessed to the crimes and that there is DNA evidence to support this .
Like them or despise them , one thing has been consistent about stun gun-maker Taser International :
They never , ever lose in court .
45 wrongful death or injury lawsuits had swung the company 's way , as of early last year .
About a month ago , Taser even got a judge to reverse three Ohio autopsies that had partially faulted the electroshock weapons .
But that all changed on Friday , when a federal jury in San Jose found the company responsible for the death of 40 - year - old Robert Heston Jr. , awarding his family more than $ 6 million in damages .
" An attorney for the family called the verdict a ' landmark decision , ' and indicated that it was the first time Taser International had been held responsible for a death or injury linked to its product , " the* Monetrey County Herald * reports .
An autopsy found that Heston died from a combination of methamphetamine intoxication , an enlarged heart due to long - term drug abuse , and Taser shocks .
Heston 's parents , Betty Lou and Robert Sr. , and their daughter sued Taser International .
They alleged the company failed to properly warn users that its product could be dangerous , and even lethal , when used repeatedly in conjunction with chest compressions and on people under the influence of drugs ...
The six - person jury found that Arizona - based stun - gun manufacturer Taser International should have more effectively warned police that Taser shocks were potentially dangerous .
Salinas police testified during the trial that they were not warned that the shocks could be dangerous .
* Plaintiffs attorney John Burton said the verdict is precedent setting , noting that this was the first time a jury found Tasers are dangerous when used too often ...
According to Burton , the verdict included $ 5.2 million in punitive damages , and $ 1.021 million in compensatory damages .
The jury found that the victim was 85 percent at fault , resulting in an apportioned final damages award . *
Taser 's pugilistic executives interpreted the verdict as a victory .
" Jury Finds Extended Taser Device Application 15 Percent Responsible for Arrest Related Death , " a company statement read .
But , as * The Lede * notes , the company ’s stock dropped almost 12 percent during trading on Monday and Tuesday .
Bloomberg
News reported last month that more than half of Taser ’s top 10 shareholders sold some of their shares this year .
The company got a boost in New York City , however , where police commissioner Ray Kelly declared that 520 new Tasers would be made available to officers on patrol .
The announcement came on the heels of a new RAND Corporation report , which found that the stun guns could help the New York Police Department save lives .
" A review of 455 police - involved shootings found 25 cases - including three fatalities - where Tasers might have prevented the gunplay , " the New York Daily News reports .
But , of course , cops use Tasers as more than just substitutes for firearms .
The electroshock weapons are employed in all sorts of situations where a police officer would never think to pull out his gun .
( " Do n't Tase Me , Bro "
was never about to be " Do n't Shoot Me , Bro , " right ? )
That can lead to more lawsuits .
A retired lieutenant 's teenaged son is suing the NYPD , for example , after he was zapped four times and hit with a nightstick at a Harlem barbecue .
He was never charged with assaulting an officer , or resisting arrest .

“ Will Senator Chuck Schumer support impeachment hearings ?
Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) is one of my senators from New York along with Hillary Clinton .
For the most part I like Senator Schumer and I think he does a pretty good job .
He strikes me as more honest and sincere than Hillary .
I have become a big fan of The Hillbillyreport which is made of James Pence videos .
Jim is a funny guy .
He does this brief 1 minute video on impeachment hearings .
I think he nails it when he tells Senator Schumer to grow some balls . ”

The US has offered bribes to Iraqi MPs to lure them into endorsing a security deal that critics believe would make Iraq a US colony .
Sources in Iraq 's parliament told Press TV on Thursday that Washington has offered three - million dollars in bribe to the lawmakers who sign the " framework accord .
" Under the agreement , the US would be allowed to set up at least 13 permanent military bases in Iraq and US citizens would be granted immunity from legal prosecution .
Iraqi lawmakers , however , vowed that they would never sign the agreement which would turn their country into ' a US colony ' .
The accord has faced strong objections from religious and political figures inside and outside Iraq .
Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr has also protested the deal , calling on the people to hold demonstrations after every Friday prayers against the accord .
The country 's most revered Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani has formerly objected to the deal , saying he would not allow the government to sign such a deal with " the US occupiers " as long as he was alive .

$ 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil costs U.S. $ 130 million
Whenever I ’m involved in a discussion about government waste and / or the politics of bureaucratic budgeting , I undoubtedly recount a story that usually leaves people nodding in agreement or shaking their head in disbelief .
The story goes like this : A friend of mine we ’ll call “ Rob , ” whom I used to work with during my summer breaks , was coming back to Massachusetts for an unexpected late - September visit .
Rob had relocated to Pensacola , Florida where he was learning how to fly jets at the Naval Flight Training School .
As Rob lifted the golf clubs out of the nose of the fighter jet he had just flown from Florida to Massachusetts for a one - day visit , he knew his trip was different – and he was a little uneasy about it .
You see , Rob ’s day - long visit to play golf in Massachusetts was made possible by an officer ( or officers ) who rightly feared that ending up with a surplus of fuel at the end of that fiscal year would slash the budget for fuel in the next .
Rob ’s little visit was back in the early 1990s , but with today ’s skyrocketing fuel prices , and the added fuel demands of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , the “ largest single user of petroleum products in the world ” is looking for ways to use less fuel – and more types of it .
The Shreveport Times reports that the military spent $ 12.6 billion on jet fuel , diesel and other fuels in 2007 and rising fuel costs have the DoD asking Congress for additional funding to cover a projected shortfall .
In the meantime , the Air Force has been looking for ways to offset rising fuel costs , including conservation .
Col .
West Anderson is the 2nd Bomb Wing ’s vice commander at Barksdale AFB .
Anderson knows a thing or two about fuel consumption .
A B - 52 bomber has a 50,000 gallon fuel tank , when all filled up , his fleet of 60 plus B - 52s hold a total of 5 million gallons of JP - 8 jet fuel .
Col .
Anderson says :
“ We ’ve been exploring fuel savings , trying to lighten the loads that we carry on day - to - day training missions , so we get better fuel economy .
We ’re planning our missions more efficiently so were not using as much ‘ drone ’ time , do n’t try to spend as much high - level time , ( and ) condense and pack the training into a tighter schedule . ”
Defense planners are also looking to alternative fuel sources and synthetic fuel blends to help cushion the impact of rising oil prices .
Said Air Force Maj .
Don Rhymer of the Air Force Alternative Fuels Certification Office , of the “ The goal is to have every aircraft using synthetic fuel blends by 2011 . ”
The DoD also hopes that at least 50 % of this fuel will be produced domestically by 2016 .
But “ alternative fuel sources ” and “ synthetic fuel blends ” are not automatically good things , as Clayton Cornell at gas2.org points out .
Cornell writes :
“ While synthetic fuel has the capacity to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , it could also double CO2 emissions produced by military flight [s ] .
At the time of this writing , synfuel is made via Fischer - Tropsch process from either coal or natural gas to produce a somewhat cleaner burning but extremely greenhouse - gas intensive product .
The Air Force may be underscoring a recently hyped green image , but it seems that economic considerations are largely at play here … ”
And what about those late - September Navy - sponsored New England golf getaways ?
The ones where the primary mission is to burn “ surplus ” fuel ?
Their days may be numbered , but there are no reductions or structural incentives for using less currently in the works .
According to Col. Anderson , “ We have n’t been told that we ’re going to get a reduction in our flight hours we have submitted for next year .
That always could happen , but right now we have received no word that any of that is going to take place . ”

Radiohead “ House of Cards ” Video
The video for “ House of Cards ” off the bands latest album was just released .
No cameras or lights were used .
Instead two technologies were used to capture 3D images : Geometric Informatics and Velodyne LIDAR .
Geometric
Informatics scanning systems produce structured light to capture 3D images at close proximity , while a Velodyne Lidar system that uses multiple lasers is used to capture large environments such as landscapes .
In this video , 64 lasers rotating and shooting in a 360 degree radius 900 times per minute produced all the exterior scenes .

Electronic
Arts does n't want you getting so caught up in your copy of Mass Effect for PC that you forget all about upcoming survival - horror - in - space title Dead Space , so it 's throwing a few reminders your way .
If you pre-order Mass Effect from EA 's online store , you 'll get the first issue of the * Dead Space * comic book and a Dead Space poster while supplies last .
If you prefer cash incentives , pre-order Mass Effect from retail outlets like GameStop or Amazon and you 'll save $ 10 .
My advice : Go for the munny .
Do n't get me wrong , Dead Space looks quite enticing , but really , a poster ?
The PC version of Mass Effect is due out on May 27 in North America and June 6 in Europe .
Dead Space is scheduled for a Halloween release .

Think rising fuel prices , global warming and tightening fuel economy and emissions rules will leave us driving cars as thrilling as a Toyota Prius ?
Do n’t bet on it .
The supercars of tomorrow will be as green as they are mean .
So says Georg Kacher of Car Magazine , who talked to some of Europe ’s leading automotive engineers and came up with the blueprint for a 300 horsepower BMW coupe that ’s cleaner and more efficient than a Honda Civic .
Diesel and hybrid versions would be even greener .
Kacher calls the car Vision Z , and although it ’s not a real car , it could be .
Everything about it is here now or coming soon .
" Does Vision Z sound like science fiction ? " he writes in the May issue .
" It should n’t .
Hybrids , start / stop systems , downsized engines , multi-material chassis , plastic panels and brake - by - wire all feature on today ’s cars .
This is just the next step . "
And what a step it is .
The Vision Z may exist only in the pages of Car Magazine , but Kacher says it is " based upon actual research projects and detailed interviews with leading engineers .
It ’s a natural extension of the lead that BMW has taken with its Efficient Dynamics program . "
Kacher obviously is gazing into a crystal ball , but nothing about the car is particularly revolutionary from a technology standpoint .
As we noted in " How Detroit Will Reach 35 MPG , " all automakers are developing direct injection gasoline engines , clean diesels , hybrid drivetrains and dual - clutch transmissions with seven or more speeds .
What Kacher does is put it all together in a high - performance sports car we could see by 2018 .
The Vision Z looks a lot like the Z4 coupe ( pictured ) on steroids .
A modular engine cradle would allow BMW to easily offer it with four drivetrains .
The top - of - the - line turbocharged six cylinder gasoline engine would produce 400 horsepower .
Direct injection and cylinder deactivation deliver 35 mpg while emitting 200 g/ km of carbon dioxide .
The 295 - horsepower Porsche Cayman S gets 15 mpg ( combined ) and emits 254 g/ km .
Two turbocharged four - cylinder engines also could be offered .
A 300 hp gas version returns 38 mpg and emits 130 g/ km .
Compare that to the Civic , which gets 29 mpg ( combined ) and emits 139 g/ km .
A 56 - mpg diesel would emit " similar levels of CO2 , " Kacher writes .
He envisions a plug - in hybrid version that cribs from the Chevrolet Volt and its sibling , the Opel Flextreme , by using a small gasoline or diesel engine to charge lithium ion batteries or capacitors that drive an electric motor
Electronic components like steering and air conditioning pumps improve efficiency by reducing parasitic drag on the engine .
Color impregnated in plastic body panels reduces the ecological impact of painting .
A steel cockpit with aluminum nose and tail and body panels of aluminum , composite material like carbon fiber and / or plastic keep the car under 2,800 pounds .
And just what would all this technology cost ?
About as much as the M3 Coupe , Kacher says .
BMW would have to sell about 40,000 of them a year to make it profitable .
That ’s not an unrealistic target to shoot for , as BMW sold 44,421 7 - Series sedans last year .
" It might be hyperbole to describe Vision Z as the car BMW ca n’t afford to ignore , " he writes , " but the risk of not building it would certainly outweigh any reservations . "
An Australian teacher is alive today because he had the presence of mind to poke a shark in the eye .
Jason Cull was swimming off Middleton beach last week when the great white grabbed him by the leg and dragged him under .
" I felt along it , I found its eye and I poked it in the eye , " said Cull , " and that 's when it let go . "
Most of us would n't even know whether this was a good idea or not .
After all , you do n't want to give a four - metre shark extra reasons to dislike you .
But what about other animals ?
What is the best course of action if you 're attacked ?
Alligators
There is a persistent myth that you should always run away from an alligator in zigzag fashion , because alligators can't turn corners .
The truth is that an alligator is n't going to give chase on land for any distance , so it 's best to move fast and in a straight line .
If the gator does catch hold of you , you should , according to the Worst - Case Scenario Survival Handbook , attack its eyes and snout .
In 2006 , Corey Workman of Florida escaped from an alligator 's jaws by sticking his thumb in its eye , something he had seen on the Discovery Channel .
Mountain lions , pumas and cougars A 1997 study of puma attacks stressed several useful tactics .
Never turn your back on a cougar , puma or similar , and do n't run away .
Stand your ground , look the cat in the eye and try to make yourself look as big as possible by opening your coat or standing on a rock , or both .
Bare your teeth and make menacing noises .
If
the animal remains unimpressed , prepare to fight it off with a stick or by throwing rocks .
If you 're going to win , you need to act like the more aggressive predator .
Bears
The general rule of thumb is : stay away from bears .
Mostly , they will do the same for you , but a surprised bear , or a mother bear protecting her cubs , may attack what it perceives to be a potential threat .
Running away from a bear wo n't do you much good - bears can run as fast as horses , and they can climb trees - but then standing your ground is unlikely to help either .
Some experts suggest you play dead , although doing so would obviously require tremendous faith in their expertise .
Bees
You 'll be pleased to hear that when you 're attacked by killer bees , you 're allowed to run away .
But do n't swat at them ; it just pisses them off .
If you can't get indoors , run through bushes or undergrowth in order to slow them down .
Do n't jump into a pond or pool ; apparently the bees will just wait for you to surface .
Wild turkeys A resurgent wild turkey population has caused problems in Boston , where the 1.5 m - tall turkeys are known to chase joggers and schoolchildren , often in mobs .
Wildlife officials advise fighting back with a broom or open umbrella .
Do n't be a victim .
Be the dominant turkey .
The Charleston Gazette
For a time , the ads were everywhere on TV and radio , the ones with the head of a security company brazenly challenging would - be thieves to try to steal his identity .
Richard Todd Davis , CEO of LifeLock Inc. , was so confident in his company ’s ability to protect his identity that he publicly revealed his Social Security number : 457-55-5462 .
But according to a new class - action lawsuit filed last week in Jackson County , LifeLock ’s identity theft protection services were so inept that Davis ’ personal information was stolen repeatedly .
“ While LifeLock has only publicly acknowledged that Davis ’ identity was compromised on one occasion , there are more than 20 driver ’s licenses that have been fraudulently obtained [ using his personal information ] , ” the suit states .
“ Furthermore , a simple background check performed using Davis ’ Social Security number reveals that his entire personal profile has been compromised to the extent that the birth date associated with his Social Security number is Nov. 2 , 1940 , which would [ inaccurately ] make Davis 67 years old . ”
“ Through its advertisements , LifeLock misrepresents and assures consumers that it can protect against all types of fraud including , without limitation , computer hacking , password theft and other noncredit - related theft , ” the suit reads .
“ This is a service that you pay for and it kind of lays dormant , ” said David Paris , an attorney with the New Jersey firm Marks & Klein who is heading the case against LifeLock .
“ So no one knows that they ’re not getting what they paid for , because they do n’t know what to look for . ”

I stumbled on an article by Scott Loganbill entitled Google ’s Open Source Protocol Buffers Offer Scalability , Speed which contains the following excerpt
The best way to explore Protocol Buffers is to compare it to its alternative .
What do Protocol Buffers have that XML does n’t ?
As the Google Protocol Buffer blog post mentions , XML is n’t scalable : " As nice as XML is , it is n’t going to be efficient enough for [ Google ’s ] scale .
When all of your machines and network links are running at capacity , XML is an extremely expensive proposition .
Not to mention , writing code to work with the DOM tree can sometimes become unwieldy . "
We ’ve never had to deal with XML in a scale where programming for it would become unwieldy , but we ’ll take Google ’s word for it .
Perhaps the biggest value - add of Protocol Buffers to the development community is as a method of dealing with scalability before it is necessary .
The biggest developing drain of any start - up is success .
How do you prepare for the onslaught of visitors companies such as Google or Twitter have experienced ?
Scaling for numbers takes critical development time , usually at a juncture where you should be introducing much - needed features to stay ahead of competition rather than paralyzing feature development to keep your servers running .
Over time , Google has tackled the problem of communication between platforms with Protocol Buffers and data storage with Big Table .
Protocol Buffers is the first open release of the technology making Google tick , although you can utilize Big Table with App Engine .
It is unfortunate that it is now commonplace for people to throw around terms like " scaling " and " scalability " in technical discussions without actually explaining what they mean .
Having a Web application that scales means that your application can handle becoming popular or being more popular than it is today in a cost effective manner .
Depending on your class of Web application , there are different technologies that have been proven to help Web sites handle significantly higher traffic than they normally would .
However there is no silver bullet .
The fact that Google uses MapReduce and BigTable to solve problems in a particular problem space does not mean those technologies work well in others .
MapReduce is n't terribly useful if you are building an instant messaging service .
Similarly , if you are building an email service you want an infrastructure based on message queuing not BigTable .
A binary wire format like Protocol Buffers is a smart idea if your applications bottleneck is network bandwidth or CPU used when serializing / deserializing XML .
As part of building their search engine Google has to cache a significant chunk of the World Wide Web and then perform data intensive operations on that data .
In Google 's scenarios , the network bandwidth utilized when transferring the massive amounts of data they process can actually be the bottleneck .
Hence inventing a technology like Protocol Buffers became a necessity .
However , that is n't Twitter 's problem so a technology like Protocol Buffers is n't going to " help them scale " .
Twitter 's problems have been clearly spelled out by the development team and nowhere is network bandwidth called out as a culprit .
Almost every technology that has been loudly proclaimed as unscalable by some pundit on the Web is being used by a massively popular service in some context .
Relational databases do n't scale ?
Well , eBay seems to be doing OK .
PHP does n't scale ?
I believe it scales well enough for Facebook .
Microsoft technologies are n't scalable ?
MySpace begs to differ .
And so on …
If someone tells you " technology X does n't scale " without qualifying that statement , it often means the person either does n't know what he is talking about or is trying to sell you something .
Technologies do n't scale , services do .
Thinking you can just sprinkle a technology on your service and make it scale is the kind of thinking that led Blaine Cook ( former architect at Twitter ) to publish a presentation on Scaling Twitter which claimed their scaling problems where solved with their adoption of memcached .
That was in 2007 .
In 2008 , let 's just say the Fail Whale begs to differ .
If a service does n't scale it is more likely due to bad design than to technology choice .
Remember that .

Though the savings rate does not account for the increased value of stock and property , or the gains on retirement accounts , many economists still view it as the most useful gauge of the degree to which Americans are making provisions for the future .
For the 34 million households who took money out of their homes over the last four years by refinancing or borrowing against their equity  roughly one - third of the nation  the savings rate was running at a negative 13 percent in the middle of 2006 , according to Moody ’s Economy.com .
That means they were borrowing heavily against their assets to finance their day - to - day lives .
By late last year , the savings rate for this group had improved , but just to negative 7 percent and mostly because tightened standards made loans harder to get .
“ For them , that game is over , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Economy.com .
“ They have been spending well beyond their incomes , and now they are seeing the limits of credit . ”
Many times before , of course , Americans have found innovative ways to finance spending , even when austerity seemed unavoidable .
It could happen again .
The Me Decade was declared dead in the recession of the early 1980s , only to yield to the Age of Greed and later the Internet boom of the 1990s .
Over the longer term , the economy should keep growing at a pace that reflects improving productivity and population gains .
But for the first time in decades , credit is especially tight as the bursting of the housing bubble has spread misery across the financial system .
In homes now saturated with debt , conspicuous consumption and creative financing have come to seem a sign of excess not unlike that of a suntan in an age of skin cancer .
Private members ' clubs to be banned from treating women as ' second class citizens '
Golf for all : Harriet Harman wants to end private members ' clubs restricting female access
Private members ' clubs will be banned from treating women as ' second - class citizens ' under new laws .
Equalities minister Harriet Harman wants to make it illegal for golf clubs and working men's clubs to restrict women 's access or deny them the right to vote as full members .
Only half the 2,500 working men's clubs give women full membership rights while some golf clubs stop them playing at the weekend , restrict access to the course or bar them from the running of the club .
The plans are sure to face opposition from club owners - and even equalities groups say the proposals could distract from their key aim of equal pay .
The announcement was made in the Commons yesterday by deputy Labour leader Miss Harman , who has been dubbed Harriet Harperson for her feminist views .
She said it is only fair that existing laws banning clubs from discriminating on the grounds of race , disability and sexual orientation should be extended to include women .
The changes will be contained in an Equalities Bill to be published in the coming weeks .
She said : ' Later this month , I hope to be able to set out to the House what the Bill 's provisions are .
' But I can say that the Bill will ensure that clubs that offer membership to both women and men will no longer be able to discriminate against women .
They will have to treat men and women equally . '
However , the new measures will not affect single - sex clubs such as the Women 's Institute .
They will only affect mixed - sex clubs where women have lower membership status than men .
The Equality Bill is also expected to give women the right to breastfeed in public places .
While the contents of the Bill are yet to be confirmed , ministers have also suggested forcing businesses to conduct ' pay audits ' - reviewing salaries to ensure men are not paid more than female colleagues .
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said : ' Where there is mixed membership we believe all should be treated equally , and that women should not be second class citizens . '
Katherine Rake , director of women 's equality campaigners the Fawcett Society , said : ' That sort of discrimination has no place in modern - day society , so we welcome this .
' But we hope the Bill also includes measures to ensure men and women are on equal pay .
' But if this legislation does nothing more than allow women golfers to play at certain times , it wo n't do much to improve equality for the vast majority of women . '
The Conservative spokesman for women , Theresa May , said : ' Having campaigned on this issue for some time , I welcome the fact that the Government has decided to include this in the Equality Bill .
However I 'm disappointed that it is taking them so long to bring the Equality Bill forward . '

" I understand my opponent came this morning and spent a lot of his time attacking me , " Hillary Clinton suggested to a union gathering of steelworkers in Pittsburgh on Monday .
As she went on to say , " Well , you know , I know that many of you , like me , were disappointed by recent remarks that he made , " scattered boos and calls of " No " could clearly be heard from the audience .
" I think it 's important that , you know , we give people the chance to really compare and contrast us , " Clinton concluded .

Obama kept Law Review balanced
Barack Obama 's election in 1990 as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gave him his first moment of national fame , a powerful intellectual credential and a sweet book deal .
It was also his first electoral victory , won in part by convincing the conservative minority of law students that he would treat them fairly .
While the title and election have become well - known parts of Obama 's personal story , the substance of his actual work on the Review , where he spent at least 50 hours a week , has received little attention .
Advertisement
Obama might have had it right while he was running the journal , when he reportedly ended minor disputes with the words , " Just remember , folks : Nobody reads it . "
The eight dense volumes produced during his time in charge there — 2,083 pages in all — show the Review to have been a decidedly liberal institution , albeit one in transition as its focus on race and gender was contested by liberals and conservatives alike .
Under his tenure , the Review published calls to expand the powers of women , African - Americans and the elderly to sue for discrimination .
But Obama , who this March referred to " identity politics " as " an enormous distraction , " was not so easily pinned down .
He published a searing attack on affirmative action , written by a former Reagan administration official .
And when , in an unusual move , he selected a young woman from a non-Ivy League law school to fill one of the Review ’s most prestigious slots , she produced an essay focused as much on individual responsibilities as on liberties , criticizing both conservative judges and feminist scholars .
" I was very surprised and honored to receive the invitation , of course , as I was teaching at Maryland Law School at the time , and the Foreword typically is extended to more established scholars at ‘ top ’ law schools , " Robin West , now a professor and associate dean at Georgetown Law Center , wrote in an e-mail to Politico .
While other articles are selected by the Review 's editors as a group , the Foreword is solicited by a smaller band led by the Review 's president .
West worked closely with Obama on her piece , she said , remembering him as gracious and helpful , if a bit polite and even formal : " He would always ask first about my baby , " she recalled .
If the editor and author — a black man and a woman — were an unconventional team for the Review , however , West 's article challenged the then - prevailing wisdom in a different way , taking as its touchstone the work of Czech freedom fighter Vaclav Havel and the anti-Communist revolutions in Eastern Europe that were then still under way .
Havel had written that the citizen ’s sense of responsibility — not just of individual rights — was essential to political liberty , and West applied that critique to contemporary liberalism to argue that goals such as tolerance and diversity might in fact be " weakened , not strengthened , by taking rights so ' super - seriously ' that we come to stop examining our sense of responsibility . "
Obama " clearly agreed with me at the time that a shift in constitutional thinking from a rights - based discourse to one that centered [ on ] responsibility and duties ... would be a good thing , " West told Politico .
" Partly because of those conversations , I do n't find it surprising at all that Sen .
Obama 's speeches are often marked by calls to spark a sense of responsibility , rather than a sense of grievance . "
That classically liberal approach was hardly the mainstream of legal academia at the time .
Under Obama 's guidance , the Review underwent a period of relative peace after the turbulent 1970s and ' 80s , when the publication — like the institution itself — attempted to balance its inherent elitism with some semblance of openness and multiculturalism .
“ He was as much a traditionalist as anything , ” recalled Susan Estrich , the USC School of Law professor who served as Michael Dukakis ’ campaign manager in 1988 — and who broke ground as the first female president of the Harvard Law Review 14 years before Obama took the reins .
“ It was a big deal that he got the presidency .
He was selected because of merit , and he believed in the institution and its history .
There are some years [ at the Review ] that are radical and others that are traditional . "
Eleanor Kerlow , the author of " Poisoned Ivy : How Egos , Ideology and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School , " depicted Obama 's tenure as a calm before the storm .
Kerlow told Politico she “ never heard anything negative about him ” while researching her book .
“ Despite the political and ideological infighting , he maneuvered his way around pretty well . ”
Her book is set in the following year , when Obama ’s successor circulated a parody of an article by a feminist legal scholar who had been murdered , igniting a crippling ideological power struggle at the Review .
In Obama 's time , as it is today , the Harvard Law Review was one of the most important and distinguished legal publications in the world .
Founded in 1887 , it is the rare self - supporting legal publication compiled and edited completely by students , typically those attending their second or third year at the prestigious school .
After winning a spot on the Review , Obama beat out 18 other contenders to become the first African - American president in the then - 103 - year history of the Review , and his duties included leading discussions and debates to determine what to print from the mountain of submissions from judges , scholars and authors from across the country , supervising the thorough editing of each issue 's contents and giving every article what 's known as a " P- read " once it was finally considered ready for publication .
Once a piece is set , the president also sends a letter or fax and makes a follow - up phone call to each author .
Federal Judge Michael W. McConnell , who was nominated by President Bush and has frequently been mentioned as one of Bush ’s potential Supreme Court nominees , recalls receiving one such letter and call in early 1990 for his article “ The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion . ”
McConnell told Politico , “ A frequent problem with student editors is that they try to turn an article into something they want it to be .
It was striking that Obama did n’t do that .
He tried to make it better from my point of view . ”
McConnell was impressed enough to urge the University of Chicago Law School to seek Obama out as an academic prospect .
Yale professor Vicki Schultz , then an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School , wrote a lengthy article for the June 1990 issue , titled “ Telling Stories About Women and Work , ” which compared the ways in which the courts handled sexual and racial discrimination cases .
She was concerned that “ some African - American scholars might be offended by the comparison ” but says Obama was “ incredibly reassuring and smart and nonideological ” about the way he approached the piece .
One thing Obama did not do while with the review was publish any of his own work .
Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said Obama did n't write any articles for the Review , though his two semesters at the helm did produce a wide range of edited case analyses and unsigned “ notes ” from Harvard students .
Estrich believes that Obama must have had something published that year , even if his campaign says otherwise .
“ They probably do n’t want [ to ] have you [ reporters ] going back ” to examine the Review .
( While the Review 's contents are protected by U.S. copyright law and are n’t available for free online , Politico is providing all the front covers — which include each issue 's table of contents — and a representative masthead from Obama 's term as president . )
In recent months , Obama 's stewardship of the Review has generated a small dust - up in the blogosphere , with some critics insisting that " Obama 's Volume 104 is the least - cited volume of the Harvard Law Review in the last 20 years . "
The claim has methodological problems , however , including the fact that Obama oversaw only the first four issues of that volume .
Review veterans said he would have had an increasing influence on — as well as a final read of — the latter half of Volume 103 , then a diminishing influence over the second half of Volume 104 , produced after he left the presidency .
Moreover , with the exception of the Foreword , Review articles are selected by a committee of editors , with the president merely the first among equals .
Still , the substance of the Review offers a glimpse at the environment in which Obama came to the law , and the eight issues that Obama presided over have enough material to keep the blogosphere busy for months .
Among the more interesting pieces :
• March 1990 —
This issue , the first of Obama ’s presidency , has an article by University of Florida associate law professor Anthony Cook on " the reconstructive theology of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . "
The article ends with a theme that would later emerge in Obama 's speeches : " With such mutual respect and openness to each others ' pain , suffering and faith , we must work out more fully and struggle towards King 's ideal of the Beloved Community and thereby hew from our mountain of despair a stone of hope . "
• April 1990 —
An unbylined note titled " Rethinking ( M ) otherhood : Feminist Theory and State Regulation of Pregnancy " asks whether the state should consider the potential for endangering the fetus when pregnant women abuse drugs .
The author suggests that the problem 's positioning as a conflict between fetal and maternal rights is " both illegitimate and counterproductive " and concludes that policies should to be recast to expand , rather than restrict , women 's reproductive rights .
• June 1990 —
This issue included five responses to “ Racial Critiques of Legal Academia , ” a highly controversial article published in the Review before Obama became its president .
The article — written by Randall Kennedy , a black professor at Harvard Law — argued against the idea that legal scholars of color have a unique and at times uniquely valuable voice on issues related to race .
The first entry in the colloquy is prefaced by a quote from performer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson ’s 1934 article “ The Culture of the Negro ” — " The white man has made a fetish of intellect and worships the god of thought ; the negro feels rather than thinks " — and several quotes from the now largely forgotten but once highly controversial racial provocateur Frantz Fanon , among them : “ If the white man challenges my humanity , I will impose my whole weight as a man on his life and show him that I am not the ‘ sho ’ good eatin ' ’ that he persists in imagining . ”
• November 1990 —
This issue included perhaps the most conservative piece of Obama 's tenure , in which Ronald Reagan ’s former Solicitor General Charles Fried attacked race - based affirmative action , calling it " racial balkanization " that would " impoverish the human race . "
The implications of group rights , he wrote , are " sinister . "
• February 1991 — Obama 's last issue contains one of its most sharply liberal pieces , a study of race and gender in car sales , which , the editors say in an equally liberal introduction , provides " evidence that seriously challenge faith in the ability of competitive market forces to eliminate racial and gender discrimination in other markets " and calls for more government action .
In the end , though , Obama 's time on the Review mirrored other aspects of his life .
Even in the staunchly liberal milieus in which he has spent his entire adult life , Obama has managed to lead without leaving a clear ideological stamp , and to respect — and even , at times , to embrace — opposing views .
To his critics , that 's a sign of a lack of core beliefs .
To his admirers , it 's the root of his appeal .
" To understand what someone else is trying to say is n't just an editorial skill , " said McConnell .
" It 's a life skill . ”
Feds Gone Wild ; Reports Highlight Worst Crimes by Officials Colorful busts of law enforcement 's own officials found buried in reports .
June 4 , 2008  --
An FBI special agent used an undercover real estate firm run by the bureau to sell her friend 's house for $ 1.3 million , according to a new report by the Department of Justice 's Inspector General .
Meanwhile , the Homeland Security Department 's Inspector General reported investigators found evidence an official there may have swapped sensitive law enforcement information to white supremacists for drugs , sex and money .
A DHS airport security officer also stole $ 18,000 from his elderly mother , stopped paying her nursing home bill and ran up charges on her credit cards , the IG said .
Call it Feds Gone Wild : some of the most colorful busts of law enforcement 's own officials , buried in otherwise dull reports to Congress , new editions of which landed earlier this week .
Every six months the top internal watchdogs for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security report to Capitol Hill on their current efforts , which range from financial audits and management reviews to investigations of wrongdoing into their agencies ' own personnel .
The cases they cite are a sampling , which do not name the culprits , and tend towards the colorful , even shocking .
Their latest reports do not disappoint .
In addition to the FBI 's budding broker ( dismissal recommended ) , the ex-DHS official ( eventually indicted and arrested on drug charges ) , and the TSA 's ungrateful son ( pled guilty , sentenced to fine plus restitution , 60 days ' confinement ) , they featured :
A Catholic prison chaplain who admitted to engaging in sexual acts with inmates who attended his Bible study class or clerked in his office ;
A Border Patrol officer who married and lived with an undocumented alien , and a immigration official who lived with his illegal immigrant girlfriend and helped her obtain fake papers ;
A senior - level immigration official who was indicted for taking bribes and tips in exchange for releasing immigration detainees ;
A federal security agent who " for the past several years " stole money out of Automated Teller Machines ;
A prison doctor and aide who scammed $ 2 million from Medicaid by running a bogus HIV therapy program for inmates ;
A Border Patrol officer who ran queries of federal law enforcement databases on behalf of drug traffickers , and another officer who sold marijuana from his Border Patrol vehicle .
Former law enforcement officials cautioned not to jump to conclusions based on reports of a few bad apples .
" The minority of bad people do n't speak for the majority of people working hard , doing their job , day to day , " said Brad Garrett , who served as an FBI special agent for over two decades .
" Unfortunately , people hear more about the bad news than the good news , " he said .
" But most people are law - abiding and do their job -- obviously , some better than others . "

In this game , kids answer lifestyle questions and the program tells them when they should die because they have used up their " fair share " of the world ’s resources .
The less politically correct kids are , or the wealthier they are , the sooner they are told they should die .
Accepting the default , average choices in the games tells kids they should die when they are 9 years old .
Yeah , I know you think I am exaggerating .
Because this is likely to get pulled down soon , I will show you a series of screenshots from it .
Whether it gets pulled down or not , a major media company ( with all of its famed multiple levels of editorial control ) thought this was a good game for kids .
I actually delayed publishing this , because I wanted to make sure this was not some kind of hack or joke site .
But you can get there right from the ABC home page by clicking " science " in the top menu and clicking on the planet slayer game icon at the bottom of the science page .
I still wonder whether it ’s a put on – it ’s that bad .
Here is the landing page ( click on any page to increase the size ) :
Yep , that little sign does indeed say " find out when you should die . "
Here the game is explained :
Here is the first question :
With each question , if you choose any answer that might not indicate that you are a subsistence farmer in Africa living on a $ 1 a day , your pig gets fatter .
I really encourage you to check out the whole thing .
It is one politically correct litmus test after another .
My pig got slightly fatter , until I got to this one :
Answering that you spend any more than $ 10,000 AUS ( about a 1:1 conversion with US dollars ) , your pig will get really fat .
The wealthier you are , the more evil you are in a direct relationship .
It is a point I have made for a while : global warming alarmists consider their preferred solution to environmental issues to be universal poverty .
There is me , really evil , because I earn a good living .
And , as we can see with this question , since I spend my money on ordinary stuff that I actually want , rather than where the authors would like me to spend it , I really suck .
When you hit the final button , you pig is actually exploded in a bloody mess ( yes , the red is blood ) .
As it turns out , I should have been strangled at birth :
Hat tip to Watts Up With That .
Really , in some ways this is an awesome game .
Never have I seen such a pure combination of Marxist - style zero - sum economics with science - challenged warming alarmism .
I do n’t think I need to bother refuting any of this .
If you are new to the site , you can find a basic refutation of zero - sum economics here and a series of resources on global warming , from a book to free Youtube videos , here .
Notable Design Patterns for Domain - Specific Languages
Diomidis Spinellis
Abstract
Keywords : design patterns ; domain - specific languages .
1 Introduction
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we introduce DSLs and outline their differences from executable specification and general purpose languages while in section 3 we present the formalism of design patterns that we use for describing the DSL realisation strategies in section 4 .
Finally , section 5 concludes this paper with a discussion of the relationships between the outlined design patterns and directions of future research .
2 Domain - Specific Languages
[ p ]
Figure 1 : UML diagram of a DSL - based system architecture .
DSLs are , by definition , special purpose languages .
Any system architecture encompassing one or more DSLs is typically structured as a confederation of modules ; some implemented in one of the DSLs and the rest implemented using a general purpose programming language ( Figure 1 ) .
As a design choice for implementing software systems DSLs present a number distinct advantages over a ``hard - coded '' program logic :
Concrete Expression of Domain Knowledge Domain - specific functionality is not coded into the system or stored in an arcane file format ; it is captured in a concrete human - readable form .
Programs expressed in the DSL can be scrutinised , split , combined , shared , published , put under release control , printed , commented , and even be automatically generated by other applications .
Direct Involvement of the Domain Expert
The DSL expression style can often be designed so as to match the format typically used by the domain expert .
This results in keeping the experts in a very tight software lifecycle loop where they can directly specify , implement , verify , and validate , without the need of coding intermediaries .
Even if the DSL is not high - level enough to be used as a specification language by the domain expert , it may still be possible to involve the expert in code walkthroughs far more productive than those over code expressed in a general purpose language .
Although the DSL concept bears similarity to executable specification languages [ Som89 ] , [ TM87 ] such as OOSPEC [ PH95 ] the DSL approach exhibits some important advantages :
Expressiveness Executable specification languages taking a Swiss army knife approach towards the problem of specification offer facilities for specifying all types of systems , but often at a cost of clearness of expression .
As an example OBSERV [ TY92 ] provides a multiparadigm environment allowing the system specification using object - oriented constructs , finite state machines , and logic programming .
In contrast , DSLs being tailored towards a narrow , specific domain can be designed to provide the exact formalisms suitable for that domain .
Runtime Efficiency
The possible interactions between different elements of a general purpose specification language such as its type system and its support for concurrency result in runtime inefficiencies .
A narrowly focused DSL can employ the most efficient implementation strategy and specialised optimisations for satisfying the expressed specification .
Modest Implementation Cost DSLs are typically implemented by a translator that transforms the DSL source code into source or intermediate code compatible with the rest of the system .
Such an approach can often be implemented using string processing languages such as awk [ AKW79 ] and Perl , language development tools such as lex and yacc , specialised systems such as TXL [ CHHP91 ] and KHEPERA [ FNP97 ] , or declarative languages such as Prolog and ML .
The DSL implementation cost is - and should always be - modest .
Reliability
As described in the previous paragraph , the limited scope of a DSL often allows a source - to - source transformation type of implementation .
The small scale of the required implementation effort often results in a translator whose correctness can be trivially verified .
The size of typical executable specification languages means that the implementor must often take the correctness of the language 's implementation on trust .
Tool Support Limitations CASE and integrated software development tools offer only limited support for integrating DSLs into the development process .
Ad hoc solutions are often required to smoothly integrate DSL code with existing revision control systems , compilers , editors , source browsers , and debuggers .
Training Costs
In contrast to established specification languages such as Z [ PST91 ] system implementers and maintainers will by definition have no prior exposure to the DSL being used .
This problem is somehow mitigated by the fact that an appropriately chosen DSL will be familiar to other participants of the implementation effort such as those involved in the specification , beta testing , and final use .
These participants will be able to perform DSL code walkthroughs - a task normally reserved for experienced software engineers .
Design Experience DSL - based system architectures are not widely adopted within the software industry .
As a result , there is an evident lack of design experience , prescriptive guidelines , mentors , design patterns , and supporting scientific literature .
Early adopters will need to rely more on their own judgement as they adopt the approach in a stepwise fashion .
Software Process Integration
The use of DSLs is not yet an integral part of established software processes .
Therefore , the software process being used has to be modified in order to take into account the design , implementation , integration , debugging , and maintenance of the adopted DSLs .
The implementation of a DSL differs from the implementation of a general purpose language .
Compilers for general purpose languages are typically structured as a lexical analyser , a parser , a semantic analyser , an optimiser , and a target code generator .
In contrast , the limited scope of a DSL allows and requires different implementation strategies .
The lexical , syntactic , and semantic simplicity of DSLs often obviate the need for some elements that would be required by a general purpose language compiler ; for example instead of using a parser front - end DSL implementations often process the source language using regular expressions .
In addition , the often - limited user population of a DSL does not justify a large implementation effort forcing DSL implementers to choose the most economical realisation strategies ; as an example compilation into assembly code of the target machine is rarely a practical proposition .
Finally , as DSLs are often part of the development process of a larger system , schedule pressures drive DSL builders towards implementation methods that can rapidly deliver results .
The aim of this paper is to provide , in the form of a pattern language , a repertoire of methods often used in the implementation of a DSL .
3 Design Patterns
``Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core of the solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice . '' - [ AIS +77 ]
Twenty years later Gamma et al. [ GHJV95 ] cross-pollinated these ideas into the field of reusable object - oriented software design .
Design patterns offer a convenient way to capture , document , organise , and disseminate existing knowledge from a given area in a consistent and accessible format .
Patterns differ from algorithms and data structures in that the concepts they describe can not be coded and used as a subroutine or an object class .
Patterns also differ from frameworks as they do not describe the structure of a complete system : interrelated patterns are typically used together to solve a general design problem in a given context .
In this paper we describe eight recurring patterns that we have identified as being used for DSL design and implementation .
The description of these patterns provides the DSL designers with a clear view of the available DSL realisation strategies , the forces that will guide them towards the selection of a specific pattern , the consequences of that decision , examples of similar uses , and the available implementation alternatives .
In our description of the patterns we followed - in free text form - the format and classification used by Gamma et al . [ GHJV95 ] .
We classify each pattern as creational if it involves the creation of a DSL , structural if it describes the structure of a system involving a DSL , and behavioural if it describes DSL interactions .

Figure 2 : The piggyback pattern .
The piggyback structural pattern ( Figure 2 ) uses the capabilities of an existing language as a hosting base for a new DSL .
Often a DSL needs standardised support for common linguistic elements such as expression handling , variables , subroutines , or compilation .
By designing the DSL on top of an existing language the needed linguistic support is provided ``for free ' ' .
The piggyback pattern can be used whenever the DSL shares common elements with an existing language .
Typically , the DSL language processor passes the linguistic elements that are expressed in the existing language to the language processor of the existing language .
Where the DSL is implemented as a compiled language a typical implementation compiles the DSL code into the base language : DSL code is compiled as needed , while embedded base - language elements are emitted unmodified .
Consequently , the resulting output of the compilation consists entirely of the base language .
If the DSL is implemented as an interpreter , a similar strategy can be applied if the base language provides a facility for calling its interpreter with suitable arguments from within the DSL interpreter .
Typical examples of this approach are the yacc [ Joh75 ] and lex [ Les75 ] processors .
While the specifications of the input grammar ( in the case of yacc ) and the input strings ( in the case of lex ) are expressed in a DSL , the resulting actions for recognised grammar rules and tokens are specified in C which is also the processors ' output language .
Yacc uses the piggyback approach more aggressively as it introduces special variables ( denoted by the $ sign ) to the C constructs used for specifying the actions .
The piggyback approach resembles in structure compiler front - ends that generate an intermediate language .
However , the structure we propose uses an existing , human - readable , and typically general - purpose language , as the compilation target rather than a specialised , machine - readable intermediate language .
The effort of translating the DSL into an existing human - readable language instead of implementing an alternative compiler front - end is substantially lower .
In addition , the process of this translation is relatively straightforward and can be implemented as a simple source - to - source transformation - often merely using lexical processing constructs as described in section 4.3 .
In contrast , the implementation of a compiler front - end requires detailed knowledge of the intermediate language , and often intimate knowledge of a specific compiler implementation .
[ p ]
Figure 3 : The pipeline pattern .
The pipeline behavioural pattern ( Figure 3 ) solves a problem of DSL composition .
Often a system can best be described using a family of DSLs .
The prototypical example for such an application is the composition of diverse mark - up languages in text processing systems .
Different such languages can be used to specify tables [ Les79b ] , mathematical equations [ KC74 ] , chemical formulas [ BJK87 ] , pictures [ Ker82 ] , graphs [ BK86 ] , and organic element chemical structures [ BJK87 ] .
In cases where a number of DSLs are needed to express the intended operations , their composition can be designed and implemented using a pipeline .
Typically , all DSLs are organised as a series of communicating elements .
Each DSL handles its own language elements and passes the rest down to the others .
Sometimes , the output of one DSL can be expressed in terms of the input expected by another DSL further down the pipeline chain [ Ben86 ] .
The use of the pipeline pattern encourages the division of responsibility among small specialised DSLs and discourages bloated feature - rich language designs .
The DSL - based system can be built in a stepwise fashion , adding components as needed with new components utilising existing ones .
As suggested by its name , the pattern can often be implemented using a pipeline of independent communicating system processes .
Many modern operating systems provide facilities for setting up such a pipeline , while the Unix shells also provide a supporting built - in notation .
The pipeline approach has been used by the troff [ Oss79 ] family of text processing tools .
Elements of a troff - based text processing pipeline can include eqn [ KC74 ] for processing equations , tbl [ Les79b ] for processing tables , pic [ Ker82 ] for processing pictures , grap [ BK86 ] for drawing statistical displays , dag [ GNV88 ] for typesetting directed graphs , chem [ BJK87 ] for typesetting chemical structures , and refer [ Les79a ] for processing references .
A similar structure has also been used to produce algorithm animations [ BK91 ] .
In addition , if one considers the command line arguments passed to typical Unix commands as a mini-DSL , then typical pipelines of Unix tool invocations can also be considered as an application of this pattern .
This mode of use allows the implementation of sophisticated applications such as spell checkers or complicated operations on images and sound using families of tools such as the system 's text processing tools , the pbm [ P+93 ] portable bitmap collection , and the sox sound tools .
4.3 Lexical Processing
Figure 4 : The lexical processing pattern .
The lexical processing creational pattern ( Figure 4 ) offers an efficient way to design and implement DSLs .
Due to their - by definition - limited field of applicability DSLs impose severe restrictions to the effort that can be used for their design and implementation .
Many DSLs can be designed in a form suitable for processing by techniques of simple lexical substitution ; without tree - based syntax analysis .
The design of the DSL is geared towards lexical translation by utilising a notation based on lexical hints such as the specification of language elements ( e.g. variables ) using special prefix or suffix characters .
The form of input for this family of DSLs is often line - oriented , rather than free form and delimited by character tokens .
This design pattern can be used together with the piggyback pattern in cases where , after some lexical processing , the output of the DSL processor can be passed to the processor of the base language .
The utilisation of this pattern lowers the implementation cost for DSLs making them a practical proposition for applications where the cost of a full parser - based translation would not be justified .
As translators based on lexical structure are often implemented using interpreted or rapid prototyping languages , the DSL design and implementation can gracefully evolve together in a combined iterative process .
Examples of this application include numerous DSLs implemented using tools such as sed [ McM79 ] , awk [ AKW88 ] , Perl [ WS90 ] , Python [ Lut96 ] , m4 [ KR79 ] , and the C pre-processor .
Most of these tools offer a rich set of lexical processing and substitution facilities - often expressed in terms of extended regular expressions - that can be used to implement a complete DSL in tens of lines of code .
4.4 Language Extension
Figure 5 : The language extension pattern .
The language extension creational pattern ( Figure 5 ) is used to add new features to an existing language .
Often an existing language can effectively serve a new need with the addition of a few new features to its core functionality .
In this case , a DSL can be designed and implemented as an extension of the base language .
The language extension pattern differs from the piggyback pattern by the roles played by the two languages : the piggyback pattern uses an existing language as an implementation vehicle for a DSL , whereas the extension pattern is used when an existing language is extended within its syntactic and semantic framework to form a DSL .
The design of a DSL using this pattern involves the addition of new language elements to an existing base language .
These elements can include new data types , language block interaction mechanisms , semantic elements , or syntactic sugar .
Typically the DSL inherits all syntax and semantics of the base language used , while adding its own extensions .
An object - oriented class hierarchy can thus be formed with a number of DSLs being derived from base languages and forming base languages for other DSLs .
The use of the language extension pattern frees the DSL designer from the burden of designing a full featured language .
In addition , where the pattern is used to design a non-trivial DSL hierarchy , the pattern offers a clear way of organising the language relationships and interactions [ SDE95 ] .
Compiled - language implementations of the extension pattern are often structured in the form of a pre-processor which transforms the DSL into the base language .
Alternatively , source - to - source transformations [ CHHP91 ] , code composition [ SG97b ] , or intentional programming [ Sim95 ] techniques can be used to augment the language using high level operators .
One of the earliest examples of this pattern is the ``rational FORTRAN '' ( Ratfor ) compiler [ Ker75 ] which provided a structured version of FORTRAN .
The implementation of the original C++ compiler ( cfront ) also used this technique [ Str84 ] .
A current effort using the extension pattern involves the addition of generic types to the Java programming language [ BOSW98 ] .
Extensions of interpreted languages can also benefit from this design pattern by implementing the language extension using a meta- interpreter [ SS86 ] or a metacircular evaluator [ ASS90 ] .
Examples include the examination of abstract syntax trees using an interpreter of Prolog extended with an ambient current object [ Cre97 ] and the extension of ML for graph drawing [ KH97 ] .
4.5 Language Specialisation
Figure 6 : The language specialisation pattern .
Language specialisation ( Figure 6 ) is a creational pattern that removes features of a base language to form a DSL .
In some cases the full power of an existing language may prevent its adoption for a specialised purpose .
A representative case arises when requirements related to the safety or security aspects of a system can be satisfied only be removing some ``unsafe '' aspects ( such as dynamic memory allocation , unbounded pointers , or threads ) from a language [ Mot94 ] .
In such cases a DSL may be designed and implemented as a subset of an existing language .
Whenever some specific features of an existing language render it unsuitable for a given application , the design of a DSL following the specialisation pattern can result in a mature language that satisfies the given requirements .
The design of the DSL involves the removal from the base language of the unwanted syntactic or semantic features .
Since the DSL is effectively a subset of the base language the removal can be guaranteed by a language processor that checks the DSL conformance .
In a limited number of cases additional run-time checks may be required .
Examples of DSLs designed following the specialisation pattern are Javalight [ NvO98 ] which is a type - safe subset of Java , the educational subsets of Pascal used for a stepwise introduction to the language [ Sav95 ] , the HTML [ BLC95 ] application of SGML [ ISO86 ] , and the automotive `safer - subset ' of C [ ER97 ] .
4.6 Source to source transformation
[ p ]
Figure 7 : The source to source transformation pattern .
The source to source transformation creational pattern allows the efficient implementation of DSL translators .
As outlined in section 2 , the resources available for implementing a DSL are often severely constrained .
Source to source transformation can be used to ease the burden of implementation .
When the DSL can not be designed as a language extension , specialisation , or using the piggyback pattern it is often possible to leverage the facilities provided by existing language tools using a source to source transformation technique .
The DSL source code is transformed via a suitable shallow or deep translation process into the source code of an existing language .
The tools available for the existing language are then used to host - compile or interpret - the code generated by the transformation process .
When using this pattern one capitalises on the existing language processor infrastructure .
This can include optimising compilers , linkers , and native code instruction schedulers .
In addition , in some circumstances , even tools that rely on mappings between the source code and the machine code ( such as profilers , execution tracers , and symbolic debuggers ) can be used .
In particular , some candidate host languages such as C offer a mechanism for specifying the file and source line of the DSL code that generated a particular sequence of host code instructions .
The use of this pattern makes it also relatively easy to troubleshoot the DSL compilation process , because the resulting code will often be easy to read and reason about .
One other possibility involves the translation of the DSL code into the intermediate language used by existing language compilers .
The pattern can be implemented using a traditional lexical analysis , parsing , and host code generation process .
In addition , a number of tools such as TXL [ CHHP91 ] and KHEPERA [ FNP97 ] can be used to speed - up the implementation process .
4.7 Data Structure Representation
Figure 8 : The data structure representation pattern .
The data structure representation creational pattern ( Figure 8 ) allows the declarative and domain - specific specification of complex data .
Data - driven code [ KP78 ] relies on initialised data structures whose complexity can often make them difficult to write and maintain .
Complicated structures are better expressed using a language rather than their underlying representation ( e.g. a graph adjacency list may be easier expressed as a list of path connections ) .
Designing a DSL to represent the data offers an attractive solution to the problem .
The pattern is of use whenever a non-trivial data structure ( anything other than rectangular arrays ) needs to be initialised with data .
It is particularly applicable to the initialisation of data structures whose elements are interrelated such as trees , graphs , arrays of pointers to statically initialised structure elements , arrays of pointers to functions , and multilingual text elements .
The DSL typically defines a user - friendly , alternative but isomorphic , representation of the underlying data structure elements .
The DSL compiler can then parse the alternative data representation and transform the data elements to the structure needed for the internal representation .
The adoption of this pattern minimises the chances of initialising data structures with wrong or inconsistent data , as the DSL compiler can perform such checks when compiling the data into the internal format .
In addition , the data can be generated in the most efficient internal representation using tools such as the perfect hash function generator gperf [ Sch90 ] .
The pattern is most often implemented as a DSL compiler from the external to the internal representation .
Where runtime efficiency is not a major constraint the DSL can be directly coded within the system 's hosting language source code utilising the user - friendly alternative data structure and suitably interpreted at runtime .
Such strategies are often employed in systems written in interpreted declarative languages such as Prolog or Lisp .
A representative example of a DSL based on this pattern is FIDO [ KS97 ] which is designed to concisely express regular sets of strings or trees .
Other cases of DSL - based data specifications are the table initialisations generated by yacc [ Joh75 ] and lex [ Les75 ] for the table - driven parsing and lexical analysis automata they create .
Figure 9 : The system front - end pattern .
The configuration and adaptation of a system can often be relegated to a DSL front - end ( Figure 9 ) .
Complicated software systems offer hundreds of configuration options , while their users require ever - increasing adaptation possibilities .
Adding more features and configuration options can enlarge and complicate the system with diminishing returns on real functionality and user - friendliness .
Making the system programmable by means of the DSL front - end structural pattern provides its users with a declarative , maintainable , organised , and open - ended mechanism for configuring and adapting it .
Systems with more than a few configuration options , and systems whose operation can not be adequately specified by means of some arguments or a graphical user interface typically benefit from the addition of a DSL front - end .
Using this strategy the system 's configuration parameters and internal functionality are exposed as elements of the DSL - e.g. as variables and functions respectively .
At this point it is often advantageous to remove from the system all elements that can be specified by means of the DSL , and code them in terms of it , thus simplifying its structure .
Often the addition of a DSL to a system can reveal synergistic effects by enabling its communication with other systems , allowing for the automatic generation of DSL programs with increased functionality , establishing a common language among its user base , providing a mechanism for optimising or checking the system 's configuration , and opening a market for third - party add - on applications .
The pattern is most often implemented as an interpreted language embedded within the target system .
A number of existing interpretative languages have been used or targeted explicitly for this purpose .
Lisp - like languages have been used by systems such as the Emacs [ Sta84 ] editor and the AutoCAD package [ RH98 ] , while languages such as Tcl [ Ous94 ] , Perl [ WS90 ] , and Microsoft 's Application Basic [ Boc99 ] provide explicit support for system embedding .
5 Conclusions
Figure 10 : Relationships within the DSL pattern language .
We have described a DSL pattern language consisting of eight DSL design patterns .
Our pattern language does not include the design of a DSL using traditional programming language design and implementation techniques ( lexical analysis , parsing , code generation ) , as the aspects of those are extensively covered in the existing literature .
The relationships of the patterns we described are depicted in Figure 10 .
The interrelationships between the patterns are both interesting , and typical of a pattern language focused on a specific domain .
Throughout our literature research for drafting this work we were impressed by the multitude of DSL designs , implementation strategies , and resulting systems , and the scarcity of supporting design frameworks and methodologies .
We hope that the pattern language we presented can be used as a building block for a systematic view of the software development process involving DSLs .

Biographical Information
The South China Mall is the largest mall in the world , and it's a ghost town , with only a handful of shops in its peeling , spooky , sprawling guts .
The employees of this giant mall could , if they wanted , spend their breaks driving bumper cars , browsing for house - wares , strolling along a Venetian canal , petting fake herons in an indoor rain forest , or gazing at an eighty - five - foot replica of the Arc de Triomphe – all , of course , without leaving the premises .
They could also picnic next to the bell tower of St Mark 's Square in Venice , soak up the ambience of San Francisco , or take a ride on the mall 's indoor - outdoor roller coaster , a 553 - meter flying railway known as Kuayue Shi Kong , or " Moving Through Time and Space " .
As it happens , it 's just those things – time and space – that give so much trouble to the workers here .
They have too much of both .
On a recent Friday afternoon , an amusement - park employee , slouched in a forsaken ticket booth , tried to kill time by making origami .
Another worker slept , with perfect impunity , on a table .
In front of the haunted house attraction , one attendant was doing hand - stands while two others looked blankly on .
There was nothing else to do , because the South China Mall , which opened with great fanfare in 2005 , is not just the world 's largest .
With fewer than a dozen stores scattered through a space designed to house 1,500 , it is also the world 's emptiest – a dusty , decrepit complex of buildings marked by peeling paint , dead light bulbs , and dismembered mannequins .

Krugman : McCain 's energy project is ' basically irrelevant ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Senator John McCain , who called last week for an end to the ban on offshore drilling , has since admitted that it would not provide any " immediate relief . "
However , he continues to insist that it would be a good idea because " the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have a psychological impact that I think is beneficial . "
Keith Olberman turned for comment on McCain 's energy proposals to economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman .
Krugman began by dismissing McCain 's grandly - named " Lexington Project " for energy independence as " sort of a collection of mice " and noted that offshore drilling " does nothing for the crisis we 're in .
...
It 's trivial compared with things like energy conservation , alternative sources of energy .
This was just to be able to say he was doing something -- which he has n't , actually . "
" I think McCain has bought into the notion that there 's a kind of a panic , " Krugman went on .
" That speculators are buying up energy resources and that 's what 's driving up the price .
...
The problem is that it 's not right .
...
He 's got this idea that if we can just do something , even if it 's basically irrelevant , it 's somehow going to make a big difference in the current situation -- and this is not good policy . "
Krugman said that for him " the stuff about McCain believing that speculators -- evil speculators -- are the problem is the most amazing thing about all this .
It 's not what you expect from a Republican -- except a Republican who 's looking for something , anything to say . "
" He wants to be saying something different , but he ends up sounding basically like Bush over again , " Krugman concluded .
" ' If only you 'd let me drill some more stuff ... forget about the environment .' ...
Even politically , I think it 's a bad idea .
He 's making himself sound more like the guy that most Americans would really like to see the end of . "
Krugman also noted that even though neither candidate has a real answer to the energy crisis , there are definite differences between them .
Obama is proposing to spend actual money -- $ 150 billion over ten years -- and McCain is not .
On the other hand , " McCain is right to give Obama a hard time on ethanol .
That 's not Obama 's finest moment .
He was being a politician .
... Ethanol 's a really bad idea . "

Let me just sum up the known facts here , and for the best big treatment of the story go see Glenn Greenwald
The short story is that what passes for the conservative braintrust these days -- a collection of repulsive little scabs no smarter than their own shoes -- has seized upon an article in the New York Times '
Travel section describing the small town of St. Michaels , Maryland , home to the vacation homes of numerous famous and wealthy Americans , notable among them Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld .
There 's a picture there of Rumsfeld 's driveway .
This , the right - wing bloggers assert , is an intentional " exposure " of Cheney and Rumsfeld to terrorists , done with malice by the New York Times .
No , I 'm not kidding .
There 's only a few problems with this " theory " , as Greenwald admirably points out with the help of others in the blogosphere .
First , noting the astonishing fact that Cheney and Rumsfeld have vacation homes in St. Michaels is hardly new information .
In addition to being public information , it was printed in a similar soft story in the Washington Post last year .
So did , in fact , NewsMax -- one of the rightwing outlets now pretending that publishing that information now is treason .
Second , the New York Times printed a similar story in 2003 about the Clinton 's Chappaqua home , demonstrating that these puff pieces are , golly gee , done all the time .
Guess how many right - wing bloggers had a very public and ceremonially overdressed cow over that one ?
Yeah .
So essentially , this " affront " to the delicate sensibilities of these overstuffed sausages known as the " right " is a completely bogus story .
It 's all spin ; there 's no " there " .
None .
NewsMax itself could tell you where Cheney lived -- they even cited the Washington Post story as their source , in their article .
But here 's the nasty part .
The " response " the right wing blogs have decided on , as a result of this hidden menace that they and only they can see , is retaliation against the reporters and editors who enabled this story .
From one right - wing blog ( no link ; see Greenwald if you must ) :
So , in the school of what 's good for the goose is good for the gander , we are providing this link so YOU may help the blogosphere in locating the homes ( perhaps with photos ? ) of the editors and reporters of the New York Times .
Let 's start with the following New York Times reporters and editors : Arthur " Pinch " Sulzberger Jr. , Bill Keller , Eric Lichtblau , and James Risen .
Do you have an idea where they live ?
Go hunt them down and do America a favor .
Get their photo , street address , where their kids go to school , anything you can dig up , and send it to the link above .
This is your chance to be famous - grab for the golden ring .
Their homes .
Their children .
Go report on where their kids go to school , and it's " your chance " to " do America a favor " .
Find out where their kids go to school , so you can " grab for the golden ring " .
Yeah .
And that particular blogger is n't the only one encouraging such actions , and in fact numerous right - wing blogs have begun to publish the information ; phone numbers , street addresses .
Maps to get to those houses .
And encouragement to grab for that ring .
On a personal note , this is why I laughed my ass off at the " Online Integrity " sign - up sheet being circulated in the wake of the last event similar to this -- when Malkin 's followers used the phone numbers of college students posted prominently ( more than once ) on Malkin 's spittle - flecked site in order to , surprise surprise , inundate those students with crank calls and death threats .
The premise of Online Integrity was that right - wing bloggers were going to start kicking out bloggers who did not agree to adhere to some basic , bottom - rung premises of human behavior .
Guess how long that premise lasted .
So here 's where we 're at .
Will any of the right - wing bloggers denounce the published notion that , in order to settle a score with a newsperson , you should find out where their kids go to school and obliquely use that information to become " famous - grab for the golden ring ? "
Tell me , O noble dung beetles wriggling through whatever mouldering shit you can manage to dig up , where is that line ?
What should you do with the information about the children of reporters , if you find it ?
I 'm waiting .
Note to Malkin .
Note to Powerline .
Note to RedState .
You 're all worms .
You 're sick ; you 're disgusting ; you are an affront to everything America stands for .
Your stupidity makes angels cry , and your constant insistence on pushing blatantly false premises and stories taints this nation and taints the very premise of " journalism " .
You are shameless , cowardly , petty thugs , and you are apparently pathological liars .
So let 's all see what the right - wing response is .
Let 's see how they respond to being corrected on the facts of this so - called " treasonous action " .
Let 's see if they decide that explicit encouragement that the children of reporters and editors are now " fair game " is a line that should or should not be crossed .
They are very insistent that over - the - line behavior by anyone but themselves needs to be condemned by all ; let 's see it happen .
We 're waiting .
Tell us that children are off limits .
Go on .
That might just be , literally , the very least you can do .
