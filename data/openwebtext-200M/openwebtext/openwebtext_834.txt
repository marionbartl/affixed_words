I ’m often surprised by the fact that many people see monads as the be all and end all of Haskell ’s abstraction techniques .
Beginners often struggle over them thinking that they ’re something incredibly important and complex .
In reality though , monads are neither important , nor complex , and that ’s what I aim to show with this little tutorial about what other abstraction techniques you can use , and when they ’re appropriate .
First things first – IO
The reason a lot of people come across monads is that they want to get on with interacting with the outside world – they want to do I/O .
I ’m going to get this out of the way quickly .
In Haskell , IO is kept in a carefully constrained box , because unconstrained it violates referential transparency ( that is , you can get multiple answers from the same call to the same function depending on what the user happens to type / how they wibble the mouse / etc ) .
You can recognise functions in this box by their type signature – they involve a type that looks like this : IO something .
Here ’s a few examples :
-- Call this , and you get back a Char , -- carefully wrapped up in an IO type .
getChar :: IO Char --
This one does n't have an interesting result , -- only a unit value wrapped up in an IO type .
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
These can be stuck together with the handy do notation :
main = do putStrLn
" What is your name ? " name <- getLine putStrLn ( " Your name is " ++ name )
There , that ’s that out of the way – we can do IO now , and we did n’t need to understand anything nasty or complex .
Some Abstraction techniques – Dealing with values in boxes
We often deal with values that are hidden inside other types .
For example , we use lists , to hide values in , we use Maybes etc .
What would be nice , is if we could apply a function to the values hiding in those boxes .
Early in learning Haskell I ’m sure you will have met a function that can do this for lists : map .
This can be generalised though : Enter the Functor .
Functors can do one thing , and one thing only , they can apply a function to a value inside an outer construction .
They do this with the function fmap ( or Functor map ) .
Lets look at some examples :
For Lists , fmap is simply map :
> fmap ( +1 ) [ 1,2,3,4 ] [ 2,3,4,5 ]
For Maybe values fmap lets us apply a function to the value inside a just :
> fmap ( +1 ) ( Just 1 ) Just 2 > fmap ( +1 ) Nothing Nothing
For Tuples , fmap lets us apply a function to the second half of the tuple ( if we import an extra module that defines it ) :
> import Control .
Applicative > fmap ( +1 ) ( 1,2 ) ( 1,3 )
We can use fmap to target a function into several layers of boxes by composing applications :
> ( fmap . fmap ) ( +1 ) [ ( 1,2 ) , ( 3,4 ) ] [ ( 1,3 ) , ( 3,5 ) ]
Here , the first fmap pushes ( fmap ( +1 ) ) inside the list , and the second fmap pushes ( +1 ) inside the tuples .
Putting things in boxes
All that is n’t very useful if we can’t actually put something in a box in the first place .
This is where the pure function comes in handy .
This function lets us wrap anything we like in a box .
> pure 1 :: [ Int ] [ 1 ] > pure 1 :: Maybe Int Just 1 > pure 1 :: Either String Int Right 1
In Haskell , the pure function is in the Applicative class ( you ’ll need to import Control .
Applicative ) .
The Applicative class does some other interesting things as we ’ll see in a minute .
Because of this it would be nice if pure were separated into its own little class all on its own , but unfortunately that is n’t the way it is in Haskell ( at the moment at least ) .
Boxes everywhere
So , we ’ve seen how to put something in a box , and we ’ve seen how to apply a function to a value in a box , but what if our function is in a box too ?
At this point , the Applicative class really comes into its own .
The ( <*>) function from Applicative lets us apply boxes to each other as long as they have the right types of values inside .
> ( Just ( +1 ) ) <*> ( Just 1 ) Just 2 > [ ( +1 ) , ( * 2 ) , ( ^3 ) ] <*> [ 1,2,3 ] [ 2,3,4,2,4,6,1,8,27 ]
That second result is not entirely clear – what ’s going on ?
Well , the ( <*>) function has applied each function to each argument in turn , and bundled up all the results in one list .
( +1 ) gets applied to each argument , generating the results 2,3 and 4 ; ( * 2 ) gets applied to each argument , generating the results 2,4 and 6 ; and finally ( ^3 ) gets applied to each argument , generating the results 1,8 and 27 .
An important note : All Applicatives are also Functors .
You can implement fmap for any Applicative like this :
fmap f a = ( pure f ) <*> a
Applicative in fact does this for you , but calls the function ( < $ > ) .
Functions that produce boxes
When we have functions that produce values that are hidden inside boxes , we have a problem .
Each time we apply the function we get an additional layer of boxes , this is n’t particularly pretty , nor composable .
This is where monads come in .
Monads add a single function called join , which is used to flatten out the layers of boxes :
> join ( Just ( Just 2 ) ) Just 2 > join [ [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3,4,5 ] ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ]
The join function lets us compose our box - producing functions more easily .
We now fmap our box producing function over values in a box .
This results in a 2 - layer set of boxes .
We can then use join to squash that back down again .
This pattern is so useful that we call it “ bind ” or ( = << ) .
f =<< a = join ( f < $> a )
Some people like to define this the other way round :
a >>= f = join ( f <$> a )
This allows a very imperative style of programming where we ask the language to take the result of one computation , push it through a function , take the results , push them through another function , etc .
As with Applicatives and Functors , all Monads are Applicatives .
We can define the ( <*>) function using only bits of a Monad and the pure function :
f <*> a = f >>= ( \fv -> a >>= ( pure . fv ) )
We can see here a common pattern with monadic programming .
We bind a function returning a monadic value into a lambda .
Haskell provides a syntactic sugar for doing this called do notation :
f <*> a = do fv <- f av <- a pure ( fv av )
We can now see clearly that IO in Haskell is not using any magic at all to introduce an imperative concept to a functional language , instead the IO type is simply a monad .
Remember , this means that it ’s a functor and an applicative too , so we can use < $> and <*> wherever we please in IO code to apply functions to IO values .
Why you do n’t always want to go for Monads
As we ’ve seen , Monad sits atop a set of classes proudly the most powerful of all , but that does n’t mean we want to use it all the time .
As we ’ve seen , Monad gives us a very imperative feel to our code – it reveals an order that is n’t necessarily there .
Do notation particularly seems to suggest ( in our example above ) that we should first take the value out of f , then take the value out of a , and then apply the two .
In reality , this order is not there , the Haskell runtime is free to evaluate these in any order it likes .
This can make such language constructs dangerous .
Firstly , we ’re functional programmers because we like describing what things “ are ” , not what steps you should take to produce them .
Secondly , the steps we seem to give here , are not the ones that the run time will really take in the end .
Lets look at an example of when we really should n’t use Monads .
We have excellent Parser combinators in the Parsec library .
These let us define small parsers , and stick them together using the Monadic interface .
Lets define a small parser to parse an Int that may or may not be in a string :
parseInt = do ds <- many1 digit pure $ read ds parseMaybe p = ( do n <- p pure ( Just n ) ) < |> ( pure Nothing )
We are expressing an ordering that we do n’t intend to – first we accept at least one digit into ds , then we read them and rewrap them in a parser .
In parseMaybe first we parse something , and take the value out into n , then we wrap it in Just , and give it back .
This is n’t clear .
Why could n’t we just describe the grammar ?
Why do we have to specify an order ?
Lets patch parsec to provide an Applicative instance :
instance Applicative ( GenParser a st ) where ( <*>) = ap pure = return
Note that I ’m using a shorter version of the definition of ( <*> ) in a monad using the ap function .
Now we may use the applicative functor interface :
parseInt = read < $> many1 digit parseMaybe p = ( Just < $> p ) < |> ( pure Nothing )
Not only are these definitions shorter , but we can quickly and easily see their meanings – an integer is many digits , with read applied to get them into a form we can use in Haskell .
Lets look at a more complex example :
data Record = R { firstCol , secondCol :: Maybe
Int } deriving ( Show ) parseRecord = do col1 <- parseMaybe parseInt char ' , ' col2 <- parseMaybe parseInt char '
' pure ( R col1 col2 )
Again , we ’re specifying an order we do n’t want to see .
Lets look at this in applicative style :
parseRecord = R < $> ( parseMaybe parseInt <* char ' , ' )
<*> ( parseMaybe parseInt <* char '
')
Note the use of the ( <* ) function – this simply takes the value from the left hand parser , and passes it up , ignoring the value returned by the right hand parser .
We can now see that parseRecord constructs a record from two maybe Ints , separated with a comma .
We have n’t introduced any orderings that we do n’t need to , and we ’ve even condensed our code a little .
Conclusions
We ’ve seen the hierarchy of classes in Haskell in all its glory , rather than focusing unduly on the Monad , we ’ve seen that the Monad interface , while powerful , is not always desirable .
Hopefully we ’ve seen that a lot of our monadic code can be cleaned up to use the Applicative ( or maybe even Functor ) interface instead .
A six - year - old boy is in a critical condition after repeatedly pinning himself against a wall while playing with a full - sized remote - controlled car , emergency services say .
He suffered multiple leg fractures , pelvic and head injuries at his family 's semi-rural property at Grose Vale , in Sydney 's north - west , just before 11 am today .
" It is thought from the information that people gave to doctors at the scene that somehow the boy hit the button and the car has gone forward and pinned him against the wall , " NRMA CareFlight spokesman Ian Badham said .
" That happened four times - the car pinned him four times .
That 's why both legs have been badly broken . "
Emergency services were called , but the boy 's mother put him in the car and started to drive to hospital , he said .
NSBM Special Report
Story by J. Bennett
Does Black Metal have a problem with Brownshirts ?
Or is the problem someone else 's ?
Decibel investigates the peculiar world of National Socialist Black Metal .
They were Nazis , dude ?
They were threatening castration , Donny .
Are we gonna split hairs ?
— Memorable exchange from The Big Lebowski , a very funny movie produced and directed by a couple of very funny Jews .
As if acting out some bizarre atavistic saga — half comedy , half high drama — our protagonists assume their marks in the theatre of the absurd .
Somewhere not - so - deep in the sub- underground , the forces of National Socialist Black Metal — henceforth known as NSBM — are circling their Panzer tanks ( or at very least their amplifiers ) against the evil forces of Jewry , Niggerdom and Fagitude .
No , wait — the NSBM dudes are the evil ones ( Evil is , after all , a requirement of all black metal ) and they ’re aligning themselves against the Zionist Occupation Government , jungle fever and same - sex marriage .
Or is it Israel , multiculturalism and gay bars ?
Point is , if it ai n’t white — and straight , and pagan — it ai n’t right .
Or so believe the NSBM hordes , most of whom prefer to think of themselves as warrior - intellectuals rather than musicians ; as defenders of heritage and folkways rather than standard - brand racists .
Not content with black metal ’s unholy trinity of Satanism , corpsepaint and intentional misspellings , the propagators of NSBM see in Burzum mastermind Varg Vikernes not just a convicted murderer or a musical trailblazer , but an ideological messiah .
As the self - appointed Charles Manson of Norwegian black metal , Vikernes started rolling swastika - style — issuing screeds against Jews and “ colored people ” and declaring his relation to Norwegian Nazi political sympathizer Vidkun Quisling — shortly after his arrest for killing Mayhem guitarist Øystein Aarseth in 1993 .
Hypnotized by Vikernes ’ dark charisma and shrewd intellect , a fringe element of the nascent black metal underground took heed .
As a result , many anti-fascist and anti-racist action groups have sounded the air - raid sirens for the second coming of the Luftwaffe , but the majority of NSBM ’s known adherents do n’t seem to be doing much more than toeing White Power ’s party line , dropping a few racial slurs or slapping swastikas on their album covers .
But maybe that ’s an oversimplification .
How Many Polish Black Metal Nazis Does
It Take to Screw in a Lightblub ?
If Varg Vikernes is NSBM ’s messianic ideologue , Rob “ Darken ” Fudali ( pictured at left ) is one of the genre ’s most prolific and revered practitioners .
Fudali ’s primary band , Graveland ( he has another project called Lord Wind ) , emerged from the forests of Poland in 1992 , and has since recorded a slew of albums and EPs ( roughly half of which Fudali plays all the instruments on ) — including 1997 ’s Following the Voice of Blood ( featuring the track “ White Hand ’s Power ” ) , 1999 ’s Immortal Pride and the band ’s latest full - length , Fire Chariot of Destruction — many of which were released on Germany ’s No Colours Records .
Almost unanimously worshipped within NSBM circles , some of Graveland ’s earlier recordings are even considered black metal classics by those who do not share Fudali ’s racial beliefs .
Nonetheless , Darken no longer considers his music black metal .
“ I do not think Graveland is an NSBM band , ” he tells Decibel through an interpreter .
“ Graveland is regarded as a NSBM band because of my political convictions , [ which ] most people would call extreme right - wing National Socialist convictions . ”
Most of Fudali ’s beef with black metal seems to stem from the genre ’s satanic roots in both the Church of Satan - sanctioned stylings of Mercyful Fate and the cartoonish shock tactics of Venom .
“ I do not want my band be identified with Satanism , ” he says .
“ Black metal will always be identified with Satanism because Satanism is inseparably connected with black metal .
From the very beginning of Graveland we have combined paganism with Satanism .
It happened because people I played with were Satanists and they were not interested in paganism .
Due to these differences , we finally started to walk separate ways and Graveland became [ a ] one - man band again .
I understood that I could not support Satanism [ because it ] was a part of Judeo - Christian religion .
In the Third Reich , Satanists would end [ up ] in gas chambers . ”
Oddly enough , Fudali is not particularly interested in being affiliated with National Socialism , either .
“ I do not see any point in referring to NS because I do not see any point in referring to any ideologies that lost , ” he points out .
“ It is against logic and the eternal law of evolution .
I think that white men should search for new ideas that would be well adapted for the current reality and the problems of [ the ] contemporary world . ”
Fudali ’s immediate surroundings in the contemporary world are overwhelmingly white .
As of November 1999 ( according to that month ’s issue of Central Europe Review ) , 98 % of Poland ’s population was ethnic Polish .
That same year , the country ’s Jewish population represented less than half of a percent .
Nonetheless , Fudali believes that white people “ are at the edge of extinction . ”
Like Vikernes , he adheres to a form of pagan nationalism that promotes the segregation of all cultures in order to promote the advancement of the Aryan race .
“ Pagan beliefs are the system of values that is the precious heritage of my folk , ” he offers .
“ Its achievements have assured [ our ] survival and development for thousands of years .
I reach them to re-build my spirituality .
Other people do the same .
The world of right - wing ideologies has always been strongly connected with religion and spirituality .
It distinguishes us from leftists .
People who experience Graveland ’s creativity sometimes experience [ a ] kind of awakening . ”
It is unclear if these people follow Fudali ’s lead by carrying swords and dressing up like medieval warriors in their press photos .
Or if they ’re actually awake while they are doing it .
Pagan War Machine
Ymir G. Winter is the guitarist for the New York - based NSBM band Grom .
Winter says his father openly advocated fascism and that his grandfather ( on his mother ’s side ) fought for Germany in World War II .
“ Couple that with growing up in the racial mosaic of New York City , and I was White Pride from early on , ” he explains via e-mail .
( In his transmissions , he consistently capitalizes the word White while using a lower - case “ j ” in the word Jewish . )
Winter also prides himself on the fact that Grom is one of the few NSBM bands in the world that actually plays live .
“ During many of our shows , we will spit fire and then set an Israeli flag ablaze , ” he explains .
“ When regulations do n’t allow this , we have the crowd stomp the Israeli flag and spit on it .
[ But ] a Grom show is not a redneck rally .
We do not banter on about ‘ kikes and niggers . ’
I am more concerned with praising Aryanism and Paganism than I am with attacking non-whites and using foul language . ”
In addition to his musical pursuits , Winter is a “ proud member ” of the National Alliance , the West Virginia - based White Nationalist group founded by Dr. William Pierce .
Pierce ( 1933 -2002 ) was the author of The Turner Diaries , the futuristic race - war fantasy novel that inspired Timothy McVeigh to detonate a truck full of explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , killing 167 people .
( In The Turner Diaries , which Pierce published under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald in 1978 , the story ’s protagonist detonates a truck full of explosives in the basement of FBI headquarters . )
In early 1999 , Pierce bought Resistance Records , the infamous White Power music clearinghouse that hocks everything from skinhead music and hatecore to RAC ( Rock Against Communism ) and NSBM .
The label is currently pimping the shit out of “ white nationalist folk duo ” Prussian Blue , which consists of two blond , blue - eyed 13 - year - old twin sisters , Lynx and Lamb Gaede , who play folk versions of Skrewdriver songs and original odes to Rudolf Hess at White Power picnics and love -ins .
The Gaede sisters were recently interviewed by Diane Sawyer on ABC ’s Primetime .
It just so happens that Ymir Winter works at Resistance , where he recruits bands , handles CD trades , and writes for the label ’s magazine , aptly entitled Resistance .
“ The goal of Resistance is to steer White youth away from the jewish MTV lifestyle which will have them worshiping hip - hop culture and have them thinking that acting and looking black is ‘ cool , ’ ” Winter explains .
“ Resistance wants to promote Aryan awareness and does so by using music as a recruitment tool and as a vessel for the National Socialist / White Power movement .
I do n’t think that Resistance has taken an official stance as to [ which is ] the best form of White Power music , but I think the scope of NSBM ’s appeal and marketability has been realized .
Ten years ago , hatecore was cutting edge and was the main musical structure for the National Socialist / White Power scene .
These days , more and more it is NSBM . ”
To this end , Winter is also the label manager of Unholy Records , an NSBM subsidiary of Resistance that released a double - disc Burzum tribute album in 2002 ( Visions : A Tribute to Burzum ) , Nocturnal Fear ’s Sterilize and Exterminate and Nachtmystium ’s Reign of the Malicious .
Though the presence of the latter on an NSBM label may surprise many of the band ’s more recent fans , it is important to note that Nachtmystium has always been an apolitical band , and guitarist / vocalist Blake J. ( AKA Azentrius ) ’s more recent musical endeavors — specifically with black metal supergroup Twilight and his own label , Battle Kommand — are not even remotely affiliated with National Socialism or White Power .
“ In the past , we ’ve had some indirect ties to labels and bands that are part of the NS scene , ” Azentrius concedes .
“ At one point not too many years ago , it was n’t uncommon for NS labels or bands to trade and work with non-politically motivated bands and labels because at the end of the day , we ’re all trying to promote , release , and be involved with music — all politics aside .
Today it seems like there ’s less of a connection , at least for me and my label .
We do n’t oppose people ’s right to be ‘ NS ’ or whatever — that ’s a personal choice , and if you live in the USA , you have the right to that opinion .
Even though I personally , my band(s ) and my label have absolutely no interest in being a part of that scene , I will ALWAYS take their side when it comes to their freedom of speech being imposed upon . ”
Whatever Happened to Freedom of Hate Speech ?
Say what you will about the tenets of National Socialism , Dude — at least it ’s an ethos .
— Yet another memorable line from The Big Lebowski
Over the past 15 years , minor controversies have surrounded various black metal bands ’ choices of words and symbols .
Mayhem used old SS Totenkopf insignias on their t- shirts ; Emperor guitarist Samoth started a band called Zyklon ( originally Zyklon - B , the name of a Nazi gas - chamber fumigant ) ; most infamously , the slogan “ Norsk Arisk Black Metal ” ( translation : “ Norwegian Aryan Black Metal ” ) appeared on the back cover of Darkthrone ’s 1994 album Transylvanian Hunger .
Prior to the album ’s release , Darkthrone drummer / lyricist Gylve Nagell ( AKA Fenriz ) apparently sent a fax to the band ’s UK - based label , Peaceville Records , containing text he wanted to include on the album ’s sleeve : “ We would like to state that Transylvanian Hunger stands beyond criticism .
If any man should attempt to criticize this LP , he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior . ”
Peaceville promptly shit themselves and issued a press release stating that the label would honor Nagell ’s request but would “ refuse to promote or advertise ” the album .
Darkthrone then delivered a convoluted apology that claimed , “ In Norway , the word ‘ Jew ’ is used all the time to mean something that ’s out of order …
When we wrote ‘ Jewish behavior ’ in our previous press statement , we could have easily written , according to the Norwegian language , ‘ stupid ’ instead . ”
When contacted by Decibel , Darkthrone guitarist / vocalist Ted Skjellum ( AKA Nocturno Culto ) was hesitant to comment .
“ After the blow we took back in the midst of last decade , I kind of said to myself that we should not ever let some losers try to fry us again , ” he typed via e-mail .
“ You see , people just love to put other meanings to things people say about politics .
FUCK THEM ALL .
It ’s like people do n’t want to wake up and face reality .
Everybody seems to want to live out a fuckin’ lie . ”
There are at least a few people in NSBM circles who think bands like Darkthrone , Zyklon and Mayhem are poseurs .
“ Most of these Norwegian bands ’ ideology is cheap and they will sell it for anything they can get — like a five dollar crack whore , ” says Rich Mills , owner of Vinland Winds Records in New York City , an NSBM label that releases music by Grom , Graveland and Australian bizarros Spear of Longinus .
Like many NSBM acolytes , Mills harbors a unique veneration for Varg Vikernes : “ Burzum is the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs . ”
Mills says he has been “ loosely affiliated ” with the National Alliance in the past , but insists that he will always remain a “ lone wolf . ”
Under the nom de guerre Grimnir Heretik , he is the vocalist for Grand Belial ’s Key , a band that has often been saddled with the NSBM yoke , even if it is n’t necessarily self - applied .
Still , GBK ’s latest album , Kosherat , closes with two Chaos 88 covers ( including the song “ Holy Shit , ” which features the lyric , “ I wanna beat you like the Jew that you are ” ) .
Mills believes there is a double standard applied to the traditionally anti-religious stance prevalent in most forms of extreme music .
“ It seems you can talk about killing Jesus and how much Christianity sucks but if you mention it being linked to or having its roots in Judaism you will be totally boycotted , ” he points out .
“ Attacking Christianity is okay , but [ attacking ] Judaism is not .
You will be labeled an anti-Semitic Nazi Racist .
That is the true hypocrisy of the so - called extreme metal genre .
Freedom of speech just as long as what you say is what they agree with . ”
Another bone of contention within the NSBM community is the fact that death metal and gore bands can get away with graphic lyrics about murder and torture — like Cannibal Corpse ’s infamous “ Stripped , Raped and Strangled ” and “ Fucked With a Knife ” — but criticizing Jewish doctrine or claiming to support a dead political platform like National Socialism is strictly verboten .
“ Most people in the black metal scene are either pro-NS or indifferent to it , ” Mills speculates .
“ The only people who complain are [ in ] the death metal scene , [ and ] claim to be so extreme .
I guess [ lyrics about ] raping your mother and having sex with dead babies are okay , but looking out for your own kind is n’t .
Maybe they do n’t want to really offend their Jewish record labels by claiming affiliation with any extreme right - wing political faction and get themselves dropped . ”
Ymir Winter totally agrees : “ The metal scene has become a politically - correct realm for modern - day hippies and apologists .
These people ‘ Hail Satan ’ and sing about sacrificing infants and then some , yet get all upset at the mention of anti-Semitism .
Somehow it has become fact that one cannot even QUESTION Jewish doctrine , society , ethos , or race without being branded an anti-Semite . ”
Kike Bastards vs. Aryan Assholes
Sometime in 1999 , just after Grom released their debut EP , Pagan War Machine , on Vinland Winds Records , they played a show at the Voodoo Lounge in Queens .
“ In those days , we opened for many mainstream acts such as Deicide and Incantation , ” Winter explains .
“ I think we were playing with Krisiun that night and we heard that one of the main writers or editors from Metal Maniacs was coming to review our show but had an agenda to smear us regardless of how well we played .
Anyway , we caught wind , confronted him and my old bassist ended up grabbing the guy ’s notepad and backpack and hurling [ them ] down the boulevard .
We then grabbed the guy by his collar and tossed him . ”
Grom ’s Wikipedia.com entry — which
Winter claims was not authored by anyone in the band — refers to this incident as , “ The beating of a Jewish member of the Metal Maniacs staff by one of the now - former members of Grom . ”
“ I ’m the only Jewish editor the magazine has ever had , and that never happened to me , ” says former Metal Maniacs editor Mike Greenblatt , AKA Mike G. “ Maybe one of my writers went to see them , but I ’ve always been heavily anti-Nazi and anti-White Power .
I used to make a point of it .
I remember when I interviewed Lemmy from Motörhead , he was talking about Hitler and I questioned him on it .
He said Hitler was the first rock star , and of course I knew what he meant , but at the time , he had gotten me drunk on Jack Daniel ’s and the room was spinning around while he was spouting this shit about Hitler , and I was like , ‘ Wait a minute — I ’m a Jewish guy !
I do n’t get into that shit !’
So I always wore my Jewishness on my sleeve as sort of a rebellious thing against these White Power assholes . ”
In fact , the history of Greenblatt ’s nom de plume dates back to hate mail sent to the Maniacs office when he started at the magazine in 1989 .
“ The publisher and I started receiving death threats , like , ‘ Die , you kike bastard ! ’ and all this shit , ” he explains .
At first , Greenblatt resisted the publisher ’s suggestion he abbreviate his last name , but then eventually agreed , albeit for a completely different reason .
“ The final turn came in 1991 when I started a country music magazine .
I understood , business - wise , that if the kids found out that the editor of Metal Maniacs was also the editor of a country music magazine , it would hurt my credibility in the metal world . ”
Nazi Watchdogs
In the fall of 1999 , the Southern Poverty Law Center ’s quarterly magazine , Intelligence Report , featured an article entitled “ Sounds of Violence . ”
As though narrating a trailer for Reefer Madness , the authors warn of “ a new generation of metal bands , known as the black metal underground , [ that ] is so extreme it makes Marilyn Manson look square . ”
They then claim that Varg Vikernes was imprisoned for “ beheading his best friend ” — in actuality , Vikernes stabbed Aarseth to death , and the two had n’t been particularly friendly for some months prior to the murder — and make a vague attempt to link the Columbine shootings to black metal : “ Words , for these youths , often become action .
Among others , Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris , who murdered 12 of their classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado last April , were said to have been influenced by this kind of music . ”
Next , they vilify Lords of Chaos co-author Michael Moynihan for making allegedly racist and fascist comments and for his membership in “ the black metal band Blood Axis . ”
The main problem with this particular part of the article — besides being totally misleading — is that Blood Axis is not a black metal band .
Rather than interview Moynihan , the authors of the article excerpted quotes from an issue of Compulsion zine published in 1998 .
“ I have no problem being called a fascist , ” Moynihan is quoted as saying .
“ If fascism will restore some sense of order , discipline and responsibility to the world , then I am all for it . ”
Two of the authors of the SPLC report , John Lunsford and Justin Massa , also wrote portions of the anti-White Power music campaign Turn It Down ’s December 1999 tract Soundtracks to the White Revolution : White Supremacist Assaults on Youth Music Subcultures , which features chapters on NSBM and a sub-section ( in the chapter on noise bands ) on Moynihan specifically .
Unsurprisingly , the same Compulsion quote appears in both texts .
“ The reports on black metal by these watchdog groups represent some of their most shoddy investigative work , ” Moynihan tells Decibel .
“ This not only shows the low level of understanding they have for the subject matter , but it calls the accuracy of their work as a whole into question .
Not that these kind of issues probably concern them , however , since the real goal of these reports is neither historical nor journalistic accuracy — it ’s to keep their readers sufficiently alarmed so that they will continue to donate money to the coffers of the watchdogs .
Of course something like black metal , with all of its apocalyptic overtones , suits such a purpose perfectly .
“ Regarding their attacks on me , these too have been packed with misinformation and outright errors , ” Moynihan adds .
“ They ignore my artistic work as whole — it ’s clear they ’ve never even listened to the records they ’re condemning — and merely focus on a few provocative statements selectively culled from interviews done nearly 15 years ago .
These statements become far more ambiguous when contextualized into everything I ’ve said and done over the years .
From the very beginning I have said that Blood Axis represents a grey area of Nietzschean amorality and paradox ; the inability of people to handle it , or even grasp it on these terms , only proves how successfully it embodies this . ”
The Turn It Down campaign was launched in 1999 by the Center for New Community , a faith - based non-profit organization stationed in Chicago .
According to Devin Burghart , the Director of the CNC ’s Building Democracy Initiative and editor of Soundtracks to the White Revolution , the CNC is “ a civil and human rights organization concerned about social , racial and economic justice . ”
( The third author of the SPLC report , Eric Ward , is currently on staff at the CNC ; Massa is a former CNC staffer . )
“ Part of the work we ’ve done here at the Center for a number of years has been to help counter White Power music and particularly the growth of the NSBM phenomenon , ” Burghart adds .
“ We ’re part of a network of organizations that works to counter this type of music internationally . ”
Soundtracks to the White Revolution ’s chapter on NSBM opens with a list of 21 US - based NSBM labels and distributors .
While most of the labels on the list deal at least partially if not exclusively in NS titles , the presence of LA - based Southern Lord Records — known for decidedly non-Nazi black metal releases from Craft , Lurker of Chalice and Xasthur — was initially puzzling .
Even more baffling is the fact that , in 1999 , when Soundtracks to the White Revolution was published , Southern Lord specialized almost exclusively in doom and drone bands like Goatsnake and Sunn O ) ) ) .
Asked which Southern Lord title or titles Turn It Down considers National Socialist in nature , Burghart ca n’t recall .
“ I ’d have to go back and look to see what they were carrying at the time , ” he says .
“ But it was clear — we had a pretty long discussion about the threshold these labels had to cross before we were gonna list them .
It was n’t that they just had one Burzum album — it had to be far more than that . ”
Turn
It Down ’s NS threshold remains a mystery .
Although Southern Lord declined to comment for this article , it seems the error potentially occurred in conjunction with the label ’s very first release , Dommedagsnatt , by now - defunct Seattle doom mavens Thorr ’s Hammer , which included Southern Lord owner Greg Anderson and fellow Sunn O ) ) ) guitarist Stephen O’Malley as members .
Thor ’s Hammer — with one “ r ” — is the name of a Polish NSBM band featuring former Graveland drummer Capricornus .
Hating for Dollars
Vee vant zee money , Lebowski .
—( You guessed it . )
Despite the flaws in their reporting , the CNC and the SPLC are genuinely concerned about the use of NSBM — and White Power music in general — as a recruitment tool for organized white supremacist groups like the National Alliance .
But even Burghart admits that most of the evidence that NSBM is successfully recruiting serious White Power acolytes is purely anecdotal .
“ White Power groups like the National Alliance have attempted to use the NSBM packaging and genre to recruit a different type of disaffected young person into the white supremacist movement , ” Burghart explains .
“ Most of the NSBM bands used to get the cold shoulder from old - line White Power bands in the hardcore and oi scenes .
But with the popularity of bands like Burzum and Graveland , the foundation was laid to bring those folks in .
But frankly , these [ organizations ] do n’t have enough critical mass to draw people from .
I think the conundrum they ’ve run into with the NSBM scene is that they were late to get involved and unable to capitalize . ”
Which begs the question : Does any White Power organization that wants to be taken seriously in the political arena really want to be associated with a bunch of dudes running around in corpsepaint and wielding swords ?
“ That actually has been a topic of discussion , ” Burghart says .
“ There are those in the white supremacist movement who like the fact that most of the members of the NSBM scene are fairly well - educated and have a more elite or aristocratic perspective than the more working - class followers of the White Power / skinhead scene .
But for some , the gruff sound of black metal and , you know , the corpsepaint , is n’t that attractive . ”
Mark Potok , Director of the SPLC ’s Intelligence Project and editor of the Intelligence Report that ran the “ Sounds of Violence ” article back in 1999 , says that William Pierce was initially reluctant to bring Resistance Records under the National Alliance ’s ivory umbrella for those very reasons .
“ It was very painful for William Pierce to buy Resistance , ” Potok explains .
“ He could n’t stand the music .
His thing was Wagner and polkas — no kidding — he thought that stuff was ‘ healthy ’ music .
He used to talk about the ‘ Negroid rhythms ’ of American pop music . ”
This is a sentiment echoed by Varg Vikernes , who has done much to distance himself from black metal in recent years because of metal ’s foundation in rock ‘ n ’ roll , and by extension , the blues .
However , Pierce was able to ignore the black metal ’s lack of Aryan purity when the NA ’s Resistance - bolstered bank statements began rolling in .
“ Between dues and Resistance , the National Alliance was grossing close to a million dollars a year at its peak in 2002 , right around the time Pierce died , ” Potok explains .
“ He thought the music was disgusting , but he knew it was important to the movement , and he recognized it as a very important money - making tool . ”
Bark vs. Bite
Despite the often alarmist nature of the reports issued by both SPLC and Turn It Down , neither Potok nor Burghart was able to cite a substantive act of violence committed by a member of the NSBM community since “ Sounds of Violence ” and Soundtracks to the White Revolution were published .
Still , Burghart insists that NSBM is potentially more dangerous than the documented violence of skinhead groups and other White Power bands .
“ I think NSBM is as serious as any genre in the White Power scene — if not more so , because of the glorification of ultra-violence , ” he says .
“ We ’re only talking about a scene of maybe a few hundred people , but within that scene , there is a high propensity for violence . ”
The closest Burghart comes is the case of Leo Felton , a six - foot - seven , 225 - lb straightedge skinhead arrested in April 2001 for passing counterfeit bills at a Dunkin Donuts in Boston .
At the time of his arrest , the 30 - year old Felton had already served 11 years in prison for the attempted murder of a black cab driver , and was allegedly a member of the anti-Semitic World Church of the Creator and the Outlaw Hammerskins .
Police apparently found bomb - making materials in Felton ’s apartment , and believed he was conspiring to blow up the New England Holocaust Memorial .
But Felton ’s connection to NSBM is tenuous at best : according to articles that Burghart co-authored ( with Justin Massa ) in the October 2000 and July 2001 issues of the British - based anti-fascist magazine Searchlight , Felton read an NSBM - related zine called Fenris Wolf when he was incarcerated in New York on the attempted murder charge .
Fenris Wolf was published by Nathan Pett , who hid convicted murderer and fugitive Hendrik Möbus — of the German black metal band Absurd — at his home near Spokane , Washington .
Fenris Wolf was also affiliated with the Pagan Front , a loosely knit organization collectively known as “ The Hammer of National Socialist Black Metal . ”
While Felton was killing time behind bars reading Fenris Wolf , he also slit the throats of two black inmates who allegedly tried to rape him .
The irony of all this is that Felton ’s father is black .
Welcome to RaHoWa !
Of course , there are those who will think that simply giving NSBM editorial space is an implicit form of support for its underlying ideologies .
As a metal journalist who has written extensively about NSBM bands in publications like Terrorizer , Metal Maniacs and Unrestrained , Nathan Birk has come up against this kind of thinking repeatedly .
“ I just think that ’s a bad symptom of modern American social mores that I ’m expected to take these people to task , ” he says .
“ I do n’t really listen to ambiguous , please - all demographics of music — I prefer bands that lay it on the line , be they far - right or far - left .
What about a band like Severed Head of State ?
They talk about torching cops .
If I write about them , it does n’t mean I support torching cops .
Yeah , I have a natural distrust of authority , but I ’m also a father , so if there ’s someone breaking into my house , I wanna be able to call the cops and make sure they fuckin’ come . ”
Birk also is n’t convinced that most NSBM bands pose an actual physical threat to anyone .
“ I ’m sure 95 percent of it is just talk , anyway , ” he says .
“ They ’re just using imagery .
I mean , Graveland were n’t always singing about ‘ the power of the white hand ’ or whatever .
I have demo tapes where they thank Dead Can Dance . ”
In defense of his own writing , Birk also cites the use of fascistic imagery by musical enigmas Death in June , a band that has never come out in support of any political platform .
“ Why is it so taboo in Western society to use imagery of and metaphors for power , domination and submission ? ” he asks .
“ Why do they have to be beholden to an endorsement of those things ?
I mean , is art so beholden to these absolutes ? ”
Just the same , NSBM figureheads like Fudali speak of RaHoWa , the perpetually impending Racial Holy War in which the white race will be forced to defend its blood and soil against the alien forces of the “ mud races ” and the Zionist Occupation Government ( ZOG ) , the hidden Jewish hand that controls Hollywood , the Federal Reserve , and is the driving force behind the US alliance with Israel .
( The concept of ZOG is derived from an allegedly ancient text first published in Russia in 1903 entitled The Protocols of the Elders of Zion .
Many white supremacist groups believe
The Protocols is an instruction manual for the Zionist — AKA Jewish — conspiracy to manipulate the world ’s social order through a systematic takeover of the mass media and financial institutions .
As early as 1921 , the New York Times proved that The Protocols were a forgery . )
“ When will RaHoWa come ? ” Fudali asks .
For him , it is a rhetorical question .
“ Maybe when the US loses [ the ] war in the Middle East ?
It is inevitable .
Islam spreads without aircraft carriers and super - war technology .
One thing is sure : RaHoWa is imminent . ”
For all the large talk that goes on in NSBM circles , very few of these self - styled racial holy warriors are perpetrating any actual crimes — at least that we know about .
However , there a few lone wolves who seem more than prepared to get it on , Timothy McVeigh style .
We Are But Wolves Among Sheep
We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children .
— The “ Fourteen Words ” of White Nationalism
About a year ago , I got an e-mail from Quebec with a photo attached .
Two clicks later , I was looking down the barrel of a gun .
In the photo , a man in military fatigues , a black ski mask , and a flak jacket was pointing an automatic rifle at the camera lens .
His name is Vjohrrnt V. Wodansson ; he was , at the time , the webmaster and minister of propaganda for the Canadian ( or “ Northern Vinland ” in Aryan - speak ) chapter of the Pagan Front , otherwise known as “ The Hammer of National Socialist Black Metal , ” a loose pro-Aryan cadre of “ heathen writers , artists , musicians , editors and label owners who care for our ancestral heritage , purity of race and tradition , and are ready to defend it , when the time comes . ”
Wodansson is a member of the “ leaderless resistance , ” one of the white supremacist movement ’s faceless lone wolves .
Like Timothy McVeigh , he claims to be a survivalist hardliner , and it is clear that he is no stranger to serious weaponry .
At the time of this interview , he was also the vocalist and drummer for a NSBM band called Nacht Und Nebel , which is German for “ Night and Fog . ” On December 7 , 1941 , Field Marshall Wilhelm Keitel issued Adolf Hitler ’s infamous “ Night and Fog Decree , ” which stated that those who resisted German rule in occupied territories would “ disappear in the night and fog ” — Nazi - speak for deportation to concentration camps .
Their families would not be informed .
Night and Fog is also the title of Alain Resnais ’ brutal 1955 Holocaust mini-documentary , which contains stomach - churning footage shot at the concentration camp at Auschwitz , Poland .
There is also an NSBM compilation entitled The Night and the Fog : A Tribute to National Socialist Black Metal , co-released in the late ‘ 90s by Dungeons of Darkness Records and Hendrik Möbus ’ Darker Than Black Records .
“ Racism is a natural instinct of man , ” Wodansson tells Decibel via e-mail .
“ Humanist black metal faggots who praise global friendship and tolerance for all should start thinking about switching to another , more humanist style of music — like death metal for example . ”
For Wodansson , black metal is only a means to an end : the recruitment and preparation for RaHoWa .
“ The musical medium is solely propaganda , ” Wodansson says .
“ Black metal is a common passion we share , but we all know that music is not the solution .
It will not help us win the war .
It is a great medium for recruiting , or at the minimum , attracting some interest from the youth .
Besides that , NSBM cannot do much more than entertain .
It is not the answer to the problem in itself . ”
Like Varg Vikernes and Rob Fudali , Wodansson espouses an intense dislike for the Satanism prevalent in black metal circles .
He even quotes Vikernes directly : “ Perhaps in time when they eventually start to realize that they are in fact ‘ only slaves to the one with horns , ’ like Vikernes once stated in an interview , and awake from that hypnosis .
Then some progress will be possible towards a more productive goal and ideological coherence . ”
Unlike many NSBM devotees , Wodansson has no use for Nazi relics or propaganda .
Like Deicide ’s inverted cross or Venom ’s pentagram , they represent an idea — they are not the idea itself .
“ Many would call themselves NS because they collect WW2 medals , helmets , flags or buy a bunch of books on the subject — that ’s all crap , it ’s all useless , ” he spits .
“ National Socialism is in the soul , mind and spirit of the individual , not in 70 - year - old junk .
I have never read Mein Kampf , nor do I intend [ to ] ever read it .
I do not need it to know my path .
Give me an original [ Nazi ] pistol , an Iron Cross Medal of Honor or one of Hitler ’s personal suits and I ’ll immediately sell it so that I can purchase weapons .
We discourage you [ from ] wasting all your money on useless things like CDs and Nazi decorations for your bedroom .
This is no fucking rock ‘ n ’ roll fashion show : THIS IS RACE WAR !! ”
As a precaution , the PFV , now defunct according to Wodansson , did not discuss any of its more “ delicate projects , ” as he calls them , with new recruits , much less the press .
“ [ What ] we have in mind is never discussed with those [ whom ] we cannot be 100 % sure of their complete integrity and reliability regarding the revolution at hand , ” he explains .
“ As I said previously , music is not all we are about .
We make a huge point about preparedness , survivalist training , weapons training , and food and equipment caches for later use .
That ’s how it should be for any serious revolutionary activists : Minimum to live by , the rest in what is imperative for war .
“ You can not go to war with your BC Rich guitar or your Vic Firth drum sticks , can you ? ” Wodansson continues .
“ The PFV firmly express that the armament of its members by ‘ all means necessary ’ is a duty to all true revolutionary fighters .
And I am not talking of swords , battle axes and fantasy daggers here .
When the ZOG raid your house to look for hate propaganda and discriminating anti-fed - governmental evidence , do you really think they will be frozen with fear at the sight of a corpsepainted kid in black holding [ a ] fake sword ? ”
It is the sound every would - be Tiger Woods yearns for – the sweet high - pitched " thunk " as the oversized head of their favourite driver sends the ball soaring up the fairway .
Yet the latest must - have titanium clubs , which can cost hundreds of pounds each on the promise of delivering longed - for extra yardage , could be hurting more than your bank balance .
Ear specialists have found that the hearing of one 55 - year - old player could have been damaged by the sound of his new ultra - thin club striking the ball and have suggested golfers should consider wearing ear plugs to minimise the threat to their health .
Research published in the British Medical Journal , which pitted six brands of titanium clubs against thicker - faced and older stainless steel models , found that the former produced greater sound levels .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It was carried out by a team of ear , nose and throat specialists based at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital after a golfer attended their clinic suffering from reduced hearing in his right ear along with unexplained tinnitus .
He complained he had been using one super - lightweight club three times a week for 18 months which made a sound " like a gun going off " .
One of the study 's authors , Malcolm Buchanan , said : " Thin - faced titanium drivers may produce sufficient sound to induce temporary or even permanent cochlear damage in susceptible individuals . "
Golfers should consider ear protection , particularly on an enclosed driving range where they might hit hundreds of balls over a short period , researchers said .
Professionals believe they could prevent players hearing cries of " fore " .
Dr Buchanan , a keen golfer , conceded that wearing ear plugs could be " a bit too radical " for many players , even though some golfers had likened the sound to a " sonic boom " and others said it made them unpopular on the tee .
Scott Gourlay , head professional at Craigmillar Park Golf Club in Edinburgh , said : " On a range , you might get an effect from these drivers .
But it 's not as bad on the course because the noise dissipates in the open air and you are only hitting a drive every 15 minutes . "
" I wanted to come to hear for myself first - hand from people in Gaza , whose lives have been so badly impacted by the recent conflict , " the former prime minister said at a school in the northern town of Beit Hanun .
" These are the people who need to be the focus of all our efforts for peace and progress from now on . "
After attending college in the late 80s I became skeptical of the " received wisdom " approach to education I encountered there .
I strongly believed that real truth and understanding could only be found through a Socratic Dialogue of systematic doubt .
Instead each course was taught as if the facts presented were truths handed down by God to be memorized .
After reading the very revealing Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich , I gained confidence in attempting a Socratic Dialogue directly with the immortal books .
This approach has taken a long time and is still ongoing .
However I believe I have discovered a straightforward approach to achieve an education level that is the peer of any elite undergraduate college in the modern world .
This wouldnt have been the case 70 years ago when colleges were far better , but it is now .
This will take 4 to 5 years .
Pick a season and work for 3 to 4 months to pay for living expenses for the rest of the year while studying .
If you have to live at home or with roommates to afford that then do so .
Your study plan will be based on 7 books .
Each book will take 4 to 12 months of intensive study to work through one at a time .
You will study to completely master the material in each book .
You will seek out inexpensive tutors that are easily found on college campuses to help with this task .
They often charge $ 10 to $ 20 an hour .
Interview tutors until you find the right ones for each book .
If possible try to find a tutor who will read or hopefully reread the books at the same rate as yourself .
Meet with your tutor every 1 or 2 weeks for a couple hours to go over corrected homework and engage in a Socratic Dialogue .
If you need to fill in gaps from your high school education , that will become apparent while working through the 7 books and your tutor will assign supplementary reading .
During these 4 years you will also want to do some networking for intern and apprentice opportunities , if at all possible to be done during the 4 working months .
If its not possible to work as an apprentice during the 4 years of study , that should be your goal after graduating .
That s the meat of the course .
The dessert is getting a recognized college degree .
You will do this by taking your final year of study in a distance program at either Empire State College or Open University .
These colleges allow testing out of other courses , so you will do that for the other 3 years .
Youll want to be in communication with either of these 2 from the start about your plan and progress .
Make a 4.5 - year study schedule of the chapters of each book under advisement from your tutors and college .
You may have to skip some chapters depending on your ability and commitment .
Be sure to stay on top of this because these books will require a tremendous amount of work .
Your payback however will be literally priceless .
Here are the 7 books , in the order they should be studied :
By claiming your inheritance of human achievement in truth , knowledge , science , virtue and art , you will also be well prepared for a glorious future of achieving freedom and prosperity .
There should probably also be an 8th book that would be a general world history , including of art .
Any suggestions ?
Reading additional books by Rothbard would also be a great idea , especially This one .
Given current circumstances , everyone of every education level should read This one .

Man , if there was ever a Senator who should not ask strangers " do you know who I am ? " it is David Vitter of Louisiana .
And yet , that is what he said at Dulles last week .
Vitter is famous mostly for sleeping with prostitutes and then just not resigning over it , even after everyone in the world heard the terrible rumor that he 's a diaper fetishist .
Since his name turned up on the DC madam 's list and he held a hilarious press conference with his terrifying wife ( pictured above ) , he 's been one of the leaders of the Senate Republicans ' opposition to Barack Obama , because that leadership vacuum is actually really real .
And now he has one more item for his political resume : freaking the fuck out at the airport , like an entitled child .
See , he arrived to the airport late , and they would n't let him board his plane .
So he opened the security door , which set off an alarm , because it 's the security door , and Vitter kept pointing to his Senate member pin like it was a magical " go wherever you want whenever you want " badge , and he said " do you know who I am " or some equivalent phrase , and the poor airport employee he was yelling at quite reasonably threatened to call security .
Vitter , according to the witness , remained defiant , yelling that the employee could call the police if he wanted to and their supervisors , who , presumably , might be more impressed with his Senator 's pin .
Then the guy went to find a cop or something and Vitter ran away .
Probably crying , the whole time .
Because he missed his flight which probably totally messed up his date to have man -baby sex with a hooker .
Of course , this happens to members of Congress basically all the time , this airport rage .
Unstable madman Senator Jim Webb kept showing up to airports with unregistered guns , and California Democrat Bob Filner — who was arrested with the freedom riders in 1961 !— was arrested in 2007 for freaking out when his luggage got lost .
But neither of them , as far as we know , tried the " do you know who I am " bit , or slept with prostitutes while wearing adult diapers .

We need to flood Congress about this Insane Legislature to benefit Monsnato Lose Your Property for Growing Food ?
March 16 , 2009
By Chelsea Schilling
© 2009 WorldNetDaily
Some small farms and organic food growers could be placed under direct supervision of the federal government under new legislation making its way through Congress .
Food Safety Modernization Act
House Resolution 875 , or the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009 , was introduced by Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , in February .
DeLauro 's husband , Stanley Greenburg , works for Monsanto – the world 's leading producer of herbicides and genetically engineered seed .
DeLauro 's act has 39 co-sponsors and was referred to the House Agriculture Committee on Feb .
4 . It calls for the creation of a Food Safety Administration to allow the government to regulate food production at all levels – and even mandates property seizure , fines of up to $ 1 million per offense and criminal prosecution for producers , manufacturers and distributors who fail to comply with regulations .
Michael Olson , host of the Food Chain radio show and author of " Metro Farm , " told WND the government should focus on regulating food production in countries such as China and Mexico rather than burdening small and organic farmers in the U.S. with overreaching regulations .
" We need somebody to watch over us when we 're eating food that comes from thousands and thousands of miles away .
We need some help there , " he said .
" But when food comes from our neighbors or from farmers who we know , we do n't need all of those rules .
If your neighbor sells you something that is bad and you get sick , you are going to get your hands on that farmer , and that will be the end of it .
It regulates itself . "
The legislation would establish the Food Safety Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services " to protect the public health by preventing food - borne illness , ensuring the safety of food , improving research on contaminants leading to food - borne illness , and improving security of food from intentional contamination , and for other purposes . "
Federal regulators will be tasked with ensuring that food producers , processors and distributors – both large and small – prevent and minimize food safety hazards such as food - borne illnesses and contaminants such as bacteria , chemicals , natural toxins or manufactured toxicants , viruses , parasites , prions , physical hazards or other human pathogens .
Under the legislation 's broad wording , slaughterhouses , seafood processing plants , establishments that process , store , hold or transport all categories of food products prior to delivery for retail sale , farms , ranches , orchards , vineyards , aquaculture facilities and confined animal - feeding operations would be subject to strict government regulation .
Government inspectors would be required to visit and examine food production facilities , including small farms , to ensure compliance .
They would review food safety records and conduct surveillance of animals , plants , products or the environment .
" What the government will do is bring in industry experts to tell them how to manage all this stuff , " Olson said .
" It 's industry that 's telling government how to set these things up .
What it always boils down to is who can afford to have the most influence over the government .
It would be those companies that have sufficient economies of scale to be able to afford the influence – which is , of course , industrial agriculture . "
Farms and food producers would be forced to submit copies of all records to federal inspectors upon request to determine whether food is contaminated , to ensure they are in compliance with food safety laws and to maintain government tracking records .
Refusal to register , permit inspector access or testing of food or equipment would be prohibited .
" What is going to happen is that local agriculture will end up suffering through some onerous protocols designed for international agriculture that they simply do n't need , " Olson said .
" Thus , it will be a way for industrial agriculture to manage local agriculture . "
Under the act , every food producer must have a written food safety plan describing likely hazards and preventative controls they have implemented and must abide by " minimum standards related to fertilizer use , nutrients , hygiene , packaging , temperature controls , animal encroachment , and water . "
" That opens a whole can of worms , " Olson said .
" I think that 's where people are starting to freak out about losing organic agriculture .
Who is going to decide what the minimum standards are for fertilization or anything else ?
The government is going to bring in big industry and say we are setting up these protocols , so what do you think we should do ?
Who is it going to bring in to ask ?
The government will bring in people who have economies of scale who have that kind of influence . "
DeLauro 's act calls for the Food Safety Administration to create a " national traceability system " to retrieve history , use and location of each food product through all stages of production , processing and distribution .
Olson believes the regulations could create unjustifiable financial hardships for small farmers and run them out of business .
" That is often the purpose of rules and regulations : to get rid of your competition , " he said .
" Only people who are very , very large can afford to comply .
They can hire one person to do paperwork .
There 's a specialization of labor there , and when you are very small , you can't afford to do all of these things . "
Olson said despite good intentions behind the legislation , this act could devastate small U.S. farms .
" Every time we pass a rule or a law or a regulation to make the world a better place , it seems like what we do is subsidize production offshore , " he said .
" We tell farmers they can no longer drive diesel tractors because they make bad smoke .
Well , essentially what we 're doing is giving China a subsidy to grow our crops for us , or Mexico or anyone else . "
Section 304 of the Food Safety Modernization
Act establishes a group of " experts and stakeholders from Federal , State , and local food safety and health agencies , the food industry , consumer organizations , and academia " to make recommendations for improving food - borne illness surveillance .
According to the act , " Any person that commits an act that violates the food safety law … may be assessed a civil penalty by the Administrator of not more than $ 1,000,000 for each such act . "
Each violation and each separate day the producer is in defiance of the law would be considered a separate offense and an additional penalty .
The act suggests federal administrators consider the gravity of the violation , the degree of responsibility and the size and type of business when determining penalties .
Criminal sanctions may be imposed if contaminated food causes serious illness or death , and offenders may face fines and imprisonment of up to 10 years .
" It 's just frightening what can happen with good intentions , " Olson said .
" It 's probably the most radical notions on the face of this Earth , but local agriculture does n't need government because it takes care of itself . "
Food Safety and Tracking Improvement Act
Another " food safety " bill that has organic and small farmers worried is Senate Bill 425 , or the Food Safety and Tracking Improvement Act , sponsored by Sen.
Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio .
Brown 's bill is backed by lobbyists for Monsanto , Archer Daniels Midland and Tyson .
It was introduced in September and has been referred to the Senate Agriculture , Nutrition and Forestry Committee .
Some say the legislation could also put small farmers out of business .
Like HR 875 , the measure establishes a nationwide " traceability system " monitored by the Food and Drug Administration for all stages of manufacturing , processing , packaging and distribution of food .
It would cost $ 40 million over three years .
" We must ensure that the federal government has the ability and authority to protect the public , given the global nature of the food supply , " Brown said when he introduced the bill .
He suggested the FDA and USDA have power to declare mandatory recalls .
The government would track food shipped in interstate commerce through a recordkeeping and audit system , a secure , online database
or registered identification .
Each farmer or producer would be required to maintain records regarding the purchase , sale and identification of their products .
A 13 - member advisory committee of food safety and tracking technology experts , representatives of the food industry , consumer advocates and government officials would assist in implementing the traceability system .
The bill calls for the committee to establish a national database or registry operated by the Food and Drug Administration .
It also proposes an electronic records database to identify sales of food and its ingredients " establishing that the food and its ingredients were grown , prepared , handled , manufactured , processed , distributed , shipped , warehoused , imported , and conveyed under conditions that ensure the safety of the food . "
It states , " The records should include an electronic statement with the date of , and the names and addresses of all parties to , each prior sale , purchase , or trade , and any other information as appropriate . "
If government inspectors find that a food item is not in compliance , they may force producers to cease distribution , recall the item or confiscate it .
" If the postal service can track a package from my office in Washington to my office in Cincinnati , we should be able to do the same for food products , " Sen .
Brown said in a Sept. 4 , 2008 , statement .
" Families that are struggling with the high cost of groceries should not also have to worry about the safety of their food .
This legislation gives the government the resources it needs to protect the public . "
Recalls of contaminated food are usually voluntary ; however , in his weekly radio address on March 15 , President Obama announced he 's forming a Food Safety Working Group to propose new laws and stop corruption of the nation 's food .
The group will review , update and enforce food safety laws , which Obama said " have not been updated since they were written in the time of Teddy Roosevelt . "
The president said outbreaks from contaminated foods , such as a recent salmonella outbreak among consumers of peanut products , have occurred more frequently in recent years due to outdated regulations , fewer inspectors , scaled back inspections and a lack of information sharing between government agencies .
" In the end , food safety is something I take seriously , not just as your president but as a parent , " Obama said .
" No parent should have to worry that their child is going to get sick from their lunch just as no family should have to worry that the medicines they buy will cause them harm . "
The blogosphere is buzzing with comments on the legislation , including the following : * Obama and his cronies or his puppetmasters are trying to take total control – nationalize everything , disarm the populace , control food , etc .
We are seeing the formation of a total police state .
* Well ... that 's not very " green " of Obama .
What 's his real agenda ?
* This is getting way out of hand !
Is n't it enough the FDA already allows poisons in our foods ?
* If you 're starving , no number of guns will enable you to stay free .
That 's the whole idea behind this legislation .
He who controls the food really makes the rules .
* The government is terrified of the tax loss .
Imagine all the tax dollars lost if people actually grew their own vegetables !
Imagine if people actually coordinated their efforts with family , friends and neighbors .
People could be in no time eating for the price of their own effort .
...
Oh the horror of it all !
The last thing the government wants is for us to be self - sufficient .
* They want to make you dependent upon government .
I say no way !
already the government is giving away taxes from my great great grandchildren and now they want to take away my food , my semi-auto rifles , my right to alternative holistic medicine ?
We need a revolution , sheeple !
Wake up !
They want fascism ... can you not see that ?
* The screening processes will make it very expensive for smaller farmers , where bigger agriculture corporations can foot the bill .
* If anything it just increases accountability , which is arguably a good thing .
It pretty much says they 'll only confiscate your property if there are questions of contamination and you do n't comply with their inspections .
I think the severity of this has been blown out of proportion by a lot of conjecture .
* Do n't waste your time calling the criminals in D.C. and begging them to act like humans .
This will end with a bloody revolt .
* The more I examine this ( on the surface ) seemingly innocuous bill the more I hate it .
It is a coward 's ploy to push out of business small farms and farmers markets without actually making them illegal because many will choose not to operate due to the compliance issue .

Time Warner abruptly fired the two top leaders of its struggling AOL unit Wednesday and replaced them with one of the top executives from Google .
AOL ’s new chairman and chief executive will be Tim Armstrong , who joined Google in 2000 to start a sales operation for the then - tiny search engine .
Since then , Google has grown to sell more advertising than any newspaper , magazine or television network .
Mr. Armstrong , who was the president of American operations , looked after both advertising sales and relationships with publishers .
He replaces Randy Falco , a former top executive of NBC , who was brought in to run AOL in November 2006 by Jeffrey L. Bewkes , Time Warner ’s chief executive .
Ron Grant , a former aide to Mr. Bewkes who was the No. 2 executive at AOL under Mr. Falco , was also fired Wednesday .

It ’s my favorite Democratic piece of shit , Christopher Dodd , explaining how he lied about being responsible for the language in the stimulus bill that allowed corporate bonuses to companies receiving bailout money !
Because of his insertion into the bill , AIG executives get to walk out the door with over $ 165 million in bonuses ( hoo - ray for democracy sponsored by capitalism ! )
Now of course , the real question is why .
The ‘ why ’ is actually that Christopher Dodd receives a ton of money from the financial and insurance industry , including over $ 280,000 donated to Dodd ’s political campaigns from AIG alone .
So , in total , what a nice little investment for AIG !
Stuff a little piggy full of cash and get a bigger piggy bank in return .
Do n’t you love Washington ?

You may not want or need as much insulation as I used .
It ’s very cold where I live .
It is not a thing of beauty and was build strictly to function as a place to start plants and extend our very short growing season .
It hides in our garage .
So far it has been a constant 58 degrees inside the greenhouse .
I have started only cold friendly plants .
It likely gets a bit chillier when the lights go off .
Materials :
Many times you can find some of what you need for free on freecyle.org , reyooz.com , thinggo.com or trusty craigslist.org .
A thrift store is another good place to check for some of these items .
Shelf with 5 shelves $ 50.00
8 LED grow light panels $ 240.00
Roll of sheet plastic $ 12.00
2 Power strips $ 10.00
2 Timers $ 14.00
1 Thermometer $ 2.50
Trays $ 3.00
Total : About 331.50 ( plus tax )
Time of useful life .
The only element I expect not to last for at least 10 years are the LED panels .
Things I had on hand :
old blanket
cotton cord
zip ties
staple gun
blinder clips
bubble wrap
duct tape
some lattice panel to
keep the barn cats out
Notes :
LEDWholesalers on ebay.com – 2 orders – 900 LED Grow light 4 Red + Blue Hydroponic Lamp Panels .
They have a few negative comments but for the most part they get 5 stars .
My shelf was a bargain apparently .
I ca n’t find these very cheap online .
Make sure the timers are the grounded type ( three prong . )
The power strips plug into the timers .
The LED panels go into the power strips .
Instructions :
1. Assemble shelf per directions that come with shelf .
2.Test all of your panels .
You may need to send them back and it ’s easier to do when they are not attached .
3.Attach LED panels to undersides of each shelf .
( I used cotton cord and staples because it will be easy to remove panels if they go bad . )
4.Use zip ties to attach power strips to the back braces of the shelf .
5. Set timers for the amount of “ daylight ” you want .
People differ on this .
I have mine set for 14 hours .
We will see how this goes .
6. Plug all panels into the two strips .
7.Test switches .
8. Make panels of bubble wrap to cover 3 sides of the shelf .
( I used 2 layers . )
9.Staple the bubble wrap panels from the top shelf .
10 . Use duct tape to close gaps in panels –
Do not seal the whole thing up – plants like air .
Stay away from PVC plastic .
11 . Make plastic sheets into panels that will cover three sides of the shelf
12 . Staple them also from the top of the shelf .
13 . Use duct tape to close gaps in plastic sheet panels .
14 . Create 4th panel – door .
Cut plastic the length of shelf .
Use a layer or two of bubble wrap .
Duct tape edges if you like .
15 . Staple door to top of shelf .
Use clips to keep door folded open when working with plants .
16 . Cover top with blanket for insulation in colder areas .
17. Use string to attach thermometer to easily visible spot in greenhouse .
18 . Fill with trays of seedlings .
19 . Water and wait .
Check the site for more reports on how our seedling starts are doing .
Happy digging !

Rachel Maddow last night caught up with that strange domestic terrorism case out of Maine that we reported on awhile back as part of a larger trend we 're seeing of ratcheted - up rhetoric and increasingly violent expressions coming from the American far right since Barack Obama 's election .
Maddow :
But should this guy have been found out -- I dunno , before he died ?
And , post - 9/11 , have we focused too much on stopping Bin Laden again at the expense of potentially stopping the next Timothy McVeigh ?
Good question .
And the answer is clearly yes .
The Maine incident is only the latest in a long string of cases of serious domestic terrorism emerging from the extremist Right since 9/11 .
Some of the others include :
-- The anthrax killer .
--
The far - right " Patriot " who constructed a sodium cyanide bomb capable of killing hundreds .
-- The Alabama militiamen who plotted to go on an anti-Latino killing rampage .
-- The ex-Army Ranger who planned an anti-abortion killing spree .
--
The young skinheads who wanted to kill 107 black people and cap it off with Barack Obama .
There has also been outright malfeasance on the part of the FBI when it came to investigating far - right extremists in the past eight years .
That appears to be changing -- the FBI has been public about its concerns regarding the resurgence in white - supremacist hate groups and their activities and recruitment since Obama 's election .
We 'll have to see if that translates into tackling the problem seriously .
The devastating air assault on the Gaza Strip which began on 27 December , and the ground invasion that followed , are the latest stages in the unequal war between the state of Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement , better known by the acronym Hamas .
The onslaught has so far led to the deaths of more than 600 Palestinians , many of them children , including those killed in an air strike on the UN - run al - Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp .
Since Hamas 's unexpected victory in legislative elections in January 2006 , Israel has been attempting to loosen the organisation 's grip on the Palestinian territories .
Although the elections were widely acknowledged to be free and fair , neither Israel nor any of its western allies was prepared to recognise a Palestinian Authority run by what they regard as a terrorist organisation .
A civil war broke out between Hamas and Fatah , Israel 's so - called partner for peace which runs the PA , and in June 2007 , Hamas fighters ousted their rivals from Gaza .
The Israelis responded by imposing a blockade on the coastal territory , and Fatah began attempting to excise Hamas from the West Bank .
As Edward Platt reported in the New Statesman recently ( " Israel v Hamas : the war that can never end " , 3 November 2008 ) , Hamas derives much of its support from the network of charitable institutions it runs and on which many Palestinians depend for survival .
Having outlawed Hamas 's executive and military wings , the PA and the Israeli army began to close down the schools and orphanages , claiming that they had become breeding grounds for a new generation of terrorists and a means of raising funds for terrorist activities .
Hamas called it a " declaration of war on the poor and the needy " .
It was .
In Gaza , the campaign proceeded by even blunter means .
At the end of February , Israel launched a five - day strike intended to put an end to the barrage of Qassam rocket fire that various paramilitary groups , including Hamas 's military wing , had been directing from Gaza into southern Israel .
Like the current campaign , it ended with incursions by the Israeli army , and resulted in the deaths of many non-combatants ; according to the Palestinian human rights organisation al - Mezan , 65 of the 119 Palestinians killed were civilians .
" Operation Warm Winter " did not immediately achieve its aim of ending the barrage , but a ceasefire came into effect in June and held for six months .
As usual , both sides blame the other for breaking it , though the first recorded incident of the latest stage of the war occurred on 4 November , when Israeli special forces entered the Gaza Strip and killed six militants .
On 5 November , Hamas resumed its rocket attacks and Israel increased the severity of the blockade , which it had never fully lifted , and which has turned Gaza into a kind of open prison , a place of misery and hopelessness .
Supplies of food , fuel and medicine were cut off and it was plain that a humanitarian disaster was developing .
In the circumstances , that Hamas continued to fire rockets into Sderot and other towns in south - west Israel was a grotesque and pointless provocation .
Yet it could claim , with some justification , that it was only responding to the greater Israeli aggression of the blockade , and its defiance may play well to a section of its domestic audience .
But the majority of the population that it claims to represent has suffered terribly as a result .
Public opinion in Israel demanded a response to the relentless Qassam attacks that had led to the deaths of 24 of the country 's citizens , and , predictably , it has come in time - and with George Bush still nominally in power in the US - to restore the prospects of Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak , foreign minister and defence minister in the current coalition government , who will lead Kadima and Labour in next month 's elections .
Yet it is hard to see how Israel will benefit from its instinctive reversion to force , grotesquely disproportionate in this latest war .
It is also hard not to see this invasion of Gaza , as well as the invasion of Lebanon in 2006 , as proxy wars in the larger conflict with Syria and Iran .
The campaign is unlikely to damage Hamas as much as Israel seems to hope - its military wing need only retain a rudimentary fighting capacity to claim a victory of sorts , and because of its willingness to resist the invasion , it may yet emerge from the conflict with its status enhanced .
It is hard to predict what Hamas will do next ; its pronouncements are often contradictory , yet it seems to have accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state on pre-1967 borders .
However , with prospects for a two - state solution rapidly receding , such openings should be exploited to the full , and we must hope that President - elect Obama has a broader grasp of the needs of the region than the callous and inadequate administration seeing out its last days in office .
When the fighting ends , international pressure must be brought to bear to ensure the blockade is lifted and the next truce must be monitored with greater vigilance than the last .
Yet , so long as Israel remains committed to Hamas 's destruction , and Hamas continues to strike against Israeli civilians , there will be no lasting peace .
It may be unpalatable to deal with a group that endorses suicide bombing and which is virulently anti-Semitic , but Israel , and its sponsor , the US , must acknowledge Hamas as the democratic choice of the Palestinians and seek grounds for compromise .
In the long run , negotiations will provide a more effective and infinitely more humane way of protecting Israeli citizens than attempting to batter the Gazans into submission .
Language Changes
Const and immutable fields with initializers are now warned about :
Eventually , they will be deprecated , and then will be an error .
Such fields should now be changed to enum , static or immutable .
Eventually , new behavior for them will be enabled , as follows : Fields in an aggregate which are not static will now always be addressable .
This means they occupy space in the object :
struct S { immutable int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 ] ; const int [ ] arr2 = [ 1 , 2 ] ; }
This means that code which accessed such declarations without the this reference will no longer compile .
Additionally code which depended on the size of a structure with such fields will have to be fixed :
struct S { immutable int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 ] ; } void main ( ) { auto x = S.arr ; static assert ( S.sizeof == size_t.sizeof + size_t.sizeof ) ; }
To make the field static again , simply use the static keyword .
Alternatively make the field an enum to turn it into a manifest constant :
struct S { static immutable int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 ] ; enum arr2 = [ 1 , 2 ] ; }
Note however that manifest constants which are arrays are allocated on each usage , so you may prefer using static instead .
Rationale :
Making a field implicitly static based on whether it is const / immutable and has an initializer leads to confusion .
The static keyword can be used to explicitly make any field static .
A qualified constructor is now invoked when a const / immutable / shared aggregate object is instantiated , respectively :
import std.stdio ; class C { this ( ) { writeln ( " 1 " ) ; } this ( ) const { writeln ( " 2 " ) ; } this ( ) immutable { writeln ( " 3 " ) ; } this ( ) shared { writeln ( " 4 " ) ; } } void main ( ) { auto a = new C ; auto b = new const C ; auto c = new immutable C ; auto d = new shared C ; }
This has the consequence that aggregates which have only immutable or shared constructors can no longer be used to instantiate mutable objects :
class C { this ( ) immutable { } this ( ) shared { } } void main ( ) { auto c1 = new C ; auto c2 = new immutable C ; auto c3 = new shared C ; }
On the other hand , aggregates which do not have shared or immutable constructors can no longer be used to construct shared or immutable objects , respectively :
class C { this ( ) { } } void main ( ) { auto c1 = new C ; auto c2 = new immutable C ; auto c3 = new shared C ; }
However , if an aggregate has a pure constructor it can be used to construct an object with any type constructor :
class C { this ( ) pure { } } void main ( ) { auto c1 = new C ; auto c2 = new immutable C ; auto c3 = new shared C ; }
In earlier releases some struct members such as arrays would be bitwise - compared in a comparison operation .
This has now been changed to be a structural comparison instead :
struct S { char [ ] data ; } void main ( ) { auto s1 = S ( " foo " .dup ) ; auto s2 = S( " foo " .dup ) ; assert ( s1.data ! is s 2.data ) ; assert ( s1 == s2 ) ; assert ( s1.data == s2.data ) ; }
If an opEquals function is not present the compiler rewrites the expression s1 == s2 to s1.tupleof == s2.tupleof .
Comparing .tupleof expressions is also a feature new to D in the 2.063 release .
The right - hand - side of an array copy operation now requires using the slice syntax :
void main ( ) { int [ ] [ 2 ] x ; int [ ] y ; int [ ] z ; x [ ] = z ; y [ ] = z ; }
If the user intended to write such code they must use the slice syntax for both the source and target arrays :
void main ( ) { int [ ] [ 2 ] x ; int [ ] y ; int [ ] z ; y [ ] = z[ ] ; }
Rationale :
The compiler will emit a warning to make the user aware that the copy operation is arbitrarily expensive .
A type can no longer be passed to a function as a value of that type :
T[ ] foo ( T ) ( T t ) { return null ; } void main ( ) { alias int Int ; alias typeof ( foo ( Int ) ) IntArray ; }
If the user wants to pass an argument of a certain type , they can use the .init property :
T[ ] foo ( T ) ( T t ) { return null ; } void main ( ) { alias typeof ( foo( int .init ) ) IntArray ; }
Rationale :
Treating types as expressions in special contexts only leads to confusion .
Instead , the .init property can be used for such purposes .
The index variable in a foreach range is now by default a value type :
void main ( ) { size_t count ; foreach ( n ; 0 .. 10 ) { ++n ; ++ count ; } assert ( count == 10 ) ; }
If the user wants to modify the index variable he must use the ref keyword :
void main ( ) { size_t count ; foreach ( ref n ; 0 .. 10 ) { ++n ; ++ count ; } assert ( count == 5 ) ; }
Rationale :
Making the index variable implicitly ref can introduce bugs that are hard to track down .
An associative array entry used to be default - initialized before assignment took place :
void main ( ) { int [ int ] aa ; a a [ 1 ] = a a [ 1 ] + 1 ; assert ( aa [ 1 ] == 1 ) ; }
In 2.063 , accessing an entry which does not exist will now throw a RangeError :
void main ( ) { int [ int ] aa ; a a [ 1 ] = a a [ 1 ] + 1 ; }
Rationale :
Default - initialization during assignment can be a source of bugs .
Method overrides no longer inherit constness of the base method :
class A { void foo ( ) const { } } class B : A { override void foo ( ) { } }
If the user wants to override a const method he has to mark the overriden method as const :
class A { void foo ( ) const { } } class B : A { override void foo ( ) const { } }
The feature allows introducing new overloads based on the constness of the method :
class A { void foo ( ) const { } } class B : A { void foo( ) { } alias super . foo foo ; override void foo ( ) const { } }
The following code used to be allowed :
void f( int [ ] function ( ) del ) { assert ( ! del ( ) ) ; } typeof ( null ) g( ) { return null ; } void main ( ) { f( &g ) ; f(( ) => null ) ; }
However the implicit conversion would end up generating wrong code .
To work around this , make sure the return type is typed properly , or use ( T [ ] ) . init in the return expression of a lambda expression :
void f( int [ ] function ( ) del ) { assert ( ! del ( ) ) ; } int [ ] g( ) { return null ; } void main ( ) { f( &g ) ; f(( ) => ( int [ ] ) .init ) ; }
The Template This Parameter can now be used to infer the qualifier of this to member functions :
struct S { void foo ( this T ) ( ) { } } void main ( ) { immutable S s ; s.foo ( ) ; }
Array slices are no longer l-values .
This means an address can no longer be taken of a slice , and slices cannot be passed by ref to functions :
void foo( ref int [ ] arr ) { arr = new int [ 10 ] ; } void main ( ) { int [ ] arr ; foo ( arr ) ; assert ( arr.length == 10 ) ; foo ( arr [ ] ) ; auto ptr = &arr [ 1..2 ] ; }
To work around this you can make your function take an r-value if it does n't need to reassign and resize the slice , but only needs to read or modify its contents .
Otherwise , to accept both l-values and r-values you can make your function take its argument by `auto ref` :
void take ( int [ ] arr ) { } void takeRef ( ref int [ ] arr ) { } void takeAutoRef ( T ) ( auto ref T [ ] arr ) { } void main ( ) { int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ; take ( arr ) ; takeRef ( arr ) ; takeAutoRef ( arr ) ; int [ ] arr2 = arr [ 1 .. 2 ] ; take ( arr2 ) ; takeRef ( arr2 ) ; takeAutoRef ( arr2 ) ; take ( arr [ 1 .. 2 ] ) ; take Ref ( arr [ 1 .. 2 ] ) ; takeAutoRef ( arr [ 1 .. 2 ] ) ; }
Rationale :
Passing slices by reference had no observable effect when reassigning or resizing such a slice at the call site , therefore such slices should by default be r-values .
For example , the following code used to be allowed but is now a compile - time error :
void reAssign ( ref int [ ] arr ) { arr = new int [ 2 ] ; } void reSize ( ref int [ ] arr ) { arr.length = 10 ; } void main ( ) { int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ; reAssign ( arr [ 0 .. 4 ] ) ; assert ( arr == [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ) ; re Size ( arr [ 0 .. 4 ] ) ; assert ( arr.length == 4 ) ; }
Accessing non-static fields used to be allowed in many contexts , but is now limited to only a few :
- offsetof , init , and other built - in properties are allowed :
struct S { int field ; } void main ( ) { auto a = S.field .
offsetof ; auto c = S.field.max ; auto d = S.field ; }
- When invoking static methods of a non-static field :
struct Foo { static struct Bar { static int get ( ) { return 0 ; } } Bar bar ; } void main ( ) { static assert ( Foo.bar.get ( ) == 0 ) ; }
- When accessing static fields implicitly using an alias this expression :
struct Foo { static struct Bar { static int get ( ) { return 0 ; } } Bar bar ; alias bar this ; } void main ( ) { static assert ( Foo.get ( ) == 0 ) ; }
The implicit conversion of an array to a pointer was a deprecated feature :
void foo( int * p ) { } void main ( ) { int [ ] arr = [ 1 , 2 ] ; foo ( arr ) ; }
This feature has now been completely removed .
The workaround is to either use the .ptr property , or explicitly pass the pointer to the first element :
A Scientology spokesman has confirmed that Scientologists believe that mankind 's problems stem from brainwashed alien soul remnants created millions of years ago by genocidal alien overlord Xenu .
The admission follows years of attempts to dismiss the story , first leaked by defectors , as anti-church propaganda .
In an interview with KESQ News Channel 3 , Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis was quizzed over the Xenu story , which leaked papers show is revealed to senior Scientologists as part of their induction to " Operating Thetan Level III " .
Davis at first denied the story , as he had done in the past .
However , when the KESQ reporter read from a book written by Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard which refers to the Xenu story , Davis admitted that the story is authentic , albeit confidential and restricted .
He then laid into KESQ reporter Nathan Baca , accusing him of " forwarding an agenda of hate " .
The Xenu story has previously been routinely denied by senior Scientologists , including actor Tom Cruise ( story here ) .
The Church of Scientology has long used copyright and trade secrecy laws in legal actions designed to suppress the tale .
According to anti-Scientology protest group Anonymous , a leaked recording shows Scientology founder Hubbard giving a lecture on OT III .
A handwritten document summarising the Xenu story , in Hubbard 's own handwriting , has also turned up , it adds .
A transcript of the OCIII procedure can be found on Wikileaks here and a collection of Scientology documents - which , true to form the Church tried to supress - can be found on Wikileaks here .
Scientologist doctrine suggests that exposure to the fantastical Xenu story before the completion of numerous preparatory stages might result in pneumonia or even death .
Scientologists pay an estimated $ 350,000 to reach OT III .
A core doctrine of Scientology belief is that freeing the human body of attachment to alien soul remnants , or Thetans , created by Xenu when he kidnapped millions and brought them to earth for a fiery execution , is key to achieving spiritual progress and relief from worries . ®
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- I 've been playing with one of many new systems that are hitting the market which allow the user to quickly boot the machine and go directly to a small version of Linux rather than wait to load Windows .
AsusTek AKCPF , , the Asian motherboard maker , began this trend with a boot off of a chip on the motherboard .
And , more recently , Phoenix Technologies PTEC , +0.63 % has introduced HyperSpace , a software subsystem that is similar to dual - boot ( where you can choose what operating system you want to load ) .
HyperSpace is a compact Linux that loads almost instantly and gives the user a browser , word processor and a few other useful goodies that can easily be accessed in a pinch .
I 've always liked this idea and describe its functionality as follows :
I 'm going on a trip .
I shut down everything in my office .
The car service just arrived .
I realize that I forgot some confirmation number I need .
I cannot wait forever for a computer to boot just to go on the Web to look up the number .
The instant - on feature of these new systems lets me get on and get off the computer in less than a minute .
I 'm on my way .
This is just pure convenience , and Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % has got to be taking notice , since this entire subsystem is a Trojan Horse ( like the original one , not the computer virus type ) .
What it is doing is introducing people to Linux and its desktop capabilities .
If people are using Linux like this routinely , how long will it be before they can be convinced that Linux is just as good as Windows ?
And it 's free .
With the advent of the small , inexpensive computer and the Netbooks that sell for around $ 299 , the appeal of Linux becomes greater and greater because it costs nothing .
Right now , for example , I can get a complete Intel INTC , - 0.46 % motherboard with an Atom processor , ready to install in a box , for about $ 100 .
All I need is a $ 30 memory module , an inexpensive hard disk ( $ 50 ) and a case / power supply ( $ 75 ) .
For $ 255 , I can have a pretty nice cheap machine .
Now I have to add the most basic version of Windows for $ 199 ?
And Office for another $ 399 ( standard no - frills edition ) ?
Let 's add this up :
Hot little computer : $ 255 .
Basic low - end Microsoft software : $ 598 .
What 's wrong with this picture ?
With HyperSpace , the sinister aspect to it is the built - in word processor from Korea 's Haansoft Corp .
It makes a clone of Microsoft Office , and Haansoft Write is included with Hyperspace .
This product is an out - and - out , menu - item - for - menu - item copy of Microsoft Word 2003 .
It even uses the red squiggly line for spell checking .
Looking at this product , if I were Microsoft , I 'd be totally freaked out .
This sort of thing , initiated by AsusTek , is not ending anytime soon .
The HyperSpace product is one example of many yet to come .
I 'm not sure any of these will be successful as products , but they will be successful in introducing more and more people to Linux and the Microsoft Office clones , many of which cost a fraction of the Microsoft products and , in most cases , are free for the asking .
Microsoft has pretty much done all it can do to make Microsoft Office a dead - end product with few improvements on the roadmap .
This means it is ripe for copying .
The number of Office Suites is increasing daily .
A list is maintained here .
Until now , the average computer user has been ignoring this trend .
But the economic conditions and the emergence of powerful inexpensive computing has to make people rethink the Microsoft proposition .
If Intel can provide users with powerful little systems for $ 99 and has been pushing prices lower and lower over the years , why ca n't Microsoft ?
Intel makes elaborate hardware in billion - dollar factories .
Microsoft stamps out a disk .
This discrepancy has to end soon .
Millions of dollars in US aid to Madagascar could be affected The US has halted all non-humanitarian aid to Madagascar after the army forced out the elected president and installed the opposition leader in his place .
Washington said it had to act , saying Tuesday 's takeover was a " coup " .
The EU also condemned the power grab , while the African Union suspended Madagascar 's membership in the group .
Opposition leader Andry Rajoelina is due to be inaugurated as Madagascar 's transitional head on Saturday after the ousting of President Marc Ravalomanana .
" This series of events is tantamount to a coup d'etat , and the United States will not maintain our current assistance partnership with Madagascar , " US State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on Friday .
The people demanded liberty and the military rallied to the popular movement , but it did not seize power
Roindefo Monja
Transitional prime minister
Conservationists seek happy ending for Madagascar " In view of these developments , the United States is moving to suspend all non-humanitarian assistance to Madagascar . "
Mr Wood did not provide any figures , but it is believed that millions of dollars in aid to the Indian Ocean island will be affected .
Madagascar participates in several US programmes with a number of different aid agencies .
One of those agencies , the Millennium Challenge Corporation , said it was halting a poverty reduction grant to Madagascar , which totalled $ 110 m ( £ 76 m ) over five years .
The US , the EU and AU have all urged Madagascar to restore democratic government .
Meanwhile , the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) has threatened sanctions against Madagascar .
Defiance
The aid suspension by Washington came just hours before the expected inauguration of Mr Rajoelina , a former disc- jockey , in the capital Antananarivo .
The army handed power to Andry Rajoelina Madagascar 's Constitutional Court earlier approved the handover of power .
The former Antananarivo mayor says he now wants to change the constitution , which at presents bars him from contesting presidential elections , as at 34 he is six years too young .
The BBC's Christina Corbett in Antananarivo says he is trying to give himself legitimacy ahead of his inauguration .
Amid growing international pressure , Madagascar 's acting prime minister said the new authorities " will explain to the whole world our cause " .
" The people demanded liberty and the military rallied to the popular movement , but it did not seize power ...
We are confident the international community will understand , " Roindefo Monja told Reuters news agency .
There is still no word on the whereabouts of Mr Ravalomanana , whose re-election to a second term in 2006 could not save him from being ousted .
At least 100 people died in Madagascar during several months of violent protests and looting , triggered by the power struggle between Mr Ravalomanana and Mr Rajoelina .

This is an interesting case :
At issue in this case is whether forcing Boucher to type in that PGP passphrase –which would be shielded from and remain unknown to the government–is “ testimonial , ” meaning that it triggers Fifth Amendment protections .
The counterargument is that since defendants can be compelled to turn over a key to a safe filled with incriminating documents , or provide fingerprints , blood samples , or voice recordings , unlocking a partially - encrypted hard drive is no different .
Windows 7 will be released to manufacturing in 2009 , more precisely in the third quarter of this year , with information from a leaked product roadmap pointing to the first half of October 2009 .
The past week , Steven Sinofsky , senior vice president , Windows and Windows Live Engineering Group , revealed the official product roadmap for Windows 7 beyond the public Beta Build 7000 .
Sinofsky indicated that the next development milestone for Windows Vista 's successor would be Release Candidate ( RC ) , followed by RTM ( the gold version of the operating system ) and then by the platform 's GA ( general availability ) .
Lotta Bath , from the Microsoft Sweden Partner team , simply added deadlines to the upcoming Windows 7 releases , mapping a variety of events that would lead to the launch of Windows 7 ( via Neowin ) .
Bath simply attempted to answer questions that Microsoft partners had related to the point of reference that would precede the launch of the company 's next iteration of the Windows client and server platforms .
In this context , Bath claimed that the Win 7 product roadmap dates had been confirmed by Michael Bohlin ( Windows product manager ) .
Microsoft would make available the Release Candidate of Windows 7 in April 2009 , making its way to RTM in October .
In the meantime , Microsoft Sweden will also deal with the Microsoft Windows 7 Summit on February 26 via TechNet and TrueSec .
Bath 's next reference points out that Microsoft itself could finish deploying Windows 7 pre-release versions internally by the end of May 31 , 2009 , remaining loyal to its dogfooding tradition .
Windows 7 Release Candidate ( RC ) is scheduled to drop in early April 2009 after the CeBit conference .
Throughout June , July and August , Microsoft Sweden will be involved in demoing Windows 7 .
Subsequently , Bath indicates Q3 2009 for the RTM launch of Windows 7 , offering October 3 at 11.10 as the deadline for the gold milestone .
Bath obviously addresses Microsoft partners with the release dates , and in this context , as relevant as they might be , fact is that general users can see different deadlines for Windows 7 altogether .
Microsoft is , just as was the case with Windows Vista , preparing two separate launch events for Windows 7 , one focused on businesses and the other on general consumers .
In this regard , Windows 7 gold could very easily be made available to corporate customers through Software Assurance ( volume licensing ) by the end of 2009 .
However , an October 2009 RTM does leave enough elbow room for Microsoft to introduce the general availability of Windows 7 in time for the holiday season , namely in December .
Still , Bath does mention “ Februari 2010 i kartong i handeln ” which could point to the availability of the boxed versions of Windows 7 as late as next year , and indeed three years after Vista ' GA .

Beta is available for download here .

Wikipedia allows readers to edit the content of its pages A decision by a number of UK internet providers to block a Wikipedia page showing an image of a naked girl has angered users of the popular site .
The blocked page of the online encyclopaedia shows an album cover of German heavy metal band Scorpions , released in 1976 .
Internet providers acted after online watchdog the Internet Watch Foundation warned them its picture may be illegal .
The IWF said it was a " potentially illegal child sexual abuse image " .
Some volunteers who run Wikipedia said it was not for the foundation to censor one of the web 's most popular sites .
They also argued that the image was available in a number of books and had never been ruled illegal .
But the IWF , which warns internet providers about possible images that could be linked to child abuse , said it had consulted the police before making its decision .
The foundation 's list of proscribed sites is widely used by British internet service providers to filter out images showing child abuse and other illegal content .
It 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site
David Gerard , Wikipedia volunteer
As a result , the addition of the Scorpions Wikipedia page has made it inaccessible to the majority of British internet users .
The IWF , which lists the BBC , News International and internet companies AOL ( UK ) and Ask among its members , said as many as 95 % of British users would now be unable to access the page .
Wikipedia volunteer David Gerard said he and fellow users were angry that as well as the photo , the text on the page had been blocked .
" Blocking text is a whole new thing - it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site , " he said .
Mr Gerard also told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme the album cover was still available as part of the band 's box set and could be viewed on retail websites .
" When we asked the Internet Watch Foundation why they blocked Wikipedia and not Amazon , apparently the decision was ' pragmatic ' , which we think means that Amazon had money and would sue them , whereas we 're an educational charity . "
Access blocked Susan Robertson , of the IWF , said the image could potentially contravene the Protection of Children Act 1978 .
" We only act on the reports we receive , and as I understand it , the only report we received regarding this content , as of Friday , was the content on Wikipedia , " she said .
A fascinating case which sheds light on the debate about freedom of speech on the internet
Rory Cellan- Jones
Read more at the dot. life blog Ms Robertson also said the IWF needed to " take a view " on the images available on Amazon with its " analyst team and police partners " .
Jay Walsh , a spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation , which manages the encyclopaedia , said the removal of the page also appeared to have stopped thousands of UK users from editing articles on Wikipedia , which allows readers to self - edit its pages .
" It appears that there 's a large number of editors - I can't say all - who appear to have access issues , " he said .
The IWF spokeswoman said a reader had brought the image to the foundation 's attention last week and it had contacted the police before adding the page to their list .
Wikipedia is one of the world 's most popular websites .
It is a multi-lingual online database written , edited and funded largely by its users .
It has 2.6 m articles in English alone .

Long before they see the " game over " screen , Xbox , Wii and PlayStation fans have already taken a big blow – to their wallets .
The average price of console games makes them seem an exorbitant luxury in these recession - hit times , although the industry that creates these technological marvels tends to disagree .
It turns out that the £ 50 you could splash out for a new PS3 or Xbox 360 game does n't go very far when you factor in all the costs of getting the disc into your hands .
The budget required today to develop a blockbuster release can dwarf even the film industry 's best .
The Oscar magnet Slumdog Millionaire cost $ 14 m to make .
Last year 's critical darling of the video games world , Grand Theft Auto IV ?
That cost more than $ 100 m .
Even lower - cost games on Nintendo consoles Wii ( £ 35 - £ 40 ) and DS ( £ 25 - £ 30 ) often demand budgets that would make the average movie mogul raise an eyebrow .
Michael French , the editor - in - chief of Develop , the industry magazine , says : " Each console generation has demanded a bigger development cost – these guys live to take advantage of what 's under the hood of the latest thing .
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in particular have driven the need for bigger teams of artists , animators , programmers , actors and more .
The average development cost for today 's games is around £ 7 m , double what was spent a decade ago .
I expect GTA IV 's budget will be eclipsed . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The lion 's share of the £ 50 you hand over is taken by the retailer selling the game , and the publisher that distributes it , markets it and usually bankrolls its creation .
Just as development budgets have skyrocketed , so have promotion costs .
For the biggest titles , publishers regularly spend in excess of £ 2 m on marketing .
" The publisher actually ends up with a fairly small share of a game 's recommended retail price , " says Peter Stone , general manager of Konami UK , the label responsible for the epic Metal Gear Solid 4 , rumoured to have cost $ 50 m .
" We pay the marketing , manufacturing and development costs .
Large portions are also eaten into by retailer margins and VAT , so publishers only take what is necessary to cover overheads and – in the event of a hit – turn a profit . "
So are you feeling sorry for these giant publishers yet ?
Did n't think so .
But it 's impossible to ignore the huge financial risk they undertake when launching their biggest titles .
The world is playing more games than ever – the market researcher Media Control GfK puts global games sales at $ 32bn last year , topping DVD revenues for the first time .
Yet the big names of the industry are running into financial trouble , largely for failing to produce the geese that lay the golden eggs demanded by shareholders .
Electronic
Arts – best known for the football game FIFA and The Sims – lost $ 641 m in the final quarter of 2008 , despite putting a string of highly rated games into play .
Midway Inc , owner of the Mortal Kombat series , was this year sold by owner Sumner Redstone for a paltry fee and delisted from the New York Stock Exchange .
Long before million - dollar development budgets existed , entertainment software retailed at slightly lower prices , even if the difference was n't as much as rose - tinted gamers of yesteryear may remember .
Back in 1993 , a new - release game for either of the two market - leading consoles , the Sega MegaDrive and Super Nintendo ( SNES ) , sold for £ 35 to £ 45 .
Nick Gibson , director of industry financial experts gamesinvestor.com , explains that the cost of creating a Golden Axe or Street Fighter II was much less than it would be for today 's big hitters , but the manufacturing cost of making the cartridges ( the format of the day ) brought its own perils .
" On a pure price - for - price comparison basis , one could argue that gamers today get a fair deal , " he says , " as £ 34.99 in 1993 translates to just under £ 49.99 today when inflation is taken into consideration .
However , the problem with comparing them is that 1993 games were lower - cost to develop but much more expensive to manufacture – up to £ 25 per title . "
According to industry insiders , today 's big high - street retailers take about one - fifth of your £ 50 , which helps to fund distribution and their biggest cost , rent .
The platform holder – Microsoft , Sony , Nintendo – takes a hefty slice for its investment in developing , marketing and selling consoles .
Sony , typically spends well over £ 1bn designing a new console – and then sells it at a £ 100 loss per unit .
It 's not all bad news for gamers , though .
Due to less preclusive retail laws than our European neighbours and a fiery price war between specialist chains , supermarkets and online stores , it really pays to shop around .
A new copy of Sony 's epic " make it yourself " platformer LittleBIGPlanet can now be picked up for about £ 15 , just three months after its release .
The second - hand market is also burgeoning , with trade - ins offered by Game , HMV and independent retailers .
These can save consumers £ 10 or more on that month 's biggest title .
Terry Scicluna , chief operating officer of Game , says : " The UK market is incredibly competitive .
Consumers get great value , and that 's before you take into account special offers and weekly deals .
We work hard to offer the best possible prices on new and trade - in games . "
But , even with these perks , is buying a new game actually worth it ?
When we can pick up a DVD player for the same price , is £ 50 too much ?
Again , the industry does n't think so .
" Measured on a per- hour basis against the cinema , for instance , games offer wonderful value , " says Rod Cousens , chief executive of the UK publisher Codemasters .
" It 's a market that has seen prices essentially capped while development costs , marketing costs , manufacturing risk and cash outflow periods have all risen . "
Wonderful value ?
It might not seem so next time you hand over your credit card for a must - have game .
But in terms of pleasure and fun , it 's hard to deny that the games market is starting to leave other forms of entertainment sobbing in its wake .

Love Twitter , do you ?
Think it 's all the rage ?
Well , let me tell you a story about Twitter that will SHOCK AND ALARM YOU .

For the past month or so , your editor at large took it upon himself ( with the help of trusted companion Gourmet Spud ) to create the " Rick Rielly " Twitter feed .
Our goal : to test the outermost limits of obvious punnage , dental humor , old lame catchphrases , and stories about snowshoe racing champions who have no legs .
Some might say this was a mean - spirited attempt to rip on Rick Reilly and shed light on his obvious shortcomings .
Well , it was .
BUT DAMMIT , THAT WAS WHAT MADE IT FUN .
So imagine my dismay when I found this message waiting for me from Twitter today :
This account is currently suspended and is being investigated due to strange activity .
If we have suspended your account mistakenly , please let us know .
See Suspended Accounts for more information .

That 's right .
You may think Twitter is just a fun little lark .
But what you do n't know is that THEY CAN SNEAK IN AND STEAL YOUR PRECIOUS ACCOUNT FROM YOU WITHOUT EXPLANATION IN AN ACT OF EXTRAORDINARY WEB RENDITION .
Why was the account suspended ?
Well , apparently because impersonating people violates Twitter 's terms of service ( like I read that fucking thing ) .
Okay , fine .
I could see that being not kosher with the folks there .
EXCEPT THAT WE PURPOSELY SPELLED RICK REILLY'S FUCKING NAME WRONG ON THE ACCOUNT AND ANYONE WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS ACTUALLY RICK REILLY WAS A FUCKING MORON , LIKE THIS ASSHOLE :
KardiacKeith@RickRielly
Why do you worry so often about other people ?
Bill Simmons has a much better outlook on pop culture than you do .
True Story .
Clearly , either Reilly , or someone at ESPN , or some Rick Reilly fanboy finally put two and two together and alerted Twitter to the naughtiness of our little project .
But let me tell you something , Twitter .
You may have shut us down , but you can't stop kickass phony Twitter feeds from springing up .
And you know why ?
BECAUSE A PHONY TWITTER FEED IS FIFTY TIMES MORE INTERESTING THAN SOME RANDOM FUCKFACE'S " LEGITIMATE " ACCOUNT .
BECAUSE ACTUAL TWITTERING IS GAY .

Consider this the beginning of the end of your little fad , Twitter .
You fucked with the wrong man .
I 'm gonna start a new site that allows users to post updates that are 150 characters long .
That 's right .
TEN MORE CHARACTERS .
And you know what will happen then ?
YOU WILL BE FUCKED .
FUCKED IN THE ASS .
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO TWEET TO ALL YOUR RETARD FRIENDS , " HELP , I'M BEING FUCKED IN THE ASS ! "
Because let 's face it :
Tweeting is nothing more than blogging for children , the elderly , the mentally retarded , and Ashton Kutcher .
Someone 's gonna find a way to do what you do better .
They might even have the foresight to allow obvious satire .
AND THEN YOUR QUIRKY LITTLE UPSTART WON'T BE WORTH JACK SHIT , YOU FUCKS .

And Reilly , if I find out it was YOU behind this , I will be rougher on you than Russian toilet paper .
Say , did n't you use that Russian toilet paper gag in your last column ?
Why yes , you sure did .
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING OVERPAID HACK .
Until then , here are some of Spud 's and my favorite bogus Rielly Tweets .

But the proposed contribution rates are so low and means - testing is now so widespread that many millions of employees would still be better off on benefits .
So they 'll opt out , condemning Turner 's scheme to the policy scrap heap .
Guest post by Steve Goddard
Yesterday , Dr. Walt Meier from NSIDC again graciously updated us about the NSIDC sensor problem , and also about his current thinking with respect to polar ice trends .
The key concepts being that Arctic ice continues to decline , and that Arctic and Antarctic ice are separate entities – so the current near normal global sea ice area “ has no meaning in terms of climate change . ”
This article examines both of those concepts .
NSIDC is still having sensor problems on their satellite , as seen below on 2/28/09 .
Note the speckled white areas , and the large dark gray sliver in the Sea of Okhotsk near the top .
http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_daily_extent_hires.png
Fortunately there is another ice extent data source , AMSR - E which has not suffered sensor problems and their data is unaffected .
NSIDC also explains on their web site that “ AMSR - E has a lower absolute error ” than the NSIDC sensors , even when functioning properly .
AMSR -E ( below ) has been recording sea ice since 2002 .
The maximum ice extent for 2009 ( red ) and 2008 ( orange ) are both in the top three on the AMSR - E record , at more than 14 M km2 .
The only year which had greater ice extent than the last two years was 2003 .
So clearly we are on a recent trend of higher Arctic ice maximums , which is a fact that is rarely if ever reported by the main stream media .
Also note in the NSIDC map above , all of the ice basins are close to the 1979 - 2000 normal .
If there is a dramatic downwards trend in maximum Arctic extent , it certainly is n’t visible in either the map or the graph .
http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/seaice/extent/AMSRE_Sea_Ice_Extent.png
The NSIDC graph below also shows Arctic ice extent nearly back to the 1979 - 2000 mean .
http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_timeseries.png
Turning our attention to Antarctica .
Dr , Hansen predicted in 1980 that ice loss in Antarctica would be symmetrical to the Arctic .
But the current thinking , as expressed by Dr. Meier , indicates that view is no longer valid .
In fact , NSIDC data shows that Antarctic ice extent has actually increased substantially , as seen below .
http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/effects/downloads/Challenge_chapter2.pdf
It was reported last week that the IPY ( International Polar Year ) released a study claiming that both polar ice caps are melting “ faster than expected . ”
Given that NSIDC shows Antarctica gaining ice at a rapid pace , I find myself surprised that IPY would release a study saying exactly the opposite .
But then again , an IPY official reportedly forecast that last summer ( 2008 ) might have an “ ice free Arctic . ”
Columnist George
Will reported that overall global sea ice area is normal , and was correct .
Dr. Meier confirmed that on January 1 global sea ice levels were normal .
Walt Meier ( 16:04:59 )
1. He ( George Will ) was factually incorrect on the date that he reported his “ daily global ice ” number .
However , he was merely out - of - date with his facts ( it was true on Jan 1 , but was n’t 6 weeks later ) .
The UIUC graph shows global ice levels well within one standard deviation of the 1979 - 2000 mean .
Dr. Hansen was correct that according to global warming theory , both poles should be losing ice – though we know now it theoretically should be happening more slowly in the Antarctic .
Yet 20 years later we actually see the Antarctic gaining ice , which is contrary to Dr. Hansen ’s theory , contrary to IPY claims , and probably contrary to Steig ’s questionable temperature analysis .
The main trend I see in polar ice is an increasing disconnect between hype and reality .
Given that the AO ( Arctic Oscillation ) has been neutral this winter and polar drift has been less than last year , I forecast that the summer Arctic ice minimum in 2009 will show more ice than either of the last two years .

MOSCOW - A woman from Russia 's Siberian region of Irkutsk has been arrested for killing a friend of hers then eating part of the corpse , Interfax news agency reports , quoting local investigators .

" Investigators have information to suggest the woman cooked pieces of her murdered friend and ate them , " said an official with the Russian prosecutor 's investigative committee , Vladimir Salovarov .
The Palestinian death toll in the Gaza conflict climbed to more than 1,000 today after nearly three weeks of intensive Israeli bombing and fighting on the ground .
So far , 1,010 Palestinians have been killed , among them 315 children and 95 women , Dr Moawiya Hassanein , the head of Gaza 's medical emergency services , told the Guardian .
The number of injured after 19 days of fighting stood at 4,700 , he said .
As Israeli troops fought on the outskirts of Gaza City after another night of heavy bombing and shelling , diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensified , with the secretary - general of the UN , Ban Ki-moon , in Cairo for urgent talks .
He is calling for an immediate ceasefire .
With the death toll rising , Bolivia 's president , Evo Morales , said his country had cut diplomatic relations with Israel .
He called for Israeli leaders to face charges at the international criminal court .
The head of the international committee of the Red Cross described the situation in Gaza as " shocking " after visiting a hospital in the territory .
" I saw this dramatic humanitarian situation .
There 's an increasing number of women and children being wounded and going to hospitals , " Jakob Kellenberger said later in Jerusalem , the AFP news agency reported .
" It is shocking .
It hurts when you see these wounded people and the types of wounds they have .
And I think that the number of people coming to these hospitals is increasing , " he said .
Kellenberger , who called on both sides to stop targeting civilians , demanded better access for medical teams within Gaza , saying the daily three - hour pause in Israeli operations was not sufficient .
Ban described the toll on civilians in the conflict as " intolerable " .
He called for " an immediate end to violence in Gaza , and then to the Israeli military offensive and a halt to rocket attacks by Hamas " .
His demand followed a meeting with the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak .
The UN chief is also scheduled to travel to Jordan , Israel , the West Bank , Turkey , Lebanon , Syria and Kuwait , although not Gaza itself .
As well as the Palestinian death toll , 13 Israelis have been killed , including three civilians .
At least 35,000 Palestinians are holed up in UN schools operating as emergency shelters .
Tens of thousands more are staying with relatives or friends .
About two - thirds of the territory 's 1.5 million people have no electricity ; the rest have only an intermittent supply , according to the UN .
There was more heavy fighting in northern Gaza today and around the edges of Gaza City , from where Israeli troops have mounted raids to within a mile of the city centre .
Early today , the old Gaza city hall , a former court building , was destroyed in an air strike which damaged many shops in the nearby market .
Israel 's military said it had hit 60 sites overnight , including the police headquarters in Gaza City that had been hit on the first day of the operation , as well as rocket launching sites , weapons stores and 35 smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt .
Six Israeli soldiers were injured .
Three rockets fired from Lebanon landed in northern Israel in the second such attack since Israeli forces launched their Gaza offensive .
Police said the rockets landed in open areas and there were no reports of damage or injuries .
People in northern Israel were advised to head to bomb shelters .
Reports from Lebanon said five rockets were fired but that two fell short .
Israel 's military responded with artillery fire towards the firing sites .
Four rockets were fired on northern Israel last Thursday .
Hezbollah denied responsibility and speculation focused on small Palestinian groups in Lebanon .
Rifts among Israel 's leaders over the conflict are appearing to deepen .
The defence minister , Ehud Barak , is pressing for a one - week halt to the fighting to allow in humanitarian aid , according to a report today in the Ha'aretz newspaper .
Barak believes the 19 - day offensive has bolstered Israel 's deterrent power and believes continuing the fight would bring " only operational complications and casualties " , the paper said .
" Barak is proposing the IDF [ Israel Defence Forces ] cease its fire , hold its positions and keep the reservists under arms , and thus negotiate with Egypt and the United States on an arrangement that would prevent arms smuggling into the strip , " it said .
Barak fears that when Barack Obama assumes the US presidency on Tuesday he will demand an immediate Israeli ceasefire .
Another risk was a tougher UN security council resolution – a resolution last week calling for a ceasefire was ignored as " unworkable " by Israel .
My shortlist of people who have done most for the denialist cause - in playing card form
With the Heartland Institute 's annual jamboree for climate deniers in full swing in New York here 's my shortlist of people who have done most for the denialist cause - in playing card form .

Sammy Wilson 's appointment as Northern Ireland environment minister appears to have been conceived as some sort of practical joke .
It 's no longer very funny .
He fills the same role as the former South African health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , who claimed that Aids could be treated with beetroot and lemon juice .
Wilson maintains that environmentalism is a " hysterical pseudo - religion " .
Climate change is natural and " beyond our control " , so " resources should be used to adapt to the consequences of climate change rather than King Canute style vainly trying to stop it . "
But the minister for hysterical pseudo - religion intends to cling onto his brief come hell or high water .

Klaus is the rightwing president of the Czech Republic , criticised by
Vaclav Havel as a promoter of " gangster capitalism " .
He describes
himself as " the most important ' denier ' in the world " , though Viscount
Monckton ( see below ) might take issue with this .
He told the US Congress that " manmade climate change has become one of the most dangerous arguments aimed at distorting human efforts and public policies in the whole world … Communism was replaced by the threat of ambitious environmentalism . "
Climate change , he says , is caused " not by human behaviour but by various exogenous and endogenous natural processes ( such as fluctuating solar activity ) " .
He describes concern about climate change as a " new wave of dangerous indoctrination of the whole world " and says that " global - warming alarmism is challenging our freedom , and Al Gore is a leader of that movement . "

Steve Milloy writes a weekly " Junk Science " column for Fox News , which he uses , among other topics , to pour scorn on studies documenting the medical effects of secondhand tobacco smoke and showing that climate change is taking place .
Fox describes his credentials thus : " Steven Milloy publishes JunkScience.com and manages the Free Enterprise Action Fund .
He is a junk science expert , and an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute " .
What it does n't say is that he has long acted as a paid advocate for the tobacco company Philip Morris , while the fake grassroots group he runs has also received funding from ExxonMobil .
His website has been the main entrepôt for almost every kind of climate change denial that has found its way into the mainstream press .
Milloy claims to be campaigning against " faulty scientific data and analysis used to advance special and , often , hidden agendas " , which seems to be a pretty good summary of his own activities .

Michaels played a starring role in Channel 4's
The Great Global Warming Swindle and is regularly used by the US media , largely because he is one of the very few deniers who has any relevant scientific credentials .
He maintains that : " When it comes to global warming , apparently the truth is inconvenient .
And it 's not just Gore 's movie that 's fiction .
It 's the rhetoric of the Congress and the chief executive , too . "
Something he is less keen to reveal is that , as a leaked memo from an electricity company shows , he has recently been paid at least $ 100,000 by companies involved in coal - fired power production to make the public case against climate change .
In 2007 Michaels withdrew as an expert witness from a court case about climate change , after it became clear that his other sources of funding could be revealed to the public .

Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , whose academic qualification is a classics degree , maintains that " politicians , scientists and bureaucrats contrived a threat of Biblical floods , droughts , plagues , and extinctions worthier of St John the Divine than of science . "
He came to public notice with a long paper published on the website of the Sunday Telegraph , accusing the UN of scientific fraud .
His paper was filled with sciencey equations and calculations , which were rapidly dismissed as bunkum by real scientists .
He has threatened several of those who have challenged his scientific claims with libel suits , but they have not yet materialised .
Though he has never held a seat in the Lords , he maintained in a threatening letter to two US senators that he was " a member of the Upper House of the United Kingdom legislature " .
He has also claimed that , among other unlikely feats , he was responsible for winning the Falklands war .
His grand statements about climate science and his own credentials have earned him the nickname among some environmentalists of Viscount Monckhausen .

An Alaskan denying climate change is like a Saudi Arabian denying sand .
But can she do it ?
You betcha .
The eagle - eyed governor can – or so the satirists claim - see Russia from her house , but apparently not the melting permafrost , shrinking glaciers and disappearing sea ice closer to home .
During her vice - presidential campaign , she embarrassed John McCain by maintaining : " I 'm not one though who would attribute it [ climate change ] to being manmade . "
She has refused to classify the polar bear as an endangered species on the grounds that the sea ice is here to stay , but is making plans for opening up the Arctic Sea to oil drilling , on the grounds that the ice is due to disappear .
Could her ambivalence towards climate change have anything to do with the fact that Alaska is a major oil state ?
You betcha .

Inhofe is the senior Senator for Oklahoma .
He leads the Republican party 's Neanderthal tendency and receives more campaign money from fossil fuel companies than from any other sector .
In 2003 he delivered a speech to the Senate called The Science of Climate Change , in which he said : " The claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science …
With all of the hysteria , all of the fear , all of the phony science , could it be that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people ?
It sure sounds like it . "
Seeking to characterise environmentalists , he says : " I could use the Third Reich , the Big Lie ...
You say something over and over and over and over again , and people will believe it , and that 's their strategy . "
He has also compared the US Environmental Protection Agency to the Gestapo .
Terrifyingly , until 2006 Inhofe chaired the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works .

Mel P ( Genuinely Scary Spice ) appears to believe that half the scientists on earth are engaged in a series of giant conspiracies .
Like Christopher Booker ( below ) , she dismisses not only climate change but also the entire canon of evolutionary science .
She also stoutly defends the thesis that MMR injections cause autism .
She claims that " the theory that global warming is all the fault of mankind is a massive scam based on flawed computer modelling , bad science and an anti-western ideology …
The majority of well - meaning opinion in the Western world believes a pack of lies and propaganda " .
She has also maintained that " carbon dioxide forms a relatively small proportion of the atmosphere , most of which consists of water vapour . "
If this were the case , we would need gills .

Booker writes a column in the Sunday Telegraph .
It 's filled with so many misleading claims about climate change , evolution , asbestos , speed cameras and the European Union that it would take an encyclopedia to document them .
His most famous contention was made in a column in February 2008 .
The previous September , he noted , " sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded .
But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings , reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . …
Its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area , which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 m sq km to just 4 m from the start of 2007 to October , also shows it now almost back to 13 m sq km . "
To reinforce this point , he helpfully republished the graph , showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January .
The Sunday Telegraph continues to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter .
The prestigious and highly sought Christopher Booker prize for climate change denial was named in his honour .
Ace of spades
David Bellamy
TV presenter

Because he was once an environmentalist and a famous broadcaster , David Bellamy is used as the mascot of climate change deniers all over the world .
Like most mascots he is cute , furry and apparently incapable of rational thought .
He has claimed that global warming is " poppycock " , that " the global warmers are telling lies – carbon dioxide is not the driver " and that " 555 of all the 625 glaciers under observation by the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Zurich , Switzerland , have been growing since 1980 " ( the WGMS responded that this was " complete bullshit " ) .
He maintains that " since I said I did n't believe human beings caused global warming I 've not been allowed to make a TV programme . "
This is odd because he stopped making TV programmes in 1994 .
He was making public statements in support of mainstream climate science until at least 2000 , and his first public statement to the contrary was in 2004 .
But the conspiracy extends even further .
" Have you noticed there is a wind turbine on Teletubbies ? " , he asked in the Daily Express .
" That 's subliminal advertising , is n't it ? "
On his very full plate , immigration was one issue that President Obama had yet to take on - until yesterday , when he discussed it with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus .
At a town hall meeting in southern California yesterday , Obama renewed his support for comprehensive reform , including a possible path to citizenship for law - abiding people who entered the country illegally , along the lines of the bill that stalled in Congress in 2007 .
According to the White House account of yesterday 's one - hour closed session , it was " a robust and strategic meeting " in which Obama announced he will go to Mexico next month to meet President Calderón and discuss , among other issues , effective , comprehensive immigration reform .
After the meeting , Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois , chairman of the Hispanic caucus 's immigration task force , and advocacy groups said they were hopeful that Obama would address immigration reform this year .
" Although it is very early in his administration , he understands that for the immigrant community it 's the 11th hour , and there is no time to waste , " Gutierrez said in a statement .
Janet Murguía , president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza , added , " While we agree that our priority should be fixing the nation 's economy , we also believe that we can initiate an immigration reform that will help us achieve long - term economic growth . "

White House scraps plan to bill veterans ' insurers
The White House announced late yesterday that it has dropped a proposal - strongly objected to by veterans groups - to bill veterans ' private insurance for treatment of service - related injuries and disabilities .
The proposal was designed to generate more than $ 540 million a year for the Department of Veterans Affairs , but opponents said it broke faith with service members who risked their lives and argued that it threatened to use up insurance benefits that their families also use .
The groups ' leaders had angrily criticized the administration after meeting with Obama and top aides Monday .
The White House said that the president , after hearing concerns that the proposal " might , under certain circumstances , affect veterans and their families ' ability to access healthcare , " has " instructed that its consideration be dropped . "

Senate confirms
Kirk as trade representative
WASHINGTON - Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk won Senate confirmation yesterday to be the nation 's top trade official with responsibilities for advancing free trade at a time when many Americans see foreign competition as a threat to their livelihoods .
The Senate voted , 92 - 5 , to confirm Kirk as US trade representative , setting aside a tax problem revealed after he was nominated and concerns raised by some Republicans that the Obama administration was putting the country on a path to protectionism .
Kirk , at his confirmation hearing , said he would try to help American workers hit by the negative aspects of trade and would put more effort into ensuring that trade partners are n't violating existing agreements on open trade .
That would signal a shift from the Bush administration , which championed the benefits of free trade .

Biden unveils meals plan as part of stimulus effort
Vice President Biden announced yesterday that states will receive $ 100 million in stimulus money to feed low - income older Americans .
The funding is expected to provide nearly 14 million meals nationwide , the White House said .
The stimulus package provides $ 65 million for meals at senior centers and other community sites , $ 32 million for home delivered meals , and $ 3 million for Native American nutrition programs .
The offices of Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry of Massachusetts said that the Bay State will get $ 2.1 million , $ 1.4 million for nutrition programs at senior centers and $ 700,000 for home - delivered nutrition programs .
" Communities and aging services across the state are facing a surge in the need for these services because of the economic crisis , " Kennedy said .

Local environmentalist nominated for EPA post
President Obama yesterday nominated a New England environmentalist to be a top regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency .
He announced his selection of Cynthia J. Giles as assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance at the EPA .

For the sake of all the people who have either lost their jobs , seen their mortgages turned upside - down , or at least been plunged into anxiety , one certainly hopes that the $ 790 billion " stimulus " package , the most expensive piece of legislation ever passed , will do whatever it is supposed to do to the economy .
Unfortunately it is not likely to do so , both because it is based on shaky economic theory [ . pdf ] and because neither it nor much of the discussion concerning our economic doldrums has taken into account the contribution that " defense " spending has played in bringing about this recession .
But it is still possible to learn a few things and to begin some reforms and even paradigm shifts that , though they might not end this recession [ . pdf ] next week or even next year , could make it less likely that we will make similar mistakes in the future .
A good deal has been written , by me and many others , of the factors that led to the current economic debacle .
While greed and inscrutable securities played their roles , a loose - money policy at the Fed and government mandates to make mortgages available to people of dubious creditworthiness , especially when housing prices began to fall and using the increasing paper value of one ’s house as an ATM was no longer an option , all played their roles .
It is difficult to untangle all the contributors to this perfect storm of an economic downturn , but one factor that has n’t received enough attention , in my view was the costs of the unnecessary wars undertaken by the Bush administration .
The Iraq war has cost around $ 600 billion so far , and the costs will continue to accrue .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total cost will be around $ 2 trillion , while Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes calculate that it will be more like $ 3 trillion .
As Doug Bandow put it last October , as the financial crisis had begun to become apparent in its full horror , " Getting out now would cut the expense , but many of the costs are impossible to escape , such as the expense of caring for America ’s grievously wounded , which will stay with us throughout their lifetimes . "
Those wounded warriors will give rise to other costs that cannot be put into dollars , especially in the communities where they live .
Beyond the costs to young people rendered " differently abled " to various degrees and therefore facing greater hurdles in the way of achieving their aspirations , entire families and communities will be sadly aware of the human costs of war .
It is impossible to predict just what effect this will have on the willingness of young people in the near future to put themselves in the service of the empire .
Young people notoriously believe they are immortal and bad things can’t happen to them .
It seems more than possible , however , that military morale , difficult as it is to measure in mere dollars , will suffer in ways that show up , for example , in recruitment  although one short - term impact of the recession seems to have been an increase in recruits  and suicides .
If loose credit and near - heedless increases in spending ( the Bushies increased discretionary domestic spending faster than any administration since LBJ and maybe FDR ) contributed to the economic downturn , it is difficult to see how an even greater increase in spending and more government pressure to loosen standards and get credit flowing again will be a sovereign cure .
If the spending does have a stimulating effect , it is likely to be brief and followed by inflationary pressures .
China , which has been essentially subsidizing Bush ’s spending spree by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities , is facing its own internal troubles and is likely to be less eager to buy debt made in the USA , which is likely to drive up the cost of borrowing to finance spending based on dubious claims of a multiplier effect .
While this recession might not achieve the depth and length of the Great Depression , it is likely to last longer and be deeper than any since WWII .
How much of the problem is attributable to the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the roughly $ 515 billion the U.S. spends annually on " normal " military operations may not be possible to calculate , though I would love to hear about respectable studies that have been done on the matter .
But it seems probable that the desire to be a world - bestriding imperial power with 800 military bases and facilities scattered around the globe has played a role in bringing the U.S. to its economic knees .
The fact that the U.S. government faces other unfunded obligations is relevant , of course , to its ability to continue to spend taxpayers ’ hard - earned money defending Europeans from threats that evaporated with the demise of communism or the South Koreans from a North Korea whose GDP is about one - fortieth of theirs .
The Social Security and Medicare systems , if not reformed reasonably soon , could bankrupt the country or crowd out all other government spending .
And the longer reform is postponed , the greater the social dislocations that will result .
In short , the United States may not be able to afford the empire it has built over the years , or indeed to redeem the numerous promises the government has made to Americans that they will be supported comfortably in their old age .
The possibility that somebody in a garage is developing a technology as revolutionary in its efficiency - boosting implications as the computer has been cannot be discounted , but it can not be guaranteed either .
Hard choices are ahead in a society that may well be significantly less entrepreneurial than it has been in the past .
Some would argue that most of the empires of the past never really paid for themselves , although they may have gained trade concessions or access to resources for a while .
But the promoters of empire would like us to believe that while empires may have costs , they will bring us more than commensurate benefits .
That argument has never had much resonance in the U.S. ( even though military activities have sometimes led to commercial advantages ) .
Our imperialists prefer to couch the advantages in terms of promoting democracy and human rights and uplifting the disadvantaged in benighted countries , even  or perhaps especially  when a little digging would uncover more venal motives .
If it turns out , however , that we can afford neither humanitarian nor ostensibly geopolitically advantageous military interventions because they keep us from meeting needs at home ( whether these should be done through free markets or government activity will still be tussled over ) , however , we might just decide to let Afghans , Pakistanis , Indians , Estonians , Lithuanians , Poles , Czechs , Slovaks , and so many more  not to mention Russia , China , Japan , south Asia , and a Middle East we have never mastered  decide for themselves how to live .
We might maintain the illusion that we could reduce the amount of suffering and bloodshed if only we had the resources to intervene , but we do n’t .
It would n’t be the end of the world if the American empire retreated and eventually was no more .
Berlin , Paris , London , Vienna , Moscow , Tokyo , Istanbul , Beijing , Delhi , Rome , and dozens of other cities have their charms yet , even if they are no longer the centers of great empires .
Washington would have more charms than it does now if it ceased to be the geopolitical center of the world and the Pentagon was converted to condos .

Blood supplies are stretched UK scientists plan a major research project to see if synthetic human blood can be made from embryonic stem cells .
Led by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service , the three year trial could provide an unlimited supply of blood for emergency transfusions .
The blood should be free of infections like the human form of mad cow disease .
Teams will test human embryos left over from IVF treatment to find those destined to develop into the universal " O- negative " blood donor group .
We could provide an unlimited supply of blood in this way
Project lead Professor Marc Turner
O - negative blood can be transfused into anyone without fear of tissue rejection and is the only safe option when a patient 's blood group is unknown or not immediately available .
This precious blood is in limited supply because only 7 % of the population belongs to this blood group .
The Wellcome Trust is understood to have promised £ 3 m towards the cost of the multimillion - pound project , with further funding coming from the blood transfusion services of Scotland , and England and Wales .
The Irish government is also believed to be involved .
The project will be led by Professor Marc Turner of Edinburgh University who is the director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service .
He said the work would begin in the next few weeks after final approval had been gained from the relevant research bodies .
Making blood from embryos 1 . Embryo created from IVF is tested for O - negative blood group , then allowed to develop for several days until stem cells can be extracted
2 . Stem cells are cultured in laboratory with nutrients to stimulate red blood cell creation
3. Nuclei are removed in final stage to produce oxygen - carrying mature blood cells .
Trillions of these will be needed to build up a blood bank Stem cells are the body 's master cells , with the ability to transform into any type of tissue .
Scientists have already shown it is possible to take a single stem cell from an early human embryo and encourage it to develop into mature blood cells in the laboratory .
And a US firm called Advanced Cell Technology has managed to produce billions of red blood cells from embryonic blood cells in this way .
The challenge now is to scale up the production and move the science from the lab to the bedside , which will take years .
Professor Turner said : " We should have proof of principle in the next few years , but a realistic treatment is probably five to 10 years away .
" In principle , we could provide an unlimited supply of blood in this way . "
However , many groups object to the use of embryonic stem cells on the grounds that it is unethical to destroy embryos in the name of science .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Josephine Quintavalle of the public interest group Comment on Reproductive Ethics said : " Like so many of the claims associated with embryonic stem cells , this is first steps research rather than a cure around the corner , and just as hypothetical as the rest of the claims which try to justify destroying the human embryo for the benefit of mankind .
" Associating this controversial research with a National Blood Transfusion service may even end up contaminating the feel - good image of blood banks .
" Those who donate blood but who defend the right to life of the human embryo may be reluctant to continue giving their blood . "

Jai ho !
If you cried sacrilege when you found out that Watchmen director , Zack Snyder , had altered the ending of Alan Moore ’s graphic novel , just wait until you hear what else he ’s changed .
The film screened for press in Los Angeles last night , and a source tells Defamer that the faraway glimpse of pantsless superhero Doctor Manhattan ’s blue wiener in an early preview has indeed made the final cut .
In fact , the movie contains several shots of said wang — not that fans of the original comic would ever recognize it .
Says Defamer ’s tipster :
There is indeed shitloads of blue wang .
And it ’s huge .
In the comic book , it ’s very average , and uncut , but the film is completely the opposite .
Massive and circumcised .
Given that it ’s digital , was it [ Billy ]
Crudup or his agent that insisted on the impressive cut cock ?
In the graphic novel , Doctor Manhattan ’s peen is modest and understated ( do a Google Image Search ) , symbolizing the character ’s impotence in the face of human evil .
Adding inches to its length or circumference undermines everything Alan Moore was trying to say about politics , society , and the human condition .
At this point , the best we can hope for is that Snyder was more faithful with respect to testicle size .
Zack Snyder Promises Giant , ‘ Hardcore ’ Blue Wang In Uncut ‘ Watchmen ’ [ Defamer ]
Earlier : New ‘ Watchmen ’ Footage Leaves Nothing to the Imagination
A woman , 54 , from Hobart spent the first 10 years of her marriage fighting about sex , always nervous about an unwanted advance .
" He 'd be snoring loudly and I 'd still lie there worrying that the hand was going to come creeping over . "
On the other hand , a 43 - year - old Townsville man wrote : " I just feel so lonely .
We get on really well , we do n't fight or argue , but when it comes to intimacy , or sex , she does n't want to know . "
Arndt said while giving women the right to say " no " to sex was an undisputed success of the women 's movement , " the female libido tends to be a fragile , easily distracted thing that gets buffeted by normal life and a couple can't afford to have their intimacy reliant on that fragility " .
" Mismatched desire is the burning issue , it 's what is filling the waiting rooms of sex therapists all over the world , " she said .
" I have spent half my life hearing from sex - starved men and the women saying , ' Oh , do I have to ? " '
Arndt was surprised at the openness of the men , who traditionally have been reluctant to discuss such matters .
" They do n't know what 's hit them , " Arndt said .
" They listen to what women want , try to please them and … this need that is so important to them is totally ignored .
Sex is just one area in relationships where men now are on the back foot . "
She said one man , a 66 - year - old from Darwin , eventually gave up and told his wife : " I 'll make no advances or ask for sex until you ask me . "
The result ?
" In the last eight years there has been no sex in our marriage at all , " he wrote .
Arndt said low - libido partners , which are mostly women , needed to put sex on the " to - do list " , even if they did n't feel like doing it .
" The notion that women have to want sex to enjoy it has been a really misguided idea that has caused havoc in relationships over the last 40 years . "
With the right approach from a loving partner , if women were willing to be receptive " and allow themselves to relax … they would enjoy it " , she said .
Chris Brown Issues Statement
has issued a statement one week after his arrest for allegedly attacking girlfriend
The following statement was issued on Sunday by a spokesman for Chris Brown :
" Words can not begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired .
I am seeking the counseling of my pastor , my mother and other loved ones and I am committed , with God 's help , to emerging a better person .
Much of what has been speculated or reported on blogs and / or reported in the media is wrong .
While I would like to be able to talk about this more , until the legal issues are resolved , this is all I can say except that I have not written any messages or made any posts to Facebook , on blogs or any place else .
Those posts or writing under my name are frauds . "
Brown , 19 , was arrested and charged with making criminal threats after reportedly assaulting then - girlfriend Rihanna , 20 , last Sunday .
The R&B star faces jail time if he is found guilty .
According to Rihanna 's father , she is currently on the mend in Barbados .

Michael Steele ' wins ' hip -hop ' battle ' with Stephen Colbert David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Ever since RNC Chairman Michael Steele said he wants to give the Republican party a " hip - hop makeover , " Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert has been chomping at the bit to net Steele into a rap battle .
On Colbert 's Thursday episode , Steel won without even showing up .
" Just to help him hip - hop - ify the party , I invited chairman Steele to come on my show for a discussion about the benefits of a small government rap battle , " said Colbert .
" Since then , Steele has twice accepted my invitation in the press , going so far as to say , ' bring it on . '
But he has yet to bring it ...
Even though the invitation was very clearly BYOI : bring your own it .
I do n't understand why he is not here . "
Instead of penciling in another date , Colbert pulled a hoodie out of his jacket , picked up a mic and started his flow .
" Hey Mike Steele gonna steal the mic , with a flow so rich it 'll get a tax hike , dropping rhymes so fine it will make you blush , and be so fat you could call them Rush .
Oh , say , can you see , by your mom 's ugly face , we do n't need Scalia to rule this case .
Call Nancy Grace and crank up the right - wing Republican base . "
In Steele 's absence , Colbert and his editors spliced together some of Steele 's video clips into something of a hip - hop response that nearly defies description .
It was absurd enough that Colbert finally put his rap mantle down and awarded Steele the win , in a manner of speaking .
This video is from Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report , broadcast Mar. 19 , 2009 .

Wee ( web engineering easy ) is a Seaside like web framework that uses continuations and lets the developer " get the job done quick and beautiful " , as its developer Michael Neumann writes .
Wee also has reusable components , " which are like widgets in a GUI .
Once written , you can use them everywhere " , targeting componentized HTML GUI applications , rather than RESTish ones .
The approaching 2.0 release will also be fully Rack based .
Neumann 's blog post about
Wee shows some examples how much more readable code with continuations can be .
With continuations , a simple sequential flow can be written as :
callcc page1 callcc page2 callcc page3
Compare this to the alternative , written in continuation passing style :
call page1 do call page2 do call page3 end end
If continuations are so useful , why is n't every framework using them ?
A reason why there are n't more continuation based web frameworks for Ruby is certainly that continuations in Ruby 1.8 leak memory .
Although Brent Roman 's MBARI patches fix the memory leak , they are n't yet in the official Ruby 1.8 series ( they might get included once Engine Yard assumes the maintenance ) .
With Ruby 1.9.1 , the memory leaks are also gone and Wee takes advantage of that :
For 10000 requests ( with one thread ) Ruby 1.9.1 takes 16 seconds and requires 12 MB of memory .
The same example with Ruby 1.8.7 grows to 329 MB of memory and takes 56 seconds
Wee seems to be a good reason to start switching to Ruby 1.9 and also an interesting alternative to Rails , now that Merb will be merged into Rails 3.0 .
I am pro-choice because I do n't think there is any reason why a woman should have to face all the consequences from something she did not do alone .
If a guy can get a woman pregnant and then run away , there is no reason why she should be the one responsible for everything .
Having more options puts a woman on more equal footing with men , instead of being someone of whom they can take advantage .
In addition , I believe that it is best for a child to not be born at all than to be born hated , to a mother who is forced to have him because she has no choice , and not because she wants the child .
The single most important factor for women 's advancement in society is our ability to control our fertility .
Without that , we are trapped by the realities of pregnancy , childbirth and chilrearing ; rather than a privelege and a gift , these aspect of being female become an unbearable burden .
Attempts to limit women 's reproductive freedom are no more than a gambit to keep women " in their place " -- a gambit in the guise of religious moralism .
True , the guise can run deep , and many so - called " pro-lifers " genuinely believe that killing a fetus is equivalent to killing a human being .
But such religious feeling has no place in the public policies of a country that claims to separate church and state .
In the words of supreme court justices O'Connor , Kennedy and Souter : " At the heart of liberty is the right to define one 's own concept of existence , of meaning , of the universe , and of the mystery of human life . "
No one wants to plan an abortion .
But the best way to prevent abortions is to prevent unwanted pregnancies : through sex education , improved distribution of birth control , and general empowerment of women to shape our own individual lives .
I think one of the biggest problems with the abortion debate is that the two sides are n't in direct opposition .
The pro-life movement seeks to force their moral beliefs on others - grounded in their own religion or personal philosophy .
The pro-choice movement does n't make claims on the morality of abortion - we leave that as an individual choice for every woman faced with an unwanted pregnancy .
If they feel abortion is wrong and they want to give their child up for adoption , or keep it , we will support their decision .
Pro-life people say " Abortion is wrong ; " we only say " Abortion is . "
Making abortion illegal wo n't stop abortions from happening , it will only stop them from being safe .
43 % of abortions worldwide are illegal .
Changing laws does n't solve the problem , making contraception available and affordable does .
If we are to maintain the separation of church and state so central to our nation 's identity , we cannot have some people forcing their beliefs on us all .
I 'm pro-choice because it 's the only option that is n't poisoned with misogyny .
I believe that we are responsible for justifying our beliefs , and just as one cannot claim that a given race is inferior to another because " it 's what I believe " , I do n't think one can argue that old white men can assert control over a woman 's uterus -- and future -- because they claim to believe that a fetus is comparable to a human life .
That belief is so clearly a result of the fact that only women can get pregnant and only women would ever have to carry an unwanted fetus to term that I find it laughable that anyone claims being anti-choice has anything to do with concern for potential life .
Can anyone really believe that abortion would even be an issue if men had to face the possiblity of giving birth to and raising a child because of one night of failed contraception ?
I think Florence Kennedy said it best : " If men could get pregnant , abortion would be a sacrement . "
Your views ?
Good news , doodlers :
What your colleagues consider a distracting , time - wasting habit may actually give you a leg up on them by helping you pay attention .
Asked to remember names they'd heard on a recording , people who doodled while listening had better recall than those who did n't .
This suggests that a slightly distracting secondary task may actually improve concentration during the performance of dull tasks that would otherwise cause a mind to wander .
" People may doodle as a strategy to help themselves concentrate , " said study co-author Jackie Andrade , a University of Plymouth psychologist .
" We might not be aware that we 're doing it , but it could be a trick that people develop because it helps them from wandering off into a daydream . "
Andrade 's findings , published Thursday in Applied Cognitive Psychology , are an interesting wrinkle on cognitive load theory :
The mind has a limited amount of attention to give and , once occupied , stops processing other stimuli .
Cognitive load is exploited by magicians , whose verbal and physical flourishes distract from sleight - of - hand .
It also explains why driving while talking on a hands - free headset is no safer than driving while holding a phone .
And it could be the reason why doodling is so much better than daydreaming .
" It takes a large cognitive load to daydream .
That has a big impact on the task you 're meant to be doing , " said Andrade .
" Doodling takes only a small cognitive load , but it 's just enough to keep your mental resources focused on the main task . "
Andrade 's team asked 40 people to listen to a recording containing the names of people and places .
Afterwards the people wrote down the names they could remember .
While listening , half of the test subjects were also required to shade in shapes on a piece of paper .
Afterwards , they remembered one - third more names than test subjects who did n't doodle while listening .
" The exciting thing is that people actually got better while doing two things at once , " said Andrade .
" Doodling is not as bad a thing as we might think . "

You may ask yourself , " what is the point of an acorn - shaped DAP " ?
Well , stop asking and just bask in the glory of its zaniness !
Why not , right ?
It 's teeny , cute , it 's got 1GB of memory , and it comes with its own USB cable !
Could n't be simpler than that .
Shell out $ 21 bucks for this little guy , strap it to your cell phone , and head for the great outdoors -- a beautiful placid lake for some camping , perhaps .
Sky 's the limit !
Yes , that ’s what I said .
I ’ll say it again :
It ’s time to nationalize the banks .
I say that as a die hard libertarian with impeccable free market credentials .
Even at this point , my preference would be to let bad companies fail .
But , our “ leaders ” in Washington have made it clear that they ’re not going to let that happen .
They ’re going to prop up the failing companies , and the core problems will not be solved .
Essentially , we have two problems right now .
The first is a complete lack of faith in our economic system by significant parts of those in the system .
This is a problem that has frankly been caused by the Feds and their helter - skelter approach to the problem .
The second is a pricing problem .
There are a huge number of over - priced assets ( namely , houses ) on the books of these banks .
Together , these are like a toilet that is clogged .
The Feds , in all their wisdom , are trying to clear the clog out by throwing more water into the toilet .
Unfortunately , this does n’t clear out the clog , and you eventually end up with turds all over your floor .
Since the Feds wo n’t let the clog work itself out by allowing banks ( and other poorly managed companies ) to fail , the best move is for the U.S. to nationalize its problem banks .
They would combine the toxic assets into a single bank ( a so called “ bad bank ” ) and sell the bad bank on the private market at a steep discount .
The remaining “ good banks ” would be sold off at market prices .
The Swedes did this in the 1990’s .
Yes , the stock - holders of the banks take a real hit with this approach , but they ’re supposed to when the companies they are holding have behaved stupidly .
What wo n’t work is the inconsistent half - measures we ’re currently taking .
Any banks with problems must be nationalized and fixed .
Any banks that do n’t sign onto this plan are on their own .
I ’d even support the full nationalization of all US banks over what we ’re doing now .
Do this , and then stop with the inane “ stimulus packages ” , that even the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says will hurt more than it will help .
Richie Sexson was a first baseman for the Seattle Mariners , earning $ 50 million over four years .
In 2007 , he hit barely .200 for the season and struck out more times than all but a handful of players .
It ’s possible that never in the history of the game had so much been paid for so little production .
At first , fans did n’t seem to care what Richie was getting , so long as he swatted enough homers among his strikeouts .
But during his freefall , that $ 8 hot dog and $ 10 beer did not go down so easily .
He was booed out of the game in ever - polite Seattle .
As it turns out , there ’s a performance clause in class resentment .
And when home - office hobbyists could flip a tract house every six months and walk away with a sweat - free windfall , no one would have minded if , say , Countrywide Financial was paying exotic dancers to sort the M&Ms on board the corporate jet of its chief executive officer , Angelo Mozilo .
But after Countrywide collapsed , and more than 12,000 people lost their jobs and many more lost their life savings , Mozilo was a pariah .
How could he stand to make $ 110 million in total severance ( later reduced ) after driving the nation ’s largest home lender into the ground ?
Class resentment , like race , is always there in American life , though oft - smothered by the surface calm of good times .
It was considered unfashionable , or worse , to point out that by 2006 total compensation for C.E.O.s of the largest companies was 364 times that of the pay of the average worker – a nearly tenfold increase in the gap over 30 years .
Oh shush , the apologists for inequality always said – America is a meritocracy , we pay for the best , and the rewards are market - driven .
As it turns out , there ’s a performance clause in class resentment .
To fail and still walk away with a killing is a break in the social contract simply because it does n’t work that way in real life for most people .
All of which is to say that President Obama should have little trouble prevailing with his announcement Wednesday that the buffet table at the loser ’s banquet has been closed .
He set a salary cap of $ 500,000 for executives at companies that receive large amounts of bailout money .
The restrictions do not go as far as those proposed by Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill , but it ’s a start , and the national mood is with him .
Polls show bipartisan resentment at the lords of finance who expect continued gilded age rewards after ruining the economy of the Western world .
“ People really hate you , ” Representative Barney Frank said of his message to bankers .
“ And they ’re starting to hate us because we hang out with you . ”
Obama was more nuanced , but his words on Wednesday showed a continued fleshing out of his theme that the party is over for those at top , as it has been at the bottom for some time .
“ This is America .
We do n’t disparage wealth , ” Obama said .
What Americans wo n’t stand for , he said , are “ executives being rewarded for failure , ” especially when the taxpayers are doing the rewarding .
It would have been more difficult for Obama to channel the century - old outrage of Teddy Roosevelt had he not ditched Tom Daschle , his rules - challenged nominee for health czar .
Daschle , with his $ 5 million in influence - peddling income and surprise at having to pay taxes on a limo and driver , is road kill on the way to the kind of common sense governance that Obama promised to bring to Washington .
Daschle ’s circle of sympathy goes no further than K Street , which if it were based in Omaha would be shut down as a vice problem and public menace .
Of course , some people will whine at the cruelty of trying to force welfare - dependent corporate execs to live on half - a- million a year .
“ That is pretty Draconian , ” said James F. Reda , founder of a compensation consulting firm , who was quoted in a New York Times story about Obama ’s restrictions .
He said it would be difficult to staff companies forced to accept the limits .
The same argument was made by the Wall Street bonus babies who said that good people would be hard to find if they could not reward them with millions extra every time they crashed 401k portfolios .
They argue that high executive compensation , and the billions in yearly bonuses , are just part of the accepted pay packages of the titans of finance .
Fine .
That was then .
But once a company comes to taxpayers for a handout , it ’s time for a paradigm shift , as they say at human resource retreats while plotting layoffs .
I ’m going to guess that if top employees of teetering banks are n’t willing to work for reduced pay , there ’s a long line of people who would happily take their place .
Go ahead – make their day : walk away from the executive chambers .
The pity party meets at first base , the one - time home of strikeout king Richie Sexson .
[ Correction :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly named the chief executive of Countrywide Financial .
He is Angelo Mozilo , not Anthony . ]
Well , here we go again ... it appears the Canonical just uploaded some new and very nice desktop themes for the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) operating system , in order to please their devoted users .
Softpedia is once again the first website to offer you a preview of the new artwork , which will probably be present in the final release of Ubuntu 9.04 .
OK , so ... long story short , it looks like there 's a new package ( see the end notes for details ) named gnome - themes - ubuntu , which contains three of the most popular , community created GNOME themes : Dust , Dust Sand and New Wave .
However , none of the new themes is set as default ... yet !
Without further introduction , here are the new themes ...
Ubuntu 9.04 Daily Build 03172009 with the New Wave theme
Ubuntu 9.04 Daily Build 03172009 with the Dust theme
Ubuntu 9.04 Daily Build 03172009 with the Dust Sand theme
What else can we tell you ?... the new themes look and feel great !
Once again , we would like to mention the fact that the above themes are created by third - party authors : New Wave is created by Anton Kerezov , Dust and Dust Sand are created by Rico Sta. Cruz and Kido Mariano .
And , now that we have a new login screen , new notifications and three new nice themes ... all we need is a breathtaking wallpaper .
Among other new features in Ubuntu 9.04 is the famous GNOME 2.26 desktop environment , which brings lots and lots of improvements in many areas , such as Evolution , GNOME Control Center , GNOME Media , GNOME Power Manager , etc. Ubuntu 9.04 's kernel will be based on the latest version of Linux kernel 2.6.28 , which will offer support for many new devices ( wireless , webcams , etc ) .
Moreover , applications such as OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 , The GIMP 2.6.6 , Mozilla Firefox 3.0.7 , Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0.0.21 , Transmission 1.51 or Pidgin 2.5.5 will also be present in the final version of Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) , due for release on April 23rd .
Do n't forget to visit our website next Friday for the Ubuntu 9.04 Beta Screenshot
Tour , where we will unveil more of Jaunty 's new features !
Later edit :
We discovered that the themes will be present in Ubuntu 9.04 and they are all in an official package , named " gnome - themes - ubuntu " .
Please see the screenshot below for more details .
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , ruler of Dubai , called off multimillion - pound festivities late on Monday night .
He said all public New Year ’s celebrations should be called off “ as a sign of solidarity with the brotherly Palestinian people and because of the death and destruction perpetrated on the Gaza Strip by the Israeli war machine ” .
Researchers have identified a new strain of malware that can spread rapidly from machine to machine using a variety of infection techniques , including the poisoning of webservers , which then go on to contaminate visitors .
The malware is a variation of a rapidly mutating virus alternately known as Virut and Virux .
It has long proved adept at injecting itself into executable files , which are then able to attack uninfected machines through network drives and USB sticks .
The variant , which Microsoft is calling Virus : Win32 / Virus .
BM , is also able to infect web scripts based on languages such as PHP , ASP , and HTML .
Servers that become infected include an iframe in webpages that attempt to spread malware to visitors .

Google being infamous for its propensity to launch free desktop tools doubling as data mining i.e. spyware gimmicks , we ’ve checked and analyzed one aspect of their new Chrome browser ’s data streaming behavior in more detail .
In conducting these tests we focused on the type of data being sent to Google when you enter something into the Chrome address field .
So we typed the URL http://www.microsoft.com into the address field in an intentionally slow fashion .
Outgoing and incoming data streams where simultaneously analyzed deploying the network protocol analyzer tool Wireshark .
The ensuing log files indicate beyond doubt that the typed - in characters are being converted into GET commands calling a specific Google URL .
In this particular example all calls following were addressed at IP 74.125.43.100 which is assigned to the host bw - in - f100.google.com – clearly a Google property .
Generally speaking , the generated URLs will adopt this specific format :
http://74.125.43.100/complete/search?client=chrome&output=chrome&hl=en-US&q=...
The query string “ q= … ” is made up of the characters or letters you enter in the address field .
In the following log file excerpt we have purged the preceding part of the URLs , i.e. the string “ http://74.125.43.100″ for easier readability .
Following the initial GET line you ’ll find the Google server return data .
Session Protocol

This shows nicely how each and every character , when entered in slow speed , gets transmitted to Google whereupon the Google system returns its suggestions that will not be modified further , the more complete your final address string becomes .
It is important to note that we are analyzing the browser ’s address field here , not a Google query field !
In a nutshell : with its Chrome browser Google is actually monitoring your entire surfing behavior , not merely the searches you may conduct via their search engine .
So regardless how lax a data privacy standard you may embrace : this clearly and unambiguously qualifies Chrome as a blatant spyware tool !
You do n’t have to be an Einstein to figure out that lots of privacy protection interest groups ( and the European Commission who have been giving Google a pretty hard time over privacy violation issues in the recent past anyway … ) will take a pretty dim view of this policy .
So expect this matter to dominate the headlines for quite a while to come .
Nor would it come as a particular surprise to us if this should evolve into yet another public relations disaster for the Google crowd who have proved remarkably insensitive to concerns both by the general public and the body politic outside the USA in this field .
So are there any upsides to this from an SEO point of view ?
Maybe there are , indeed .
Some suggestions come to mind off the cuff .
You could use Chrome specifically to either grab data from Google you ’re interested in or to furnish them with data you actually want them to have .
A group of at least a dozen teenagers assaulted six people in two separate incidents , one of them possibly a bias crime , after the Britney Spears ' concert in Newark Saturday night .
Bobby Daniel Caldwell , 36 , and his partner Joshua Kehoe , 25 , both from Kearny , said they were returning to their car parked near Raymond Boulevard and Broad Street from the Prudential Center at approximately 11 p.m. when a group of 15 to 20 teenage girls and boys approached them from the opposite direction and then punched and kicked them as they yelled an anti-gay slur .
After they stole Kehoe 's cellphone , the group then assaulted four female college students who had been walking behind them , Kehoe said .
They fled with one of the girls ' purses , said Police Director Garry McCarthy during an interview today .
Detective Hubert Henderson said the college students did not suffer serious injuries .
Caldwell was not as lucky .
He suffered a broken jaw that doctors had to fix by inserting two metal plates and wires , Kehoe said .
For the next several weeks , Caldwell has to subsist on a liquid diet , Kehoe said .
" I have to drink a sippy cup , like two - year - old , " Caldwell mumbled through his wired jaw as he sat in their Kearny apartment .
Kehoe said the crowd deliberately targeted him and his partner because they were gay .
McCarthy said while they have not determined if it was a bias incident , investigators were busy today interviewing the victims and looking at surveillance footage .
" If it turns out that it is a bias crime , then it is what it is " he said .
Kehoe said he was positive it was a bias incident because they used an epithet commonly used to demean homosexuals .
" No matter how you look at it , it is a hate crime , " he said .
Paul Loriquet , a spokesman for the Essex County Prosecutor 's office , said the prosecutor 's bias unit had already joined in the investigation .
Security videos taken in the area on Saturday night are being reviewed .
Steven Goldstein , chairman of Garden State Equality , a Montclair - based gay rights organization , said his group is looking into the attack .
" You have two people have the living daylights beaten out of them , while they are called a ( epithet ) , " he said .
" If that 's not a hate crime then I do n't know what it is . "
Within minutes of the attack , Caldwell was taken to University Hospital with his jaw broken in two places .
Kehoe said he had to wait for police for 45 minutes at the site of the assault even though several squad cars passed the scene .
Kehoe said a security guard at a nearby building and two passersby called police , with one of them even flagging down a patrol car that drove away .
" It was like you were in a town with no police and people on the loose , " Kehoe said .
McCarthy and Mayor Cory Booker said police were busy at that time breaking up a crowd of 400 to 500 teenagers fighting in front of the Sugar Rays nightclub about seven blocks away on Park Place .
The crew that attacked Kehoe , Caldwell and the college girls was a splinter group from the mob fighting in front of the nightclub , McCarthy said .
that is .
" Unfortunately , our officers were responding to what was called a general call for support , so numerous of our officers fled to the scene of what was happening , and left this individual vulnerable to this attack by these children , " said Booker , referring to Caldwell , who suffered the brunt of the abuse .
Sugar Rays , adjacent to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center , was having an alcohol - free teen event from about 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday , according to Miles Berger , one of the owners .
Berger said he did n't know if any Sugar Rays patrons were involved in the latest violence .
" Whether they went to Sugar Rays or not , they have to be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , " he said .
Berger also owns the Robert Treat Hotel across the street , where violence erupted after an event on Feb. 22 in which three men were shot outside the ballroom where a late - night hip - hop dance party was taking place .
Authorities said the shooting was sparked by a dispute .
Jasper Kane , 21 , of Newark was arrested on March 13 in connection with the shooting .
Both Booker and McCarthy insisted future events would not spark similar problems , once legislation requiring a police security review is approved by the city council .
McCarthy said he expected the council 's approval may come as soon as next week .
The ordinance would require event organizers to submit a security plan , and apply for a permit .
Traditionally , governments accepted that they were only temporary custodians of power .
And that their power was circumscribed – by Parliament , the civil service , the courts , local governments , and even the media .
They tried to work within those constraints .
Mrs
Thatcher got extremely annoyed when these institutions stood in her way .
Not always , but for the most part , even the Iron Lady accepted their constitutional right to do so .
We ca n’t blame the international economy , or terrorism , for the state we ’re in .
As I explain in my new book , The Rotten State of Britain , it ’s rooted deep in the psychology of New Labour .
Strikes , stagflation , even snow – it ’s like the 1970s all over again .
It took Mrs Thatcher to pull us out of that mire .
Unfortunately , Gordon Brown seems to have bought us a return ticket .
How did we get into such a state ?
We ’re spied on by the world ’s biggest array of CCTV cameras .
We ’re bullied by the world ’s most expensive police force , who are quite willing to arrest us for dropping an apple core .
We seize the assets of our best friend in Europe – Iceland – under anti-terrorism law .
Nannying officials say we can’t feed our dogs grapes or give our kids a sip of wine .
The average worker has to save 60 years to get the same pension that an MP clocks up in just 13 .
The government ’s total liabilities are three times the national income .
The IMF says we ’re the country least well placed to survive the downturn , not the best , as Gordon Brown insists .
Dr Eamonn Butler is director of the Adam Smith Institute and author of The Rotten State of Britain , which is published on Tuesday by Gibson Square Books .
The book offers a damning account of what the successive Labour Governments have done to Britain over the last twelve years and here he looks in particular at the perils of the state having accrued increasingly draconian powers .
New Labour blew this consensus apart .
Labour had suffered terribly through its long war between those who wanted to cherish its socialist ideology and those who wanted to get it elected .
It had seen what happened to John Major when he too faced a fractious party , airing its disputes in public .
New Labour ’s new principle , and what got it elected , was control .
It would be crisp , businesslike , and united .
It would achieve that by having strict central control over policy and action .
Dissent would not be tolerated .
It won the campaign .
And New Labour thought that the same principles would win government as well .
All policy was cleared through Downing Street .
The civil service press officers , who prided themselves on being independent , were replaced by ones who would stay on message .
MPs and ministers who muttered any doubts were humiliated , briefed against , and demoted .
The press was taught to follow the line by being rewarded with inside information and interviews for helpful pieces , and being frozen out for harmful ones .
You have to hand it to Peter Mandelson , Alastair Campbell , Tony Blair and the others .
The machine they created was brilliantly effective .
Nothing stood in their way .
But leaders need someone to stand in their way , to challenge them , to restrain their excesses .
Otherwise , they soon use their power to serve their own whims and interests , rather than the public good .
Today , power is concentrated in Downing Street – with Gordon Brown and eighty - odd unelected , unaccountable Party appointees .
Parliament is powerless , because so many MPs owe their ministerial careers and pensions to Gordon Brown ’s patronage .
Debates are routinely guillotined : but the government has the votes , so why talk ?
The civil service is told what to do by Party officials : civil servants know that their careers too depend on following the line .
Even the judges are slapped down by ministers if they deliver unwelcome verdicts – something that politicians would once never dare to do .
The entire apparatus of the state has been subverted .
It no longer protects us from our rulers .
Rather , it simply deepens their power over us .
New Labour really believes that it knows what is good for us .
But when such belief comes with unlimited power , it is hugely dangerous .
The government has voted itself sweeping powers , in the genuine belief that it will use them wisely .
But it has led to people being arrested for heckling the Foreign Secretary , staging a one - man protest in Whitehall , and indeed dropping an apple core .
Soon the police will have powers to arrest anyone taking a picture of them .
I had great difficulty getting the major publishers to take my book , because nobody seemed to realise how far we had slid into a police state .
But now , with former MI5 chief Stella Rimington and David Blunkett both saying exactly that , I feel vindicated .
Just stand back , and you will see how far it is gone .
Will a Conservative administration rein back its own powers and set us free once again ?
I ca n’t say I ’m confident .
Power is intoxicating .
Politicians almost never give it up .
But it will take a radical shift of power , from the politicians at the centre to the people in the localities , to pull us out of this rotten state .
AOL Gets a New CEO : Google Sales Boss Tim Armstrong ( Plus the Whole Press Release )
Everyone who wondered why Randy Falco and Ron Grant were still running AOL gets an answer : Time Warner ( TWX ) was lining up their replacement .
Google ( GOOG ) sales chief Tim Armstrong becomes chairman and CEO of the troubled Web property , effective immediately .
The move is getting immediate cheers from current and former AOL employees I ’ve talked to .
The snap consensus is that anyone would have been better than Falco , a longtime NBC executive , and Grant , who was Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes ’s chief lieutenant before being elevated to his role as President and COO of AOL .
But they ’re particularly happy to see a sales guy running the organization : AOL once had a much admired sales operation .
But in recent years , the group has been roiled , as a series of sales chiefs came and went .
( From Kara Swisher , here are more details on the shakeup , and an interview with Armstrong .
And here ’s some early betting on Armstrong ’s replacement at Google — former Doubleclick CEO David Rosenblatt has a lot of fans ) .
The current AOL sales chief , former Yahoo ( YHOO ) sales boss Greg Coleman , was installed just last month .
He ’s been deep into a reorg of his own .
It was desperately needed after AOL ’s miserable performance in 2008 , which concluded with a quarter that saw ad revenue drop 18 percent .
But those plans may be up in the air now .
In any case , here is the full press release from Time Warner about the firing of Falco and Grant , after the jump :

A former Swiss investment banker admitted in court on Monday that he seduced and blackmailed Germany ’s wealthiest woman , heiress to the BMW car empire , with secret films of their hotel trysts .
The former Credit Suisse banker Helg Sgarbi apologized in court to the women involved .
Despite the apology the prosecution seeks a nine - year jail term for the man .

Defendant Helg Sgarbi is accused of blackmailing Susanne Klatten , a heiress to the BMW business empire who is ranked as one of Germany 's richest woman by having his sexual trysts w ... ith them filmed and then demanding money .
Anzeige
Helg Sgarbi admitted seducing heiress Susanne Klatten and three other wealthy women and persuading them to pay him almost 10 million euros ( $ 12.64 million ) with various tales , including one that he had fallen foul of the Italian mafia .
" I regret what I did , “ Sgarbi , 44 , told the Munich court , with little emotion .
" I apologise to the women involved . “
Klatten , a member of the Quandt family -- the leading shareholders in carmaker BMW -- went public last year with the story of how her lover filmed their secret meetings and later demanded 49 million euros not to reveal them .
Anzeige
The 46 - year - old married mother - of - three had first met Sgarbi at a health centre , state prosecutors told a crowded court .
Posing as a special envoy for war zones , Sgarbi won over Klatten after sending her text messages and phoning her with declarations of his love .
She later handed him a cardboard box containing 7 million euros in 500 euro notes , believing he had paralysed a child in a traffic accident in America and needed the money to pay compensation to avoid being jailed .
Anzeige
Sgarbi then demanded 49 million euros , threatening to send photos and tapes of their hotel - room rendezvous to colleagues , family and the press .
His admission means Klatten may not have to appear in court .
Leafing through the defendant ’s curriculum vitae , judge Gilbert Wolf read from a glowing job reference from investment bank Credit Suisse , describing Sgarbi ’s role there as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions .
State prosecutor Thomas Steinkrauss - Koch told the court he would seek a nine - year prison term .
Anzeige
" Where is the money ?
Where are the tapes ?
And who are the accomplices ? “ he asked the defendant .
Klatten ’s wealth is estimated by Forbes magazine at almost $ 10 billion , making her the 68th richest person in the world .
She owns just over half of the chemical company Altana as well as 12.5 percent of BMW .
Newspapers had reported that Sgarbi had sought to justify his actions as revenge for his Jewish grandfather ’s forced labour in Quandt family factories during the war .
But no mention was made of this claim on Monday .
The Quandt dynasty had close ties to the Nazi party and built its fortune supplying German army and railway worker uniforms .
The first wife of Klatten ’s grandfather went on to marry Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels .

Clash of cultures
an " anti-blasphemy " convention ?!
Wednesday , February 15 , 2006
Last week I read about an ancient arab saying : " a falling camel invites many knives " .
I do n't know any statement that is more applicable to the West today than this .
It is becoming more evident each day that the momentum in this so - called clash of cultures is with fundamental Islam and not with the West .
The most recent manifestation of this phenomenon is the proposal by the UN and agreed to by the EU , to establish an international " anti-blasphemy " convention .
While the proposed convention is carefully couched in general terms , the unmistakable intention of it is to proscribe blasphemous statements or deeds , which today is something unique primarily to Islam , as other religions generally do not concern themselves with blasphemy to the same degree .
While a " convention " is n't exactly a law , it has the same effect as a law , as in the Geneva Convention , meaning that signatories to the convention that are in contravention are in effect breaking a law .
The fact that the UN is in the process of introducing this convention is n't surprising , nor is the EU 's support of it .
It represents a further capitulation to radicalism and violent actions , another new " peace in our time " moment for the West that will ultimately prove to be insufficient in stemming further demands that Westerners modify their behavior in deference to Islam .
The real goal of Islam was clearly stated by a " moderate " Muslim on July 2 , 1998 in Fremont , California .
In a packed banquet hall , Omar M. ahmad , Chairman of the board of the Council on american - Islamic Relations ( CaIR ) , said , " Islam is n't in america to be equal to any other faith , but to become dominant .
The Koran should be the highest authority in america and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth . "
It does n't get much more straightforward than that .
Incidentally , when Daniel Pipes , director of the Middle East Forum , quoted Mr. ahmad , he promptly denied ever making the statement .
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , the secretary - general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , called upon European governments to enact legislation against " Islamophobia " and claimed that Muslims are being discriminated against , likening current events to " a new Sept. 11 against them " .
Gee , Mr. Ihsanoglu , I do n't know quite how to break this to you , but it is n't difficult being " Islamophobic " in the face of all the violence that is taking place in the name of Islam .
I think it is only normal for people to feel fear , watching videos of hostages being brutally decapitated , while the participants chant " all praise be to God " .
Suicide bombings and planes flying into buildings also tend to make people nervous .
We in the west have a lot of " no - nos " when it comes to being critical of those who are different and we pride ourselves in our inclusiveness and tolerance of others .
We have gone so far as to enact some really screwy laws that deprive us of the right to speak freely , lest we offend someone .
These include hate laws that make it illegal to be racist or homophobic or to even deny that there was a Holocaust .
I 'm sure we , being the falling camel that we are , will find some method of accommodating Islam .
In fact , we 're already voluntarily censoring ourselves so as not to inadvertently offend .
Remember the Nike running shoes that had a squiggle on them that looked like the word " allah " written in arabic ?
Well ,
Nike voluntarily took those shoes off the market and to atone for their " sin " , the company built a basketball court at an Islamic school in the U.S .
Then there 's Burger King , who voluntarily took its ice cream swirl off the British market because some British Muslims felt the swirl also looked like the word " allah " .
and while we 're on the subject of Britain , that country is no longer flying its own flag over its prisons , as it contains St. George 's cross , which may be offensive to Muslims because it was used by the Crusaders .
Do n't forget the Kleenex boxes with Winnie the Pooh and his friend Piglet , which were deemed offensive to Muslims and ordered off the desks of British civil servants .
Ditto for the Disney Piglet mugs , which might also be offensive to Muslims .
While we are twisting ourselves into pretzels in our efforts not to offend Muslims , the Muslim world does n't seem to have a problem burning churches or foisting off blood - libels against Jews .
In Saudi arabia newspapers routinely carry stories about how Jews kill Muslim babies so that they can make Purim cookies with their blood or that Jewish prostitutes are responsible for the spread of aIDS in Egypt .
Irshad Manji , the apostate Muslim woman and author of the book The Trouble With Islam recalls how as a child in Egypt she was warned against taking candy from strangers , lest they be Jews attempting to poison her .
In Canada , Mohammed Elmasry , head of the Canadian Islamic Congress , is threatening to have The Western Standard charged with a hate crime for reproducing the cartoons that started this most recent round of strife .
In an ominous statement referring to Denmark , Elmasry said , " we can't control what 's in the press .
If people do it , we have to live with the consequences . "
Those consequences include riots , mayhem and murder .
What Mr. Elmasry and most everyone else may have missed is that the Danish cartoons came about as a result of fear .
a Danish author who was writing a book about Islam attempted to find an illustrator for the book and every artist he contacted turned the job down for fear of his safety .
When he related his plight to the Editor of the Jylands - Posten , the editor wanted to test the veracity of the author 's story by sending a call for cartoons illustrating the Prophet to 40 Danish cartoonists .
Only ten of the 40 dared to submit their work .
One of our most precious freedoms is the freedom to say what 's on our mind .
Bit by bit that freedom is going the way of the dodo , as conventions , regulations and laws come into force around the world that limit what we can say and how we can say it .
More and more knives are coming out as this camel , which was once a strong and free society , continues its descent into ignominy .
Who knows , in 20 years ' time we might find ourselves in the Caliphate of ameristan .
It 's even possible that the head of the Supreme Islamic Court could then be Chelasy bin Clinton .
Thanks to a successful experiment carried out by a team of Indian scientists , now there is a species of bacteria named after ISRO and another one after legendary Indian astronomer Aryabhata .
Bacillus isronensis and Bacillus aryabhata are among three new species of bacteria discovered in the upper stratosphere which have been found to be highly resistant to ultra-violent radiation .
The third species has been named Janibacer hoylei , after distinguished astrophysicist Fred Hoyle , a press release from ISRO ( Indian Space Research Organisation ) said .
ISRO carried out the balloon experiments which led to the discovery of the new species .
Scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ( TIFR ) in Mumbai , Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( CCMB ) in Hyderabad , National Centre for Cell Sciences ( NCCS ) in Pune and some other institutions collaborated in the experiment which was the second such project undertaken by ISRO .
The experiment was conducted using a 26.7 million cubic feet balloon , carrying a 459 - kg scientific payload soaked in 38 - kg of liquid neon .
The balloon was flown from the National Balloon Facility in Hyderabad and operated by TIFR .
The payload consisted of a cryosampler containing 16 evacuated and sterilised stainless steel probes , the press release said .
Throughout the flight , the probes remained immersed in liquid neon to trap gases and vapours from the stratosphere .
These steel cylinders , after collecting air samples from different heights ranging from 20 km to 41 km , were parachuted down and safely retrieved .
The samples were analysed by the scientists at NCCB and NCCS following a homogenous procedure .
The analysis revealed that out of the 12 bacterial colonies detected in the air samples , nine had more than 98 per cent similarity with species found on earth .
Three , however , were completely new , and had significantly higher ultra-violent resistance compared to their nearest phylogenetic neighbours , the release said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have pinpointed two genes that protect wheat against devastating fungal diseases found worldwide , potentially paving the way to hardier wheat strains , international researchers reported on Thursday .

New research published in the journal Science showed how the genes provide resistance to leaf rust , stripe rust and powdery mildew , diseases responsible for millions of hectares of lost wheat yield each year .
“ Improving control of fungal rust diseases in cereals through breeding varieties with durable rust resistance is critical for world food security , ” Simon Krattinger of the Institute of Plant Biology in Zurich and colleagues , wrote in one of the studies .
“ The most profitable and environmental friendly strategy for farmers to control wheat rust in both the developing and the developed world is to grow genetically resistant wheat varieties . ”
The findings might help farmers one day protect crops without spraying them with fungicides , improve traditional plant breeding techniques and possibly help protect other crops susceptible to the diseases like barley , researchers said .
Krattinger and his team isolated a gene called Lr34 using a resistant wheat line , knocking out genes until they found the one that offered protection .
They do not know exactly what the gene does but believe it produces a protein that transports molecules in a cell that help fight off diseases , Krattinger said .
A problem for plant breeders is that other resistance genes only offer short - term protection because diseases mutate and find new ways to attack a plant .
But the Lr34 gene is different because it is far more durable , Krattinger said .
“ The gene has been active for more than 50 years , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ Breeders knew certain plants offered resistance but they did n’t know what the gene was or how it worked .
We have identified that . ”
In the second study , Cristobal Uauy of the John Innes Center in Britain and colleagues identified a gene called Yr36 found in wild wheat but absent in modern pasta and bread varieties .
The gene confers resistance to stripe rust .
Bread wheat provides about 20 percent of the calories eaten by people across the world and is Britain ’s biggest crop export , the researchers noted .
“ We have recovered a gene that has been lost during domestication , ” Uauy said in a telephone interview .
“ We now have a new tool to combat this disease . ”
The researchers do not know what the gene does but believe it recognizes a lipid from a disease and somehow triggers a resistance response , he added .
Like the Lr34 gene , Yr36 appears to offer longer protection and it also seems to fight off more than one strain of stripe rust , he added .
“ The idea is if you can have these genes you are buying insurance your crops will be fine and you are protecting your yield , ” Uauy said .
The other ship , carrying 356 migrants , reported that it was in difficulty and was towed to Libya , according to another official with the group , Laurence Hart , who was in Tripoli , Libya ’s capital .

Mr. Chauzy said his organization was “ still without news of two other boats that were caught out in the storm . ”
It was not clear whether they were fishing boats or smugglers ’ boats or what happened to the people on board .
Every year , tens of thousands of poverty - stricken people try to cross from Libya to Italy  a favored destination for migrants seeking to circumvent European immigration restrictions , often via a small Italian island called Lampedusa between the coasts of North Africa and Sicily .
The crossing spans a divide between the poverty of the developing world and the perceived riches of lands to the north .
Once they have landed in the European Union , migrants may travel with ease among the 15 of the union ’s 27 member nations that are grouped by the so - called Schengen agreement , which permits travelers to cross borders without identity papers .
Even as European economies shrink because of the global recession , the number of would - be migrants is unlikely to ease since their own homelands are also blighted by the economic slump .
How much is inside a ketchup packet ?
No one knows for sure , but there is a general consensus that it is only about one - fifth of the amount of ketchup one needs to enjoy french fries .
Brooke and I decided to find out how many packets of ketchup it takes to fill a bottle .
The first step was to buy a new bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup .
Ketchup is cheap .
This 14oz .
plastic bottle was only $ 1.25 .
We squeezed it out into a measuring cup to double - check the contents .
Yep. 14 ounces .
That is one and three - quarters of a cup .
Next we headed to Jack in the Box and Carl 's Jr. to collect ketchup packets .
The USA has traditionally been the land of plenty when it comes to a bounty of free condiment packets , but some places are getting really stingy with them lately .
Here is a photo of Brooke jamming her pockets full .
We also bought a small order of fries so we would n't feel bad about it .
We had a hundred packs , which is about one - eighth of the number I used in the ketchup packet bear a couple of years ago .
Here is what a hundred packets of ketchup look like .
To me , it was like counting money .
Stacks and stacks of money !
One by one we cut open the packets and emptied them out into a measuring cup .
We tried to get all the ketchup out of each one but inevitably , there is ketchup left in the corners .
I sometimes picture myself stuck on a desert island with only five ketchup packets for food , squeezing and re-squeezing the packets for hours on end .
Soon we had 14 ounces of unpacked packet ketchup , ( also known unpacketchup ) .
We carefully re-filled the ketchup bottle with our FREE ketchup !
Woo Hoo !
At last this whole website thing was starting to pay off !
I 'm never paying for mustard , relish , soy or el scorcho sauce again !
The bottle was refilled to the top using exactly 50 packets of ketchup !
That means that each packet holds 8 grams of ketchup , or about a quarter - ounce , and has a value of about 2.5 cents US !
We still had the fries and the more than enough ketchup left over , so I had a chance to indulge my immense desire for fresh ketchup .
Remember , the FDA recommends eight servings of fruits and vegetables every day , and ketchup - saturated french fries are the easiest way to satisfy that recommendation !
Did you ever notice how food photography makes everything look so damn tasty ?
Brooke thought that if we blended in some fresh tomatoes , we could make our own ye olde - fashioned style freshe ketchupe .
Unfortunately I got excited and turned the blender on while she was fishing the foil packets out !
Luckily she only lost one of her ring fingers , she can still flip people off .
It was a serial number on discarded implants that led authorities to the real identity of the alleged SoCal Boob Bandit and may have been the tip police needed to take her into custody .
Yvonne Jean Pampellonne , 30 , allegedly used a fraudulent identity to pay for liposuction and a breast implant exchange , according to the Huntington Beach Police Department .
The total cost of the surgeries is valued at more than $ 12,000 .
The Laguna Niguel woman is accused of opening a line of credit in someone else 's name in September 2008 , having the procedures and then never showing up for any follow - up appointments , police said .
Dr. Larry Nichter , who performed the surgery at the Pacific Center For Plastic Surgery , used identification numbers on the old set of implants to track down the original surgeon .
Employees at the center were able to confirm the identity of Pampellonne as a suspect after viewing a photograph line - up , police said .
Pampellonne surrendered in court Tuesday and was released on $ 20,000 bail , said attorney Paul Wallin .
Wallin said when all the facts are established , " a completely different picture " will emerge .
He also lambasted media reports that he said have portrayed Pampellonne as , among other things , a " boob - job bandit . "
" Everyone should reserve judgment , and when all of the facts are presented , there will be information that will be revealed that will indicate that our client is not guilty of any criminal offense , " Wallin said .
He said he had been in contact with Pampellonne , and arrangements were made for her self - surrender .
She will be arraigned May 27 in a Westminster courtroom on charges of commercial burglary , grand theft and identity theft .

Despite a winter of uncertainty and a low - key shakedown , the team formerly known as Honda Racing has been reincarnated as Brawn GP .
Considering the poor performances of Honda in recent years , the new car 's pace in its first tests has been astounding .
The neat little BGP 001 hides some unique features to its pace such as clever front suspension , a ' snow plough ' bargeboard and complex diffuser , as well as the weight distribution advantage of not having KERS .
Now under the ownership of Ross Brawn , the team 's personnel remains largely the same , while its new car is effectively the car Honda planned to race this year , but re-badged and re-engined .
That is to say that the work on this car 's design was commenced 15 months ago and largely completed while the team was still backed by the manufacturer .
Commercial negotiations to purchase the team continued all the way through to the end of February .
Simultan eously a deal to gain access to customer Mercedes engines was agreed and work was completed to redesign the car for the new engine .
At first , the car appears to be quite a conventional design , but the closer you look at the details , the more the innovation becomes apparent .
It 's obvious that the car has benefited from a lot of development since the project was prioritised last year , as a result of the poor performance of the RA108 campaigned by Honda Racing .
Starting at the front , the wide nose is as low as rules permit , at no less than 125 mm high .
Brawn GP appears to be the only team with this low approach : the shape is aided by two strakes running high up on the edges of the nosecone .
More conventional is the front wing , which uses a two - element flap and an angular transition from the main plane towards the wing tips .
Then again less conventional are the endplates , which are made up of overlapping vanes , in an effort to remove the vertical part of the endplate above the wing .
New rules for 2009 demand a minimum surface area for several sections of the endplates , in an effort to ensure teams run full width wings and not simply keep the narrower versions allowed in 2008 .
Brawn GP has still produced a full width wing , but effectively the wingtip curls down to form the bottom half of the endplate , rather than an endplate being formed by vertical fence added to the wing tip .
To meet the rules a large vane has been added to the foot plate to create sufficient side profile area .
Having no endplate makes the high pressure flow above the wing tip spill down the sides and around the front wheel , which also usefully reduces drag , offsetting the negative impact of the wider wing .
Making the design even more complex is the separate cascade element added to the top of the wing 's surface .
Controlling the flow off the front wing , Brawn GP has uniquely positioned the steering rack low down in line with the lower wishbone .
By doing this the team is allowed to have a more streamlined lower wishbone shape as it's in tandem with the steering arm .
This is important as the front wing is so much lower down this and the wishbones are hugely influential in managing the wing 's flow back over the rest of the car .
This feature may have defined the need for such a low nosecone .
Beneath the raised chassis is an innovative feature in the form of a snow plough solution , similar to that sported last week by Williams .
Starting from the splitter , a curved horizontal vane rises up to pick up the airflow passing under the nose .
As bargeboards in their conventional location are banned , the only place to put a vane is under the raised part of the chassis .
Thus the Brawn GP solution is effectively a bargeboard mounted on its side .
The tumbling vortex of air spilling off the edge of the plough heads under the raised floor of the sidepods and feeds the diffuser higher pressure air .
This allows the diffuser to flow more air and hence create a lot more downforce .
This might be a critical feature in the BGP 001's pace .
Even with this device the car also sports small turning vanes mounted just ahead of the sidepods .
Also aiding flow over the sidepods are the mirror mounts , which like Force India use excessively long mounts to act at flow straighteners .
In the BGP 001's case the mirror mounts are split to form a two element winglet - like appearance .
While they may produce some downforce , their shape is most likely to control the flow over the sidepods as they drop away towards the rear of the car .
The car 's sidepods themselves are incredibly small - the inlet is positioned McLaren - style , high and wide , leaving the maximum space for the undercut to send flow around the car .
One factor in their tiny size is that the team is not going to run KERS , thus the car only needs to cool the engine , and not the additional hardware required for KERS .
This means its radiators and ducting are correspondingly smaller .
Not only is the inlet small , but the sidepods waste away to a very narrow exit .
To maintain a reasonable exit size , the team ends the sidepod earlier than other teams , its small size aided by exiting the exhausts above it in their own fairings .
The car also appears to exit hot air under the gearbox fairing and rear crash structure , as part of a complex diffuser solution .
The diffuser is a ' double decker ' design : the ' U ' shaped centre section does not form the roof of the diffuser , but is simply the lower deck of the set - up .
The upper deck is formed around the crash structure and hence is a few centimetres higher than the limit of 175 mm - this extra exit area is critical in gaining downforce .
Conversely , the rear wing is quite conventional as are the endplates , the lower beam wing spans the full width between the endplates , as the impact structure is shaped to pass below it , making the rain light appear lower than it really is .
Flow to the rear wing is aided by a McLaren - style roll hoop - the undercut snorkel is supported by two struts leaving very little structure to the rear .
If the exterior is visibly well developed , then the mechanical and electronic work beneath the skin is not obvious , but was a huge task for the team to integrate its chassis and carbon gearbox to the Mercedes engine .
Unlike Force India 's arrangement with McLaren - Mercedes for engine and gearbox , Brawn GP has simply gained an engine supply .
It is reported that the team had options on both Ferrari and Mercedes engines , the latter chosen as the integration with the Honda chassis and gearbox was deemed easier .
This would not only be the physical joining of the three interfaces ( chassis\engine \gearbox ) but also the revisions to fuel and cooling packaging and electronic integration .
Honda had already developed and track - tested its KERS system last year , using a flywheel system developed in conjunction with Flybrid .
Unlike any other team , this was to be a pure flywheel solution mounted inside the front of the fuel tank , running off the front of the engine .
This would not have required the same cooling and complex packaging demands as the electric or flywheel \electric solutions seen on its rivals .
As yet the team does not have plans to run KERS .
Considering its late start to the season and limited budget , this seems to be a sensible route to take , as KERS is not mandatory in 2009 .
This choice might even have gained Brawn GP some of its pace , as the car can be configured to run ballast in the most efficient places ( i.e. towards the front ) rather than some 30Kg of the ballast being replaced by the KERS system in less efficient locations .
With the compressed timescales to get the BGP 001 ready for the first race , the car will continue to test in Jerez next week to gain the most track time possible before setting off for Australia .
VIEWPOINT
David Molden
Rising populations and growing demand is making the world a thirsty planet , says David Molden .
In this week 's Green Room , he says the solution lies in people reducing the size of their " water footprints " .
Each of us can make a difference if we first consider the water implications of our lifestyles and the water footprint we are leaving behind
Today , one - third of the world 's population has to contend with water scarcity , and there are ominous signs that this proportion could quickly increase .
Up to twice as much water will be required to provide enough food to eliminate hunger and feed the additional 2.5 billion people that will soon join our ranks .
The demands will be particularly overwhelming as a wealthier , urbanised population demands a richer diet of more meat , fish , and milk .
The water required for a meat - eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000 - litre - a - day vegetarian diet .
Cities and industries will also demand more water .
Ironically , even new endeavours pursued in the cause of environmental preservation , such as producing biofuels , will place even more pressure on dwindling water supplies .
Clearly , we are heading toward a tipping point that could soon bring us to a day of reckoning when we will have literally made one too many trips to the planetary well .
Given the current rate of development , we will not be able to provide water for producers to grow enough food and sustain a healthy environment .
The only solution is to learn how to live with less water by making much better use of what we have .
Better water management is good for farmers , good for the environment and good for all of us .
We already know many of the ingredients to make this happen ; the big question is why is n't it happening ?
Trickle effect
The good news is that it does happen .
People are reaching for tools - new and old - to produce more food with less water .
Rice farmers in the region are now also saving water by a practice known as ' wet and dry ' irrigation
They are adopting more precise irrigation practices , such as drip and sprinkle irrigation .
For example , many farmers in Nepal and India now regularly use low - cost drip irrigation to grow vegetables .
In sub -Saharan Africa , just a little water - combined with improved crop varieties , fertiliser and soil management - can go a long way .
Farmers can double the yield per hectare they currently harvest , and double the amount of food produced per unit of water .
Over the last two decades in Asia , sales of pumps that allow farmers to more reliably and precisely apply water to their crops , have skyrocketed .
Rice farmers in the region are now also saving water by a practice known as " wet and dry " irrigation , rather than following the traditional practice of keeping rice fields constantly flooded .
Also , many farming communities are getting organised into associations for more effective irrigation management .
But the bad news is that change is n't happening fast enough .
For example , there are still far too many ill - maintained and poorly operated irrigation systems across Asia that use two times more water than is really needed .
In sub -Saharan Africa , the problem is not water being wasted , but the simple yet devastating issue of access .
Despite water being available in nature , many farmers routinely lack enough water to produce food to feed their families .
' Water miles '
Why is it that some areas use water so carelessly ?
One problem lies with public policies that fail to connect the interests of different user groups .
The industrialised world is quick to point its finger at agricultural producers , blaming them for water woes , but it is our food habits that drive the problem
For example , farmers may see little self - interest in being more conservative with water if the benefits flow to cities and not to them .
Although , broadly speaking , water is a precious commodity , for many users its costs are negligible , so there is no incentive to conserve .
Many countries do not invest enough in water to enable poor rural communities to grow more food .
In the US and Australia , annual per capita water storage is more than 4,000 cubic metres .
Yet in much of sub -Saharan Africa it is less than 100 cubic metres ; poor countries simply cannot afford investments in large hydraulic infrastructure .
Nonetheless , the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) and other research organisations have identified new and more affordable opportunities for low - cost water investment .
For example , resource - poor farmers can afford low - cost drip irrigation kits , whereas conventional irrigation , which costs more than $ 4,000 per hectare , is well beyond their means .
Unfortunately , while we think we know the answers , reality is more complex .
We have dramatically altered natural water systems in the quest for more water control .
Unwittingly , we have created salinity problems , dried up rivers and have caused groundwater tables to decline .
Institutions that govern water have not adapted to address these issues .
Added to this is the fact that we do n't fully understand what new water problems will result from climate change .
While we desperately need to know more about water resources , basic data and knowledge are hard to get because of a lack of investment .
The industrialised world is quick to point its finger at agricultural producers , blaming them for water woes , but it is our food habits that drive the problem .
When 50 % of food is wasted after it leaves farmers ' fields , it leads to an equivalent water waste of 50 % because wasted food is also wasted water .
Action is urgently required on several fronts : we must continue to encourage the many local actions that are having a positive impact now ; we must establish policies that create incentives for farming communities to invest in better water management ; and we must invest in the infrastructure and the knowledge systems needed to manage complex water systems for the benefit of all .
Each of us can make a difference if we first consider the water implications of our lifestyles and the " water footprint " we are leaving behind .
Dr David Molden is deputy director of research for the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Dr Molden ?
Is the world becoming an increasingly thirsty place ?
Is urgent action needed to help people use the precious resource more efficiently ?
Or will technologies like desalination plants ensure that there is enough water to go round ?
While what Dr Molden said is true and has to be taken care of , it is the industrialized nations which are wasting the maximum amount of fresh water via golf resorts , etc .
Food is necessary .
Golf resorts are not .
While we have to adopt ways to minimize water wastage during farming , I think wasting a scarce and valuable resource like water for golf , etc when water levels in earth may reach critical levels and more than one third of the world 's population is suffering from its scarcity ... is exactly not a good idea and needs to be addressed .
D Datta , USA / India
Over population is unfortunately the root of most resource scarcity problems .
Lifestyle choices and technology can help but any improvements there will quickly be overtaken by the increasing population .
The earth is right sized for 3 to 4 billion people not 7 or 8 billion .
Michael , Philadelphia , PA , USA
Not sure I fully agree with just the numbers scenario .
There are development inadequacies that compound the problem ( both in numbers and resource depletion ) .
Quite frankly - the west needs to revisit how it uses resources more than the armies of rags in poorer countries whose lives are short and brutish - with more and more population controlling factors such as HIV / AIDs .
There is nothing taboo about discussing population - but it becomes a taboo if it only is biased towards poor rural peasants in Africa , Asia and Latin America and in complete isolation from other issues as well - and in complete isolation from the west 's influence as well .
It reminds me of the HIV - African promiscuity debate .
It goes nowhere if it is not properly approached in a holistic view !
asma_756 , New York
You 've got to be kidding me .... first off , this planet does not have a water shortage , we have an idea shortage .
While I will agree that de-salination is a costly venture , it is no more expensive than setting up any other type of large volume refinery .
The main problem that is that water programs are continuing to be placed into coorporate hands .
Water is a utility , an essential service , it is owned by all .
Water should never be in the hands of a company who 's main concern is the bottom line .
J.J.Hooper , Toronto / Canada
Its the same old story , there 's too many of us !
The religeous and freemarket fundamentalists hate facing up to the truth .
Oh and before the the usual dimwits line up and tell me to volunteer to be euthanased first , the point is that we should breed a little slower because people actually die naturally .
steve johnson. , whitwick Leics .
The problem needs addressing on two fronts .
1 - We need to use our resources more efficiently .
2 - We need to reduce the number of people in the world .
Over-population is the fundamental problem that is causing our environmental woes .
Jim G , Birmingham , England
As I see it , Monty Hall of the old US TV show " Let 's Make a Deal " is offering us our choice of two curtains : behind curtain one , we can either limit populations ourselves ( as odious as that may be ) ; or , behind curtain two , we can experience global famine and resource wars ( which is surely worse ) .
There are no other curtains : imaginary deities cannot save us , nor can technology , nor can conservation , in the face of another 2.5 billion souls on this planet .
China recognized this reality and has taken harsh but prudent measures to limit the size of its population .
We in the rest of the world must do the same .
James Edward Heath , Richmond , Virginia , USA
Make a start now .
Go online to your water supplier 's website and order water saving devices for your toilet cysterns at home ( and at work ) .
They are free , save water and are simple to install .
It 's a small and easy first step .
" Be the change you want to see in the world " - Mahatma Gandhi
Chris , England and Wales , UK I find the comments on population growth yet another example of worldwide issues being someone elses problem .
Everyone wants to slow population growth , but no one would accept being denied their right to have children .
Everyone wants to slow population growth , but no one would accept being denied access to medicines and treatments that prolong their life .
Take some responsibility for your own actions and stop expecting everyone else to solve these problems !
Matt , Melbourne Water access is a good example of how well - intentioned ( or more precisely , self righteous ) activists have done enormous harm .
A properly functioning private market has consistently demonstrated itself suited both for providing water and conservation .
Alas with a rallying cry of " Water must be free ! " companies are chased out of South America and the poor are left to the mercy of corrupt municipalities in league with black market suppliers .
Jude Kirkham , Vancouver Canada
With all the shortages around the worls and the impact on food , surely the best way forward is to control the population , or is every human being afraid to put forward this common sense idea .
Paul Reeves , Birmingham , England
An interesting piece of article .
I totally agree with Dr Molden .
We need to conserve water as much as possible .
And let 's not play a blame game where developed and developing countries blame each other but rather work for effective solutions for this crisis .
Karan Bhambri , Delhi , India we now have : * soil amendment that reduce water consumption by 25 % .
They slowly dissolve and become fertilizer .
* enhanced waters that increase water bio avaiability , mitosis and reduced pathogens , more .. * together with improved soil nutrition food quality ( Brix test method ) increases * crop yield also increases , demonstrated * technology also exists to reverse and prevent scale build up in farm irrigation equipment to minimize pumping costs , descaling ..
Consultant health scientist
John Butters , Redondo Beach , CA USA I am partially agree with the solutions suggested by Dr. Molden as I believe these are all secondary solutions , the main issue is the population of the planet and we must hit the problem at the source .
At present , we are 6.1 billion people and planning to stabilize ourselves at the score of 8.5 billion .
I do not understand why population is not being focused ?
Yes , I am not against to the thought , that the water must be efficiently utilized .
Sanjay Singh
Thakur , Indore , India water scarcity is only a symptom of the single biggest problem the world faces , over - population .
even if we had enough water to satisfy food production the environmental cost of shipping that food around the world would only cause yet more problems .
personally i do n't think we 're too far off the production of soylent - green , ... at least as an animal feed .
david murphy , galway I do not want to share the world resources with another 2.5 billion .
Stop the population increase and there is more to go around .
So when the world 's breeders stop breeding I will decrease my consumption in recognition of their sacrifice .
In the meantime , it is eat , drink and be merry , because tomorrow there will be a lot more people at the party .
Andy , Wales Sometimes
Is urgent action needed ?
Of course .
We are on a finite planet with finite resources .
Desalination will only be feasible if we have access to , and an abundance of , non renewable energy sources from geopolitical secure areas .
Away from the anthropocentric popular worldview , we are a species in population overshoot .
We have been living beyond our natural means since 1980 .
From an ecological standpoint , the sad , but true fact , is , WE NEED TO DIE OFF !
We are outcompeting all other lifeforms for space and resources - not to mention changing ecosystems and displacing , or terminating species , through global warming .
By our success we have precipitated a recent species extinction rate 100 times greater than the background extinction rate .
It is time to move over and make some room .
Harsh , but true .
And yes , I am willing to rejoin the carbon cycle when called .
Mr. Ronald Brown , Phuket , Thailand I agree wholeheartedly , and want to promote desalination plants for states in the US where water can be pumped to areas that are drying out .
We have an increase in global warming increasing this problem and failed education in how to recycle water and use it effectively .
These are areas I hope we are able to correct through programs and policies in the near future .
Deena , Stamford / Connecticut , USA
It is not only water that is wasted in this world .
We waste every exploitable resource until it is gone .
The human race is now completely unsustainable .
maunu , Portland , Oregon USA
An even better ( but not mentioned ) solution would be reducing population growth !
The world can't support another 2.5 billion people without a devastating impact on the environment .
Suzanne , Melbourne , Australia Yes I agree with Dr Molden .
To use Water efficiently must be a major priority in this century .
Better and cheaper technologies for desalination should also receive more attention in our Technology and Engineering Research agendas .
Alexandra Abreu , Oeiras - PORTUGAL
Like so many problems which are caused by too many people unless we address this basic situation we will only delay problems .
We can help with water saving and better methods of using it but the seeds of conflict are already sown in the fight for water .
Just look through how many countries some important rivers flow through .

ONE finger .
The left index , to be exact .
That ’s all I was allowed to touch my partner with during last weekend ’s orgasmic meditation session at the OneTaste center in Little Italy .
“ Usually , we would have you wear rubber gloves , ” says instructor Robert Kandell , “ but since you two are dating , it ’s not necessary . ”
With that , he guides my digit directly onto the sweet spot of a beautiful young woman who asked to be called Layla in this story .
While most meditation involves sitting still and breathing deeply , orgasmic meditation ( “ OMing ” for short ) requires a partner and is a heck of a lot more intimate .
Layla had agreed to try it out , and lay on her back on a mat in front of me , unclothed from the waist down .
I sit to her right , being taught a subtle finger movement that would make Buddha himself blush .
“ Relax , ” says co-instructor Racheli Cherwitz , who along with Kandell lives at the OneTaste Center in San Francisco .
I could n’t tell if Layla or I were more nervous .
We ’re not used to having an audience .
“ Society calls orgasm the moment of climax , ” Cherwitz goes on .
“ But that ’s not necessarily the goal here . ”
If it all sounds kind of crunchy , that ’s because it is .
OneTaste is an organization founded in 2004 , with the goal of fusing spirituality and sexuality , and orgasmic meditation — something of a signature practice — is seen as a way of directly accessing spiritual energy and of breaking through the barriers around sexual contact .
The technique is practiced either in a group setting or privately between couples , and is being taught here next month in a series of workshops at the downtown center .
Layla and I lucked into a private tutorial .
Most OMing begins with an “ inventory , ” in which I ’m supposed to tell Layla exactly what her honey pot looks like .
While she ’s a stunningly good sport about accompanying me to the OMing itself , she refuses to submit to this initial step .
“ I am not used to one person being that aware of my hoo - ha , ” she tells me later , “ let alone three people staring down at it and talking about where to put your hand and how fast to rub . ”
So , skipping the inventory , we proceed directly to “ the stroke . ”
Basic
OMing is all about touching the woman , nothing else .
It was a bit strange to be pulled back to third base after hitting home runs , but the position is familiar to dozens of OneTaste members here and in SF who practice OMing every morning at 7 .
( There are advanced courses where focus shifts to the guy , but again , climax is not the goal . )
“ Remember , it ’s just the two of you having an experience together , ” says Kandell .
Indeed , after just a few minutes of OMing , I feel a most unusual sensation .
Not the kind of excitement you ’d feel if Adriana Lima and Bar Refaeli invited you to share a hot tub , but more like throwing back five shots of bourbon and then going for a fast run around the block .
It ’s a heady buzz , mixed with equal parts wooziness and intensity of focus .
Layla tells me later that she felt the same thing , and was left “ shaking like I just touched a live wire . ”
It ’s not an unusual response , according to OneTaste co-founder Nicole Daedone .
She is also visiting from SF this week to teach classes on intimacy , including one tonight in Midtown .
The next OMing course in New York begins April 25 and is included in a OneTaste membership that costs $ 300 .
“ You are dealing with the most potent energy there is , ” Daedone explains , while Layla and I sit buzzing .
“ OMing is the most the direct , clean access we have to that energy . ”
Daedone should know .
There was a time when she was OMing five times a day , and says that in the past 14 years she has instructed thousands
of students , ranging in age from 18 to 78 .
“ I understand it seems weird before you try it , ” she says .
“ But once you do , it ’s like , oh , this makes sense .
Thirty years ago , yoga was also seen as weird .
I think 30 years from now , OMing will be as common and accepted as yoga . ”
Hear that , personal trainers ?
Start flexing those index fingers !

I was dubious about Will Ferrell doing his Bush impersonation one more time on Broadway .
As we lurch through the disasters bequeathed by W.  the economy tanking , 17,000 more troops going to Afghanistan , Chrysler pleading for a total of $ 9 billion  would audiences still laugh at Ferrell ’s lovable fool of a president ?
I was wrong .
The audience for the Sunday matinee of “ You ’re Welcome America .
A Final Night with George W Bush ” howled in delight .
I asked Adam McKay , the former head writer of “ Saturday Night Live ” who directed and co-wrote the show with Ferrell , why people respond this way to one of the worst presidents ever .
“ He ’s so clearly a neglected 13 - year - old that there ’s something really kind of heartbreaking about him , ” McKay said , calling him “ a good - time Charlie ” who was “ just used his whole life to front questionable business endeavors , and in a way that ’s what his presidency was .
They are not hard to find .
Every few days brings a fresh tale of feral youths meting out random acts of violence with unfathomable intensity .
Apart from the shocking brutality , the speed with which a seemingly trivial argument or confrontation can assume murderous proportions , the stories have a common theme : the perpetrators of the violence , often in their very young teens , were high on ' skunk ' at the time .
The teenagers who killed Garry Newlove , the 47 - year - old father of three in Cheshire ?
The attack came after they had binged on alcohol and skunk .
Last month three youths were found guilty of kicking to death Mark Witherall , 47 , after he found them burgling his house in Whitstable , Kent .
The three were intoxicated by a ferocious cocktail of alcopops and cannabis .
The judge said the three had ' acted as hyenas ' .
And last week the mother of Sophie Lancaster , the 20 - year - old goth murdered by two binge - drinking teenagers , claimed the rise of skunk was now one of the biggest causes of problems among young people .
' It 's so much stronger now than normal cannabis and young people are smoking it from 9 am and thinking it's OK , ' said Sylvia Lancaster .
' I have worked with young people over a number of years and I believe that one of the biggest issues facing us is skunk . '
Suddenly , skunk - a high - strength herbal strain of cannabis - is showing the darker side of a drug that was once considered to be relatively benign .
Concerns about its links with mental illness and its ability to act as a ' gateway drug ' , leading users into addiction , have prompted a sea change in popular opinion about cannabis .
It 's a far cry from the Sixties , when cannabis - chiefly marijuana , or ' grass ' - promised to open an entire generation 's mind to new possibilities .
As Paul McCartney observed to one of his biographers : ' We 'd met people like Dylan and we got into pot , like a lot of people from our generation .
And I suppose in our way we thought this was a little more grown - up than perhaps the Scotch and Coke we 'd been into before then ... so once pot was established as part of the curriculum you started to get a bit more surreal material coming from us , a bit more abstract stuff . '
The Beatles followed earlier converts such as America 's beat poets - people like Jack Kerouac , Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs , who extolled the virtues of cannabis and helped consolidate the drug 's image as a magic door through which users could access a world of new experiences .
During the Vietnam war , dope - smoking assumed a political dimension , a sign that its users were at odds with a US government fighting an unpopular war .
Cannabis soon became a major component of the West Coast counter - culture , a facilitator of free love and a return to an almost sybaritic era .
But now the hippie dream of peace and love has turned into the nightmare of A Clockwork Orange , in which drug - fuelled youths go on a violent rampage .
' The caricature of cannabis has for years equated it with herbal tea and hippies , ' says Ben Lynam , of the UK Drug Policy Commission .
' Some people still believe that , but they are now very much among the minority . '
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is not one of that minority .
This week he is expected to reject the opinion of the government 's own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , and signal that cannabis should be reclassified from a class C to a class B drug , a spectacular U - turn from just two years ago and the first time ministers have ignored their experts since 1971 .
It means those caught in possession of cannabis could face prison sentences of up to five years , compared with two now .
But the change , for the majority of users , is likely to be cosmetic .
The police have signalled that they will still continue a policy of ' confiscate and warn ' , although persistent offenders will face tougher penalties which experts believe will see more ending up in prison .
Last year police warnings on cannabis rose 20 per cent to 120,000 , suggesting the new approach is proving popular with officers on the streets , as it frees them from the bureaucracy associated with making arrests .
Brown 's supporters insist the reclassification will send a signal to society and in particular to young people .
' We need to send a message out that drug - taking is wrong , ' says Vernon Coaker , the Home Office minister .
' It 's an illegal substance , so it 's about ensuring that we keep that message strong and powerful . '
But the shift by some is seen as Brown exerting his authority as a conviction politician , obeying his own puritanical code rather than listening to the experts .
Few in the field believe the move is justified or indeed will have any effect .
In 2006 , the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee found ' no solid evidence ' that classification had a deterrent effect on consumption .
Only 3 per cent of people polled by the mental health charity Rethink said a change in classification would deter them from smoking cannabis .
' The cost of reclassification will be more than £ 1 m , ' says Paul Corry , director of public affairs at Rethink .
' Redrafting legislation , telling the public about it and retraining police is an expensive business .
But we know reclassification wo n't reduce the numbers using cannabis , so it will be a waste of money . '
Something strange is happening on Britain 's streets : drugs have become cheaper .
A survey by the charity DrugScope , based on interviews with street dealers , reveals the price of a gram of heroin dropped from £ 46 in 2006 to £ 43 last year .
An ecstasy pill cost £ 2.40 last year compared with £ 3 the year before .
Ketamine and and crystal powder also saw price falls while the price of cocaine remained stable .
The price of cannabis , however , rose over the same period .
While an ounce of ' normal ' herbal cannabis would set you back £ 70 in 2006 , last year it would cost you £ 87 .
And the price of an ounce of the stronger strains has risen to £ 134 , up from £ 121 .
Cannabis is now a big black - market business in Britain .
While heroin is imported from the east , cocaine from South America and ecstasy from the Netherlands , much of the cannabis crop is homegrown .
Sir Stephen Lander , the head of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency warned earlier this year that large - scale cannabis factories - producing high - strength strains of the drug and run by Vietnamese and Chinese criminals - are appearing across the country .
Charities working with immigrant communities claim that in many cases the factories rely on smuggled child labour to maintain the plants .
What was a cottage industry has become an industrialised cultivation .
Growers now use state - of - the art hydroponic systems to ensure bumper crops .
' There are wide areas of the country where this is being grown commercially , ' Lander said .
' It 's not as though people are growing it in a couple of pots on their window sills . '
Soaring demand for the stronger strains of cannabis is reflected by police seizures .
The Home Office has been quietly studying the results of a survey conducted among police forces across the UK .
Early findings suggest sinsemilla - the potent herbal leafy variety of cannabis made from dried seedless female plants , of which skunk is just one of about 100 strains - accounts for 80 per cent of all cannabis seizures .
Meanwhile , seizures of cannabis resin - which back at the turn of the millennium far exceeded the number of seizures of sinsemilla - have dropped by more than a third .
This is the trend that has alarmed many health experts .
Sinsemilla contains far higher amounts of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the magic ingredient that brings euphoria .
Unpublished studies suggest the THC content of the strongest varieties of herbal cannabis has doubled over the past 10 years , from seven to 14 per cent .
Some strains of herbal cannabis - so - called ' super skunk ' - now contain as much as 46 per cent THC .
At the same time , THC levels in resin have been falling , down to an average 3.3 per cent last year .
The crucial issue dividing politicians and mental - health experts , though , is whether this polarisation of cannabis is having a deleterious effect on the nation 's mental health .
Studies suggest the new hybrid strains of cannabis such as skunk , which are believed to have originated in the West Coast of the US in the Seventies , contain extremely low levels of the anti-psychotic agent , cannabidiol , leading to claims they may be more harmful .
A study published in the British Medical Journal found those using cannabis before the age of 15 are four times as likely to develop psychotic illness by 26 .
A Lancet study in 2007 estimated that 14 per cent of 15 - to 34 - year - olds affected by schizophrenia are ill because of heavy cannabis use .
And recent analysis of 35 major studies concluded that cannabis use increased the risk of psychotic illness later in life by approximately 40 per cent and by up to 200 per cent among heavy users .
Many experts in mental health say they now have more than enough evidence to understand that cannabis is not the safe drug of popular myth .
' We have been campaigning for many years about the links between cannabis and psychiatric illness , and highlighting evidence that the drug may not only precipitate psychotic breakdown but cause long - term mental damage , ' says Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity Sane .
' The front - line experience of organisations such as ours is that use of the drug can cause harm , not only to young people but to their families , making the outcomes worse for those with mental illness and robbing young people of their motivation and future . '
Wallace accepts some of the research appears to be conflicting , but says we ignore the worst - case scenario at our peril .
' We consider that until we conduct more studies to establish the effects of the drug on developing brains and minds , the strongest signals must be given that it can be disproportionately dangerous to those who may be at most risk , ' Wallace says .
The problem for the anti-cannabis camp , however , is that cases of psychosis have actually been falling .
Research presented to the ACMD - and considered instrumental in persuading it that there is no need to reclassify cannabis - have shown incidents of schizophrenia have declined between 1996 and 2005 .
And claims that Britain is in the grip of a cannabis epidemic also look flawed .
According to government surveys , reported use of cannabis among 11 - to 15 - year - olds dropped from 13.4 per cent in 2001 to 10.1 per cent last year .
Over the same period , reported use of cannabis among 16 - to 24 - year - olds slid from 27.3 per cent to 20.9 per cent .
Significantly , the decline in reported cannabis use continued to fall after the drug was reclassified from class B to class C . ' The gentle decline is something we have seen in other countries , too , ' said Ben Lynam , of the UKDPC .
' It 's difficult to say what is driving this .
It may be that people are switching to something else , like binge - drinking . '
Likewise , the number of children who believe it is ' OK ' to do cannabis has dropped dramatically - from 17 per cent in 2003 to 9 per cent in 2006 , according to the Department of Health .
And yet you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise , given the lurid headlines about a skunk - induced orgy of violence .
' There is a media generalisation about cannabis , ' Lynam said .
' You read about people going on an all - night bender on cider but the focus in the reports is on the fact they had a spliff .
That 's not to say some people do n't achieve psychosis through a spliff - in some isolated cases that will be the case .
But it all helps to create some ridiculous image of cannabis as the evil weed . '
Talk to practically any expert in the field and though they may disagree on the relative dangers of cannabis use , they will agree on one thing : the debate about reclassification has dangerously stymied the wider debate about drugs .
Instead , experts complain the focus on whether cannabis should be class B or C has blinded the politicians to the real issue - whether classification works at all .
' It is important that policy is grounded in evidence , ' says Martin Barnes , chief executive of DrugScope and a member of the ACMD .
' But the concern is now that policy is being driven by political considerations and headlines . '
The UKDPC will issue a briefing paper to politicians next week that quotes Professor Colin Blakemore of the Science and Technology Committee .
' If it took so much effort to consider one particular drug and whether it should be placed on one side or other of a boundary , does it not imply that the entire mechanism for classifying requires a new look ? '
A small but increasingly vocal band of experts would go further and see all drugs legalised .
They say the experience of the Netherlands , where people are allowed to smoke cannabis in licensed bars , suggests legalisation does not increase usage .
And they claim it would break the links between organised crime and drugs .
As a 2004 unpublished Home Office briefing to Tony Blair suggested : ' There is a strong argument that prohibition has caused or created many of the problems associated with the use or misuse of drugs .
One option for the future would be to regulate drugs differently , through either over - the - counter sales , licensed sales or doctor 's prescription . '
But instead of the wider debate many had hoped for , the government seems to be retrenching .
In addition to getting tougher on cannabis , its long - awaited 10 - year drugs strategy is , according to experts , simply a replica of the previous strategy .
' This is all smoke and mirrors , ' said Danny Kushlick , director of Transform Drug Policy Foundation , the drugs think - tank that advocates legalisation .
' It is time for Brown and Cameron to stop the Dutch auction on who can be toughest on cannabis and begin a genuine exploration of alternatives to prohibition which costs UK taxpayers £ 2 billion to enforce and has created a drugs market worth £ 5 bn . '
That it has come to this , a furious debate about the merits of reclassification of a single drug , is a singular failure of the government , Kushlick believes .
He points out that five years ago , the Home Office select committee went as far as to debate openly the merits of opening up a comprehensive discussion on alternatives to prohibition .
A then relatively obscure Tory MP , David Cameron , backed the move while a shadow minister , Alan Duncan , supported the idea of full legalisation .
But instead , experts believe the renewed focus on cannabis has now turned the clock back , with worrying implications .
' Resources could be put to much better use educating young people and the public about the physical and mental health risks associated with cannabis - we know education , and health warnings are a cost - effective way to get results , ' said Paul Corry of Rethink .
' We urge Gordon Brown to consider the facts and do the right thing with tax payers ' money - do n't waste time tinkering around with classification - invest in drugs education . '
A decision to reclassify cannabis this week will also have repercussions across the criminal justice system and end up hitting a disproportionate number of young people , according to those working at the frontline of the drugs war .
' If you reclassify cannabis , that will put pressure on the police to bring more charges , ' said Harry Fletcher , of the probation officers ' union , Napo .
' That will put more pressure on the Crown Prosecution Service and more pressure on the courts .
You will have more people going down .
You will have more people receiving sentences because they are addicted , not because they are core criminals . '
Instead of tougher penalties , most experts would prefer the government to spend its money trying to understand the more potent forms of cannabis that are emerging on Britain 's streets .
Although the government will this week bolster its argument for the reclassification of cannabis by publishing evidence that skunk is now the strain of choice among cannabis smokers and that the average spliff contains 16 per cent THC , the jury is still out on what this means .
There is evidence that users are moderating their consumption , aware of the drug 's increased potency .
Equally there is evidence cannabis can have some positive health effects for cancer sufferers .
But despite the fact that cannabis consumption can be traced back to the Neolithic age , it is still a little understood drug .
Britain 's increasingly hardline approach seems at odds with many other countries .
There is a worldwide trend towards decriminalisation of cannabis .
Holland , Switzerland , Spain , Italy , Portugal , western Australia , the Russian federation , and some Canadian and US states have moved to civil penalties for drug possession .
Barack Obama - who said of his youthful cannabis use , ' I inhaled .
That was the point ' - has pledged to decriminalise cannabis if he becomes US president .
But in Britain experts fear the cannabis debate is simply the start of a series of skirmishes between Gordon Brown 's government and its advisers .
The Observer understands that the ACMD is soon to start looking at whether ecstasy should be reclassified from a class A drug to a class B drug .
The evidence base seems to support the move , but it seems incomprehensible , given the current febrile climate , that the government will sanction the move .
Instead it will once again defy the experts , a move that will trigger further accusations that the issue is simply a political football .
The great irony is that the debate around cannabis - the drug of choice of the flower - power generation , the narcotic which in the Sixties and Seventies promised to open people 's minds and spark a cultural revolution - is now restricting understanding .
It is not just Britain 's youth that may have been damaged by skunk .

The user : A young man 's style
William is 20 .
He began smoking cannabis at the age of 14 , at his public school in south London .
' Cannabis runs through the whole class system , ' he says .
' There was a large group of people smoking regularly by the time we were 15 , and there was a boy , a good friend , selling it in class .
By the time I was picking up regularly , when I was 16 , it was all skunk . '
Why did he start smoking ?
' To get a buzz , to have a giggle and for recreation .
Every party I went to revolved around skunk .
When you become a teenager , friends become the most important thing in your life .
I had always been the " good first son " and this was something my parents knew nothing about . '
At the height of his habit , William was smoking £ 10 - worth a day , around 12g a week .
He says it was an important factor in him losing his family .
' It gave me a shorter fuse ; my morals seemed to leave me .
We would argue all the time over the most trivial of things , but I knew it was over my smoking . '
' He became a stranger in our midst , ' William 's mother , Debra Bell , says .
' Aged 14 he was pleasant , optimistic , thoughtful .
He loved reading .
Then he became depressed , upset with himself and very upset with us . '
According to Bell , by the time William was 16 , he was refusing to go to school , would get verbally abusive and violent .
' When he started to steal from us and his brothers , that was just a huge betrayal , ' Bell recalls .
' Money , CD players and PS2 games would go missing : it was like living with a burglar .
We had to put our cash , jewellery and cheque books in a safe .
Any sense of respect had gone on both sides . '
When William was 16 , they asked him to leave home and set him up in a flat on his own .
' And all of the time there was the sense of what 's going on , is it just us ? '
Bell began keeping a diary of her experiences .
Last year she published them on a website ( talkingaboutcannabis.com ) and received hundreds of emails from parents who had been through a similar experience .
Together they formed a pressure group called Talking About Cannabis .
' There was n't an understanding about how strong skunk was and what it would mean in these crucial teenage years , ' Bell says .
' If you drop out or screw up at school you 're leaving yourself a mountain to climb . '
William scraped through his GCSEs but gave up on A - levels .
He now works in a pub and has got himself a flat in south London .
He has reduced his cannabis smoking considerably , and tries to steer clear of skunk .
His mother 's work has made him thoughtful about the effects of cannabis , and he has canvassed his friends ' opinions .
' Surprisingly , everyone accepts that it has had a negative , depressing effect on them but it varies massively from person to person .
One friend had a smoke the other day and within minutes had a paranoid episode ; he saw spiders crawling out of the lamp .
But he felt fine the next day . '

Cannabis sativa : Facts and figures
The statistics
· 2.7 million Britons aged between 16 and 59 say they smoked cannabis in the last month , making it the UK 's second favourite intoxicant after alcohol .
· In 1995 , the average number of plants seized in police raids on cannabis factories was 15 .
By 2007 , this had increased to 900 which would give an annual yield to growers of £ 300,000 .
· Sinsemilla - the potent variety of cannabis , of which skunk is just one of about 100 strains - accounts for 80 per cent of all cannabis seizures .
· Levels of THC , the major psychoactive component of cannabis , are around 3.3 per cent in resin .
THC levels in some varieties of skunk can be as high as 46 per cent
· A British Medical Journal study found those using cannabis before the age of 15 are four times more likely to develop psychotic illness by 26 .
· More than 13,000 adults and 11,000 children received treatment for the effects of cannabis abuse in the UK in 2006 - 7 .
· In 2007 , police warnings on cannabis rose 20 per cent to 120,000 .
· Use of cannabis among 11 - to 15 - year - olds dropped from 13.4 per cent in 2001 to 10.1 per cent last year .
· The Netherlands , Switzerland , Spain , Italy , Portugal , the Russian Federation , and some Australian , Canadian and US states have moved to civil penalties for drug possession .
The science
· Sinsemilla is produced through selective breeding .
Female cannabis plants are grown without a male so that the plant produces more of the crystal - coated filaments that cause the high .
· Cannabis smoke contains 483 chemicals , of which 66 are cannabinoids , unique to the drug
· The effects of the drug are felt as the cannabinoids fit on to thousands of receptor proteins in the brain .
This causes a series of commands to be relayed to the central nervous system and the body : lowering body temperature , impairing memory and movement control and releasing dopamine to the brain .
· The effects of THC take hold within seconds of inhaling cannabis smoke and are at their strongest after a few minutes .
These include fits of laughter , and enhanced audio and visual sensation .

The psychiatrist : Reefer madness
Halfway down south London 's Landor Road - notorious in recent years for teen shootings and police raids - sits Lambeth Hospital .
Dr Zerrin Atakan worked as a consultant psychiatrist at the intensive care unit here for 13 years .
Throughout the Eighties and Nineties patients came and went and came again through Lambeth Hospital 's mental health wards .
To end up in Atakan 's intensive care ward they would be in an extreme state , and were often violent .
Atakan began to observe that most of them smoked cannabis .
Psychiatric intensive care wards are locked wards but , if a patient 's mental state has stabilised , after a few weeks they are allowed out to shop for a newspaper , to see how things are going .
' Some would celebrate their freedom with a joint , ' Atakan recalled , ' and psychologically they'd be straight back to square one .
' It became such a regular situation that we 'd guess it straight away , and then it would be confirmed by urine analysis .
' What we know for a fact from epidemiological studies is that if you smoke long enough and strong enough , there is an increased risk of psychotic outcomes , ' says Atakan .
Two in every 100 frequent cannabis users will suffer schizophrenia .
' We also now know that if you happen to have psychosis and carry on smoking , your progress outcomes are worsened .
' But to be convinced that there is a direct link we have to have biological evidence . '
To her amazement Atakan found that there were hardly any studies about the links between psychosis and cannabis use .
It took her and collaborator Professor Philip McGuire 15 years to get funding and cut through the red tape to run a study .
' It was n't considered a sexy drug , ' she recalls , ' and medics ca n't buy drugs on street corners . '
But finally , using an oral cannabis medication from a government pharmacy , they are beginning to get answers .
One test Atakan ran was a response inhibition task to measure how well people stop themselves from doing something .
When people stop themselves the cortex area of the brain fires up , and in people with schizophrenia , cortex function is reduced .
This ' attenuation ' of activity is linked with paranoia or suspiciousness .
In other words we are hardwired to feel paranoid or suspicious , and our cortex has to work to keep these feelings in check .
A group of volunteers were shown a series of images of arrows .
They were asked to press a button if the arrows were horizontal - whether they pointed left or right - but to stop themselves if the arrows were at an oblique angle .
The group undertook the test twice , once following an oral dose of THC and the second time having been given a placebo .
' Activity in the cortex was quite significantly attenuated by THC [ the main psychoactive substance found in the cannabis plant ] compared to the placebo , ' says Atakan .
In other words , THC made them bad at stopping themselves .
Atakan 's team also measured the group 's psychotic state - their anxiety levels , sense of alienation , intoxication and general wellbeing .
The psychotic symptoms appeared more pronounced the less well the subjects were able to ' inhibit ' themselves , in line with THC consumption .
A current Institute of Psychiatry study has healthy adults injected intravenously with THC and observed .
It has found that THC introduces psychotic symptoms .
Paranoia is increased , as is misinterpreting the environment .
Reasoning is impaired and there is a disconnection between thinking about moving and moving , and thinking about speaking and speaking .
It seems incontrovertible that THC pushes people up the psychotic scale .
' But cannabis does n't cause psychosis in everyone , ' says Atakan .
' There are young people who smoke every day but just get mild paranoia , and when they stop smoking , that goes away too . '
Why do some people return to normal and others stay down in the dark ?
' We are at a premature stage in our knowledge .
Especially in genetic terms .
Some people think there may be a gene or combination of genes that makes you vulnerable .
I think there may be protective genes that stop certain people becoming too psychotic . '

The dealer : Growing demands
Carl works in the film industry .
He is in his early thirties and has been a chronic cannabis smoker since he was 18 .
About five years ago he ' found himself ' becoming a dealer .
' I was holding pretty regularly , and friends would smoke a lot of my stuff .
The more I smoked and gave to my friends , the more it made sense to buy a nine bar and sit on it for a month or so .
I make enough to fund my own use . '
Suppliers sell skunk in 6 kg loads which are split into 1kg bricks , then quartered into ' nine bars ' , which then provide nine single - ounce bags which are then split into eighths .
The drug often changes hands at each stage .
' Once I 've got this stuff it 's been across the country three times , ' Carl says .
The buzzer sounds and Carl lets in two of his friends , or friends of friends - skinny , pale men in their late twenties .
Len hands Carl a £ 20 note and receives an eighth of skunk in return .
We adjourn to a living room adorned with Kubrick film posters and Dalí prints .
Pete , a heavily side - whiskered musician , gets rolling : crumbling the dried skunk buds on to a net of three cigarette papers .
There is no typical ' smoke - up ' or ' blaze ' because there is no typical cannabis smoker .
Cannabis is Britain 's second favourite intoxicant after alcohol .
Doctors , down - and - outs , lawyers , criminals , police , journalists , celebrities , pen-pushers , thugs , peaceniks and traffic wardens are all among the 2.7 million or so Britons aged 16 - 59 who report having smoked in the last month .
Anecdotal evidence suggests the demand for skunk grew in the late Nineties as middle - class smokers became wary of smoking resin .
' Soap bar ' was hash resin that tripled in weight on its journey from Morocco to Britain through adulteration .
' I knew a guy who worked in a cannabis factory in Spain , ' Carl says .
' They 'd melt the resin down , throw all kinds of shit in it - coffee , aspirin , asphalt - and then add boot polish or paint for the colour . '

Sarah Palin ’s campaign against special needs children
March 20 , 2009 by twitterpaters
by twit
So Sarah Palin is turning down a large chunk of the federal stimulus money for Alaska :
The biggest single chunk of money that Palin is turning down is about $ 170 million for education , including money that would go for programs to help economically disadvantaged and special needs students .
But this is Sarah Palin , who will always impress with her capacity to turn her particular brand of heartless politics into an immediately hypocritical statement :
Obama , who made the joke Thursday night on “ The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , ” apologized .
But the remark caused an immediate stir .
Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she was “ shocked to learn ” about Obama ’s comment .
“ This was a degrading remark about our world ’s most precious and unique people , coming from the most powerful position in the world , ” Palin said , whose son , Trig , was born with Down syndrome last year .
“ These athletes overcome more challenges , discrimination and adversity than most of us ever will .
and she should know !
since she is leading the fight to add more challenge and adversity to the lives of special needs children in Alaska …
“ By the way , these athletes can outperform many of us and we should be proud of them , ” said Palin , who appeared in a video promoting this year ’s winter Special Olympics games in Boise , Idaho .
“ I hope President Obama ’s comments do not reflect how he truly feels about the special needs community . ”
I hope her heartless campaign against funding education for special needs children does n’t truly reflect how she feels about the special needs community .
But actions do speak louder than words …

Illinois Medical Marijuana Bill Passes House Committee for the First Time Ever , 4 - 3
Patients , Supporters Hail Passage as Important Step to Protecting Seriously Ill Who Use Doctor - Recommended Medical Marijuana
CONTACT : Dan Bernath , MPP assistant director of communications , 202-462-5747 ex . 2030
SPRINGFIELD , ILLINOIS —
The Illinois House Human Services Committee passed a bipartisan bill today , 4 - 3 , that would allow seriously ill patients with certain debilitating conditions who have their doctors ’ recommendations to use medical marijuana without fear of arrest .
A companion bill , SB 1381 , is sponsored by three - term former state 's attorney Sen. Bill Haine ( D - Alton ) in the Illinois Senate and is expected to receive a hearing in the Senate Public Health Committee next Tuesday .
HB 2514 , the House medical marijuana bill , is sponsored by Rep. Lou Lang ( D - Skokie ) .
Although this is n't the first time a medical marijuana bill was introduced in the Illinois House , this is the first time a House committee passed such a bill .
Advocates hope state lawmakers will note that 63 percent of Michigan voters approved a similar law last November and that a 2008 statewide poll shows 68 percent support among Illinois voters for such a law .
" Doctors need every safe , effective medicine available to them when treating patients with serious conditions such as cancer , HIV / AIDS and multiple sclerosis , " said Dr. Jay Riseman , a Springfield physician who testified before the committee today .
" I 've seen medical marijuana work for patients when nothing else did , and I should be able to recommend it to my patients without leaving them vulnerable to arrest and even jail . "
With more than 26,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

The good thing about being old is you 've lived to tell about it .
It 's an unavoidable fact of living that after a couple of decades of breathing one will have had several occasions to slip the mortal coil through one 's own stupidity , and it 's the folks who manage to tally up sheets of documented bogosity as long as a cow 's leg that owe the most debt of gratitude to the forces of the universe .
When I was in engineering school in the early 1980's they were still interested in teaching some of us about big thick wires hung from aluminum towers you needed helicopters to visit .
While my degree was to be in semiconductor physics , a discipline involving things so small everyone is sure magic is involved , I decided I wanted to learn how the other half lived .
I wanted to see the great big turbines .
The big ball bearings .
The megavolts .
The multi-Tesla magnets .
The big boy toys .
So I took an elective in power generation and distribution systems .
The nice thing about power distribution and generation was the math was absolutely trivial compared to the partial differential world of quantum physics .
All the answers involve the square root of two .
Most power systems math can be summed this way : take a really big number and multiply by the square root of two .
You can use three sometimes , but only when things are totally out of control .
Now that you know the math , you 're ready to be an engineer .
For instance , take two really thick copper wires .
Bolt them to a big piece of concrete on the floor .
Send a couple hundred amps down them at once .
The answer about what happens is something times something times the square root of two .
It 's cool to watch .
The bolts fly out of the concrete sending shrapnel everywhere .
The wires try to go to opposite ends of the universe taking the building and everything in their way with them .
The smoke fills the lab and sets off the fire alarm .
Enough ozone is created by the arcing to replenish the hole over Antarctica .
Burning is everywhere .
The professor , who has been in the teacher 's lounge the whole time , comes in and sees the lab wrecked and screams something about Lorentz .
Then he goes to work in 7 - Eleven selling Big Gulps because kids are n't supposed to be left alone with so many amps .
Why would anyone bolt big wires to concrete and shoot lots of juice down them ?
The answer is simple .
Women .
Women make boys want to burn things .
And when there 's nothing to burn , they want to blow things up .
And when there 's nothing to blow up , they make rail guns .
In our case , before our gun 's self - immolition , the projectile ( a thick aluminum bar we stole from the ceramic lab ) imbedded itself in a cinder block wall .
Despite our efforts we were not rewarded by being killed by our invention because God loved us that day .
That 's what Al said , anyway .
Then he went and became a priest .
Even with
Al out of contention , we still did n't get any dates .
Lack of women sent me to power generation lab .
In the lab they have a big machine called , the synchronous machine .
It 's basically a rotating shaft with a bunch of wire coils around it .
Some of these coils turn with the shaft , some do n't .
The ones that do n't are called stators , and the ones that do are called something else .
There are commutators in there to get electricity in and out .
Etc.
You know what you need to know .
Multiply by the square root of two .
Things spin .
Meters deflect .
You make graphs .
They give you a degree .
You go to work in nuclear power plants .
Of course , that might not happen .
Let 's say you connect the synchronous machine to three - phase 440V 60 AMP , 60 Hz power .
This may not sound like much to you , but you could run a big ride at Disney World on that alone .
So let 's say you put that juice in one synchronous machine thing and get it spinning .
Then you connect the synchronous machine to a diesel engine , just because you 're a boy and you can .
Then you crank up the engine so it 's really torquing the synchronous machine .
You can actually help the electric company supply the world .
Your electric meter runs backward and you suspect you 've just discovered a great way for the university to save money through the totally inefficient , indirect generation of power through diesel generators .
I was admiring the backward running electric meter , holding two wires in my hand .
These two wires represented one of the three phases of the 440V , 60A supply we were dealing with .
I was waiting to plug these wires into an important socket when June Eccleston came into the lab .
June was one of the few female engineers in our class and having her in the lab outside class with so few guys around gave me odds I could never have otherwise .
My mating genes engaged .
I was ready to show all my feathers .
What I did to convince her I was worthy of breeding was that while trying to get up the guts to ask her to the Devo concert I casually touched my thumbs to the bare ends of the wires , forming a circuit that went from Jersey Central Power and Light 's plant in Livingston to my left thumb to hand to arm to body to heart to arm to hand to right thumb and back into the universe of electrons generated by the power plant .
In this case , the square root of three is involved when calculating the total charge I conducted .
And then you have to consider real versus imaginary power -- where only the real power was involved in the actual cooking of me .
When I woke up my arms were frozen in a contracted position .
There was smoke coming from my shirt .
Something was burning , and it smelled like hamburger .
It turned out to be coming from the machine .
We ground up some sort of vole in there .
My lab partner was sure he saw an angel of God tearing one of the leads out of my convulsing hand .
Either that or it was the wire melting .
He ran off to become a priest .
He was out of the running for the women , but it did n't make much difference .
Instead of having me expelled , professor Rankin gave me an ' A ' for that class because I was making adequate use of the square - root - of - two key on my calculator .
My arms returned to normal after a couple of hours .
June did n't seem to care .
Later I would learn that probability of survival is something a woman looks for in a mate , and nearly frying yourself alive in front of one was unlikely to help win her heart .
The aplomb with which I absorbed electrons or survived their catastrophic propulsion earned me some noteriety .
( Actually the US Army suggested I might be a good candidate for their pulse - power conditioning lab where they generate titanic electrical pulses to run huge lasers to blast missiles out of the sky , but I never did that . )
I kept my concentration in physics where except for the poison gas , the small , non-lethal voltages would keep me out of trouble .
When you get a graduate degree in electrical engineering , the first thing people say to you is : " Hey , when are you going to come by and fix my TV ? "
After a while you get tired of telling them engineering is not TV repair .
You get tired of hearing them say , " So what good are you ? "
You start thinking the matchbook course on TV and VCR repair would have made you more popular than working for a big electronics company that does things nobody understands .
People understand when their TV works and when it does n't .
The fact you helped put satellites in orbit or put megahertz in someone 's computer pales in comparison with bringing Jerry Springer into people 's homes .
So when my mother - in - law 's TV broke , why could n't college - educated me fix it ?
I did know something about complicated TV electronics , did n't I ?
After all , physics is one thing , but TVs are God 's work .
And by the way , Bobby Sweeney from across the street fixed his mother 's TV when it broke , and he was an accountant .
If you kill yourself by sticking your wet finger on the flyback transformer of an active television set , your life insurance agent laughs at your widow and child and sends them away penniless .
So every moderately educated person knows not to do that .
Everyone who has ever opened the back of a computer monitor or television set knows how to discharge the great big capacitor that stores enough electrons to burn your aorta to a chip .
Everybody knows how to take the screwdriver and short the terminals to the case to prevent the laughing during the eulogy .
I had determined the thermally - actuated crowbar circuit in the Sony 's power supply was kicking in prematurely and shutting down the TV .
I was smart enough to figure that out .
I was smart enough to figure out which transistor was causing the problem .
Because there is n't enough college education available to humanity to help a deeply and fundamentally stupid , suicidal person , I decided to do some testing with the TV turned on , to make sure my fix was going to take .
I defeated the safety interlock that prevented one from switching the set on with the case opened .
The yellow sticker that said , " No user serviceable parts inside " was a taunt .
The little international symbol man being zapped from the sky by God only meant " sinners need not pass these sacred electronic gates " .
For I was a holy man of lightning .
Did n't they know who I was ?
Did they expect I could be demeaned by being catalogued a " user " ?
They , who invented stickers , had never met me .
I vowed the " they " who did these things would be sorry someday .
It was hot .
My home 's tiny airconditioner was n't cooling down our living room , where I had my in - law 's TV in pieces on the coffee table .
My shirt was off and I was covered in sweat .
I was holding a high - voltage probe from a fluke multimeter against a terminal of the thirty - thousand volt power supply when something made me move .
I think I was reaching for a sip of coca-cola .
Or maybe I was raising my hands to prayer , or maybe I just wanted to scratch my tongue , because the truth is that those brain cells have been char - broiled and are now rattling around in my skull like dried mexican beans .
I woke up sitting upright , wobbling from side to side .
The lights in the house were flickering .
There was a streak of red across my chest and a thin trail of smoke where the hair had been singed off .
The electricity had gone from one wet finger across my sweaty chest to the other , burning a track as it went .
When my wife came into the living room and saw me burning on the floor she said the only thing worth contributing to the world of knowledge and altruism when confronted with a self - destructive engineering idiot .
" Did you fix it ? "
It turns out I had , and so was now on par with Bobby Sweeney , the accountant TV maintenance genius from across the street .
A few days later , I met Bob in the town bar and I asked him about fixing his mother 's TV , because after all , between amateur TV repair and becoming a navy seal , it was unclear to me which was less dangerous .
He did n't remember fixing the TV .
Just that the remote needed batteries .
When a CSS or Javascript file is changed the visitor ’s browser needs to get the latest copy of the file to reflect the changes , but it will have been cached and may cause rendering or functionality issues depending on the changes .
To force reloading of the CSS and Javascript file the files should be renamed each time they are changed ; this can be automated by using PHP to add the timestamp of the file into the filename .
I ’ve posted about doing this previously using the timestamp as part of a query string , but it would appear this method has implications with proxy servers often not caching the files due to the query string .
I found that post thanks to the comments to David Walsh ’s recent post in which he suggests always writing out the timestamp to the Javascript or CSS filename .
The problem with doing that is it will force the browser to always download a copy of those files on every page request which somewhat defeats the purpose of caching .
Instead I ’ll show here how to make the filename unique based on the last time it was modified , and without having to use query strings or rename the file thanks to a little bit of .htaccess magic .
If the stylesheet is css/ main.css and the Javascript file js / common.js you can write out the appropriate tags into your page like this :
< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href= " /css/main.<? php echo filemtime ('/ path/to/css/main.css ' ) ; ?>.css " /> < script language= " javascript " src="/js/common.<?php echo filemtime ('/ path/to/js/common.js ' ) ; ?>.js " > </ script >
This will result in filenames in the HTML code like this :
/css/main.1237440708.css /js/common.1237441675.js
Now we need some rewrite rules in an .htaccess file to rewrite the time stamped version of the filenames to the actual filenames :
RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^css / main .[0-9] +.css /css/main.css [ L ]
RewriteRule ^js / common .[0-9 ]+.js /js/common.js [ L ]
Now a request for css /main .[ numbers ].css will actually result in css / main.css being served .
The above example requires a rule for every stylesheet and Javascript file but we could instead use regular expressions so any CSS or Javascript file with .[ numbers ] .
in it will be rewritten :
RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^css /(.*) .[ 0- 9]+.css /css /$ 1.css [ L ] RewriteRule ^js /(.*) .[ 0 - 9 ]+.js /js/$1.js [ L ]
And finally , both could be combined into a single rule :
RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^( css|js ) /(.*) . [ 0 - 9 ] +.(.* ) $ /$ 1/$ 2.$ 3 [ L ]
Now you can simply add any additional directory prefix into the first backeted part to apply the rules to those too .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A gold watch owned by Abraham Lincoln bears a message marking the start of the U.S. Civil War , but the president never knew of the “ secret ” inscription uncovered on Tuesday at the National Museum of American History .
The engraving , by watchmaker Jonathan Dillon , is dated April 13 , 1861 , and reads in part : “ Fort Sumpter was attacked by the rebels ” and “ thank God we have a government . ”
The museum said it agreed to open the watch to find out if the message really was there after it was contacted by the watchmaker ’s great - great - grandson , Doug Stiles of Waukegan , Illinois .
The American Civil War began when Confederate troops opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston , South Carolina , on April 12 , 1861 .
Forty - five years later , Dillon the watchmaker told The New York Times that he was repairing Lincoln ’s watch when he heard that the first shots of the Civil War had been fired .
Dillon said he unscrewed the dial of the watch and used a sharp instrument to mark the historic day on the president ’s watch .
He told the newspaper that , as far as he knew , no one had ever seen the inscription .
“ Lincoln never knew of the message he carried in his pocket , ” Brent Glass , director of the National Museum of American History said in a statement .
“ It ’s a personal side of history about an ordinary watchman being inspired to record something for posterity . ”
Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States in November 1860 .
In the leadup to the Civil War , South Carolina and six other states seceded from the Union before Lincoln ’s inauguration in March 1861 .

KENTWOOD -- Local police and federal authorities are investigating graffiti spray painted on a burned house that reads " Die Obama , " as well as similar words on two neighboring houses .

• Second fire damages Kentwood home undergoing repairs for previous blaze
The home at 4763 Summer Creek Lane was heavily damaged in a 2 a .m. blaze that fire investigators believe started in the basement .
Further investigation this morning revealed the graffiti on the homes .
The owners of all three homes are African American .
Shequillia
Hall , who lives next door to the burned home , found the graffiti on her home .
" It 's very disturbing , " said Hall , who moved to the neighborhood about 18 months ago .
" We think it 's all part of the fire , but we 're not sure . "
Fire investigators have not yet labeled the blaze suspicious , but Hall said she was interviewed today by authorities with the FBI and ATF .
James and Gloria Cutts live at the fire - damaged home .
They were not home when the fire started because their home was being renovated from smoke damage caused by an earlier oven fire , which was not suspicious .
Hall said three of her Obama election signs were stolen last year from her yard , but there have been no other incidents .

It was hailed as an archeological discovery of global importance showing , among other things , the oldest representation of Christ on the cross and proof that ancient Egyptian influences had survived deep in Roman Spain .
For traditional Basques the pictures , symbols and words found scraped onto pieces of third century pottery dug up near the town of Nanclares , in northern Spain , included miraculous evidence that their unique language of Euskara was far older than ever thought .
Eighteen months ago the dig 's director , Eliseo Gil , claimed that some finds at the Roman town known as Veleia were on par with those at Pompeii or Rome itself .
Basque nationalists bristled with pride .
This archeological jewel gave them a far greater claim to a distinctive , millennial and Christian culture than they had dreamed possible .
Now a committee of experts has revealed those jewels to be fakes .
" They are either a joke or a fraud , " said Martín Almagro , a professor in prehistory from Madrid .
" How has something like this been taken seriously for so long ? "
The hunt is on for an archeological fraudster who defaced fragments of third century pottery with fake graffiti .
The fraudster seems either to have buried the pieces or planted them in a laboratory where experts sifted through finds .
The fakes left the first people to see them swooning .
The Calvary scene was hailed as both the nearest thing mankind had to a contemporary pictorial account of the crucifixion , and proof that Basques had been relatively early Christians .
The words in Euskera , if genuine , would have predated by 700 years the previous earliest known written form of the language .
The hieroglyphics caused speculation about the existence of third century Egyptologists who might have created the inscriptions to teach children .
Now experts who have studied the pieces in depth say the fakes , some of which used modern glue , should have rung warning bells immediately .
References were found to non-existent gods , 19th - century names and even to the 17th - century philosopher Descartes .
Words in Euskara used impossible spellings .
The hieroglyphs included references to Queen Nefertiti which would have been almost impossible to make prior to the 19th century .
The Calvary scene , meanwhile , included the inscription " RIP " .
" It is a formula that can only be applied to people who are dead , " Almagro told El Correo newspaper .
" To say that Jesus Christ is dead would be a heresy .
I have n't seen anything quite so funny in the whole history of Christianity . "
Local authorities and sponsors from Basque public companies have poured hundreds of thousands of euros into excavations .
Last week they closed the dig temporarily .
Eliseo
Gil did not return calls from the Guardian but sources said those in charge were not yet fully convinced that their finds were fake .
New South Wales police have arrested a 23 - year - old man who was allegedly involved in an international art scam .
Police say he tried to sell fake pieces of artwork to at least one person for between $ 500 and $ 1,000 .
The paintings had been mass produced in China .
Officers investigating the alleged fraud arrested the man at Wamberal on the central coast last night .
They found 50 large oil paintings in his car .
Police say the fake artwork is part of a global fraud scam allegedly involving Israeli nationals , which has been operating in Europe , America and Australia for more than eight years .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A soldier who reported for duty with her children in tow has been granted her request for a discharge , her lawyer said Monday .
Lisa Pagan was recalled to the Army after being honorably discharged four years ago .
Lisa Pagan , of Davidson , North Carolina , reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning , Georgia , with her two preschool children .
She had been honorably discharged from active duty at the rank of specialist nearly four years ago but was recalled as part of the Individual Ready Reserve program .
The former Army truck driver asked for a reprieve from deployment because her husband travels for business and they would have no one to care for their children if she was sent overseas .
Until Monday , her request had been denied .
Late Monday afternoon , Pagan 's lawyer told CNN the Army would grant her request and begin the process of discharge again , this time for good .
" We are definitely heading in the right direction for Lisa and her family and her children , " said Mark Waple , Pagan 's attorney .
" She has been told by her chain of command they plan on doing everything they can within reason to do this as expeditiously as possible . "
Pagan enlisted in 2002 and was honorably discharged from active duty in June 2005 .
She was never deployed .
Before she left for Fort Benning , Pagan , 27 , told CNN affiliate WCNC that her relatives were n't able to care for her children for various reasons , including her relatives ' health .
She said her family could n't afford having her husband give up his job .
They would lose their house , she told the Charlotte , North Carolina - TV station .
" I 'm a human being .
I need to take care of my children .
They do n't have anybody else , " Pagan told WCNC .
Since September 11 , 2001 , the Army has recalled about 25,000 soldiers .
Nearly half requested a delay or a full exemption .
Some just wanted to finish their school semester before reporting .
Others had financial or medical problems that made it difficult to report for duty .
The Army says it granted nearly nine out of 10 delay requests and six out of 10 requests for exemption .

Apple has created a series of specifications for performing two - dimensional transforms via CSS , as well as animating those transforms over time .
The Safari 4 beta highlights some of these CSS - based transforms , along with Safari 's support for HTML 5's video and audio tags , in the " welcome page " that 's loaded on Safari 4 beta 's first launch .
But flying much lower under the radar is an addition to Apple 's CSS Transforms that gives web app developers some powerful 3D graphics capabilities — so long as that web app is made for an iPhone .
The WebKit team added CSS Transforms to nightly builds of WebKit back in October 2007 , transforms that included scaling , rotation , skewing , and translation in 2D space .
As the specification matured , 3D and animation capabilities were added .
Eventually , the 3D transforms were broken out into a specification of their own .
Though WebKit has had these 3D transform capabilities for some time , only Mobile Safari on the iPhone and iPod touch has them enabled .
Currently , neither Safari 3.2 , Safari 4 beta , nor WebKit nightly builds can take advantage of these advanced 3D transforms .
The 3D transforms , it should be noted , only apply to 2D elements .
However , the transforms allow a web developer to translate , scale , rotate , skew , and change the perspective of almost any DOM element in 3D space , resulting in some rather spectacular effects .
Below are two examples — provided by Apple on the Mobile section of its Safari Dev Center site — loaded in iPhone Simulator .
Though many of the 2D transforms and animations are possible to replicate with JavaScript , and Mozilla is experimenting with some JavaScript - based 3D effects , WebKit 's CSS transforms offer a serious performance advantage .
" It 's hardware accelerated , and all the timing and intervals needed for the animations are handled more efficiently by Safari itself instead of Safari's JavaScript engine , " Peter Zich , a Chicago - area developer , told Ars .
" The framerate for JS animations on the iPhone usually does n't get past 5 fps , for instance , while with CSS it is far more . "
Apple promotes these capabilities as a way for iPhone web app developers to achieve near native speed 3D effects .
So why is n't Apple bringing the technology to the desktop ?
" I talked to Vicki Murley , a Safari Tech Evangelist at Apple , about why they left 3D off of non-Mobile Safari , " Zich said .
" She said they did n't really have a reason for it ... they just had n't done it . "
A ticket in the WebKit team 's bug tracker , opened in July of 2008 , requests that the transforms be enabled in desktop builds of WebKit .
Zich would like Apple to take browser 3D even further .
" I 'm hoping they make a 3D canvas , " he said .
He 's been experimenting with the capabilities , making a simple model of a van using PNG files for the faces , which are then placed in 3D - positioned divs .
" What I 'd like to do is make something where you throw in a set of points , and it makes a 3D model , " he says .
His 3D van demo model , though , certainly opens up the imagination to the possibilities .
If you needed further evidence that Apple will never allow Flash to sully its portable Internet devices , then 3D CSS transforms are it .
Along with WebKit 's support for HTML 5's advanced media handling capabilities , advanced Nitro JavaScript engine , and CSS - based transforms and animations , Apple is readying WebKit to be the best tool for providing web - based applications on a wide variety of platforms .
Enabling the 3D capabilities on the desktop would go a long way towards generating interest in making Apple 's currently - proprietary CSS extensions into a de facto , or even official , web standard .
— A judge in Wake County said three Raleigh children need to switch from home school to public school .
Judge Ned Mangum is presiding over divorce proceeding of the children 's parents , Thomas and Venessa Mills .
Venessa Mills was in the fourth year of home schooling her children who are 10 , 11 and 12 years old .
They have tested two years above their grade levels , she said .
" We have math , reading ; we have grammar , science , music , ” Venessa Mills said .
Her lessons also have a religious slant , which the judge said was the root of the problem .
" My teaching is strictly out of the Bible , and it 's very clear .
It is very evident so I just choose to follow the Bible , ” Venessa Mills said .
In an affidavit filed Friday in the divorce case , Thomas Mills stated that he " objected to the children being removed from public school . "
He said Venessa Mills decided to home school after getting involved with Sound Doctrine church " where all children are home schooled . "
Thomas Mills also said he was " concerned about the children 's religious - based science curriculum " and that he wants " the children to be exposed to mainstream science , even if they eventually choose to believe creationism over evolution . "
In an oral ruling , Mangum said the children should go to public school .
" He was upfront and said that , ' It 's not about religion . '
But yet when it came down to his ruling and reasons why , ' He said this would be a good opportunity for the children to be tested in the beliefs that I have taught them , ' " Venessa Mills said .
All sides agree the children have thrived with home school , and Vanessa Mills thinks that should be reason enough to continue teaching at home .
" I can not sit back and allow this to happen to other home schoolers .
I do n't want it happening to my children , ” Venessa Mills said .
Mangum said he would n't talk with WRAL News Thursday about the details of the case because he has n't issued a written ruling yet .
He said he expected to sign it in a few weeks .
An estimated 71,566 students were taught at home during the 2007 - 08 school year , according to figures released by the state Division of Non-Public Education .
The enrollment amounts to about 4 percent of students ages 7 to 16 in North Carolina – students in that age range are required by state law to attend school .
About two - thirds of the schools classified themselves as religious schools .

In a surprise Sen. Judd Gregg withdrew his name from consideration to be President Obama ’s Secretary of Commerce .
Gregg cited differences with the administration on the stimulus package as a reason for his withdrawal .
In a statement Gregg said , “ However , it has become apparent during this process that this will not work for me as I have found that on issues such as the stimulus package and the Census there are irresolvable conflicts for me .
Prior to accepting this post , we had discussed these and other potential differences , but unfortunately we did not adequately focus on these concerns .
We are functioning from a different set of views on many critical items of policy .
Obviously the President requires a team that is fully supportive of all his initiatives . ”
This is a huge blow for Obama ’s idea of a bipartisan cabinet .
Apparently , the White House had little advance warning that this announcement was coming today .
Little by little , Obama is being dragged back into partisan Washington politics .
If Gregg could not support the Obama administration ’s policies , then he did the correct thing by withdrawing from consideration .
It makes one wonder if the new administration has not been too naïve in ignoring the role of partisanship in the cabinet appointment process .

Republicans are drawing the battle lines , by trying to know Obama down into the mud to brawl with them .
The GOP ’s best chance of standing up to the administration involves making issue as partisan as possible .
It is not a coincidence that Republicans thrived in the environment of the past 15 years .
They learned to win by dividing , which is what will make Obama ’s goal of national political unity so difficult to accomplish .
This is another day , when Obama ’s message on the stimulus gets knocked off the front page by more cabinet troubles .

US President George W. Bush ( R ) and Vice President Dick Cheney walk to the Rose Garden on July 10 , 2008 for Bush to sign H.R. 6304 , the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , at the White House in Washington , DC .
The bill would expand legal authority for electronic wiretaps by spy agencies and includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks .

Last week , the file cabinets at the Department of Justice rolled open .
Out came the most brazen thinking imaginable :
In the weeks after the 9/11 attacks , ultra - con lawyers said the military could blow up apartment buildings , eavesdrop on anyone and even suspend freedom of the press .
All in the name of the war on terror .
It may all sound like more of the same , another collection of the Bush - Cheney greatest hits as the White House inner circle dreamed up ways to counter the attacks .
But it 's also the latest exhibit in the case for a " truth commission " that Congress is considering to investigate the Bush era .
There are reasons to worry about the notion .
It could become a partisan piñata that Democrats exploit for attention and Republicans smack as a useless diversion .
It could end up producing a political meltdown instead of fresh take on modern history .
Or it could elucidate how this nation went from the Bill of Rights to an anti-terrorist mind set that fostered warrantless wiretaps , foreign prisons , torture and radical notions of unfettered presidential war powers .
The commission concept could well go nowhere .
President Obama - whose Blackberry is jammed with e-mails on the economy , health care , global warming and two wars - is cool to the idea .
Asked about a truth panel , he said he 's " more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards . "
His Republican foes feel just the same , seeing the commission idea as partisan payback .
The chief booster of the truth commission is Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy , the Democrat who chairs his chamber 's judiciary committee , where such legislation would likely originate .
The commission 's design is vague for now .
Leahy held a dog - and - pony hearing with invited luminaries who both praised and criticized the overall idea without getting into details .
The hearing did draw out one telling result : Strong doubts from Sen. Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican and the kind of a moderate needed to give the commission bipartisan credibility .
There is any number of directions the commission idea could head .
There could be a independent or special prosecutor , a joint panel within Congress or a blue - ribbon commission of elders .
The powers could be carefully drawn to make sure it has access to all the necessary records and inside players .
This design work is exactly where the commission will make or break itself .
Leahy needs to produce a specific plan soon .
For now he 's more interested in taking Washington 's temperature .
Properly drawn , a commission could go a long way in explaining and understanding the policies that brought discredit on this country .
It 's time to pursue the truth .
Colbert undergoes anal exam in honor of Glenn Beck David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday February 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Fox 's Glenn
Beck recently asked viewers to look in his eyes to see the truth .
Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert treated his audience to a view of an anal scope so they could see a different kind of truth .
" In the milky way of punditry , there are white dwarfs and there are flaming balls of gas , " Colbert said , introducing the segment .
" But tonight I 'm proud to announce there 's a new worm hole to a parallel world .
Glenn Beck has a new show on Fox News and it is great !
Last Monday 's show , Glenn climbed into his genius cannon and lit the fuse . "
After showing a clip of Beck asking if his viewers knew why they screamed at their television screens , Colbert suggested that they were " terrified of Glenn Beck 's crazy eyes . "
" What a master stroke of innovation ! " Colbert exclaimed .
" He 's reinvented the medium of television by melding it with the nightmares of opium addicts . "
Colbert piled on the " praise . "
" Nation , Glenn Beck is going unappreciated in his time ! " Colbert intoned .
" The world was not ready for his crazy eye closeups ... except for those parts of the world where they lick hallucinogenic frogs . "
Colbert said he agreed with Beck that it 's important to trust your gut .
" So I say forget looking into each other 's eyes , " Colbert said , " we need to look into each other 's guts and it starts tonight ! "
Orderlies dressed in blue uniforms set up a curtain on Colbert 's desk which blocked off the bottom half of his body , and a doctor went to work behind it as the phaux Comedy Central pundit struggled to deliver his lines .
A split screen showed a monitor with live video of the " internal exam . "
" We need to take a stand , " Colbert said .
" I myself wo n't be standing for days . "
Colbert concluded his segment " So , America , take a good , hard look at your gut and ask yourself how far up your own ass are you willing to go ?
Because rest assured ... rest assured , ladies and gentlemen , for me and Glenn Beck the answer is all the way ! "

Representative Lynn Woolsey ( D - CA ) is introducing a bill to Congress that would finally get junk foods out of our schools , addressing skyrocketing childhood obesity rates and bringing school nutrition standards forward 40 years .
[ social_buttons ]
“ Despite pockets of progress in some states and school systems , most schools make junk food readily available to children .
But junk food in schools helps fuel an epidemic of obesity and diabetes in children .
And , it undercuts the considerable federal investment we make in the healthy school lunch program . ” – Margo Wootan , Center for Science in the Public Interest nutrition policy director
The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act is an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 .
The amendment will have the USDA update the nutrition standards for foods sold throughout school campuses , including vending machines and school stores , and will probably be addressed as Congress looks to reauthorize the soon - to - expire Act .
Because the current federal standards only prohibit “ foods of minimal nutritional value ” in cafeterias during mealtimes , children still have access to junk foods elsewhere on campus .
The standards for those foods have not been updated since 1979 , and kids can replace or add to their school lunch with sodas , sports drinks , and candy bars , as well as low - nutrition foods such as french fries or pizza .
“ Current nutrition standards keep some junk food out of our schools but let other junk food in through the back door .
Today , doughnuts are allowed but lollipops are not .
Cookies are fine , but breath mints are banned .
This does n’t make any sense .
It undermines the federal nutrition standards for meals if students spend their money on unhealthy options .
It also undermines the role of parents who give lunch money to their children expecting them to eat something wholesome and nutritious and their money is spent on unhealthy options instead . ” – Rep. Woolsey
The bill is backed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , the National PTA , the American Dental Association , American Diabetes Association , American Dietetic Association , American Heart Association , Partnership for Prevention , Save the Children , and School Nutrition Association , and has 88 cosponsors .
“ Many of the foods being sold to our students on school grounds undermine federal investment in healthy school meals , nutrition education , and the lifelong lessons that parents teach their children about healthy eating habits , ” “ Families and local leaders have successfully advocated to remove unhealthy alternatives from some schools , but it is time for national leadership on this issue . ” – Jan Harp Domene – National PTA President
President Obama ’s proposed budget includes an increase of $ 1 billion per year for child nutrition , encompassing the WIC program and school lunch and breakfast programs .
His economic stimulus package also includes $ 100 million for upgrading school cafeteria equipment , which may help to support healthy school luch choices .

Sometimes modern design and minimalism go a little too far and it ’s hard to figure out exactly what the products are .
We ’ve tracked down 19 products that look quite cool but leave you wondering wtf ?
The Cell Tankless Toilet
Even in the most modern bathroom design , a toilet is a toilet right ?
Apparently not , which is fine with us because why should your bathroom have to revolve around the throne ?
Downplay it with the egg shaped design of the Cell Tankless Toilet .

Recycled Paper Side Table
It ’s kind of easy to call anything that could technically support a lamp and some magazines a “ side table ” which gives lots of room to minimalist designers .
The Recycled Paper Side Table by Matt Gagnon technically fits the requirement of being able to hold something on it , although until you put a lamp on it people will have no clue what it is .

Das Keyboard Ultimate
Das Keyboard was designed to be the best keyboard ever made and it provides the best tactile typing experience …
That ’s great but why does it have blank keys ?
Apparently real typists can feel their way though so silly things like marked keys are unnecessary .

Flavor of Time
It ’s been said that our most powerful sense is the sense of smell and that the scent of a fond memory can stay with you forever — like homemade cookies from when you were a kid , or the way that that she smelled the first time you kissed …
But you probably never thought you ’d be telling the time based on smell alone .
That ’s the idea behind the Flavor of Time Clock .
There are 12 different “ flavor capsules ” so each hour a different scent is exuded from the holes on the face of the clock .

End Table Bookspine Saver
As most minimalist products you might not know what this is until you see it in use .
And like the best minimalist designs , once you realize what Habitual Bedside Table is you realize it ’s really the ONLY way to design a bedside table … especially if you read a lot .

Harmony Salt & Pepper Shakers
Is that one of those new tiny speakers I ’ve heard so much about ?
Yeah , that ’s got to be it .
They ’re for your iPod right ?
This product looks way more complicated than it is … seriously , it ’s just a salt and pepper shaker .
The outer part holds pepper while the center blob holds salt .

Mondrian T Lamp
Unless it ’s on you might think this was some kind of hat rack or something .
The Mondrian T is about as simple as it gets for lighting and you get the benefit of clean lines without loads of color which is usually what comes to mind when there ’s a mention of something “ Mondrian . ”

Osorom Bench
A bench huh ?
It ’s hard to imagine something that looks like this would have a purpose , but apparently it does .
Actually the curved sides might be pretty comfortable as opposed to a hard square corner .
Although those holes all over it seem like if you sit on this thing you ’re asking for some uncomfortable snaggage .
Yeah nevermind about the Osorom Bench seeming comfortable .

So Microsoft put together an ad ( embedded below with more to come apparently ) that does what Apple started ( comparing PCs and Macs ) only from Microsoft ’s perspective .
That is , when either side plays this game , they focus on the pros of their team while pointing out the cons of the other side all while conveniently forgetting to mention their own cons .
That ’s how commercials work , you see .
By and large , Apple and Microsoft are playing the same game .
A game that Apple started , I might add .
And kudos to Apple for starting it ; it seems to have worked well for them .
But now that a strong response is out by Microsoft ( a separate tangential conversation is whether Microsoft should be throwing so much money at a “ response ” campaign ; that ’s debatable ) , the Apple fanboys are restless ( this topic was at the top of Techmeme earlier today ) and feel the need to point out the “ offense , ” “ pointlessness , ” and “ inaccuracies . ”
Wow .
Talk about a classic case of dishing out but not being able to take it .
Case in point , what was the first point of the author who wanted to explain why this was so offensive ?
In his own words , “ … she goes into the “ Mac store ” — red flag here already , anyone who is even remotely interested in a Mac knows it ’s the Apple Store … ”
I ca n’t even begin to understand what that has to do with anything remotely relevant to being offensive , but to each his own , I suppose .
Anyway , back to my original point :
When Apple ran their commercials , I did n’t feel the need to take offense or complain about inaccuracies and onesidedness .
It was a pretty good campaign .
And now Microsoft has put together a decent response by using a similar formula .
Why ca n’t we just leave it at that ?
Do we really need to get out the fine tooth comb and go through all Apple ’s ads and all Microsoft ’s ads and benchmark them against some universal neutral fairness system ( which does n’t exist ) ?

Bladderworts , carnivorous plants of the genus Utricularia , live in water or soggy soil .
To snare their snacks , bladderworts set ingenious little traps , sometimes in the hundreds , among their waterborne leaves .
The traps maintain an internal pressure lower than that outside ; when passing prey triggers an exterior hair , a trapdoor snaps open , and inflowing water carries the prey inside to be digested .
Biologists have long noted algae among the insects , nematodes , and other minute animal prey in bladderwort traps .
Are the algae symbionts ?
Are they swept in accidentally with animals ?
Or could bladderworts actually eat algae ?
To advance the debate , Marianne Peroutka of the University of Vienna and several colleagues analyzed 1,450 traps from four species of Utricularia .
More than half the traps contained algae , often unaccompanied by animal prey .
In fact , algae constituted as much as 80 percent of trap contents under certain conditions .
Intriguingly , the softer the water the plant inhabited , the more algae its bladders bore .
Soft water , low in minerals , supports less animal life than hard water does , and Peroutka thinks bladderworts may compensate for the lack of meat by eating more greens .
Indeed , some of the entrapped algae appeared semi-digested , as others have noted .
A few other carnivorous plants are known to eat plant matter , so perhaps we should start calling them omnivores .
The finding was detailed in the journal Plant Ecology .
A fossil from famous shale deposits in Canada was thought to be unremarkable , but a new study finds that it 's actually the remains of a 500 - million - year - old monster - looking predator .
The Burgess Shale ( a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia ) has yielded exceptionally well - preserved fossils that present a remarkable snapshot of Cambrian marine life from 505 million years ago .
The first fragments of the monster fossil ( a species called Hurdia victoria ) were described nearly 100 years ago , and at the time , they were thought to be part of a crustacean - like animal , and other parts were subsequently described as multiple organisms including jellyfish , sea cucumbers and other arthropods .
Now it 's clear that Hurdia was a relatively large predatory animal , possibly up to 1.5 feet ( 0.5 meter ) in length .
It had a segmented body with a head bearing a pair of spiny claws and a circular jaw structure with many teeth .
" Finding a complete fossilized animal is extremely rare .
Soft tissues tend to decay rapidly after death , and harder parts tend to disarticulate or break into pieces , often leaving very few clues as to what the original animals looked like , " said Jean - Bernard Caron of the Royal Ontario Museum , which houses many Burgess Shale fossils , including pieces of Hurdia .
A study of the fossil by Caron and his colleagues , detailed in the March 20 issue of the journal Science , sheds light on the origin of the largest group of living animals , the arthropods — a group that includes insects , crustaceans , spiders , millipedes and centipedes .
Clues to the real nature of Hurdia have been accumulating over the years as new specimens have either been collected or discovered in museum collections .
The last piece of the puzzle was found when a specimen turned up in storage cabinets at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C.
The specimen , the best - preserved of all the relevant fragments , was collected by Charles Walcott in the early 20th century .
This specimen had lain untouched for decades until researchers in the 1970s and 80s classified it first as an arthropod and then as an unusual specimen of the famous monster predator Anomalocaris .
The new description of Hurdia shows that it was actually related to this other beast .
One feature does set Hurdia apart from Anomalocaris — a unique , large , three - part shell that projects out from the front of the animal 's head .
" This structure is unlike anything seen in other fossils or living arthropods , " said Allison Daley , the team 's lead researcher from Uppsala University in Sweden , who worked on the fossils for her doctoral thesis .
" It was hard to tell whether the box - like shell structure came to lie so far forward after the animal died , or when it molted its hard parts , or if this was how it really looked when alive , " said Greg Edgecombe , a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum .
" The way the fossil is preserved made us decide that it really had this structure in front of its head , but we still do n't know what it was for . "
Daley said : " In many animals , a shell or carapace is used to protect the soft - parts of the body , as you would see in a crab or lobster , but this structure in Hurdia is empty and does not cover or protect the rest of the body .
We can only guess at what its function might have been . "
Also unknown is exactly what this mini predator would have snacked on .
" We have no direct evidence ( such as preserved gut contents or fecal matter ) as to what Hurdia would have been eating , but we can guess that as a top predator it was trying to eat anything it could catch , " Daley told LiveScience in an email .
" In the Cambrian marine environment , this could include trilobites or other arthropods , molluscs , marine worms , and even other predators . "
The Hurdia fossil also reveals details of the gills associated with the body , some of the best preserved in the fossil record .
Most of the body is covered in the gills , which were probably necessary to provide oxygen to such a large , actively swimming animal .
Hurdia and Anomalocaris are both early offshoots of the evolutionary lineage that led to the arthropods .
They reveal details of the origins of important features that define the modern arthropods , such as compound eyes and limbs with filaments used for breathing .
State Sen .
Dave Schultheis restated his opposition to a bill requiring HIV tests for pregnant women by claiming that infected babies would cause families to “ see the negative consequences of that promiscuity . ”
The Colorado Springs Republican with a penchant for foot - in - mouth moments tells The Rocky Mountain News in a follow - up story to Wednesday ’s Senate floor controversy :
“ What I ’m hoping is that , yes , that person may have AIDS , have it seriously as a baby and when they grow up , but the mother will begin to feel guilt as a result of that , ” he said .
“ The family will see the negative consequences of that promiscuity and it may make a number of people over the coming years begin to realize that there are negative consequences and maybe they should adjust their behavior . ”
Yes , Schultheis really said he is “ hoping ” people “ have AIDS , have it seriously as a baby … ”
Senate Minority Leader Josh Penry told the Rocky that “ he ’s not going to muzzle his caucus . ”
“ People are entitled to their opinions , ” the Grand Junction Republican said .
“ It ’s not my job to go around and censure people and tell them what to say . ”
This is the second controversy to erupt on the Senate floor in so many days .
Wray Greeley Republican Scott Renfroe drew fire after comparing homosexuality with murder while arguing against a bill that seeks to extend health benefits to same - sex partners of state employees .
UPDATE : The Rocky re-arranged its original story posted at 1:05 p.m. and buried Sen. Schultheis ’ controversial quote in a linked side bar .
Mark Haines Does n’t Get It
If anyone on Wall Street is wondering : what is this “ it ” that we are supposed to “ get ” ?
Is it just that people are angry ?
Could I be one of those people who do n’t “ get it ” ?
If so , how would I know ? , s/he could do worse than consider this YouTube of CNBC ’s Mark Haines interviewing Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) ( via TPM ) .
It ’s a pretty good diagnostic tool .
This is what “ not getting it ” looks like .
At about 50 seconds in , Haines says : “ You and people who share your opinions seem to feel that , you know , let ’s hold salaries on Wall Street to $ 100,000 .
Do you have any idea what Wall Street would look like if you did that ? ”
If your immediate reaction is : that ’s telling him , Mark Haines ! , then you do n’t get it .
A couple of years ago , it would have been hyperbole to suggest that we would all be better off if the senior executives at all our major financial firms were people picked entirely at random out of the phone book .
Now , it ’s arguably true .
People picked at random would , admittedly , be likely not to have been to business school .
They might not know a lot about futures or derivatives or put options .
But so what ?
At least they might have been more likely to know that they were clueless , and a few of them might have had the common sense to ask questions like : will housing prices really go up indefinitely ?
In any case , what ’s the worst they could have done ?
Bankrupted their companies with ludicrously risky gambles that fell apart once markets went south ?
Destroyed trillions of dollars in value ?
Brought the world financial system to the brink of collapse ?
Left taxpayers across the globe on the hook for trillions of dollars ?
Bankrupted entire countries ?
Oh , right .
“ Getting it ” means understanding that the entire story that some people on Wall Street have told themselves about why they got such obscene levels of compensation is false .
As a group , they were not uniquely talented .
They did not make a lot more money for their company than they earned , at least not in the long run .
Their salaries were not fair compensation for the value they produced .
It would not have been worse if they had been replaced by people chosen at random .
Look at the YouTube clip again .
Mark Haines seems astonished and baffled by Rep. Sherman ’s comments .
He acts as though he ’s dealing with some ignorant Yahoo who just does n’t see that when people on Wall Street and people on Main Street disagree , Wall Street is obviously right .
That ’s why he takes “ What do people on Main Street know about running a financial system ? ” to be such a killer response to Sherman .
A few years ago , it would have been a killer response .
Normally , it makes sense to think that people on Wall Street know more about running a financial system than people chosen at random , just as it makes sense to think that a successful director knows more about making movies than I do .
When people reach positions of prominence in a given field , it makes sense to think that their opinions about the field they work in are entitled to some deference * .
It takes a lot to completely forfeit any right to that deference .
But the people in the financial services industries have managed to pull it off .
And that ’s what Mark Haines does n’t get .
* Preemptive footnote : their opinions are entitled to “ some deference ” , not “ complete deference ” .
Imagine me talking to a successful director about what really goes on in the movie industry : I do n’t think that I should slavishly abdicate my judgment just because the director is successful , but I do think that before I go spouting off , I ought to take seriously the possibility that that director might know more than I do .
That ’s all I mean .
By Andrew Marr
Presenter , Darwin's Dangerous Idea
Andrew Marr gets to grips with Darwin's Dangerous Idea
His vast brow hangs over us all .
His foamy white beard cascades down in the familiar Michelangelo Old Testament style .
He speaks to mankind of ancient origins and end times .
In this year of his double anniversary , are we in danger of turning Charles Darwin if not into God , at least into the founder of a secular religion ?
I 'm a lapsed Presbyterian Christian .
I had a blinding revelation of disbelief at the age of around 15 .
It was every bit as clear and convincing as others describe revelations of faith .
Back then , I explained to the school chaplain that I could accept religion , but only as a metaphor - Heaven and Hell on Earth , that sort of thing .
Kindly but firmly , and rightly , he said that no , this would not be sufficient .
There 's no doubt that Darwinism , and indeed scientific truth generally , can supply people like me with some of the nourishment religion offers .
Richard Dawkins wrote an excellent book , Unweaving the Rainbow , about this .
But are n't there also dangers in trying to replace religion with a secular equivalent ?
Churches to science Late last year , during filming , I visited both the Kensington and Oxford University natural history museums .
A pair of magnificent buildings , they are startlingly and unmistakably like Christian cathedrals .
In Oxford , the delicate carvings of animals and plants entwine pillars and arches , while statues of scientists look like latter - day saints .
In London , Darwin himself presides over the nave , as Gothic , Venetian and Renaissance styles jostle round .
The cathedral - like Natural History Museum , London I 've since learned , thanks to Sir David Attenborough , that the London building by Waterhouse was always meant to mimic a cathedral .
Its founder , Richard Owen , wanted the museum to be a " temple of nature " and when it opened , it was dubbed " the animals ' Westminster Abbey " .
But where is Owen 's statue now ?
An enemy of Darwin , hustled away from the altar to make way for Charles D . Though he coined the word dinosaur and was a remarkable fellow , he is generally cast out as a disbeliever , schismatic and bad egg .
And what are most sacred objects in Kensington ?
Well , bones , of course - not saints ' bones , but bones collected by Darwin on his travels , a voyage which brings a whiff of pilgrimage to the tale .
One could go on in this fairly trivial way , and have plenty of fun with the comparison .
' Revelation ' Darwinism has its bishops and its schisms .
There are Darwin cartoon books for children , not dissimilar in tone to blandly uplifting Sunday School booklets .
More significant , though , is that Darwinism , like a religion , offers both a method and a message .
Darwinism underpins today 's acceptance of the importance of the web of life
It does not suggest prayerfulness or mantras , but it is grounded in the scientific method of observation , rigorous testing and peer group review .
It lays the groundwork for others to pick up and follow .
Hardly unique to Darwin , of course , but its steady press- ahead of revelation makes the growth of Darwinists and Darwin - admirers inevitable .
As for its message , though you can believe in evolution while being sceptical about some aspects of ecological science , and while you can be both a creationist and worried about the current state of nature , Darwinism underpins today 's acceptance of the importance of the web of life .
His work , for instance , on worms and coral reefs began to reveal the interconnectedness of apparently very distant life systems .
And that paved the way for modern environmentalism .
With the Earth going through an unprecedented rate of species extinction now - the man -made so - called " sixth great extinction " - and with the threat from climate change , these are potent and urgent questions .
To deal with the consequences , we have to turn to scientific evidence , which will be brought to us by - yes - Darwinists .
Darwin showed not only that we originated in animal nature , but he also implied that if we damage nature too severely we might bring about our premature extinction .
There may have been no Darwinist Eden but there is certainly a Hell waiting for a species that makes the worst choices .
And thus , back to my schoolboy metaphor .
A word of warning So where is the danger ?
I believe Darwin was right and that as science advances , he is proved more prescient , not less .
But religions are absolute .
They bring their truth and then repel all boarders .
They divide mankind into the saved and the ignorant damned .
In this story , there is no us and them .
Darwinism , as I take it , is a creed of observation , fact , a deep modesty about conclusions and lifelong readiness to be proved wrong .
I do n't say it offers everything that religion can .
But I do say that , in this respect , it is better .
However we celebrate the old man , we must n't let his work crust into creed or harden to dogma .
Darwin's Dangerous Idea , presented by Andrew Marr , is on Thursdays at 2100 GMT on BBC Two from 5 March .

A Massachusetts woman has appeared in court on a domestic assault and battery rap after allegedly attempting to impregnate her wife with a plastic syringe containing her brother 's sperm .
Stephanie K Lighten , 26 , of Pittsfield , was reportedly “ all liquored up ” when she made unwelcome advances towards her other half , 33 - year - old Jennifer Lighten .
Jennifer explained to officers that Stephanie " had been talking about trying to impregnate her for some time " , and that she 'd accordingly armed herself with a " turkey baster and her brother ’s semen in a sealed container " .
The turkey baster was actually a " large syringe with a catheter tip " , Lez Get Real clarifies , but whatever the implement in question , Jennifer told her partner " she did n’t want to get pregnant " .
Things at this point allegedly took a turn for the worse , as Stephanie " threw Jennifer on the couch , grabbed at her clothes and threatened to impregnate her " .
Lez Get Real continues : " Jennifer broke free , ran into the bathroom and locked the door .
When Stephanie broke the bathroom door down , she hurt her wrist in the process , and Jennifer escaped when Stephanie went to get an ice pack from the freezer .
" Jennifer attempted to get away in the couple ’s SUV and as she tried to pull away , Stephanie jumped on the side of car and made Jennifer stop . "
Cue cops and a cuffing for the " intoxicated " Stephanie .
Police confiscated the syringe " plus a container of semen and some aluminum foil , which was originally was used to hold the semen " .
Officers apparently confirmed the sperm was donated by Stephanie 's bruv , Nicholas Lighten .
Jennifer Lighten decided not to press a charge of assault with intent to rape , because " she did not believe Stephanie was going to sexually assault her with the syringe " .
Stephanie denied the remaining domestic assault and battery charge in Central Berkshire District Court .
Judge Rita S Koenigs advised her to “ refrain from abuse ” , before releasing her on personal recognisance .
Stephanie Lighten is scheduled to appear in in court on 29 April for a pre-trial hearing , while her MySpace page is now " set to private " . ®
It is billed as the largest ever gathering of climate change deniers , a convention that kicked off last night with a title suggesting global warming is a thing of the past , and a guest list that includes a hurricane forecaster , a retired astronaut and a sitting European president .
Entitled Global Warming : Was It Ever Really a Crisis ? and featuring some of the most prominent naysayers in the climate change debate , this week 's conference in New York sets out to escalate its confrontation with the scientific establishment , the vast majority of whose members subscribe to the view that humans are the principal cause of climate change .
Conference organisers were celebrating something of a coup in securing as a keynote speaker the Czech president , Václav Klaus , at a time when his country holds the rotating presidency of the EU .
Klaus , a Eurosceptic , believes that efforts to protect the world from the impact of climate change are an assault on freedom .
In his remarks last night , Klaus accused European governments of being " alarmist " on the subject of climate change and in thrall to radical environmentalists .
" They probably do not want to reveal their true plans and ambitions to stop economic development and return mankind several centuries back , " he said .
He received a standing ovation .
But Klaus admitted that his position was a lonely one .
" It is evident that the climate change debate has not made any detectable progress , " he said .
" It reminds me of the frustration people like me felt in the communist era . "
This week 's gathering by the Heartland Institute , a Chicago thinktank that shares the Czech president 's free - market views , brings together some of the more vocal critics of the scientific consensus , which maintains that rising temperatures are now so dangerous to people 's existence as to warrant urgent action .
Among more than 70 participants listed by the Heartland Institute is Jack Schmitt , a former astronaut , who now teaches engineering physics .
William Gray , who is regarded as a leading hurricane forecaster , is also listed , along with Fred Singer , the atmospheric physicist who argues that a melting Arctic would have some positive effects , including the formation of the long - sought north - west passage .
There is also a strong contingent of free marketeers and conservative commentators , including Christopher Booker and Christopher Monckton , both British .
Environmentalists argue that climate change denial , although the view of a minority , has damaged efforts to introduce policies to address the changes .
Kert Davies , research director for Greenpeace , says the climate change deniers have been adept at adapting their views as the public grows more conscious of the dangers of global warming .
The deniers also have resources .
The Centre for Public Integrity said in a report last month that the lobby opposing climate change action gave work to 2,430 Washington lobbyists in 2008 .
The report estimated that about 15 % of Washington 's lobbyists were now working to try to stop Congress from passing a law putting a cap on carbon .
" They are on the fringes - when you look at where the public is on this issue , where governments are on this issue , and where scientific organisations are on this issue , " said Kevin Grandia , the manager of DeSmogBlog , which seeks to counter misinformation on global warming .
" The problem is when you take that fringe and add in the public relations ability to amplify that message .
They have ingrained their message so well ... it can easily be used as a tool to oppose legislation . "
Opinion polls show that about 58 % of Americans believe human activity is causing climate change .
However , many do not see a need for urgent action .
A poll by the Pew Research Centre this year showed that climate change ranked last among topics of public concern to Americans .
The Heartland Institute was funded by Exxon Mobil until 2006 .
It disavows such links for this conference , but lists 55 sponsors , some of which do receive funding from Exxon and rightwing thinktanks .
How we deal with climate change : denial
Academics meeting in Bristol at the weekend for Britain 's first conference on the psychology of climate change argued that the greatest obstacles to action are not technical , economic or political - they are the denial strategies that we adopt to protect ourselves from unwelcome information .
Nearly 80 % of people claim to be concerned about climate change , but many people have a tendency to define this concern in ways that keep it far away .
They describe climate change as a global problem ( not a local one ) and as a future problem ( not one for their lifetimes ) .
And 60 % of people believe that " many scientific experts still question if humans are contributing to climate change " while 30 % believe climate change is " largely down to natural causes " .
Seven per cent deny climate is changing at all .

How To : Start A Container Garden
Page 1 of 2
Food prices are rising just as our paychecks are shrinking , and the food we can afford is often tainted with a host of exotic toxins .
It ’s a nasty scenario that has many people taking food matters into their own hands .
You do n’t need a 40 - acre spread to join this growing growing trend .
It ’s called “ container gardening , ” and it lets anyone with a few feet of sunny floor space , some soil and a few spare containers grow everything from tomatoes and carrots to onions and eggplants — all of it basically cost - ( and salmonella - ) free !
It ’s easier than you ’d think , especially if you follow AM ’s how - to guide .
What you ’ll need
Containers
When choosing what kinds of containers to use , consider your budget , what you ’ll be growing and where you ’ll be growing it .
Shallow rooting crops like onions or herbs need small containers in the 6 - to 10 - inch range .
But succulent vegetables like tomatoes and peppers send out long , thirsty roots that necessitate at least a five - gallon container — approximately the size of an office water cooler bottle .
Plastic containers are the cheapest .
Wood containers can contain preservatives like creosote that leech into your soil and turn healthy crops into chemical - saturated death bombs , while ceramic pots are the best , and most expensive , by far .
Ensure that whatever containers you choose offer appropriate drainage .
If there are no drainage holes , layer two inches of clean gravel along the bottom .
Without adequate drainage , your crops will die a slow death as the soil becomes waterlogged and the roots drown in a layer of anaerobic muck .
Growing mediums
Your soil needs to drain properly and retain enough moisture to feed the plants .
Use potting soil mixed with “ synthetic ” material like sawdust or wood chips .
Some gardeners will bake their soil in the oven for an hour to kill bacteria or fungus , and fill their apartments with the earthy aroma of cooked dirt .
If you buy bags of potting soil there ’s no need to bake it .
Fill your containers with dirt to 2 to 3 inches below the brim to allow for watering .
Space
What you can grow , and how much of it , will be determined by how much space you can devote .
Map out your growing areas before you buy containers .
Hanging baskets and window boxes can turn dead space into productive space for herbs and small pots in a snap .
Most vegetables need at least five hours of direct sun a day .
If your dungeon - like condo wo n’t allow this , consider leafy crops like cabbage , which are more shade tolerant than sun-gluttons like tomatoes or cucumbers .

WASHINGTON --
The peanut - processing company at the center of a salmonella outbreak had a history of salmonella contamination , but the top executive , concerned about losing money , told employees to ship suspect products anyway , lawmakers said at a congressional hearing Wednesday .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee 's investigations panel heard testimony from victims ' families , federal and state officials and private laboratories that had done testing for Peanut Corp. of America , the company accused of shipping peanut products it knew were contaminated .
Peanut Corp. President Stewart Parnell , and the manager of the Blakely , Ga. , plant to which the outbreak has been traced , Sammy Lightsey , refused to answer questions , invoking their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves .
Meanwhile , Ohio health officials reported another death linked to the outbreak , bringing the number of deaths to nine .
In addition , at least 600 people in 44 states have been sickened , and nearly 2,000 products containing peanuts -- from bulk peanut butter sold to schools and nursing homes , to ice cream , cookies , crackers and granola bars -- have been recalled .
Internal company emails released by the House committee Wednesday showed that Mr. Parnell told the plant manager , Mr. Lightsey , to " turn them loose " after being informed that some products had tested positive for salmonella .
" We need to protect ourselves and the problem is that the tests absolutely give us no protection , just an indication at best , " Mr. Parnell wrote to Mr. Lightsey in an Oct. 6 , 2008 , email after he was told of lab tests that came back positive for salmonella .
" We need to discuss this , " Mr. Parnell told Mr. Lightsey in the email .
" The time lapse , besides the cost is costing us huge $ $ $ $$ and causing obviously a huge lapse in time from the time we pick up peanuts until the time we can invoice . "
Irish Writers ' Centre Gets Its Funding Cut ; Booker Prize Winners Protest
" Lack of money is the root of all evil . " -- George Bernard ShawThe Arts Council of Ireland has decided to cut all funding to the Irish Writers ' Centre , causing stirring speeches all across the Emerald Isle .
The speeches have led to thousands of drunken and indignant punches thrown at crass youth , followed by sobbing confessions to faithless spouses late at night , confessions crowned by mechanically - distant sex acts , and then fitful dreams of past glory , past love , and past youth .
Irish writers across the globe have joined in condemning the Arts Council 's decision .
Booker Prize winners such as Anne Enright , Roddy Doyle , and Anne Enright have all said " What the fuck , " in addition to American expatriates such as Richard Ford .
These Irish writers have created a petition calling for a reversal , saying , in no uncertain terms :
You can add your voice to the outraged din by signing the petition here .
The government gives the Irish Writers ' Centre 200,000 pounds a year .
The Centre uses this money to pay the electric bill , buy crates of Ramen , and pay precisely four employees , two of whom will now be fired .
Next door to the Irish Writers ' Centre is the Dublin Writers Museum , and underneath both buildings is the Chapter One restaurant .
The Irish Writers ' Centre is famous as a venue for literary readings and as a place where poets can sleep when they are between " big scores .
" According to its official mission statement , the Centre exists in Dublin " to maintain Ireland 's position in World literature . "
Duties include calling up - and - coming young novelists from other countries in the middle of the night and reading threatening limericks , organizing Dublin 's Bloomsday , and mailing other countries huge , rotten bags of sheep shit every time one of their writers wins the Nobel Prize .
According to the Guardian , the Centre will try and raise money through benefit nights and creative writing courses , and employees there who currently exist in paid positions will keep working there on a voluntary basis until things are stabilized .
There is a tradition about writers in Ireland .
When they are not respected , they use their talents to whip up the people into a poetic frenzy leading to murder , revolution , and the arbitrary redistribution of wealth .
Keeping Irish writers happy is not just a nice gesture for the Republic : cynically , it is a gesture of political expedience that ought not to be stopped , lest the repercussions be bloody and dramatic , precisely the sort of thing that will be so much fun to read about in the future , but will not be much fun for for people in charge right now .
Just give the Centre its money back .
Raise taxes , or something .

When a reporter at the New York Times made a little mistake in an article about Boron , Conan O’Brien was furious .
On his show , Late Night , he launched into a hilarious rant about the fifth element .
Last Monday , Kenneth Chang described a new type of Boron crystal that was discovered by Artem Oganov and his team of geoscientists .
But the seasoned science journalist got one detail wrong :
Including the newly discovered substance , the element can take on four different forms , but Chang had incorrectly stated that there are only three .
" Dr. Oganov informed me of my mistake Monday evening , a few hours after the science section went to press , " said Chang on the Tierney Lab blog .
" The Web version of the story was quickly fixed , and everyone who read the story on nytimes.com last Tuesday got the correct boron news . "
But the error made its way into the printed newspaper , and The Times quickly issued a correction .
That modest announcement sparked a hilarious reprimand on late night television — in the form of a lecture by Professor O’Brien .
Chang wondered if there will be more science lessons when O’Brien takes over as host of The Tonight Show .
I sure hope so — unless it ’s at my expense .

How to Get Your Family out of a Financial Crisis
opportunity and prosperity .
Steps
1. Announce a Family Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump - start job creation and long - term growth .
Since the reason you are in trouble is that a job has been lost , you need to get a job , or better yet , two or three jobs .
Only by having jobs in the family can you get yourself back up on your feet .
But how are you going to get those jobs when no one is hiring ?
There is an easy answer .
2. Create jobs by hiring your family members .
Just go out and do it .
But what , you ask , are you going to hire them to do ?
And what are you going to use for money ?
The trick is to kill two birds with one stone , by putting your house into better shape at the same time as you create those jobs .
3 . Pay your children to fix up your house .
Hopefully you have a few children .
The more the merrier .
Pay one of them to paint the house green .
Pay one to put new sod down on your tired lawn .
Pay another one to renovate the kitchen .
Wo n't it be grand to have that nice granite countertop you have always dreamed of ?
Now is the time !
Since the entire family is in a terrible crisis , everyone will go along with your plan , and support it , no questions asked .
Just tell them that because you are creating so many great new jobs , there will be gobs of money later .
Possibly not this year , but by next year , things are really going to turn around and you will be in the pink .
Certain luxuries were out of your reach before , but why should n't you get a few goodies out of this family crisis ?
Put a little weatherstripping in the mudroom and get a high def TV while you are at it .
4 . Go to the bank and borrow a few hundred thousand dollars .
You are going to be using this money to pay salaries to your children .
Yes , it is really that simple .
When you are in a terrible financial crisis , the answer is to borrow a huge amount of money .
Now is not the time to worry about going into debt .
Borrow three hundred thousand dollars .
See how easy that is ?
Now you can pay them one hundred thousand dollars each .
Your whole family will instantly go from being down and out , to living on easy street .
It is time to set a new course for this family , and that change must begin now .
Do n't forget to set aside a very small portion of the money to buy a few condoms for your children .
Especially if your wife Nancy thinks it 's a good idea .
5 . Rest in the assurance that you have taken the wisest steps towards recovery .
Starting with little to no cash , you pulled your whole family up by their bootstraps .
You created jobs and wealth , just by sprucing up and renovating your house !
After working this kind of magic , you will be back on top of the world !
Tips
* If your family members are dragging their feet and do n't want to go along with you , just have a nice breakfast with all of them and get them on board with your plan .
What you need is unity and bipartisanship .
If they still disagree with your scheme , then say very sternly and ominously " Now , I do n't believe it 's too late to change course , but it will be if we do n't take dramatic action as soon as possible .
If nothing is done , this situation could linger for years . "
* Avoid getting any loan with interest payments attached .
Interest only adds to the amount you will have to pay back at some later time .
Interest could add another hundred thousand dollars to your debt and you would find yourself owing almost half a million dollars .
Do n't sign up for that .
Well , unless you have to , that is .
Interest - free loans do n't float in on the wind .
* If a bank wo n't deal with you , borrow the money from a really rich country .
China , for example .
They have a bunch of money because they keep taxes really low and they have all the jobs , including the one you just lost .
* If your kids worry that they will get stuck with the bill a few decades from now , tell them you have no choice .
You are forced to borrow the money .
It is the only way out of the crisis .
Remind your children that " This crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the business cycle , and we wo n't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on the worn - out dogmas of the past . "
* Besides , you can always charge them a very high percentage of their income as room - and - board money later so that you will have plenty of money for your loan payments .
It is even better if you think ahead and pay one of your kids more than the other kids .
That kid will be the rich kid in the family .
Just make the rich kid pay all the room - and - board money .
The poor kids should n't have to pay anything at all even if you do take care of their every need .
But you can give them a room - and - board credit , which will make everyone in the whole family feel very compassionate .
Except for the rich kid , that is .
But he will feel very patriotic !
* It 's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility .
It is time to finally change the ways of your family so that you can set a new and better course .
Warnings
* Since you are in a dire emergency , you have to take action right away , or things could get much , much worse .
You are in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime .
* Remind your family that there is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable .
It will certainly add to the family budget deficit in the short term .
But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all , for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs , incomes and confidence in the financial situation of your family .
* If your kids are worried that their kids ( your grandkids ) are going to have to repay all that money one day , plus a shedload of interest , remind them that they are not going to have children !
And that is the beauty of your brilliant Family Recovery and Reinvestment Plan .
It is horribly expensive , but you are never going to have to pay the money back , and since you wo n't have any grandchildren , they wo n't have to pay either .
And that 's why Nancy wanted you to buy those condoms .

A fascinating convergence is upon us right now bringing a perfect opportunity for open - minded journalists .
Sadly , many mainstream media outlets are reducing their staff journalists .
Newspapers , magazines , radio , and television outlets are facing tough economic challenges and unfortunately that means that many talented reporters and editors have been ( or will be ) laid off .
I ’ve had a chance to speak with several dozen journalists over the past few months and many are downcast about career prospects .
At the same time , many organizations -- corporations , nonprofits , government agencies , and educational institutions -- finally understand the value of what I call " brand journalism , " creating interesting information online that serves to educate and inform consumers .
People in companies now realize web marketing success comes from creating content - rich web sites , videos , podcasts , photos , charts , ebooks , white papers and other valuable content .
However , many of the companies I speak with are trying to figure out who will create the content that they need for their online initiatives .
Marketers , executives , and entrepreneurs say things like : " David , I need help .
If I knew how to create great content , I ’d already be doing it . "
At every speech I deliver I say to corporations one of the best ways to create great Web content is to actually hire a journalist , either full - or part - time , to create it .
Journalists , both print and broadcast , are great at understanding an audience and creating content that buyers want to consume — it ’s the bread and butter of their skill set .
What this convergence means to you , a smart journalist :
You went to J - school to learn how to tell a story in words and images .
Yes , the employers who traditionally hired your skills are shrinking fast .
But there is an entirely new world out there for you to consider .
Please keep an open mind about this .
I ’m not talking about PR and media relations here .
This is n't about writing press releases and trying to get your former colleagues to write or broadcast about you .
Instead , I 'm talking about creating stories as you are now , but for a corporation , government agency , nonprofit , or educational institution instead .
You 've probably not seriously considered that there are potential employers outside of media companies .
Yes , there are new potential employers .
And they need you and your skills .
Now .
You 've learned that you need to look at all sides of a story .
You wonder how can you be balanced if you work for the " dark side . "
I get that .
I worked along side Pulitzer Prize winners at the late , great Knight - Ridder for six years myself so I understand .
But if you realize that your skills are in demand right now , you ’ve got a new and fascinating opportunity .
You do n't need to compromise your integrity .
You still tell stories .
You still practice your craft .
You still have followers who care about what you do .
You still change people 's lives .
Please realize that I am not advocating the old - school " advertorial " model .
Advertorials such as those late - night cable TV shows about a product or the full - page product information " reports " found in trade journals is not what I 'm talking about here .
The idea of using your journalistic skills should be to educate and inform , not to overtly sell products .
While some of you would rather wait tables than work for " the man , " others of you will find the opportunity refreshing .
It may even make you more marketable for traditional gigs with publications , as long as you continue to create quality content while pioneering this new form of corporate journalism .
Consider Ben Edwards who went from Tokyo Bureau Chief of The Economist to director , new media communications at IBM and back again to publisher of Economist.com .
If you are a broadcast journalist , you could find a gig like Kathy Saenz landed .
Kathy is a former TV reporter for WFTX - TV , the Fox affiliate in Ft Myers , Florida , turned marketer and corporate communications manager at Neighborhood America .
Editors are in demand by companies that create terrific online media rooms such as Cisco Systems .
You could find yourself running the online media efforts of a billion dollar company .
Is running the Cisco news room really that much different than running a newspaper Web site ?
Sure , Web marketing represents a dramatically different job description from , say , beat reporter .
But is worth considering .
What do you think ?
Are you a journalist looking for work ?
Are you working in an organization that needs to hire the skills of a journalist ?
A new study reveals that humans use different neural mechanisms for determining criminal responsibility and assigning an appropriate punishment .
The research , published by Cell Press in the December 11th issue of the journal Neuron , provides fascinating insight into brain systems that may explain how thousands of years of reliance on human sanctions to enforce social norms gave rise to our current criminal justice system .
Impartial " third - party " decision making is used in our legal system for assessing responsibility and determining an appropriate punishment .
" Despite its critical utility in facilitating prosocial behavior and maintaining social order , little is known about the origins of , and neural mechanisms underlying , our ability to make third - party legal decisions , " offers co-senior study authors Dr. René Marois , a neuroscientist from the Department of Psychology , and Owen Jones , a professor of Law and Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee .
To explore the neural mechanisms associated with these processes , Marois and Jones , along with graduate neuroscience student Joshua Buckholtz , used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan subjects while they made decisions about appropriate punishments for crime scenarios that varied both in perpetrator responsibility and crime severity .
The researchers found that activity within key brain regions associated with social and emotional processing tracked punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios .
" These results accord well with prior work pointing to social and emotional influences on economic decision making and moral reasoning and provide preliminary neurobiological support for a proposed role of emotions in legal decision making , " explains Dr. Marois .
Interestingly , activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( rDLPFC ) appeared to play a key role in deciding whether or not to punish perpetrators on the basis of criminal responsibility .
Previous work implicated rDLPFC activity in a second - party punishment system , such as when subjects decide whether or not to punish a partner by rejecting an unfair economic deal proposed by that partner .
These results suggest that a common neural mechanism may be involved in punishing unfair economic behavior in a two - party interaction and deciding whether or not to punish someone based on an assessment of criminal responsibility in a third - party interaction .
" On the basis of the convergence between neural circuitry mediating second - party norm enforcement and impartial third - party punishment , we conjecture that our modern legal system may have arisen by building on preexisting cognitive mechanisms that support fairness - related behaviors in two - party interactions , " suggests Professor Jones .

Last week , I talked about setting up a dynamic personal web page on Google AppEngine .
I mentioned that it would be possible to grow and expand your page beyond the simplistic informational page I have shown you .
More specifically , I mentioned running blogs and forums out of it .
I already described how to set up a AppEngine based forum so there is no need to reiterate that here .
Today I wanted to talk about running your own blog on top of the service .
No , I do n’t expect you to write your own blog software , just like you did n’t have to write the forum software .
Believe it or not , but blogging engines are being ported to or designed this platform .
One of such engines is Bloog written and maintained by Bill Katz .
As far as I can tell , it is one of the first Blog software that runs on AppEngine but there will be more to come – I ’m sure of it .
Bloog may not be the most sophisticated blogging platform , or the most configurable one – it ’s not WordPress .
But it is fully functional and it has everything you may need for day to day blogging .
It supports reader comments , tagging , has a dynamic contact form , dynamic archives by year , it automatically generates an Atom feed and the template is pre-configured to allow you including vertical add banners in the sidebar .
No bells and whistles mind you , but solid functionality .
Bloog is on GitHub and you probably are best off pulling the source code from there .
If you are a bit old fashioned like me , and you have n’t caught the git bug yet , the GitHub has a wonderful feature that will allow you to download all of the source code from the repository with a single mouse click as either a zip file or a tarball .
Unfortunately if you do that , you will get an incomplete version of the code .
I have n’t really used git , so maybe someone with more experience can verify if what I ’m saying is correct .
From what I ’ve seen , if you are using git , you can set up something akin to symlinks that point to other projects on GitHub .
When you check the code out , git will notice the dependency , and follow the link to download the latest and greatest code for it from it ’s own repository and put it in the correct directory in your project .
This is very neat , but unfortunately it breaks down when you use the “ download code as a tarball ” feature .
The “ foreign ” code is not fetched , so you end up with empty directories where it was supposed to be .
Bloog depends on Firepython which should be in the utils / external / firepython / directory .
But it ’s not and you will probably spend few minutes scratching your head to figure it out .
Fortunately I stumbled upon this discussion to help me out .
Essentially , what you have to do , is to grab Firepython a tarball , and extract it into utils / external / firepython / in your Bloog directory .
After you do that , you are ready to go .
Here is how my Bloog turned out :
There administration UI is vestigial , so to change things such as the blog title , author and the sidebar links you need to manually edit config .py in the root directory of your project .
It ’s actually very straightforward – just a long associative list .
There is nothing to it , and even someone with no knowledge of Python should be able to do it .
The sidebar banner ( I changed it to that liquid drip thing just to show you it ’s possible ) is defined in a static HTML file located in \views\default\bloog\ads .
html .
Just delete whatever was there and insert your own personalized vertical banner or add block .
Once you do that , you can just deploy it to Google AppEngine and enjoy your own little blog .
That ’s really all there is to it .
They could make it easier to install , but really the Firepython thing is my fault .
If I used git , it would probably never happen .
There you go – yet another awesome thing you can do with Google Apps .
You can blog on it , run discussion forums , create personal pages – possibilities are endless .
When it first came out , a lot of people discarded it as a mere toy but it ’s not .
It is a glimpse of what cloud computing can do for you these days !
It is a glimpse of how a lot of hosting might be done in the future .
Of course , standard disclaimers apply – you are hosting your shit on Google ’s cloud for free which means you do n’t really own it .
And since it ’s google , it will probably harvest your blog for data which it will use maliciously in it ’s quest o achieve sentience .
So you have to factor that into the equation when you are deciding whether or not you want to use this service .
Arguably , in this day and age there are dozens of free blogging platforms out there .
Most of them will let you use your own domain name too .
So running a blog on AppEngine is probably not the most efficient way to go about blogging .
Bu it is kindoff awesome – and you can hack python code and you are not afraid to get your hands dirty you do get much more control over how your blog looks and what it does than with one of these free services .
I would n’t probably recommend running your “ mission critical ” blog on this platform .
But for AppEngine enthusiasts like me , Bloog is yet another fun app to mess around with .
Lawyer seeks to prosecute Bush for torture , bar him from Canada Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Even out of power and away from the White House , former President George W. Bush seemingly cannot get away from calls for his prosecution .
The latest outcry comes from a Canadian attorney with Lawyers Against the War , who said she will file a suit against Bush and bar his entry to Canada over alleged war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Former President Bush plans a visit to Canada on March 17 for a speaking engagement at Calgary , on invite from the city 's chamber of commerce .
" In a letter to the [ Royal Canadian Mounted Police ] war crimes section and copied to Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff and other federal ministers and opposition MPs , the Lawyers Against the War group claims that Bush is ' inadmissible to Canada . . . because of overwhelming evidence that he has committed , outside Canada , torture and other offences ' as detailed in Canada 's War Crimes Act , " reported Canada.com .
The letter ( PDF link ) asks the mounted police to " begin an investigation of George W. Bush for aiding , abetting and counseling torture between November 13 , 2001 and November 2008 at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba , Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , Bagram prison in Afghanistan and other places . "
" The letter also alleges that Bush has engaged in ' systematic or gross human rights violations , or a war crime or a crime against humanity ' under subsections 6 ( 3 ) to 6 ( 5 ) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act , " reported Straight.com .
Lawyers Against the War has been pursuing similar tactics for years .
The group 's Web site , which appears to have not been updated in the last five years , carries prior letters the organization has posted to Canadian officials .
" Surely you are aware of the many grave crimes against humanity and war crimes for which President Bush stands properly accused by the world , starting with the Nuremberg Tribunal 's ' supreme international crime ' of waging an aggressive war against Iraq in defiance of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , " begins a letter to then Prime Minister Paul Martin , written in 2004 .
" As recently as November 16 , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and former war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour called for an investigation into crimes against the Geneva Conventions in the assault by US forces on the densely populated city of Fallujah , " the author notes .
" The federal government is keeping silent on the upcoming visit , " reported Canadian magazine See .
" ' We have no comments to offer on the visit of Mr. George W. Bush to Calgary , ' said Foreign Affairs spokesperson Alain Cacchione in an e-mail .
When told about Davidson 's letter , a spokesperson with the Canadian Border Services Agency said 'we would n't comment on something like that . ' "
" [ Lawyers Against the War's Gayle ] Davidson noted that the B.C. Court of Appeal has ruled that a private prosecution of this nature cannot proceed to a first hearing without the consent of the federal attorney general , who is Robert Nicholson , " reported Straight.com .
" We can assume that he won't , " she told the Web site .
" So the next step would be to take an application to the Federal Court of Canada seeking an order of mandamus compelling the attorney general to give his consent . "

Left - handed people studied felt more inhibited and anxious
People who are left - handed are more likely to get anxious or feel shy or embarrassed about doing or saying what they want , according to new research .
Those involved in the Abertay University study were given a behavioural test that gauges personal restraint and impulsiveness .
Researchers found left - handers tended to agree more with statements such as " I worry about making mistakes . "
They also agreed that " criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit . "
In total , 46 left - handed people were compared with 66 right - handers .
' Wiring differences '
The left - handers scored higher when it came to inhibition , especially when a situation was new or unusual .
Women were also more held back than men .
All groups responded similarly to statements such as : " I often act on the spur of the moment " and " I crave excitement and new sensations . "
Dr Lynn Wright , who led the study in Dundee , believes the results could be due to wiring differences in the brains of left and right - handers .
" Left - handers are more likely to hesitate whereas right - handers tend to jump in a bit more , " she said .
" In left - handers the right half of the brain is dominant , and it is this side that seems to control negative aspects of emotion .
In right - handers the left brain dominates . "
The Tardis is being completely redesigned in time for the arrival of the new Doctor Who .
BBC bosses have given the green light to completely refit the interior for a radical new look .
They will also improve the quality of the police box exterior for the opening episode featuring new Time Lord Matt Smith .
Production sources say the decision is being taken by new Doctor Who writer and executive producer Stephen Moffat , who wants to distance himself from previous show chief Russell T Davies .
He wants the arrival of Matt Smith to signify a new era , and also to withstand Doctor Who being in high definition .
A source said : " It will be the most hitech , intricate Tardis ever . "
Smith , 26 , who will become the 11th Time Lord next year , will be the youngest actor to play the 903 - year - old doctor .
Die Regierungskoalition will künftig die heimliche Online - Durchsuchung auch für die Aufklärung schwerer Verbrechen erlauben .
Das berichtet die Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung in ihrer Samstagsausgabe .
Wolfgang Bosbach , der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der CDU / CSU - Bundestagsfraktion , sagte gegenüber dem Blatt , dass noch in dieser Legislaturperiode eine Änderung der Strafprozessordnung vorgenommen werden solle .
Ein entsprechender Entwurf der Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) liege bereits vor .
[ Update : Allerdings will Zypries vorerst wohl die Online - Durchsuchung nur in Form der Quellen - Telekommunikationsüberwachung ( Quellen - TKÜ ) zulassen , die zum Abhören von VoIP vor der verschlüsselten Übertragung eingesetzt wird . ]
Strafverfolger müssten bei schweren Taten die Möglichkeit haben , mit Hilfe von Spionage - Software beispielsweise Internettelefonate abzuhören oder E - Mails abzufangen , bevor eine Software diese Daten verschlüsselt , betonte dagegen Bosbach .
Der CDU - Politiker sagte , dass man dafür sorgen müsse , dass sich Straftäter nicht mit Hilfe von Verschlüsselungstechniken der Strafverfolgung entziehen könnten .
Es sei also notwendig , die Befugnisse der Behörden dem technischen Fortschritt anzupassen .
Der Entwurf sehe unter anderem vor , dass Ergebnisse aus Online - Durchsuchungen des BKA oder von Länderpolizeien auch bei der Strafverfolgung verwendet werden dürfen .
Eine eigenständige Erlaubnis von Online - Durchsuchungen soll es in der Strafprozessordung allerdings nicht geben .
Einen ähnlichen Vorschlag äußerte jüngst auch Generalbundesanwältin Monika Harms :
Sie sprach sich dafür aus , die im präventiven Bereich über das BKA - Gesetz gewonnenen Erkenntnisse auch zur Strafverfolgung zu nutzen .
Dafür regte sie eine entsprechende Änderung der Strafprozessordnung an , um das BKA - Gesetz , in dem unter anderem die umstrittene heimliche Online - Durchsuchung privater PCs geregelt ist , auch für die Strafverfolgung einsetzen zu können .
Siehe dazu auch :
Zu den technischen und rechtlichen Details der heimlichen Online - Durchsuchung und des Bundestrojaners veröffentlichte c’t in Ausgabe 25/08 einen Hintergrundartikel :
Zu den Auseinandersetzungen um die Terrorismus - Bekämpfung , die erweiterte Anti-Terror - Gesetzgebung , die Anti-Terror - Datei sowie die Online - Durchsuchung siehe auch :

I 've searched the web a bit , but all I found was abandoned projects and only CGI support .
EDIT : C is n't just used for writing drivers or embedded systems .
We have mailreaders , newsreaders , editors , etc. all written in C .
I 've written two BBS in the last century , before the web became popular .
The libraries are getting better and you do n't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again .
Nice data structures and string handling is easily possible in C .
But yet , there 's not much going on in web development .
I 'd like to come back to my roots and try to write web applications in C .
As for bad languages : People use C++ , Perl , and PHP for web applications .
It does n't stop them that the common perception of these language is n't very good .
EDIT 2 : I 've written BBS software in C and nobody thought this was a crazy idea , although others have done it in GfA BASIC back then .
I do n't understand why today it should be considered a bad idea .
Have a look at the software you are using or the most common programming languages in open source software .

[ This article is the second in a series of articles that seeks to provide the intelligent layman with sufficient knowledge of sound economic theory to enable him to understand what must be done to overcome the present financial crisis and return to the path of economic progress and prosperity .
The first article in the series was " Falling Prices Are Not Deflation but the Antidote to Deflation . " ]
Imagine an individual who is lethargic and lacks the energy to function at his normal level because of too little sleep .
There are drugs that can make him feel fully refreshed , even after a night without any sleep whatever , and apparently capable of functioning the next day with full efficiency .
Nevertheless taking such drugs is definitely not a good idea .
This is because the individual 's underlying problem of insufficient sleep is not only not addressed by his being stimulated but is actually worsened .
For the stimulus further depletes his body 's already diminished energy reserves and takes him down the path of utter exhaustion .
This description applies to the current slowdown in our economic system and to the efforts to overcome it through the use of " fiscal policy " and its " stimulus packages . "
The meaning of these terms is more government spending and lower taxes specifically designed to promote consumption .
This includes giving income - tax refunds to people who paid no income tax and who , because of their low incomes , can presumably be most counted on to rush out and consume more as soon as additional funds are put in their hands .
The main difference between such economic " stimulants " and pharmaceutical stimulants is that the economic stimulants will not succeed even in temporarily restoring the economic system to anything approaching its normal level of activity .
An economic system entering into a major recession or depression is in a situation very similar to that of our imaginary , sleep - deprived individual .
All that one need do is substitute for the loss of the sleep required for the body 's proper functioning the loss of something required for the proper functioning of the economic system .
Capital
In the case of the economic system , that something is capital .
The economic system is not functioning properly because it has lost capital .
Capital is the accumulated wealth that is owned by business enterprises or individuals and that is used for the purpose of earning profit or interest .
Capital embraces all of the farms , factories , mines , machinery and all other equipment , means of transportation and communication , warehouses , shops , office buildings , rental housing , and inventories of materials , components , supplies , semi-manufactures , and finished goods that are owned by business firms .
Capital also embraces the money that is owned by business firms , though money is in a special category .
In addition , it embraces funds that have been lent to consumers at interest , for the purpose of buying consumers ' goods such as houses , automobiles , appliances , and anything else that is too expensive to be paid for out of the income earned in one pay period and for which the purchaser himself does not have sufficient savings .
The amount of capital in an economic system determines its ability to produce goods and services and to employ labor , and also to purchase consumers ' goods on credit .
The greater the capital , the greater the ability to do all of these things ; the less the capital , the less the ability to do any of these things .
Saving
Capital is accumulated on a foundation of saving .
Saving is the act of abstaining from consuming funds that have been earned in the sale of goods or services .
Saving does not mean not spending .
It does not mean hoarding .
It means not spending for purposes of consumption .
Abstaining from spending for consumption makes possible equivalent spending for production .
Whoever saves is in a position to that extent to buy capital goods and pay wages to workers , to lend funds for the purchase of expensive consumers ' goods , or to lend funds to others who will use them for any of these purposes .
It is necessary to stress these facts because of the prevailing state of utter ignorance on the subject .
Such ignorance is typified by a casual statement made in a recent New York Times news article .
The statement was offered in the conviction that its truth was so well established as to be non-controversial .
It claimed that " A dollar saved does not circulate through the economy and higher savings rates translate into fewer sales and lower revenue for struggling businesses . "
( Jack Healy , " Consumers Are Saving More and Spending Less , " February 3 , 2009 , p. B3 . )
The writer of the article apparently believes that houses and other expensive consumers ' goods are purchased out of the earnings of a single week or month , which is the normal range of time between paychecks .
If that were the case , no savings would be necessary in order to purchase them .
In fact , of course , the purchase of a house typically requires a sum equal to the purchaser 's entire income of three years or more ; that of an automobile , the income of several months ; and that of countless other goods , too large a fraction of the income of just one pay period to be affordable out of such limited funds .
In all such cases , a process of saving is essential for the purchase of consumers ' goods .
The savings accumulated may be those of the purchaser himself , or they may be borrowed , or be partly the purchaser 's own and partly borrowed .
But , in every case , savings are essential for the purchase of expensive consumers ' goods .
The Times reporter , and all of his colleagues , and the professors who supposedly educated him and his colleagues , all of whom spout such nonsense about saving , also do not know other , even more important facts abut saving .
They do not know that saving is the precondition of retailers being able to buy goods from wholesalers , of wholesalers being able to buy goods from manufacturers , of manufacturers , and all other producers , being able to buy goods from their suppliers , and so on and on .
It is also the precondition of sellers at any and all stages being able to pay wages .
Such expenditures must generally be made and paid for prior to the purchaser 's receipt of money from the sale of his own goods that will ultimately result .
For example , automobile and steel companies cannot pay their workers and suppliers out of the receipts from the sale of the automobiles that will eventually come in as the result of using the labor and capital goods purchased .
And even in the cases in which the payments to suppliers are made out of receipts from the sale of the resulting goods , the seller must abstain from consuming those funds , i.e. , he must save them and use them to pay for the capital goods and labor he previously purchased .
In contrast , the Keynesian reporters and professors believe that sellers do nothing but consume or hoard cash .
They are too dull to realize that if that were really the case , there would be no demand for anything but consumers ' goods .
This becomes clear simply by following the pattern of the Keynesian textbooks in allegedly describing the process of spending .
Thus a consumer buys , say , $ 100 worth of shirts in a department store ; the owner of the department store , following his Keynesian " marginal propensity to consume " of .75 , then buys $ 75 worth of food in a restaurant , and allegedly hoards the other $ 25 of his income ; the owner of the restaurant then buys $ 56.25 ( .75 x $ 75 ) worth of books , while allegedly hoarding the remaining $ 18.75 of his income ; and so on and on .
Now , unknown to the Keynesians , if such a sequence of spending actually took place , all that would exist is a sum of consumption expenditures and nothing else .
The fact is that most spending in the economic system rests on a foundation of saving .
The seller of the shirts will likely save and productively expend $ 95 or more in buying replacement shirts and in paying his employees and making other purchases necessary for the conduct of his business , and perhaps only $ 5 on consumption .
And so it will be for those who sell to him , or to the suppliers of his suppliers , or to the suppliers of those suppliers , and so on .
Any business income statement can provide a simple confirmation of such facts .
The ratio of costs to sales revenues that can be derived from it , is an indicator of the ratio of the use of savings to make expenditures for labor and capital goods relative to sales revenues .
For the costs it shows are a reflection of expenditures for labor and capital goods made in the past .
The saving and productive expenditure out of current sales revenues will show up as costs in the future .
The higher is the ratio of costs to sales , the higher is the degree of saving and productive expenditure relative to sales revenues .
A firm with costs of $ 95 and sales revenues of $ 100 is a firm that can be understood as saving and productively expending $ 95 out of its $ 100 of sales revenues .
This relationship applies throughout the economic system .
Hoarding Versus Saving
To the extent that " hoarding " or , more accurately , an increase in the demand for money for cash holding takes place , it is not because people have decided to save .
What is actually going on is that business firms and investors have decided that they need to change the composition of their already accumulated savings in favor of holding more cash and less of other assets .
For example , an individual may decide that instead of being 90 percent invested in stocks and other securities and having only 10 percent of his savings in cash in his checking account , he needs to increase his cash holding to 20 or 25 percent of his savings .
Similarly , a corporation may decide that it needs to increase its cash holding relative to its other assets in order to be better able to meet its bills coming due .
Indeed , this is happening right now as more and more firms find that they can no longer count on being able to borrow money for such purposes .
Furthermore , the increases in cash holdings that take place in such circumstances are not only not an addition to savings but occur in the midst of a sharp decline in the overall amount of accumulated savings .
For example , the increases in cash holdings that are taking place today are in response to a major plunge in the real estate and stock markets , of numerous and sizable corporate bankruptcies , and of huge losses on the part of banks and other financial institutions .
All of this represents a reduction in asset values , i.e. , in the value of accumulated savings .
People are turning to cash in order to avoid further such losses of their accumulated savings .
Of course , widespread attempts to convert assets other than cash into cash , entail further declines in the value of accumulated savings , since the unloading of those assets reduces their value .
Accumulated savings in the economic system have fallen by several trillion dollars , and nothing could be more incredible than that , in the midst of this , many people , including the great majority of professional economists , fear saving and think that it is necessary to stimulate consumption at the expense of saving .
Such is the complete and utter lack of economic understanding that prevails .
One might expect that a group of people such as most of today 's economists , who pride themselves on their empiricism , would once and a while look at the actual facts of the world in which they live , and , in the midst of the loss of trillions of dollars of accumulated savings , begin to suspect that there might actually be a need to replace savings that have been lost rather than do everything possible to prevent their replacement .
Depressions and Credit Expansion
The loss of accumulated savings is at the core of the problem of economic depressions .
Recessions and depressions and the losses that accompany them are the result of the attempt to create capital on a foundation of credit expansion rather than saving .
Credit expansion is the lending out of new and additional money that is created out of thin air by the banking system , which acts with the encouragement and support of the government .
The money so created and lent has the appearance of being new and additional capital , but it is not .
The fact of its appearing to be new and additional capital creates an exaggerated , false understanding of the amount of capital that is available to support economic activity .
Like an individual who believes he has grown rich in the course of a financial bubble , and who is led to adopt a level of living that is beyond his actual means , business firms are led to undertake ventures that are beyond their actual means .
For an individual consumer , the purchase of an expensive home or automobile in the delusion that he is rich later on turns out to be a major loss in the light of the fact that he cannot actually afford these things and would have been better off had he not bought them .
In the same way , business construction projects , stepped up store openings , acquisitions of other firms , and the like , carried out in the delusion of a sudden abundance of available capital , turn out to be sources of major losses when the delusion of additional capital evaporates .
Credit expansion also fosters an artificial reduction in the demand for money for cash holding , which sets the stage for a later rise in the demand for money for cash holding , such as was described a few paragraphs ago .
The reduction in the demand for money for cash holding occurs because so long as credit expansion continues , it is possible for business firms to borrow easily and profitably and thus to come to believe that they can substitute their ability to borrow for the holding of actual cash .
The rising sales revenues created by the expenditure of the new and additional money that is lent out also encourages the holding of additional inventories as a substitute for the holding of cash , in the conviction that the inventories can be liquidated easily and profitably .
Recessions and depressions are the result of the loss of capital in the malinvestments and overconsumption that credit expansion causes .
The losses are then compounded by the rise in the demand for money for cash holding that subsequently follows .
They can be further compounded by reductions in the quantity of money as well , such as would occur if the losses suffered by banks resulted in losses to the banks ' checking depositors .
( Checking deposits are part of the money supply , indeed , the far greater part .
In such cases , they would lose the status of money and assume that of a security in default , which would render them useless for making purchases or paying bills . )
The Housing Bubble
Our housing bubble is an excellent illustration of the malinvestment and overconsumption caused by credit expansion .
Perhaps as much as $ 2 trillion or more of capital has been lost in the construction and financing of houses for people who , it turned out , could not afford to pay for them .
The housing bubble was financed by the creation of $ 1.5 trillion of new and additional money in the form of checking deposits created for the benefit of home buyers .
The creation of these deposits rested on the readiness of the Federal Reserve System to create whatever new and additional supporting funds were required in the form of bank reserves .
In the three years 2001 - 2004 , the Federal Reserve created enough such funds to drive the interest rate paid on them , i.e. , the Federal Funds Rate , below 2 percent .
And from July of 2003 to June of 2004 , it created enough such funds to hold this rate down to just 1 percent .
The end result was a substantial reduction in mortgage interest rates and thus in monthly mortgage payments , which served greatly to increase the demand for houses .
Government also greatly contributed specifically to loans being made to homebuyers who were not credit worthy .
It did this through its various loan - guarantee programs , carried out by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Department of Housing and Urban Development ; and by means even of outright extortion , though the Community Reinvestment Act , which required banks to make sufficient such loans as would satisfy local " community groups . "
In physical terms , the result of credit expansion was the passage of literally millions of houses that represented capital to the firms that built them , and to the banks and others that financed them , into the hands of consumers who not only had not contributed anything remotely comparable to the wealth and capital of the economic system but also had no realistic prospect of ever being able to do so .
The further result has been that many of the builders of these houses are now ruined as are many of the banks and other investors that financed the construction and sale of those houses .
And because so many lenders have lost so much , the business firms that depend on them for loans can no longer obtain those loans , and so they must close their doors and fire their workers .
The growing problem of unemployment that we are experiencing and the accompanying reduction in consumer spending on the part both of the unemployed and of those who fear becoming unemployed is the result of this loss of capital , not of any sudden , capricious refusal of consumers to spend or of banks to lend .
Indeed , the kind of consumer spending that so many people want to revive and encourage , by means of " stimulus packages , " played a major role in the loss of capital that has taken place and now results in unemployment and impoverishment .
During the housing boom , millions of owners of existing houses thought that they were growing rich as the result of the rise in the prices of their homes and that they could actually live to a substantial degree off the accompanying increase in the equity in their homes .
They borrowed against the increased equity and spent the proceeds .
This consumption was at the expense of capital investment in the economic system , which was rendered correspondingly poorer by it .
And when housing prices collapsed , and fell below the enlarged mortgage debts that had been taken on , the effect was to add to the losses suffered by lenders .
This was the case to the extent such equity - consuming homeowners then walked away from their homes , leaving their creditors to lose by the decline in the price of their homes .
Keynesian Ignorance and Blindness
The immense majority of people , including , of course , most professional economists , are ignorant of the actual nature and cause of our financial crisis .
This is because they are ignorant of the role of capital in the economic system .
They are all Keynesians .
( Even Milton Friedman , the alleged arch - defender of capitalism is reported to have said , " We are all Keynesians now . " )
But as von Mises so aptly put it , " The essence of Keynesianism is its complete failure to conceive the role that saving and capital accumulation play in the improvement of economic conditions . "
( Planning for Freedom , 4th ed. , p. 207 . Italics in original . )
In the eyes of Keynes and his countless followers , economic activity begins and ends with consumption .
So deeply do people hold the view that consumption is everything , that it blinds them to obvious facts .
Thus , the present crisis has been well underway at least since the late spring of 2007 , when the sudden collapse of two large Bear Stearns hedge funds occurred .
This was followed by a continuing string of bankruptcies between June of 2007 and August of 2008 of significant - sized and fairly well - known firms , such as Aloha Airlines , Levitz , Furniture , Wickes Furniture , Mervyns Department Stores , Linens N ' Things , IndyMac Bank , and Bear Stearns itself .
The list includes an actual run on a major bank — Northern Rock in Great Britain — in September of 2007 , probably the first such run since the 1930s .
Financial failures reached a crisis point in September of 2008 , with the collapse of such major firms as American International Group ( AIG ) , Lehman Brothers , and the Halifax Bank of Scotland .
These were followed by the bankruptcy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two giant government - sponsored mortgage lenders that had led the way in guaranteeing sub - prime mortgages to borrowers who could not repay them .
Yet as late as September of 2008 , the unemployment rate in the United States was no more than 6.2 percent and at mid-month the Dow Jones Industrial Average was still well above 11,000 .
All this confirms that the crisis did not originate in any sudden refusal of consumers to consume or in any surge in unemployment .
To the extent that unemployment is growing and consumption is declining , they are both the consequence of the economy 's loss of capital .
The loss of capital is what precipitated a reduction in the availability of credit and a widening wave of bankruptcies , which in turn has resulted in growing unemployment and a decline in the ability and willingness of people to consume .
The collapse in home prices and the more recent collapse in the stock market have also contributed to the decline in consumption , and probably to an even greater extent , at least up to now .
Both of these events are also an aspect of the loss of capital and accumulated savings .
What Economic Recovery Requires
What all of the preceding discussion implies is that economic recovery requires that the economic system rebuild its stock of capital and that to be able to do so , it needs to engage in greater saving relative to consumption .
This is what will help to restore the supply of credit and thus help put an end to financial failures based on a lack of credit .
Recovery also requires the freedom of wage rates and prices to fall , so that the presently reduced supply of capital and credit becomes capable of supporting a larger volume of employment and production , as I explained in " Falling Prices Are Not Deflation but the Antidote to Deflation , " which was my first article in this series .
Recovery will be achieved by the combination of more saving , capital , and credit along with lower wage rates , costs , and prices .
In addition , recovery requires the rapid liquidation of unsound investments .
If borrowers are unable to meet their contractual obligation to pay principal and interest , the assets involved need to be sold off and the proceeds turned over to the lenders as quickly as possible , in order to put an end to further losses and thus salvage as much capital from the debacle as possible .
In the present situation of widespread financial paralysis , firms and individuals can be driven into bankruptcy because they are unable to collect the sums due them from their debtors .
Thus , for example , the failure of mortgage lenders would be alleviated , if not perhaps altogether avoided in some cases , if the mortgage borrowers who were in default on their properties lost their houses quickly , with the proceeds quickly being turned over to the lenders .
In that way , the lenders would at least have those funds available to meet their obligations and thus might avoid their own default ; in either event , their creditors would be better off .
In helping to restore the capital of lenders , or what will become the capital of the creditors of the lenders , quick foreclosures would serve to restore the ability to originate new loans .
Recovery requires the end of financial pretense .
There are banks that do not want to see the liquidation of various types of assets that they own , notably , " collateralized debt obligations " ( CDOs ) .
These are securities issued against collections of other securities , which in turn were issued against collections of mortgages , an undetermined number of which are in default or likely to go into default .
The presumably low prices that such securities would bring in the market would likely serve to reveal the presence of so little capital on the part of many banks that they would be plunged into immediate bankruptcy .
To avoid that , the banks want to prevent the discovery of the actual value of those securities .
At the same time , they want creditors to trust them .
Yet before trust can be established , the actual , market value of the banks ' assets must be established , even if it serves to bankrupt many of them .
The safety of their deposits can be secured without the banks ' present owners continuing in that role .
When these various requirements have been met and the process of financial contraction comes to an end , the profitability of business investment will be restored and recovery will be at hand .
The Nature of Stimulus Packages
As was shown earlier , economic recovery requires greater saving and the accumulation of fresh capital , to make up for the losses caused by credit expansion and the malinvestment and overconsumption that follow from it .
Yet the imposition of " stimulus packages " results in the further loss of capital .
The Keynesians not only do not know this , but would not care even if they did know it .
Because of their ignorance of the role of capital in the economic system and resulting inability to see even the clearest evidence that suggests it , the Keynesians can conceive of no cause of a recession or depression but an insufficiency of consumption and no remedy but an increase in consumption .
This is the basis of their calls for " stimulus packages " of one kind or another .
They assume that the economic system always has enough capital , indeed , that it is in danger of having too much capital , and that the problem is simply to get it to use the capital that it has .
The way that this is done , they believe , is to get people to consume .
Additional consumption will be the " stimulus " to new and additional production .
When people consume , the products of past production are taken off the shelves and disappear from the stores .
These products , the Keynesians believe , now require replacement .
Hence , the shops will order replacement supplies and the manufacturers will turn to producing them , and thus the economic system will be operating again and recovery will be achieved , provided the " stimulus " is large enough .
The essential meaning of a " stimulus package " is the government 's financing of consumption , indeed , practically any consumption , by anyone , for almost any purpose , in the conviction that this will cause an increase in employment and production as the means of replacing what is consumed .
Despite talk of avoiding wasteful spending and being " careful with the taxpayers ' money , " the truth is that from the point of view of the advocates of economic stimulus , the bigger and more wasteful the project , the better .
This was made brilliantly clear many years ago by Henry Hazlitt , who chose the example of government spending for a bridge .
It is one thing , Hazlitt showed , if the government builds a bridge because its construction is necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic .
It is a very different matter , he pointed out , if the government builds the bridge for the purpose of promoting employment .
In the first case , the government wants the best bridge for the lowest possible cost , which implies the employment of as few workers as possible , both in the construction of the bridge and in the production of any of the materials that go into it .
In the second case , that of stimulating employment , the government wants a bridge that requires as many workers as possible , for their employment is its actual purpose .
The greater the number of workers employed , of course , the greater must be the cost of the bridge .
Indeed , no one could be more clear or explicit concerning the nature of government " fiscal policy " and its " stimuli " than Keynes himself , who declared ( on p. 129 of his General Theory ) that " Pyramid building , earthquakes , even wars may serve to increase wealth , if the education of our statesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the way of anything better . "
Acts of sheer destruction , such as wars and natural disasters , appear as beneficial to Keynes and his followers for the same reason that the " stimulus " of government - financed consumption appears beneficial .
This is because they too create a need for replacement and thus allegedly result in an increase in employment and production .
So widespread is this view that one can very often hear people openly express favorable opinions about the alleged economic benefits of such things as earthquakes , hurricanes , and even wars .
Stimulus Packages Mean More Loss of Capital
Despite the fact that what the economic system needs for recovery is saving and the accumulation of new capital , to replace as far as possible the capital that has been lost , the effect of stimulus packages is further to reduce the supply of capital , and thus to worsen the recession or depression .
The reason that stimulus packages cause a further loss of capital is that their starting point is the consumption of previously produced wealth .
That wealth is part of the capital of the business firms that own it .
The stimulus programs offer money in exchange for this wealth and capital .
But the money they offer does not come from the production of any comparable wealth by the government or those to whom it gives money — wealth which has had to be produced and sold and thus put into the economic system prior to the withdrawal that now takes place .
The starting point for the government and its dependents is an act of consumption , which means a using up , a loss of previously existing wealth in the form of capital .
The supporters of stimulus packages look to the fresh production that is required to replace the wealth that has been consumed .
It will require the performance of additional labor .
They are delighted to the extent that this fresh production and additional employment materialize .
They believe that at that point their mission has been accomplished .
They have succeeded in generating new and additional economic activity , new and additional employment .
The only shortcoming of such a policy , they believe , is that it may not be applied on a sufficiently large scale .
Unfortunately , there is something they have overlooked .
And that is the fact that any fresh production and employment that results is incapable by itself of replacing the capital that was consumed in starting the process .
The reason for this is that all production , including any new and additional production called into being by stimulus packages , itself entails consumption .
And this consumption tends at the very least to approximate the fresh production and , indeed , is capable of equaling or even exceeding it .
Thus , for example , we start with the purchase and consumption of a new television set by someone who has not previously produced and sold anything of equivalent monetary value that provided the funds for his now buying the television set .
He has simply received the money from the government .
In this case , what we have is one television set withdrawn from the capital of the economic system and placed in the hands of a non-producing consumer .
We can assume , for the sake of argument , that the retailer of the television set will order a replacement set from the wholesaler , and that the wholesaler in turn will order a replacement set from the manufacturer .
We can assume further that the manufacturer will now produce a new television set to replace the one that he sells to the wholesaler from his inventory .
The production of the replacement television set entails a using up of materials and components and part of the useful life of the plant and equipment required .
Aspects of such using up of capital goods also take place on the part of the retailer and wholesaler and in the transportation of the television set .
Very importantly , any new and additional workers who may be employed — precisely the goal of the whole operation — in producing a new television set or in moving a television set through the channels of distribution must be paid wages , which they in turn will consume .
The goods these workers receive when they spend their wages represents a further depletion of inventories , on the part of all the retailers with whom they deal .
In addition , the various business firms involved have additional profits , or at least diminished losses , as the result of the various additional purchases .
This enables their owners to consume more and probably results in the payment of additional taxes , which the government consumes .
Even whatever depreciation allowances are earned along the way in the various stages of replacing the television set are likely to be consumed .
This is because in the context of a recession or depression investors are afraid of losses if they invest in private businesses and thus prefer to invest in short - term treasury securities , such as treasury bills , which they consider to be far safer .
But when depreciation allowances are used to purchase treasury securities , they end up financing consumption rather than capital replacement .
This is because the Treasury uses the proceeds from the sale of its securities to finance nothing but consumption , either that of the government itself or that of the private individuals to whom the government gives money .
The point here is that any replacement of a good consumed by a non-producer itself entails very substantial additional consumption of inventories and the useful life of plant and equipment of business firms .
The same is obviously true of the replacement of goods that have simply been destroyed , whether by war or by an act of nature .
No matter how long the process of spending and respending of the funds introduced into the economic system by a stimulus package might continue — no matter how many instances of replacement production there might be following the purchase and consumption of our hypothetical television set or of any other such good — the initial loss of capital need never be made up .
This is because each act of replacement production is accompanied by corresponding additional consumption .
Thus the initial act of consumption — or destruction — of wealth and capital may be followed by 10 or 100 acts of subsequent production , each carried on in order to replace the goods used up before it .
But if each of these subsequent acts of production is accompanied by fresh consumption that is equivalent to it , the net effect is still one act of consumption .
As a result , the supply of capital is reduced .
For what is always present is X instances of production respectively following X+1 instances of consumption .
Now countries have suffered enormous losses of capital and yet still managed to recover and go on to new heights of wealth and prosperity .
Germany and Japan in the decades following World War II are perhaps the most outstanding examples of this .
What enabled them to recover was not further acts of consumption , not " stimulus packages " of any kind , but increases in production in excess — substantially in excess — of increases in consumption .
That is to say , it was a process of saving and capital accumulation that made their recovery possible .
On average , people in those countries , in those years , saved and reinvested a major portion of their income , often in excess of 25 percent .
It is possible , but highly unlikely , that the replacement production induced by an initial consumption / destruction of wealth might itself entail some such new saving .
If round after round of replacement production were in fact accompanied by some such saving , then , eventually , the original loss of capital would be made good .
But that would be the case only if such saving was not offset by fresh acts of " stimulus " or other policies that waste or destroy capital .
However , as I say , such an outcome is highly unlikely .
If for no other reason , this is because , as I have already pointed out , the stimulus packages take place in an environment in which investors fear to invest in private firms .
As a result , they use not only whatever new and additional savings they might make , for the purpose of buying " safe " treasury securities but also even funds they earn that are required for the replacement of capital goods .
In this way , savings are diverted into consumption rather than capital accumulation .
( It is ironic that while , if it did manage to occur and was not diverted into consumption , such saving might mitigate the effects of a stimulus package , it is attacked as undermining the process of recovery .
Thus , for example , Paul Krugman , the 2008 Nobel Prize winner in economics , writes : " Meanwhile , it 's clear that when it comes to economic stimulus , public spending provides much more bang for the buck than tax cuts … because a large fraction of any tax cut will simply be saved . "
New York Times , January 26 , 2009 , p. A23 . )
In addition to the diversion into consumption of such new savings as might occur subsequent to a " stimulus , " there is the fact that the source of any such saving , namely , the net product produced , is likely to be greatly diminished .
The net product is the excess of the product produced over the capital goods used up in order to produce it .
It is what is available for consumption or saving out of current wage , profit , and interest income .
The net product is diminished to the extent that production is made to take place in accordance with methods requiring the employment of unnecessary capital goods per unit of output .
Environmental and consumer product safety legislation provide numerous instances of this kind .
For example , requiring gas stations , dry - cleaning establishments , and many other types of businesses to substantially increase their capital investments merely in order to placate the largely groundless fears of the environmental movement .
Similarly , requiring safety features in automobiles , dishwashers , display cases , ice machines , stepladders , and countless other goods — features that the market does not judge to be worth their cost — adds to the cost of the materials and components that enter into the production of products without increasing the perceived value of the products .
In both instances , the result is a larger consumption of capital goods but no increase in production , and thus a reduction in the size of the net product produced and thus in the ability to engage in saving out of current income .
As indicated earlier in this article , the effect of capital decumulation , whether caused by stimulus packages or anything else , is a reduction in the ability of the economic system to produce , to employ labor , and to provide credit , for each of these things depends on capital .
The reduced ability to produce and employ labor may not be apparent in the midst of mass unemployment .
But it will become apparent if and when economic recovery begins .
At that point , the economic system will be less capable than it otherwise would have been , because of the reduction in its supply of capital .
Real wages and the general standard of living will be lower than they otherwise would have been .
And all along , the ability to grant credit will be less than it otherwise would have been .
Stimulus Packages
Are a Drain on the Rest of the Economic System
Even though stimulus packages may be able to generate additional economic activity , they cannot achieve any kind of meaningful economic recovery .
Their actual effect is the creation of a system of public welfare in the guise of work .
That is in the nature of employing people not for the sake of the products they produce but having them produce products for the sake of being able to employ them .
But stimulus packages are much more costly than simple welfare .
On top of the welfare dole that allows unemployed workers to live , stimulus packages add the cost of the materials and equipment that the workers use in producing their pretended products .
The work created by stimulus packages is a make - believe work that is carried on at the expense of the rest of the economic system .
It draws products and services produced in the rest of the economic system and returns to the rest of the economic system little or nothing in the way of goods or services that would constitute value for value or payment of any kind .
In other words , stimulus packages and the needless work they create cause the great majority of other people to be poorer .
I 've already shown how they cause them to have less capital .
Shortly , I will show how they also cause them to consume less .
( For elaboration on this point , please see the forthcoming republication of my article " Who Pays for ' Full Employment ' ? " )
Rising Prices in the Midst of Mass Unemployment
If economic recovery is to be achieved , the first thing that must be done is to stop " stimulus packages " and undo as far as possible any that are already in progress .
This is because their effect is to worsen the problem of loss of capital that is the underlying cause of the economic crisis in the first place .
Unfortunately , they are not likely to be stopped .
If they are implemented , especially on the scale already approved by Congress , the effect will be a decumulation of capital up to the point where scarcities of capital goods , including inventories of consumers ' goods in the possession of business firms , start to drive up prices .
Higher prices of consumers ' goods will result not only from scarcities of consumers ' goods ( which , of course , are capital goods so long as they are in the hands of business firms ) , but also from scarcities of capital goods further back in the process of production .
Thus a scarcity of steel sheet will not only raise the price of steel sheet , but will carry forward to the price of automobiles via the higher cost of producing automobiles that results from a rise in the price of steel sheet .
Likewise , a scarcity of iron ore will carry forward to the price of steel sheet , which , again , will carry forward to the price of automobiles .
And , of course , the pattern will be the same throughout the economic system , in such further cases as oil and oil products , cotton and cotton products , wheat and wheat products , and so on .
A rise in the prices of consumers ' goods is capable of stopping further capital decumulation stemming from the stimulus packages .
When the point is reached that additional funds spent on consumers ' goods serve merely to raise their prices , then no additional quantities of them are sold .
The same quantities are sold at higher prices .
This ends the decumulation of inventories .
From this point on , the buyers who obtain their funds from the government consume at the expense of people who have earned their incomes but now get less for them .
Once inventories become scarce in relation to the spending for goods , all of the funds that the government has been pouring into the economic system become capable of launching a major increase in prices .
This rise in prices can take place even in the midst of mass unemployment .
This is because the abundance of unemployed workers does nothing to mitigate the scarcity of capital goods that has occurred as the result of the attempts to stimulate employment .
Even though rising prices can deprive stimulus packages of the ability to cause further capital decumulation , the inflation of the money supply by the government results in continuing capital decumulation .
In large part , this occurs as the result of the fact that the additional spending resulting from a larger money supply raises business sales revenues immediately while it raises business costs only with a time lag .
So long as this goes on , profits are artificially increased .
Despite the fact that most or all of the additional profits may be required simply in order to replace assets at higher prices , the additional profits are taxed as though they were genuine gains .
This impairs the ability of firms to replace their assets .
The destructive consequences of this phenomenon can be seen in the transformation of what was once America 's industrial heartland into the " rustbelt . "
At the same time , throughout the economic system , starting long before today 's stimulus packages and continuing on alongside them , regular , almost year - in , year - out government budget deficits do their work of destruction .
They cause a continuing diversion into consumption not only of a considerable part of whatever savings might be made out of income but also of the replacement allowances for the using up of plant and equipment and all other fixed assets .
Generations of government budget deficits have sucked up trillions of dollars of what would have been capital funds and have gone a long way toward turning America into an industrial wasteland .
The blind rush into massive " stimulus packages " is the culmination of generations of economic ignorance transmitted from professor to student in the guise of advanced , revolutionary thinking — the " Keynesian revolution . "
The accelerating destruction of our economic system that we are now experiencing is the product of a prior destruction of economic thought .
Our entire intellectual establishment has been the victim — the willing victim — of a massive intellectual con job that goes under the name " Keynesianism . "
And we are now paying the price .
I say , willing victims of an intellectual con job .
What other description can there be of those who were ready to hail as a genius the man who wrote , " Pyramid building , earthquakes , even wars may serve to increase wealth… . "
Only a brave few — most notably Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt — stood apart from this madness , and for doing so , they were made intellectual pariahs .
But the time is coming when it will be clear to all who think that it is they who have had the last word .
UNDER PRESSURE :
When the wind tunnel is cranked up to simulate flight conditions , the brightness of the paint 's glow on the model 's surfaces depends on the varying pressure at different points .
The paint responds to oxygen levels in the air — thus , the more oxygen or pressure a point gets the less it will glow ...
COURTESY OF ARNOLD AIR FORCE BASE
( This is a follow - up on my portion of the More Secrets of JavaScript Libraries panel at SXSW . )
It ’s become increasingly obvious to me that cross - browser JavaScript development and testing , as we know it , does not scale .
jQuery ’s Test Suites
Take the case of the jQuery core testing environment .
Our default test suite is an XHTML page ( served with the HTML mimetype ) with the correct doctype .
In includes a number of tests that cover all aspects of the library ( core functionality , DOM traversal , selctors , Ajax , etc. ) .
We have a separate suite that tests offset positioning ( integrating this into the main suite would be difficult , at best , since positioning is highly dependent upon the surrounding content ) .
This means that we have , at minimum , two test suites straight out of the gate .
Next , we have a test suite that serves the regular XHTML test suite with the correct mimetype ( application / xhtml+xml ) .
We are n’t 100 % passing this one yet , but we ’d like to be able to sometime before jQuery 1.4 is ready .
Additionally , we have another version that we ’re working on that serves the regular test suite but with its doctype stripped ( throwing it into quirks mode ) .
This is another one that we would like to make sure we ’re passing completely in time for 1.4 .
Both of those tweaks ( one with correct mimetype and one with no doctype ) would also need to be done for the offset test suite .
We ’re now up to 6 test suites .
We have another version of the default jQuery test suite that runs with a copy of Prototype and Scriptaculous injected ( to make sure that the external library does n’t affect internal jQuery code ) .
And another that does the same with Mootools .
And another that does the same for old versions of jQuery .
That ’s three more test suites ( up to 9 ) .
Finally , we ’re working on another version of the suite that manipulates the Object .
prototype before running the test suite .
This will help us to , eventually , be able to work in that hostile environment .
This is another one that we ’d like to have done in time for jQuery 1.4 – and brings our test suite total up to 10 .
We ’re in the initial planning stages of developing a pure - XUL test environment ( to make sure jQuery works well in Firefox extensions ) .
Eventually we ’d like to look at other environments as well ( such as in Rhino + Env.js , Rhino + HTMLUnit , and Adobe AIR ) .
I wo n’t count these non-browser / HTML environments , for now .
At minimum that ’s 10 separate test suites that we need to run for jQuery .
Ideally , we should be running every one of them just prior to committing a change , just after committing a change , for every patch that ’s waiting to be committed , and before a release goes out …
in every browser that we support .
The Browser Problem
And this is where cross - browser JavaScript unit testing goes to crazy town .
In the jQuery project we try to support the current version of all major browsers , the last released version , and the upcoming nightlies / betas ( we balance this a little bit with how rapidly users upgrade browsers – Safari and Opera users upgrade very quickly ) .
At the time of this post that includes 12 browsers .
Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , 8 . ( Not including 8 in 7 mode . )
Firefox 2 , 3 , Nightly .
Safari 3.2 , 4 .
Opera 9.6 , 10 .
Chrome 1 , 2 .
Of course , that ’s just on Windows and does n’t include OS X or Linux .
For the sake of sanity in the jQuery project we generally only test on one platform – but ideally we should be testing Firefox , Safari , and Opera ( the only multi- platform browsers ) on all platforms .
The end result is that we need to run 10 separate test suites in 12 separate browsers before and after every single commit to jQuery core .
Cross -Browser JavaScript testing does not scale .
Of course , this is just desktop cross - browser JavaScript testing – we should be testing on some of the popular mobile devices , as well .
( MobileSafari , Opera Mobile , and possibly NetFront and Blackberry . )
Manual Testing
All of the above test suites are purely automated .
You open them up in a browser , wait for them to finish , and look at the results – they require no human intervention whatsoever ( save for the initial loading of the URL ) .
This works for a lot of JavaScript tests ( and for all the tests in jQuery core ) but it ’s unable to cover interactive testing .
Some test suites ( such as Yahoo UI , j Query UI , and Selenium ) have ways of automating pieces of user interaction ( you can write tests like ‘ Click this button the click this other thing ’ ) .
For most cases this works pretty well .
However all of this is just an approximation of the actual interaction that a user may employ .
Nothing beats having real people manually run through some easily - reproducible ( and verifiable ) tests by hand .
This is the biggest scaling problem of all .
Take the previous problem of scaling automated test suites and multiply it the number of tests that you want to run .
100 tests in 12 browsers run on every commit by a human is just insane .
There has to be a better way since it ’s obvious that Cross - Browser JavaScript testing does not scale .
What currently exists ?
The only way to tackle the above problem of scale is to have a massive number of machines dedicated to testing and to somehow automate the process of sending those machines test suites and retrieving their results .
There currently exists an Open Source tool related to this problem space : Selenium Grid .
It ’s able to send out tests to a number of machines and automatically retrieve the results – but there are a couple problems :
As far as I can tell , Selenium Grid requires that you use Selenium to run your tests .
Currently no major JavaScript library uses Selenium ( and it would be a major shift in order to do so ) .
It is n’t able to test against non-desktop machines .
Each server must be running a daemon to handle the batches of jobs – this leaves mobile devices out of the picture .
It ca n’t test against unknown browsers .
Each browser needs special code to hook in to triggering the loading of the browser by Selenium , thus an unknown browser ( such IE 8 , Opera 10 , Firefox Nightly , or Chrome ) may not be able to run .
And most importantly : Selenium Grid requires that you actually own and control a number of machines on which you can run your tests .
It ’s not always feasible , especially in the world of distributed Open Source JavaScript development , to have the finances to have dedicated machines running non-stop .
A more cost effective solution is required .
Naturally , this solution does n’t tackle the problem of manual testing , either .
A solution : TestSwarm
All of this leads up to a new project that I ’m working on : TestSwarm .
It ’s still a work in progress but I hope to open up an alpha test by the end of this month – feel free to sign up on the site if you ’re interesting in participating .
Its construction is very simple .
It ’s a dumb JavaScript client that continually pings a central server looking for more tests to run .
The server collects test suites and sends them out to the respective clients .
All the test suites are collected .
For example , 1 “ commit ” can have 10 test suites associated with it ( and be distributed to a selection of browsers ) .
The nice thing about this construction is that it ’s able to work in a fault - tolerant manner .
Clients can come - and - go .
At any given time there might be no Firefox 2s connected , at another time there could be thirty .
The jobs are queued and divvied out as the load requires it .
Additionally , the client is simple enough to be able to run on mobile devices ( while being completely test framework agnostic ) .
Here ’s how I envision TestSwarm working out : Open Source JavaScript libraries submit their test suite batches to the central server and users join up to help out .
Library users can feel like they ’re participating and helping the project ( which they are ! ) simply by keeping a couple extra browser windows open during their normal day - to - day activity .
The libraries can also push manual tests out to the users .
A user will be notified when new manual tests arrive ( maybe via an audible cue ? ) which they can then quickly run through .
All of this help from the users would n’t be for nothing , though :
There ’d be high score boards keeping track of the users who participate the most and libraries could award the top participants with prizes ( t - shirts , mugs , books , etc. ) .
The framework developers get the benefit of near - instantaneous test feedback from a seemingly - unlimited number of machines and the users get prizes , recognition , and a sense of accomplishment .
If this interests you then please sign up for the alpha .
There ’s already been a lot of interest in a “ corporate ” version of TestSwarm .
While I ’m not planning on an immediate solution ( other than releasing the software completely Open Source ) I would like to have some room in place for future expansion ( perhaps users could get paid to run through manual tests – sort of a Mechanical Turk for JavaScript testing – I dunno , but there ’s a lot of fodder here for growth ) .
I ’m really excited – I think we ’re finally getting close to a solution for JavaScript testing ’s scalability problem .
It ’s not often that I ’ll stop my fast forward through commercials to watch something .
I definitely did when I saw the Reese ’s : Perfectly Easter advertisement .
I ’m not only a huge critic of candy ( because I love it so ) , I ’m also rather fond of breaking down advertising , but I ’ll save that for another time .
The important takeaway I got on that advert was that Spring is in the Air and Reese ’s Eggs are a chocolate covered peanut butter product .
Candy Blog reader , Peloria , has been wonderfully helpful in helping me track down these two versions by leaving comments on my original review of the perfect Reese ’s Peanut Butter Eggs ( 2006 version ) .
I got a hold of eggs for 2009 from three stores with two different wrappers .
For the most part single Reese ’s Eggs are sold with the package that does n’t say that they ’re milk chocolate .
But I also found the six pack that says Milk Chocolate above the Reese ’s logo .
Whether they say Milk Chocolate or not , the ingredients are the same .
So I did a little digging .
The classic Reese ’s Peanut Butter Egg ingredients were ( 2005 source ) :
Milk Chocolate , Peanuts , Sugar , Dextrose , Salt , Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil , Corn Syrup , Cornstarch , Glycerin & TBHQ .
The current 2009 ingredients :
Peanuts , Milk Chocolate , Sugar , Dextrose , Vegetable Oil , Chocolate , Nonfat milk , Salt , Whey , Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil , Corn Syrup , Milk fat , Corn Starch , Soy Lecithin , Glycerin , TBHQ , Vanillin .
For reference , the standard Reese ’s Peanut Butter Cup ingredients are ( in 2009 ) :
Milk Chocolate , Peanuts , Sugar , Dextrose , Salt & TBHQ .
There are a few changes there , but nothing that definitively says that these are n’t a real chocolate product any longer .
But they ’re different enough to change the nutritional profile .
There ’s more salt ( they ’ve gone from 140 mg to 150 mg ) , and 11 grams of fat now instead of 10 .
So I tasted them ( after all , at this point I had 9 of them ) .
The chocolate coating looked a bit chalky , not glossy ( and some looked a little swirly and uneven in color ) .
They ’re soft and the peanut butter overwhelms any chocolate flavor anyway .
The peanut butter center is crumbly and nutty , not completely smooth but not crunchy , just a little more rustic than the stuff in a jar .
Salty , sweet and satisfying .
The chocolate coating feels cool on the tongue and seems to melt pretty well , but it also melts in my fingers pretty quickly too .
It ’s a good time these come along in the spring because they ’d never make it in a Los Angeles summer .
I ’m not sure why Hershey ’s has removed the Milk Chocolate part from some wrappers , I fear it ’s because they ’re planning something for next year ... kind of easing us into crappy candy instead of a sharp shift that causes an uproar like the true & mockolate Kissables being on the shelves at the same time .
I still consider them a winner .
The prices appear to have gone up .
I got the six pack for $ 2 on sale , but buying the individual ones , the best sale I could find was 75 cents each .
Hershey ’s has a bunch of other candies for Easter in the Reese ’s line , too .
There are Fudge Covered Reese ’s Peanut Butter Eggs and Reester Bunnies , which are just a molded version of the RPBC in various sizes .
They ’re more chocolate than peanut butter .
Then there are the Foil Eggs , the Reese ’s Pieces Eggs ( in beautiful pastels ) ,
Then there ’s this strange monstrosity which is also called Milk Chocolate Reese ’s Peanut Butter Egg but unlike the 1.2 ounce version , this one is molded .
It ’s also 6 ounces ( so five times as big but twice the price per ounce ) .
The box is ridiculously oversized for the product - it ’s 6.5 inches long .
The egg itself is 4.5 inches long , 1.5 inches high and 3 inches wide at the broadest part .
That means one inch of space on all sides ... feels like more than just protection , feels like a bit of fakery .
( Though it ’s easy to see the entirety of the product through the cellophane window . )
The ingredients are pretty much the same as the Reese ’s Peanut Butter Cup - erring on the chocolate as the first ingredient , not peanuts .
I get the sense that these are supposed to be like those deluxe slicing candy eggs that have always puzzled me .
Candy , in my opinion , does n’t need any serving implements .
It ’s meant to be eaten with the fingers and needs no preparation or tools .
Either I bite into this one and eat it all by myself , of I slice it up .
Which I did .
Looking at the slices there , I think you can tell that this is not the same center as the 1.2 ounce egg ... it looks and feels a bit oilier ( which is not a bad thing , just a different thing ) .
The interesting experience with these slices is that the amount of chocolate shell varies so much depending on where the slice comes from .
The ends , of course , are mostly chocolate .
But even in a center slice , the chocolate shell is especially thick , much thicker than any cup I ’ve ever had from Reese ’s , as thick as a regular Hershey ’s Milk Chocolate Bar .
The chocolate flavor was completely lost on this product , it tasted like peanut butter fudge , though it was pretty smooth and sweet with a slight milky flavor to it .
The peanut butter center was stellar .
It was relatively solid , had the crumbly texture and did n’t taste as sweet as the regular eggs .
I liked the clear distinction between the chocolate shell here and the peanut butter filling , instead of the unclear margins in the smaller egg .
But sometimes the chocolate had a coconut flavor to it that I can’t quite explain nor say that I cared much for .
However , the silly over - packaging and price tag would certainly keep me from buying these ever again .
But if you ’re looking for something for a peanut butter obsessed person ’s Easter basket instead of a pile of the small eggs or the standby bunny , it might be fun .
Portion control was a lot easier than I thought , I sliced up rather logically into five pieces , though I ca n’t be sure that they were actually the same weight .
The package says that it serves four ( which means each serving is more than a single regular egg ) .
I feel like downgrading the 1.2 ounce Reese ’s Eggs to a 9 out of 10 , but maybe that ’s an emotional response , a response out of fear , not one based on my actual tasting ( though there was some throat burning from the sweetness I do n’t remember from the past ) .
As for the giganto one , it ’s not something I appreciate , though I guess it ’s okay .
I give it a 7 out of 10 .
UPDATE 3/30/2009 : Thanks to Peloria ’s continued documentation , I kept looking for these other non-milk chocolate labeled eggs .
I finally found them at the 99 Cent Only Store near my house .
The packages were 2 for a dollar .
Sure enough the ingredients indicated that they ’re really not chocolate ( I know , the photo looks like all the other photos , but trust me , this is what the reverse says ) :
Peanuts , sugar , dextrose , vegetable oil ( cocoa butter , palm , shea , sunflower and / or safflower oil ) , chocolate , nonfat milk , contains 2 % or less of milk fat , lactose , salt , whey , partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , corn syrup , soy lecithin , cornstarch , glycerin , TGHQ & PGPR , vanillin .
They look a little flatter than the milk chocolate eggs ( labeled or not ) .
As for the taste , well , this one seemed really salty to me , but maybe that ’s what happens when I have peanut butter eggs for breakfast .
( Hey , eggs are a breakfast food ! )
The mockolate coating was n’t bad , it was n’t any worse looking than the current eggs .
It has a similar melt and cool feeling on the tongue , it ’s sweet but I did n’t taste any milky component to it .
I still do n’t know what ’s going on .
I do n’t know why they ’ve have both on the market at the same time , why they ’d make two versions and ruin something that was perfectly good and perfect .
As for the ruining part , well , they ’re not that bad but I ’m not fond of eating palm oil when I could be eating cocoa butter .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broached the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders on Saturday , but emphasized that the global financial slump and other international crises were more pressing and immediate priorities .
U.S. Secretary Of State Hillary Clinton meets Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in Beijing .
The United States will continue to press China on issues such as Tibet , Taiwan and human rights , she told reporters accompanying her .
" Successive administrations and Chinese governments have been poised back and forth on these issues , and we have to continue to press them .
But our pressing on those issues can't interfere with the global economic crisis , the global climate change crisis , and the security crisis , " she told reporters in Seoul , South Korea .
Clinton made China the last and most crucial stopover in her Asia trip , signaling the new administration 's first attempts to lay a foundation toward a China policy .
It is Clinton 's first trip to China as secretary of state .
Watch Clinton talk to CNN about Asian tour »
She met with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Saturday and discussed the framework for further high - level and mid-level discussions .
" It is essential that the United States and China have a positive , cooperative relationship , " Clinton told a group of reporters .
Earlier Saturday , Clinton met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing , where they discussed what they regard as the new defining Sino - U.S. strategic goals : the world economic crisis , regional security and the environment .
Watch report on the talks »
The United States and China are the world 's largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
Human rights , a traditional topic in discussions between the two countries , was broached during Saturday 's meeting between Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi , who agreed to engage in a continuous discussion on the issue .
Secretary Clinton said both nations will continue to hold frank discussions on crucial human rights issues , such as Tibet and freedom of expression in China .
In the past , Clinton has been an outspoken , staunch critic of China 's human rights stance .
In a welcoming response , Yang said China was willing to discuss the often - contentious subject of human rights .
" Although differences exist , China is willing to conduct the dialogues with the U.S. to push forward the human rights situation on the premise of mutual respect and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs , " Yang was quoted by China 's state - run Xinhua news agency as saying .
On the economic front , both leaders emphasized the importance of working in cooperation since their economies are intertwined .
China , the world 's top holder of U.S. debt , wants to ensure liquidity and security in its dealings with U.S. treasury bonds .
" We did use foreign exchange reserves to buy U.S. treasury bonds .
Our principle of using reserves is to ensure security and liquidity , " Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told reporters .
China - U.S. trade volume rose by 10.5 percent in 2008 to 333.7 billion U.S. dollars , Xinhua reported .
According to the Council on Foreign Relations , China is North Korea 's largest trade partner .
It has taken a leadership position in the six - party talks , a multinational diplomatic effort to denuclearize North Korea .
In Seoul , Clinton did not refrain from harsh words , restating the U.S. position on North Korea .
" North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the U.S. while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea , " she said .
Mid -level military discussions will resume this month , Clinton announced Saturday .
Last October , the Bush administration notified Congress of its plan to sell $ 6.5 billion in arms to Taiwan -- a move that caused China to suspend military talks with the U.S .
Clinton told CNN's Senior Correspondent Jill Dougherty that U.S. policy toward Taiwan will not change .
Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.S. President Barack Obama are scheduled to meet at the G20 meeting in London in April .

In what must appear like a lifetime to his loyal fans , the popular DVD ripper aXXo has n't uploaded any torrents for three weeks .
As always , rumors surface that claim to explain the hiatus .
Has aXXo been arrested , or transferred to one of the MPAA 's covert detention facilities ?
Did BitTorrent 's favorite uploader fall off a cliff ?
The most recent torrent uploaded by aXXo dates back to March 11 .
In the days that followed , millions have been waiting anxiously for fresh content , performing their daily aXXo search on their favorite torrent sites in vain .
The aXXo brand has achieved cult status and for some has become synonymous with quality .
Over the years aXXo has grabbed the attention of scammers , the mainstream press and even documentary makers .
So , when he goes silent it is quickly noticed and the demand from his fans for news or an update quickly grows .
This is n’t the first time that aXXo has taken a break from releasing .
Last year there were no new releases for a full four months but eventually aXXo made a glorious return with the topical release of “ I Am Legend . ”
Little is known about the reasons behind aXXo ’s current absence , although he has not disappeared completely .
We can confirm that aXXo has been logging into his account at Mininova , which means that we can safely conclude that aXXo is still among us .
When he plans to surface again is unclear , but time will tell .
It is fascinating to see how aXXo has gathered a following of millions of people in the years after he started uploading his first torrent .
As always , opinions differ and controversy always surrounds aXXo .
He is God to some , while others despise him for his lack of crediting ‘ The Scene ’ but it ’s difficult to criticize his commitment or appreciate the pressure he is undoubtedly under on a daily basis .
Fact is , however , that every aXXo upload is good for a guaranteed entry in our movie download charts , adding up to millions of downloads in a few weeks .
It may be Hollywood ’s worst nightmare , but many independent film producers will dream of having their films ripped by aXXo , ensuring that they are associated with a global brand with an unprecedented reach on BitTorrent .
NEW DELHI : " Indian Muslims are capable of solving their problems ...
We do n't need your advice ..
Do n't try to alienate Indian Muslims by your remarks , here or in Pakistan . "
This blunt message was conveyed to former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf by a prominent Muslim leader Mehmood Madani at a function in India .
Madani , member of Rajya Sabha and leader of Jamat - e - Ulema - i- Hind , made it clear to the Pakistani leader that he or his country need not bother about the condition of Muslims in India .
" Do n't start your politics of Pakistan from here , " Madani told Musharraf after the latter claimed that Muslims in India were alienated and suggested that this was one of the reasons for terrorism here .
Virtually retorting the former Pakistani military ruler , Madani said , " Pakistan ki jitni total population hai , us se zyada population hai Indian Muslims ki .
( Population of Muslims in India is more than that total population of Pakistan ) .
You should be knowing this . "
When Musharraf said he was aware of it , Madani said " If you know this , then you should also know that Indian Muslims have the capability to solve their problems .
We do n't need your advise .
Do n't try to alienate Indian Muslims by your remarks , here or in Pakistan . "
QnA : Zardari or Gilani : The same side of the coin ?
Was Pakistan safer under Musharraf ?
2 Animal Rights Activists Arrested as â€œTerroristsâ€ for Freeing Mink in Utah
Two animal rights activists have been arrested under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act in connection to the release of mink from Utah fur farms .
The crimes are attributed to the Animal Liberation Front , which the FBI labels the “ number one domestic terrorism threat . ”
William Viehl , 22 , and Alex Hall , 20 , were arrested in connection with the August , 2008 release of 300 minks from a South Jordan fur farm .
It caused about $ 10,000 in damages .
Spray painted slogans were found on the scene , including “ No More Mink , No More Murder ” and “ ALF : We Are Watching . ”
The two are also accused of attempting to damage another mink farm a few months later .
The anonymous communiquÃ© for the fur farm raid simply said :
This is a local soldier out of Utah just letting you guys know of a raid that just happened last night at the South Jordan , Utah McMullen Mink Farm , 300 plus mink were released with all their breeding records destroyed .
Good news , have n’t seen this done in a while so it had to be done .
Details of both charges are still quite sparse .
The Department of Justice press release surprisingly does n’t mention the AETA , or the word “ terrorism , ” but the language of the charges are pulled directly from the legislation .
The first charge , a felony related to the raid at McMullin mink farm , could mean up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
The second charge , a misdemeanor , could mean up to a year in prison .
The Utah indictment comes on the heels of the recent Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act charges in California .
In that case , the FBI argues that the activists were involved in a campaign of “ terror ” that including chalking defamatory slogans on the sidewalk , wearing bandanas at a protest , distributing fliers , and attending a protest where an alleged forced entry took place .
Combined , the two sets of arrests reflect the true breadth and depth of the government ’s efforts to wrap up a broad range of political activity as “ eco-terrorism ” and “ animal enterprise terrorism . ”
From First Amendment activity to non-violent direct action saving animals , the government is relentlessly branding all of it as “ terrorism . ”
Unlike what most think of when they hear the word “ terrorism , ” though , none of it–no crime by the Animal Liberation Front , Earth Liberation Front , or related groups –has ever resulted in the loss of a single human life .
Perhaps the most significant difference between Al Qaeda terrorism and “ animal enterprise ” terrorism , a difference that has been completely ignored by mainstream news articles and government press releases , is that one is intended to destroy life while the other is intended to save it .
SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt ( Reuters ) - International donors pledged $ 4.481 billion ( 3.2 billion pounds ) on Monday to help the Palestinian economy and rebuild Gaza after Israel ’s three - week offensive , insisting their funds bypass the territory ’s Hamas rulers .
Gulf Arab states , the United States and the European Commission made significant pledges .
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul
Gheit told a news conference the pledges were new and would be paid over the next two years .
The United Nations and aid agencies said rebuilding the coastal enclave was a daunting task so long as border crossings with battered Gaza remained closed .
“ The situation at the border crossings is intolerable .
Aid workers do not have access .
Essential commodities cannot get in , ” U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told donors at a one - day conference on Gaza in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El - Sheikh .
“ Our first and indispensable goal , therefore , is open crossings .
By the same token , however , it is therefore essential to ensure that illegal weapons do not enter Gaza , ” he said .
Israel and Hamas were not invited to the conference which Egypt had called for after the end of Israel ’s military offensive in Gaza in January .
The Jewish state says it supports efforts to help Palestinians in the strip , but wants assurances the aid money would not reach Hamas militants .
“ We definitely do n’t want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by Hamas and serve Hamas ’s extremist purposes , ” said Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
The Israeli offensive killed 1,300 Palestinians .
Thirteen Israelis also were killed .
The West shuns Hamas because it refuses to recognise Israel , renounce violence and accept peace deals with the Jewish state .
The Islamist Hamas , which is holding talks to form a unity government with the rival Fatah group of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , said the boycott would undercut reconstruction efforts .
“ To bypass the legitimate Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip is a move in the wrong direction , and it deliberately undermines the reconstruction , ” Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in Gaza .
NO MONEY TO HAMAS
The Palestinian Authority had hoped to raise $ 2.78 billion at the event , including $ 1.33 billion for Gaza .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged $ 300 million for Gaza reconstruction and $ 600 million to support the authority ’s budget shortfalls , economic reforms and security and private sector projects run by the PA .

She was adamant that none of the money , which has to be agreed by the U.S. Congress , would go to Hamas .
“ We have worked with the Palestinian Authority to install safeguards that will ensure our funding is only used where and for whom it is intended and does not end up in the wrong hands , ” she said .
The European Commission pledged 440 million euros ( 395.8 million pounds ) for Gaza and Palestinian Authority reforms , compared to 487 million euros in 2008 .
Gulf Arab states pledged about $ 1.65 billion and said their donations will go through a special mechanism launched on Sunday in the Saudi capital .

Western diplomats said donors in 2007 had pledged $ 7.7 billion in aid over three years , but the Palestinians complained that only a fraction of that money was paid out on time .
It also remains unclear whether Israel would open Gaza ’s border crossings to large quantities of supplies like cement and steel needed to rebuild .
Israel refuses the entry of materials it says could be also used by militants to build rockets .
“ Gaza should not actually be a prison with open skies , ” French President Nicolas Sarkozy said through an interpreter .
Israel tightened its grip on Gaza ’s border crossings after Hamas took control in June 2007 , and says it will closely manage Gaza reconstruction by requiring project - by - project approval and guarantees that projects will not benefit Hamas .
Egypt , which also borders Gaza , refuses to open its Rafah crossing for normal traffic , rather than for limited access .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said aid needed to reach Gaza , be well spent and sustained .
“ Otherwise the saga of reconstruction and destruction will go on and on , ” he added .
The PlayStation Network ramped up its offerings yesterday with the introduction of movies and television shows from NBC Universal .
The content is available for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable devices in the United States only , and will be available in standard definition with some titles in HD .
Sony will allow you to transfer some content between devices tied to one PSN account ; however , the company did n't say what that content was .
According to its statement , Sony will allow you to " transfer and view certain types of content on multiple devices . "
The main focus will be the ability to transfer content from the PS3 to the PSP , similar to how you can sync your iPod with the iTunes library on your computer .
However , you will also be able to purchase content directly from your PSP .
Movies from Universal Studios available at launch include Wanted , Hellboy II : The Golden Army , Death Race , The Incredible Hulk , Burn After Reading , The 40 - Year - Old Virgin , and The Big Lebowski .
NBC's TV programming includes The Office , Heroes and 30 Rock , as well as SCI FI 's Battlestar Galactica and Eureka .
With the addition of NBC Universal to the PlayStation Store , Sony now has content from all the major studios , with nearly 6000 TV episodes and movies available .
But that number pales in comparison with Xbox Live 's 30,000 titles and the much wider selection of content on the iTunes Store .
Sony has been trying to play catch - up in the premium content arena , and while its library may not be as wide as other retailers , it may only be a matter of time now that contracts are in place with all the major providers .
Sony 's PSN may also have an advantage over its closest competitor , Microsoft 's Xbox Live , because the PSN is free to access by any account holder , while Xbox Live requires an annual membership fee .
Sony boasts 20 million registered members , compared to Xbox 's 17 million users who have accessed their system in the last six months .
Sony calls the PS3 " the ultimate entertainment platform , " and claims it now has " the largest selection of movies on any gaming platform . "
Sony and Microsoft are in a struggle to provide the best all - in - one entertainment device for the home as entertainment moves online .
Sony relaunched the PlayStation Network Store last summer , shortly after Microsoft announced a deal to bring Netflix streaming to the Xbox .
Neither side can really claim supremacy at the moment , but if Sony can increase its content , the advantage of having a portable device ( the PSP ) that works with , and separately from , the PS3 may just put it on top .
The UK government wants to cut out users rights to access Internet content , applications and services .
Some of the information used to justify the change has been cut and pasted from the Wikipedia .
Amendments to the Telecoms Package circulated in Brussels by the UK government , seek to cross out users ' rights to access and distribute Internet content and services .
And they want to replace it with a ‘ principle ' that users can be told not only the conditions for access , but also the conditions for the use of applications and services .
The UK government texts have been heavily criticised by the French campaigning group La Quadrature du Net .
It is believed that they could have been drawn up by the UK regulator , Ofcom .
The amendments have also appeared in a set of compromise proposals put forward by the Czech Presidency for the Universal Services Directive ( Harbour report ) .
The proposed amendments cut out completely any users ' rights to do with content - whether accessing or distributing - which would appear to be in breach of the European Charter of Fundamental rights , Article 10 .
The Charter states that everyone has the right " to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . "
In the digital age , the Internet , and the associated applications and services provided by the World Wide Web , is the means by which people exercise that right .
“ NRAs shall promote the interests of the citizens of the European Union by inter alia :
( g ) applying the principle that end - users should be able there should be transparency of conditions under which services are provided , including information on the conditions of to access to and / or use of and distribute information or run applications and services , and of any traffic management policies of their choice
The wording " conditions under which services are provided " and " conditions of use " also allude to the principle of conditional access which applies to satellite and cable television .
In EU law , it is established in the Conditional Access Directive ( Directive 98/84 / EC ) which concerns protection of copyright on satellite and cable television systems .
The subscription television model is alluded to
in the ‘ Rationale ' for the amendments :
" We are already familiar with this in the broadcasting world , where certain cable or satellite operators may enter into exclusive agreements with content providers ( like Sky and Premier League football ) .
Similar arrangements may also exist in the electronic communications world "
La Quadrature du
Net comments that these amendments will obligate national telecommunications regulators to enforce a new business model , which is more like a cable television model and quite different from the Internet service provider model .
At the same time , they remove the obligation from telecommunications regulators to guarantee users ' rights to access and distribute Internet content services and applications .
The amendments , if carried , would reverse the principle of end - to - end connectivity which has underpinned not only the Internet , but also European telecommunications policy , to date .
Such a reversal would lead to a fragmentation of the internal market for communications and for e-commerce .
If for example , the UK wants to limit users to just a few websites ( as is rumoured lie behind the amendments ) , then it is not only restricting the subscriber who is paying for the service .
The effect will be that it renders invisible the millions of other websites that are not on the ‘ just a few ' list .
By default , this reduces the size of the market that is available to those millions of invisible websites .
It also threatens the business models of Internet giants such as Google .
In terms of the Telecoms Package negotiations , these amendments will put the Council in direct conflict with the European Commission .
They set the Council against the Commission 's objective of building up the digital economy .
The commissioner for Consumer Protection , Meglena Kuneva , said last week that she wants to remove barriers to cross - border online commerce in the EU .
She highlighted market fragmentation , and especially fragmentation due to intellectual property protection , as one of the main barriers that she wants to address .
The Commissioner for Information Society , Viviane Reding has stated that she supports the Internet in Europe staying open .
She said in a speech last month that " Net Neutrality has to be guaranteed .
New network managementtechniques allow traffic prioritisation .
These tools may be used to guarantee goodquality of service but could also be used for anti-competitive practices . "
They also deepen the division between the Council and the European Parliament on users and citizens rights in respect of the Internet .
The UK amendments are in direct conflict with the citizens ' safeguards enshrined in Amendment 138 to the Framework directive ( Article 8.4 ( fa of the revised Trautmann report ) and Amendment 166 ( Article 32a ) to the Universal Services directive .
These proposals can be expected to be on the table for discussion in the trialogues between the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council taking place this month .
Some sources suggest that the document was prepared by civil servants attached to the UK .
It 's possible that they were on the agenda for the IMCO committee meeting today , which was to discuss the revised Harbour report .
The UK amendments will also put the Council in conflict with its own resolution of 27 November 2008 , where it stated that : " future Internet developments , whether gradual or disruptive , and whether they concern the Internet 's infrastructure , services or applications , represent major opportunities for Europe , requiring ambitious research and development work " and that " open and non discriminatory access to the Internet should be promoted in order to ensure effective competition and an innovation - friendly environment " .
It 's also interesting that the UK government 's amendments make a direct link between the conditional access to Internet content and services , and the so - called " traffic management systems " .
Aside from the many issues raised by " traffic management systems " , there is one specific point at issue here .
In the accompanying recital - which is supposed to provide guidance - the definition of traffic management has been cut and pasted from the Wikipedia .
This is revealed by a quick comparison of the Council 's proposed text ( Presidency compromise , Article 20 ) with the UK proposed amendments , and the opening text from a page about bandwidth management in Wikipedia .
There is an obvious irony that the very person seeking to close off the Internet , turns first to the most open reference source on the Internet , in order to obtain a definition .
I was alerted to it by the naive wording about ‘ filling the link ' - this text is after all , intended to form part of the law governing the telecommunications regulatory framework for the EU .
Presidency ( Council ) proposed ‘ compromise ' amendment :
Article 20.1 ( b )
- information on the conditions
regarding access to and / or use of
services and applications , including
information on any traffic management
policies and on how these may impact
on the delivery of the service .
New recital :
Traffic management policies are the
procedures put in place by the provider
in order to measure and control traffic
on a network link so as to avoid filling
the link to capacity or overfilling the
link , which would result in network
congestion and poor performance .
These policies are deemed appropriate
and reasonable as long as it can be
justified that they are not anticompetitive
or do not give preferential
treatment to the services or applications
of the network operators or their
commercial partners over the services
and applications from other providers
The UK proposed amendments :
New recital
" Traffic management policies , are an example of such limitations , which could
have an impact on the delivery of the service .
Traffic management policies are
the procedures put in place by the provider in order to measure and control
traffic on a network link so as to avoid filling the link to capacity or overfilling
the link , which would result in network congestion and poor performance . "
The text from a page about bandwidth management in Wikipedia :
bandwidth management is the process of measuring and controlling the communications ( traffic , packets ) on a network link , to avoid filling the link to capacity or overfilling the link , which would result in network congestion and poor performance .
The Telecoms Package is the most important piece of legislation concerning the Internet , currently going through the European legislature .
It will determine , among other things , the way that the Internet will operate in the foreseable future .
I have written a new paper which addresses some of the issues related to traffic management systems which will shortly be available .

9 March 2009 .
PESHAWAR , Pakistan  Pakistan government officials said they struck a deal on Monday to accept a legal system compatible with Shariah law in the violent Swat region in return for peace .
The agreement contradicted American demands for the Pakistan authorities to fight harder against militants , and seemed certain to raise fears in Washington that a perilous precedent had been set across a volatile region where U.S. forces are fighting Taliban militants operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The latest sign of the battle came early on Monday when a suspected United States drone fired four missiles into another area of northwestern Pakistan , close to the Afghan border , killing 31 people , according to a government official and a resident .
The deal on the Swat region was conditional on both sides fulfilling their side of the bargain , government officials said .
Re-Volt
I do n’t like racing games , it ’s become clear to me .
I do n’t enjoy Gran Turismo , I do n’t play Need For Speed , and I only truly played one racing game I enjoyed , Mario Kart .
But now , I ’ve found another game worthy of being so excellent , so refined and polished , that I can actually go on saying that I love this game .
It ’s entirely perfect in my eyes , and there could n’t be a better racing game .
That ’s a opinion of course , but a opinion needs reasoning , and that ’s my next step .
The first thing you ’ll notice is the standard resolution of Re-Volt , at a low 640 - 480 .
Once you ’ve made a visit to options , and you ’ve set it all the way up to 1024 - 786 , you ’ll notice the beauty of this game .
Reflective surfaces are everywhere they need to be , the clean floors of a grocery store , the sleek and shiny RC - cars , and the marble floors of a large museum .
Effects are vibrant and colorful , not to mention pleasing to the eyes , everything from a flare impacting on another racer , or a oil puddle sending vehicles trailing off with oily skid marks , look perfect .
The vehicles in Re-volt are n’t exactly what you ’d expect , instead of some Porsche that can speed over 200 MPH , you commandeer small RC cars that zoom around the interiors of various buildings .
Although this might drive off the more “ hardcore ” gaming crowd with it ’s initial childishness , missing this would be a foolish mistake .
On harder difficulties , the computer racers are brutal and unforgiving , weapons you unleash on other vehicles are perfectly balanced and all serve a use , and there are even unlock able RC’s .
Weaponry ranges from homing fireworks that you send after targeted enemies , rolling metal balls to speed down the path of oncoming opponents , and even a kamikaze like “ self - detonation ” weapon that ’ll send nearby cars flying .
Weapons are n’t merely here to be fired off in full blazing glory , each and every one of them has tactical purposes .
Using oil - slicks in narrow doorways can force cars to run through the slippery mess , or maybe even using “ self - detonation ” to send other cars off the path .
You ’ll hardly find yourself bored in the various tracks that each offer another play method to perfect .
Sound is another joy .
Your environment actually makes you feel small , like the little RC you are controlling , all provided by the echoing and humming of the large interiors .
The exteriors are filled with the expected sounds , your RC grinds as it zooms across gravel , there ’s a nice feeling of a Sunday afternoon as you race through a suburban neighborhood .
My favorite atmospheric sounds though , is the little buzzing your RC creates .
It ’s a subtle yet perfect touch , and it never seems to grow annoying or repetitive .
Always , that buzzing keeps me coming back .
Overall , I ca n’t give Re-Volt any negatives , most likely the only problem would be the loading length .
Even on my high end PC , it took about 20 seconds to load a certain level .
Another problem would be a incredibly rare bug , where the loading screen flips sideways from some reason , ( The game runs normally though . )
But these are all minor problems , and wo n’t detract from Re -Volt ’s final score .
I stand by my 5 , you ca n’t keep a good racer back .
Once you know you ’ve found a racing game with merits , you ’ll play it for quite some time .
Re-Volt is a addictive racer that will most likely please you , and if it does n’t , well that ’s your taste in gaming .
Despite it ’s large size , just wait for the download , it ’ll be worth it .
If you 'd like to play this game with your friends online , head over here and get RVHouse , with which you can host and join online Re-vol games .
There 's also still a large community behind this game .
Lake thronged with 10 million jellyfish ... but do n't worry , they 've lost their sting
If jellyfish make you feel wobbly then look away now .
Astonishing photos have revealed a lake where 10 million of the creatures live because they are at no risk from predators .
Hundreds of years ago the lake had an outlet to the ocean but when the sea level dropped the jellyfish population were isolated in the algae - rich lake and began to thrive .
Amateur photographer Vlad Levantovsky snapped his daughter Rachel swimming in Jellyfish Lake
Mr Levantovsky said the lake was like a soup of jellyfish
With no risk of being eaten , the jellies multiplied in the lake on the Pacific island of Palau .
Over time their stings weakened and visitors can now swim alongside them with no fear of being stung .
Amateur photographer Vlad Levantovsky captured their habitat with an underwater camera while on a family holiday with wife Olga and daughter Rachel in January this year .
Mr Levantovsky , a 47 year old computer scientist from Boston , USA , described the lake as being like a ' soup ' of jellyfish .
He said : ' Even though I had known about the lake , getting in the water and seeing clouds of jelly fishes was an exhilarating experience .
' The further we swam towards the middle of the lake , the more jellyfishes were surrounding us . '
A close - up view of the jellyfish .
They have all evolved from a common ancestor
He added : ' I think there were literally thousands of them in the water around us , and at times it felt like we were swimming in a jelly soup .
' We were moving very slowly in order not to damage these gentle creatures . '
However , those who wish to follow in Mr Levantovsky 's footsteps must get a government - issued permit from the Palauan government because the lake is protected .
Scuba diving is forbidden and only snorkeling is allowed .
Jellyfish Lake , known to Palau 's natives as Ongeim'l Tketau , is one of over 70 similar saltwater lakes in the islands and contains over ten million jellyfish descended from a common ancestor , the spotted jellyfish .
Palau is around 500 miles east of the Philippines and 2,000 miles south of Tokyo .
Edward Davidson , who was known as the " spam king " ( although the moniker has been given to nearly every spammer who has ever been caught ) has been found dead in Colorado , along with his wife and 3 - year - old child , apparently in a murder - suicide .
Another child approximately 7 months old was found unhurt , and a teenage daughter had been shot in the neck with a bullet but managed to run away .
Davidson had escaped from a minimum - security facility on Sunday – essentially a work camp – allegedly with help from his wife .
Authorities estimate Davidson made at least $ 3.5 million from spamming activities conducted by his company Power Promoters between 2003 and 2006 .
He 'd been sentenced in April to 21 months in prison for tax evasion and falsifying e-mail headers on spam advertising low - cost high - risk penny stocks that he sent out on behalf of an unnamed Houston company .
He 'd also been ordered to pay $ 714,139 to the Internal Revenue Service .

Google ( GOOG ) VP Marissa Mayer talked a little smack about Yahoo's ( YHOO ) engineers on Charlie Rose last night .
Charlie asked her why " Yahoo lost its place " and Marissa answered :
" I definitely think that what drive technology companies is the people .
In a technology company it 's always about what are you going to do next .
So it comes down to who 's going to build that thing you do next .
If you have the best people , that 's a huge benefit .
I do think that some of what happened with Yahoo is a little bit of that lost focus .
But I think that over the events of recent years they 've lost a lot of their good people . "
Guess nobody told Marissa we 'd rather own Yahoo than Google .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Home Depot , the No. 1 home improvement retailer , announced Monday that it is shutting down its high - end decor EXPO business and shrinking its support staff , with both moves resulting in a reduction of 7,000 jobs .
Atlanta - based Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) said the staff cuts impact 2 % of its total workforce .
The company said the the latest job cuts will not affect any customer service positions in its Home Depot stores .
" Exiting our EXPO business is a difficult decision , particularly given the hard work and dedication of our associates in that business and the support of our loyal customers , " Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said in a statement .
" At the same time , it is a necessary decision that will strengthen our core Home Depot business . "
The company said in a statement that its EXPO business has not performed well financially and is not expected to anytime soon .
" Even during the recent housing boom , it was not a strong business .
It has weakened significantly as the demand for big ticket design and decor projects has declined in the current economic environment .
Continuing this business would divert focus and resources from the company 's core [ Home Depot ] stores , " the statement said .
Over the next two months , the closure of 34 EXPO Design Center stores , five YardBIRDS stores , two Design Center stores and a bath remodeling business known as HD Bath will impact 5,000 jobs , the company said .
Additionally , the retailer said it will reduce support staff , impacting about 2,000 employees and resulting in a 10 % reduction in the company 's officer ranks .
" A leaner organization has to start at the top , " Blake said in a conference call with analysts to discuss Monday 's announcement .
Home Depot currently operates 2,274 with a total of 300,000 employees .
" Home Depot 's news really reflects what is going on at corporations .
Companies have to cut expenses and focus on where they think consumer spending is going to be , " said Bill Schultz , chief investment officer with McQueen , Ball & Associates , a firm with over $ 750 million in assets , including Target ( TGT , Fortune 500 ) , Procter & Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) and PepsiCo ( PEP , Fortune 500 ) .
" We really need a turn in the housing market to turn the situation around for Home Depot , Lowe 's ( LOW , Fortune 500 ) and plenty of other retailers , " he said .
" These retailers can't really control sales in this environment .
So they have to cut back on expenses . "
Schultz said he sold his portfolio's $ 1 million shares in Home Depot about a year ago .
" We were very worried about the softness in the housing market .
Home Depot is the leader in the market and they were hit early , " Schultz said .
" We 'll probably take a look at Home Depot again , but not just yet . "
Home Depot also announced a salary freeze for all of its officers , although the retailer would continue to offer merit increases to non-officer level staff , earned bonuses and the company 's existing 401 ( k ) matching contribution for all employees , including officers .
The company reiterated its previously announced full - year sales and profit guidance .
Home Depot expects sales for the year ending this month to drop by 8 % and earnings per share from continuing operations to decline by 24 % , excluding charges associated with the latest job cuts and store closings
Analysts expect Home Depot to post full - year profit of $ 1.73 a share on sales of $ 71.5 billion , according to Thomson Reuters .
For 2009 , Home Depot said it expects continued weakness in sales but that the retailer does not plan to close any of its namesake stores .
The company said it will cut capital expenditure to approximately $ 1 billion and will open 12 stores .
Blake said the company would look for opportunities to open smaller stores that require lower construction costs that its typical more than 100,000 square feet big - box stores .
Company executives also said during the conference call that half of the new stores will open outside the United States , in Mexico and Canada .
Home Depot is not planning to expand on its 12 stores in China in 2009 .
Home Depot will report its full - year results on Feb. 24 .

Mark Sanford blasts " Zimbabwe " stimulus
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , whose state has the second - worst - in - the - nation 10.4 percent unemployment rate , on Wednesday compared supporters of the stimulus package to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe .
Sanford told reporters in South Carolina that he still intends to turn down millions in stimulus cash , despite the likelihood of his state legislature accepting the cash -- and criticism by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - SC ) that rejecting any payments would disproportionately harm African American residents .
" What you 're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we do n't have , send it to different states - we 'll create jobs ...
If that 's the case why is n't Zimbabwe a rich place ? " ... " why is n't Zimbabwe just an incredibly prosperous place .
Cause they 're printing money they do n't have and sending it around to their different - I do n't know the towns in Zimbabwe but that same logic is being applied there with little effect . "

Beyond Iraq , beyond the economy , beyond health care , there was something even more fundamental at stake in this U.S. election won by Barack Obama : the self - respect of the American people .
For almost eight years , Americans have seen words stripped of meaning , lives sacrificed to confront nonexistent Iraqi weapons and other existences ravaged by serial incompetence on an epic scale .
Against all this , Obama made a simple bet and stuck to it .
If you trusted in the fundamental decency , civility and good sense of the American people , even at the end of a season of fear and loss , you could forge a new politics and win the day .
Four years ago , at the Democratic convention , in the speech that lifted him from obscurity , Obama said : “ For alongside our famous individualism , there ’s another ingredient in the American saga : a belief that we are connected as one people . ”
I wonder how many safety hazards this tree - bound tea house has .
Designed by architect Terunobu Fujimori , Takasugi-an is located in Chino , Nagano Prefecture , Japan and built atop two chestnut trees , cut from a nearby mountain and transported to the site .
Takasugi - an literally means “ a teahouse too high . ”
Guests must climb a freestanding ladder , which leans against one of the trees in order to reach the little house .
Midway up the ladder , guests must remove their shoes and leave them on the platform .
In Japan , tea masters have traditionally maintained total control over their construction of their tea houses .
Their main concern for these “ enclosures ” was simplicity , and in order to keep things simple , tea masters preferred not to involve architects or craftsman to help them with the construction .
Building upon this tradition , Fujimori's tea house is quite small and compact , and can accommodate four and a half tatami mats ( 29 sq ft ) .
The architect describes the small building as though “ it were an extension of one 's body , like a piece of clothing . ”
However Fujimori's main concern is not necessarily the art of tea making , but pushing the limits and constraints of a traditional tea house .
The interior of the tea house is constructed from simple materials such as plaster and bamboo .
Once inside , you can almost forget that you are in a tree house high above the ground due to the serene and calm interior .
Three windows frame the views of the surrounding valley and the town in which Fujimori grew up .

Scott Silvestri , a spokesman for Bank of America , which bought Merrill in December , would not respond to that claim , but said in a statement , “ The safety and security of our associates is paramount , and we will always take the appropriate steps . ”
And there may be more protests .
The Connecticut Working Families party , which has support from organized labor , is planning a bus tour of A.I.G. executives ’ homes on Saturday , with a stop at the company ’s Wilton office .
“ We ’re going to be peaceful and lawful in everything we do , ” said Jon Green , the director of Connecticut Working Families .
“ I know there ’s a lot of anger and a lot of rage about what ’s happened .
We ’re not looking to foment that unnecessarily , but what we want to do is give folks in Bridgeport and Hartford and other parts of Connecticut who are struggling and losing their homes and their jobs and their health insurance an opportunity to see what kinds of lifestyle billions of dollars in credit - default swaps can buy . ”
A.I.G. paid the $ 165 million in bonuses to 463 of its executives , but in the uproar that erupted when the payments were made public , Mr. Liddy asked the employees to return much of that money .
He said that many of them have agreed to do so .
The New York attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , said on Thursday that A.I.G. had handed over a list with the names of the bonus recipients .
But he did not release the list .
“ We are aware of the security concerns of A.I.G. employees , ” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement , “ and we will be sensitive to those issues by doing a risk assessment before releasing any individual ’s name . ”
It was unclear exactly what measures the officials at A.I.G. have taken in the name of protecting the company ’s executives .
Officials at several police departments in Connecticut towns where A.I.G. executives live said they did not know about possible threats against the bonus recipients .
“ We have n’t heard of it , ” said Sgt. Carol Ogrinc of the New Canaan police .
“ There have been no complaints made to our department . ”
But several security companies in New York credited the financial crisis with a noticeable increase in some areas of their business , from protecting executives to dispatching bomb - sniffing dogs to check for trouble .
“ There is certainly anger among people about the economy and fear among corporate executives themselves , ” said Patrick Timlin , the president of Michael Stapleton Associates , which provides bomb - dog teams .

An Oakland Police officer shot Saturday during a series of gunbattles that claimed the lives of three other officers died this morning , Oakland police said today .
Motorcycle officer John Hege , 41 , had been in grave condition after being shot during a traffic stop at about 1:15 p.m. Saturday .
He was pronounced dead at noon today , according to Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason .
Hege 's fellow motorcycle officer , Sgt. Mark Dunakin , died at the scene of that shooting .
Two hours later , a SWAT team exchanged gunfire with a suspect in an apartment on 74th Avenue near Hillside Street .
Two SWAT officers , Sgt. Ervin Romans and Sgt. Daniel Sakai , died in that battle as did the suspect , identified by police as Lovelle Mixon , 26 .
A fifth member of the SWAT team was also shot , treated for minor injuries and released .
It 's dead obvious that creationism is n't science , or even bad science .
It 's nonsense .
But I 've long stated it 's also bad religion , because it does n't just take faith , it also takes a phenomenal disregard of reality .
Moderate Christians should distance themselves from such garbage , as it is a clear distortion of the Bible .
The creation story in Genesis has two self - contradicting versions !
That 's why this video pleased me .
It 's from a moderate man , a religious one , but one who sees what folly young - Earth creationism is .
I recommend watching it .
He even points out he disagrees with atheists on things , but in this case he knows creationism is a crock .
And with what 's going on Texas right now , what he says is more important than ever .
I receive email and comments on my blog from religious people saying I hate Christians .
I find that funny , and ironic , given what Jesus said on the Sermon on the Mount contrasted with the commentor 's obvious attitude toward me .
Still , that claim is ridiculous .
I do n't hate Christians , nor do I ever say that people cannot believe whatever they want .
You can believe what you want , including the grossly ridiculous idea that the Earth is 6000 years old .
That 's your right .
But that right stops when you try to make laws based on your belief , and when you try to tell an entire country how your religion should be the only thing taught in science class , and when your belief system affects people 's health , welfare , and well - being .
Creationism and fundamentalism do just that .
I will not sway from my stance that I will not allow laws in this country to be based on a narrow sect 's belief system , whether it aligns with reality or not ( and in the case of creationists , it 's way way not ) .
I will continue to be vocal , I will continue to fight , and I will do what I can to make sure this country stays free .

President Barack Obama sent the strongest warning yet that AIG had better back off their plan to award $ 165 million in bonuses , as he announced that Treasury Secretary Tim Gueither is exploring every legal option to block these bonuses .
Obama asked how a company that was bailed out by the taxpayers can believe that their executives deserve bonuses .
The President said , “ This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed .
Under these circumstances , it ’s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay .
How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? ”
Obama continued , “ In the last six months , AIG has received substantial sums from the US Treasury .
I ’ve asked Secretary Geithner to use that leverage and pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole .
I know he ’s working to resolve this matter with the new CEO , Edward Liddy , who came on board after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . ”

Since the AIG money is not in the TARP , but it technically is n’t taxpayer money .
The bigger problem might be that AIG can’t pay back the government .
AIG put out a statement last night which said that they did n’t have the money .
They used much of the federal funds to pay banks that they were in debt to .
The government is an 80 % stakeholder in AIG , which means that they should have the ability to challenge and block these executive bonuses .
As I stated last night , if AIG was smart , keeping in mind that people who are trying to claim bonuses also ran the company into the ground , they would announce that they are going to not pay the bonuses .
If I took over a company like AIG , those executives would not have to worry about bonuses , because they would be fired .
Without the generosity of the tax payers , AIG would not be in business , and for the life of me , I ca n’t understand why anyone at AIG would have thought that paying these bonuses was a good idea .
Now that the White House has weighed in , the campaign of shame is in full swing .

Bollywood - the Indian cinema center heart - a place of songs , music , dance and magic movies !
Both population and flora and fauna , geographic and climate system are among the most diverse in the world .
India - a country with a civilization more than 5,000 years of mystery , traditions , contradictions , and of course bollywood film and bollywood music !
Bollywood film industry is the most prolific in the world and its center consists in bollywood production ( its name is derived from Bombay , the former name of Mumbai city , whose studios are located in the capital of Maharashtra and who mainly commercial bollywood movies .
Cinema is an art and a form of entertainment very popular in India irrespective of age , sex , caste , social or geographical origin of the Indians , the latter attending massive in cinema .
Bollywood film cinema summarizes most productions , with 800-900 feature films produced annually .
Not many years ago has beaten the record of 1,000 bollywood movies .
Bollywood is bigger than Hollywood and Indian audience is very loyal to their national bollywood film cinema .
About 13 million people go to the cinema every day .
Even a low - income family goes to the cinema at least once a week .
Hardly one can find , in India , more important than cinema and therefore than bollywood films .
The bollywood film tells the story much easier to follow , is funny , even touching a topic as can be serious and remains socially engaged .
This new style of bollywood films cinema was called Hinglish .
It is the language of a new generation , heavily influenced by India 's great economic progress and social changes through which it passes .
Bollywood movie directors bold striking style with determination through their bollywood films in the wall traditionalism .
Directors proposed acidic satire and comedy to illustrate the complexity of a society in its full progress .
By Hinglish means a free and modern form of bollywood films cinema that inspires the subject until recently considered taboo , such as sexual fantasies , exotic lingerie , adultery , homosexuality , corruption and unemployment , to promote bollywood pictures , bollywood actress pics , bollywood concert , bollywood music , bollywood songs .
The content of these bollywood movies is more realistic from popular bollywood movies , the characters are more defined , traits receive substantial plot that is more complex .
The birth of Bollywood is dated May 3 , 1913 .
Bollywood film cinema was silent then .
“ Raja Harishchandra ” bollywood film enjoys a huge success , even if bollywood actresses ’ characters were played by men - cinema was the profession forbidden to women .
Govind Phalke Dhundiraj made about 100 bollywood films before being removed from cinema , appeared in 1930 .
For many , the 1950s were dubbed the “ golden age " of bollywood film cinema , the emergence of the great filmmakers of the time , like Satyajit Ray , considered the greatest bollywood filmmaker , born not from Mumbai ( Bombay ) , but competing studios of West Bengal .
In the 1970s and 1980s , bollywood films sector has gained in professionalism , but also in commercial productions .
At the limit , the bollywood film directors approached realistic cinema style like “ Arth ” , by Mahesh Bhatt ( 1982 ) , which shows a link adulteress and that highlights the roles of strong women characters .
Bollywood films cinema has crossed then a difficult decade : color TV , internet piracy and money dependence of mobs have jeopardized momentum .
Then the Indian economy began to open in early 1990 .
Funding sources were diversified .
Fox and Disney studios have opened branches in Mumbai .
Ten years later , was the bollywood films cinema industry time .
Rich , popular , now is need to diversify , to leave the U.S. back on track that followed bollywood a little too easy , say some critics .
Innovative bollywood filmmakers begin to make a name in the industry worldwide , and Anurag Kashyap , whose film “ indie Hindi was touring major festivals in the world .
According to Raj Nidimoru , co director the film “ Go Goa Gone ” , one of the first Indian movie with zombies , alternative cinema in India is just getting his first steps :
“ Now it 's just a ripple , but will soon become a wave ! ”
Also bollywood soap operas are bollywood films written , produced and filmed in India , with bollywood actors and bollywood actresses ( not to be confused with the Indians in Western movies , unrelated to bollywood soap opera ) .
Bollywood soap operas daily , weekly , or twice a week and are running on special television networks in India as Star Network , Sony Entertainment , Sun Network , Doordarshan , Zee TV .
But these bollywood films soap operas are not broadcast only in India but in many suitable places , such as the U.S. , UK , and other European countries , including Romania , and South Africa and Australia .
Languages ​​that prevail in bollywood films soap operas and in bollywood movies are those usually used in India , though many of these Indian soaps use a mix of Indian and English .
Bollywood movies Hindi soap operas or serials as they are called , have a number of features .
Typically Indian soaps ( Hindi series ) are stereotyped , such as the story and the characters in their features .
One of the first Bollywood movies soap opera was Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi with Bahu Thi .
In this first bollywood film soap was the story of an Indian businessman , the son of a humble and loyal wife and son .
Immediately after the show , there was another Indian soap opera , Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii , which would translate “ Story of our houses ( families ) ” where as it was about a family of businessmen , a much - loved son , etc .
Although the bollywood films are somewhat parallel similarity is quite high , writers usually try to shock the audience through various extreme scenes .
Basically , they are using the leap time jump ( about 20 years usually ) - it appears when the show ends an era and the next episode ; then continuous over 20 years ( more or less ) later , the effect of aging is highlighted with a few strips of white paint in the hair of bollywood actresses , and a few shades of gray the hair or mustache for bollywood actors .
The scenario of characters ’ face changing encountered especially in bollywood soap operas is characterized by changing a character 's face , for example , a doctor , after a car accident .
In some scenarios the patient loses his memory , and combined with the effect “ leap of 20 years ” can be a part of Indian series plot .
But as can be seen bollywood movies and bollywood songs have all that is needed to relax : a little bit of magic !

TOKYO — Kazuhiro Yamada may describe himself as an innocent victim of the recession , but he is unlikely to win much sympathy .
Until he lost his job last year , Yamada , who prefers not to reveal his real name , was a member of the Sumiyoshi- kai , one of Japan ’s most notorious crime syndicates , or yakuza .
As a mid-ranking mobster in greater Tokyo , his duties included shaking down businesses for protection money , chauffeuring his bosses around town and , on occasion , providing muscle when his gang ’s relations with associates threatened to turn sour .
Then , at short notice , he was unceremoniously dumped for not paying his dues , a non-negotiable condition of yakuza membership from the lowliest mobster to the men at the very apex of their criminal careers .
" Without the organization behind me , what am I supposed to do ?
Who 's going to hire an old man covered in tattoos with a missing digit ? ” he says of his vanished pinkie , hacked off in a ritual act of penitence for a past misdeed he ’d rather not discuss .
“ I ’m too old for construction work and I can't see how I can learn to type with only nine fingers , so that pretty much rules out a white - collar job . ”
Now only just the right side of 50 , Yamada is just one of countless gang members feeling the pinch from the global economic downturn and stock market collapse .
After a year in which the Nikkei index shed almost 50 percent and Japan officially entered recession , the yakuza , like other market players , can only look on in horror as the world ’s second - biggest economy teeters on the brink of meltdown .
In better times , yakuza foot soldiers bankrolled their hedonism – expensive cars , clothes and women – with a seemingly endless supply of profits from traditional cash cows such as gambling , prostitution , drugs , loan sharking and protection rackets .
It was a time when gangs proudly displayed their insignia at the entrance of their headquarters , swapped information with detectives over drinks in classy hostess bars and dined with senior politicians and wealthy construction magnates .
The legal squeeze began in 1992 with the introduction of the toughest anti-yakuza laws to date , forcing them to conceal their telltale tattoos and swap their gaudy suits for bespoke Italian cloth , as organised crime went white collar .
The change in tactics paid off , but only as long as the economy stayed on its upward trajectory after the lean years of the “ lost decade ” of 1990s recession .
To stock price manipulation and property sales the yakuza have added wedding and funeral services , talent agencies , and even bakeries and flower shops to its portfolio .
It is not for nothing that the Yamaguchi - gumi , by far the biggest of Japan ’s 27 gangs , is known as a “ Wal - Mart ” of the yakuza .
Last year the National Police Agency [ NPA ] , spooked by organised crime ’s assault on the property and securities markets , warned that its involvement in the regular economy was “ disease that will shake the foundations of the economy . ”
Despite promises to take on the mob , the police have yet to make inroads into organized crime .
Yakuza membership is not illegal and , unlike their FBI counterparts , Japanese investigators are banned from using wiretapping , witness protection and other tools that would bring the arrests they crave .
According to the NPA Japan is home to 80,000 gangsters , about half of whom belong to the Yamaguchi - gumi , with footholds in dozens of businesses in Japan and the United States , and increasingly , Russia and China .
Takashi Kadokura , the author of two popular books on Japan ’s underground economy , estimates the yakuza ’s illegal income amounts to as much as 1.6 trillion yen ( $ 17.5 billion ) a year .
Its financial chicanery is so broad and complex that the size of its legal income will forever be a mystery .
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission has identified more than 50 listed firms with links to organized crime , and the Tokyo metropolitan police has listed about 1,000 yakuza front companies , about 20 percent of them involving real estate .
The public and police remained largely tolerant of the yakuza , which reciprocated by keeping violence to a minimum and ensuring civilians did not become the victims of stray bullets .
But now fears are growing that intense competition for dwindling financial spoils will spark an escalation of the violence .
The past two years have seen several shootings in Tokyo as the Yamaguchi - gumi , keen to expand beyond its western Japan base , attempts to seize control of lucrative parts of the capital such as Akasaka and Roppongi .
“ The recession affects the yakuza just like everyone else , ” says Jake Adelstein , an underworld authority and former crime reporter for the Japanese daily the Yomiuri Shimbun .
“ As the economy worsens the spoils will diminish , gang membership will fall and more squabbles and fights will break out .
“ They are losing investments in real estate and that means losing jobs as well .
The consolidation of businesses through mergers and acquisitions is also freezing them out .
Just like the banks , they have loaned money to people who can no longer afford to pay them back . ”
Denied their usual incomes , many gangsters are turning to the state for help .
Last month officials admitted that hard - up yakuza members had claimed millions of dollars in unemployment and other benefits by producing fake letters of excommunication from their gang bosses .
Yamada , who is selling off his possessions to make ends meet , says he will soon be joining the ranks of the yakuza dispossessed .
“ I 'm going to go on welfare and then I do n't know what I 'm going to do , ” he says .
“ To be a yakuza used to be a job for life , but now we 're being treated like temporary workers or salesmen .
You do n’t “ sell enough ” and its goodbye .
“ This is how it is now in the organization .
The people at the top live well but everyone else is barely able to make a living .
It ’s the American business model transplanted to Japan … and it sucks . ”

Govt says ISI behind all recent terror incidents Text Size : | NEW DELHI : India , which has been silent over Pakistani links in a number of terrorist attacks in the country except for last month 's Mumbai carnage , on Wednesday disclosed that the perpetrators of all recent terror bombings ��� including those allegedly carried out by locals ��� had links with the neighbour 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) .
Disclosing it in response to a question in Rajya Sabha , minister of state for home affairs Sriprakash Jaiswal said : " Inquiries and investigations into various acts of terrorism in the recent past have indicated linkages of elements involved in terrorist incidents in the states of Uttar Pradesh , Karnataka , Gujarat , Maharashtra and Delhi with ISI . "
The written statement assumes significance in view of the government 's stated position of not taking the name of Pakistan or state actor ��� like ISI ��� until the police get some concrete proof .
It , thus , indicates that besides the Mumbai terror attack case , the police have evidence of ISI 's links in other cases as well .
Though the Centre spoke of the role of Pakistani elements in the 26/11 Mumbai carnage after getting clear evidence against banned outfit Lashker - e- Taiba , it had earlier preferred not to talk about any Pakistani linkages in the case of terror attacks in UP courts ( November 2007 ) , CRPF 's camp in Rampur ( January 1 ) , Jaipur ( May 13 ) , Bangalore ( July 25 ) , Ahmedabad ( July 26 ) and Delhi ( September 13 ) .
So , whatever the government told the Upper House on Wednesday is a clear indication of linkages of Indian Mujahideen ( IM ) ��� the splinter group of SIMI ��� with ISI .
Although IM , while taking responsibility for almost all recent terror attacks ��� except for the Malegaon blast which was allegedly carried out by Hindutva elements and the Mehrauli blast ( in Delhi ) ��� insisted that it did not have any outside links , the government 's statement , that is based on investigation , has now made it clear that the outfit has actually been operating at the behest of ISI .
Speaking about the nefarious design of the Pakistan 's espionage agency , Jaiswal , in his written response , further said : " Linkages between the ISI and various terror groups based in Pakistan , and operating in India , are well known and well documented through revelations by terrorists apprehended and investigations from time to time . "
Though the government had on earlier occasions admitted to the existence of ISI - backed terror modules in different parts of the country , it had never been so unequivocal in stating the linkages of perpetrators with the espionage agency .

Dasha prods the 's ' shaped chocolate bar in front of her .
You can understand why she 's in no rush to eat it - the Ukrainian student has just been served pork fat covered in chocolate .
Chocolate salo : Salty on the inside , sweet on the outside
Forget deep - fried Mars bar .
One of the unhealthiest snacks in the world can now be found in Ukraine .
For years people here have loved pork fat , known as salo .
Normally , small slices of the white fat are eaten with black bread , raw garlic and vodka .
But this new twist is designed to appeal to Ukraine 's love of all things fatty .
Eurovision fan
For the equivalent of £ 1 you can now get four small sticks of salo covered in chocolate at Kiev 's poshest Ukrainian restaurant .
" Our head chef likes to experiment so now we have this new creation . " says Roman Novitski , the manager of Tsarske Selo restaurant .
Young girl , come and try my tasty salo , it 's super salo
Katya Feschenko ,
salo seller
After Ukraine 's victory at the Eurovision song contest , Kiev is gearing up to welcome thousands of visitors from Europe .
Chocolate salo is likely to be one of the dishes they are offered especially as Ruslana , Ukraine 's winning entry is a fan of it .
And you can also get hold of the sweet salo - nicknamed Ukraine 's Snickers - in Ruslana 's home city of Lviv in Western Ukraine .
" I love it as it 's unusual .
I was given the first serving of Lviv 's chocolate salo .
Perhaps they were testing my bravery , but I ate it and I 'm still alive ! " Ruslana laughs .
But the chocolaty pork fat should come with a health warning , according to Dr Svetlana Fus from the Kiev Medical Research Centre .
Unusual : Pop singer Ruslana says she likes chocolate salo
The former Soviet republic already has one of the highest death rates from heart disease in Europe .
" Young girl , come and try my tasty salo , it 's super salo , " Katya Feschenko shouts to me .
Katya is the salo queen at Kiev 's busy Bessarabska Market .
Slabs of white fat sit next to spare ribs and hunks of bacon on her stall .
" Ukrainians love salo .
It comes from villages so it has a good flavour .
It 's very tasty , " says Katya , who has been selling salo for the last 20 years .
And now that salo comes with a chocolate coating it could become even more popular .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Saturday asked Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary , according to two White House officials .
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius walks with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal after meeting with the president this week .
The officials told CNN that Obama is expected to make the announcement Monday afternoon .
The officials asked not to be named because the announcement has not yet been made .
Sebelius , who administration officials say Obama seriously considered to be his vice - presidential nominee , has been rumored to be a top contender for the job for weeks .
The post is still vacant after the first pick , former Sen .
Tom Daschle , stepped aside after questions were raised about his failure to pay more than $ 100,000 in taxes for use of a car and driver .
CNN reported earlier this month that Sebelius met in Washington with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett about the job , a sign that the administration has been giving her a close look since Daschle dropped out .
The officials noted Sebelius has a good personal relationship with Obama and remained in the running for the vice presidential slot until near the end of the process .
She was also considered for other Cabinet posts .

One popular website , “ Prison Planet , ” greeted Sebelius ’ nomination with the headline “ Obama Picks Bilderberger for Health Secretary . ”
It ’s obvious why Bilderberg is a frequent target of conspiracy theorists , who ’ve credited it with anointing aspiring presidents , selecting their running mates , creating the European Union and instigating the war in Iraq and the bombing of Serbia , among other coups .
Bilderberg meetings are closed to the press , participants are asked not to publicly discuss the proceedings and the attendee list is only occasionally released .
As a result , the group has come to be viewed as a more publicity - shy cousin to the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations – other influential international think tanks that are staples of fringe group conversation .
Unlike Bilderberg , though , those organizations have opened their proceedings to public scrutiny , maintain websites and have long listed their members .
The Bilderberg group , in a rare press release last year , laid out a benign if vague mission : creating “ a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations . ”
“ Bilderberg is a small , flexible , informal and off - the - record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced , ” read the press release , which noted that a list of participants would be available by phone request between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on the second and third days of the conference .
The Bilderberg conspiracists first pounced on the Obama connection during the 2008 campaign , when news leaked in May that the candidate , who at the time was closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination , had initially tapped former Fannie Mae chairman Jim Johnson , a top Bilderberger , to help him select a running mate .
IRS filings show that Johnson as recently as 2006 was the treasurer of a non-profit group called American Friends of Bilderberg .
The group has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to pay for meetings -- including $ 125,000 in total contributions from Bilderberg stalwarts Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller in 2005 and 2006 plus $ 25,000 in 2005 from the Washington Post , whose chairman Don Graham has attended in the past .
Johnson did not return a message inquiring about his role at Bilderberg .
“ The news further puts to rest any delusions that Bilderberg is a mere talking shop where no decisions are made , ” reported Prison Planet .
“ It also ridicules once again any notion that an Obama presidency would bring ‘ change ’ to the status quo of America being ruled by an unelected corporate and military - industrial complex elite . ”
One month later , in June , Johnson was joined at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting by Geithner , Holbrooke , Summers and Ross , as well as Obama ’s first choice for HHS secretary , Tom Daschle , and Sebelius , who at the time was included on some short lists of prospective Obama running mates and who also attended the 2007 meeting in Istanbul , Turkey .
According to the Bilderberg press release , the meeting was designed to “ deal mainly with a nuclear free world , cyber terrorism , Africa , Russia , finance , protectionism , US - EU relations , Afghanistan and Pakistan , Islam and Iran . ”
Approximately two - thirds of the 140 expected attendees came from Europe , according to the release , and the rest from North America .
Had the meeting been held outside the United States , that might have been the end of the Obama angle .
But the conference , which took place from June 5 through 8 , was held at a heavily guarded hotel in Chantilly , Va. in suburban Washington — coincidentally overlapping with an Obama campaign event in the area .
While Obama ’s schedule indicated he was to fly home to Chicago for the weekend — and journalists were herded on a campaign plane under the impression they were headed there along with Obama — the future president slipped away for a private meetings and never actually boarded the flight .

Church Fights for Right to Drink Tea Court will soon decide whether religious sect can drink hallucinogenic tea .
March 2 , 2009 --
It 's a tempest in a teapot .
Followers of a Brazilian - based Christian church group in the United States want to be able to drink hoasca , a hallucinogenic type of tea , during their religious services .
But the Justice Department says the tea is illegal and falls under the classification of a banned substance .
A federal judge will soon decide whether Oregon 's Church of the Holy Light of the Queen will be allowed to consume the tea under the religious freedom restoration act .
Hoasca ( pronounced wa - SA - ca ) is made in the Brazilian rain forest by scraping the bark off tropical vines .
Believers say the tea allows them to have visions and enables talks with God and communications with spirits .
Believers , young and old , make the sign of the cross before taking a sip .
The Oregon group is fighting to be allowed to consume the tea under the religious freedom restoration act .
" If people have a substance that they need to use as part of their religion , that they should be allowed to do that , that is what the Supreme Court has held , " said Allison RenteIn , a professor of political science and anthropology at the University of Southern California .
The controversial tea has been used for centuries during religious services in South America , but most specialty stores , sometimes called " head shops , " say it is not available in most of the United States .
The church wants the same consideration as some American Indian tribes that are allowed to use peyote during their traditional religious ceremonies .
Peyote contains mescaline and is sometimes called the " divine cactus . "
Some American Indians say its intense psychological effects last up to 12 hours .
Hoasca in Legal Limbo
The battle over hoasca has been in legal limbo for years .
Though the highest courts have upheld the right for the church to use the tea , it is still considered an illegal drug .
" It is hallucinogenic and they drink it only in the context of these religious ceremonies , " said RenteIn .
" We do n't want people drinking and driving . "

Virtual Off ?
I first played Virtual On years ago now , originally on the Saturn port in fact .
I look back at that with some disdain , admittedly , as I later realized that the arcade original , with its wondrous twinstick control setup , was a far superior game .
The arcade version took me a few months of practice to get into , mainly because the nearest arcade was an hour 's train ride away and I was still at the tender age that meant I did n't have a driving license .
Once I 'd learned the basics , I decided to create a club in a fairly central London arcade .
It was imaginatively titled the London Virtual On Club , or LonVOC for short .
It then appeared that my practice had been pretty thorough , as my subsequent skills were rather potent against the new club members ( all of whom were keen to best me , but in the non - Xbox Live smacktalk sense ) .
We were also later graced with the only arcade cabinet of Virtual On Oratorio Tangram M.S.B.S. 5.2 ) in the UK , which was a lot of fun .
Considering the recent announcement of Oratorio Tangram coming to digital download , it seems only fair to cover a series that made me travel halfway across my native country just to plumb credits into an arcade cabinet ( a cabinet I later ended up owning , as you probably know already ) .
The original Virtual On had a very difficult birth , more than many probably realize .
Up until this point , Sega had used their Model 2 hardware in quite a rigid fashion in terms of gaming functionality .
The reason for this was that the bulk of the processing power was in the rendering more than anything else .
So while the games had beautifully - textured polygons , they could n't do much with them .
This is why a lot of the earlier Model 2 games felt quite on - rails .
So the simplicity behind 's beautiful handling and 's point - and - shoot approach were dictated by the hardware , not design .
Cue Juro Watari and the premise of having an arena - based fighting game where the player could dash at blinding speed wherever they wanted .
Unsurprisingly , the early vestiges of Virtual
On were almost canned , but Hisao Oguchi ( then a producer ) joined in to prove it could be done .
The biggest problem the team faced was that the Model 2 hardware had real problems with updating the position of complex animated objects .
In , the movement was relatively slow and the arena quite small , so this limitation was n't really an issue .
In Virtual On , with complicated robots dashing at high speeds things got very difficult .
The initial hit was the robots themselves .
It was clear even in early stages that they needed very low - polygon models for the titular Virtuaroids , or VRs .
The problem with mecha design at that time was that it did n't really do simple .
They were complex multi-jointed machines with a huge amount of geometrical detail .
So Katoki Hajime , renowned for his gritty real robot designs , was called in to help .
His simple and highly stylized designs helped get the game running , as well as give the title an iconic aesthetic .
The next problem was handling how to update two VRs ' positions on the fly .
This is where things get interesting .
One of the most important aspects of the original Virtual On was down to the fixed length dashes the VRs did .
Initiating a dash and then pressing one of the attack triggers would have your VR face your opponent and fire .
Making sure you got the right angle on your target was also crucial .
In addition , at the end of each dash the VR would freeze in position , leaving the player vulnerable .
So what followed was a tactical wrong footing of each player as they tried to catch one another at the end of their dashes .
This became known as thrust vectoring amongst the fans .
This core aspect of the game was another happy accident , born from the limitations of what the Model 2 board could handle .
The fixed dashes were admittedly one design solution for the technical limitations ( as it only had to have the hardware calculate a start and an end point ) but the dash freeze occurred down to the hardware needing time to update the position of the VR .
I asked Watari several years ago , how he best described the mechanics in Virtual On , and his answer was that it was akin to Noh theatre being crossed with American Football : fixed rigid motions coupled with complex arena based tactics .
Not a bad analogy , really .
There is one other technical aspect I have n't covered , though -- the twinsticks .
Why use a tank control setup for high - speed , vectored dash - based combat ?
You 'll only think that if you look upon Virtual On 's mechanics in a visual sense .
Due to limitations of the hardware , the game needed a very precise form of control input for the movement commands .
If you 're going to be penalized with immobility at the end of a dash you want to make sure that you wanted to dash in that direction in the first place .
The twinsticks were the solution to this potentially disastrous lack of precision .
The important part of the twinstick setup was at the base of each stick .
However , to limit as much of an input deadzone as possible the stick was lengthened to take advantage of its leverage .
So the player only needed to register a small movement with the sticks and the leverage would amplify that to the already sensitive electronics at the base .
Basically , a very low - tech solution for a then cutting edge problem .
The only way to make doubly sure that your inputs made it into the game as intended was manifested as a literal doubling of input : two sticks .
Each stick acted as backup for the other in terms of your direction controls .
Admittedly , you could pivot on the spot like a tank by pushing the sticks in opposing vertical directions but that was more of an easter egg rather than anything actually useful .
This is why playing the recent SEGA AGES port on a pad is akin to fondling a restless ferret through a wet towel and whyhad such problems -- but more of that later .
Some may think that Virtual On 's twinstick setup came from Cyber Sled and to an extent this is half true , as the controls were a partial inspiration .
The big difference is that Cyber Sled was trying to emulate futuristic tank combat ( so no fixed dashes basically ) rather than anything mecha related .
Virtual
On turned out to be a massive success and catapulted both Watari and Oguchi into the internal corporate limelight .
The game was also ported over to the Saturn and PC , but with mixed results , as mapping the hardware limitations intentionally onto other platforms proved very awkward .
The Saturn port was mechanically very different , as dash freeze was massively reduced .
However , when a line of new arcade boards was announced in the form of Model 3 the Virtual On team were assembled once again .
The name , or justto the fans , was birthed as means to describe what the game was .
Oratorio being a holy opera and a tangram being a Chinese puzzle based around arranging shapes , the name essentially signified that the game was meant to be a " grand remix " of sorts .
It 's an apt name as the changes to the game were legion .
Now with far more potent hardware , a lot of the limitations that defined the core mechanics of the first game were no longer really present .
That said , some were still artificially retained as they still gave meaningful structure to the game .
Specifically , the dash freeze was still about but in a vastly reduced capacity .
This made the game much more reflex based than the original but the general reduction in dash speed allowed the player to keep up .
The other interesting change from the original was how a lot of the move set had become automated .
Close combat in the original game was far more manual in terms of input : circle strafing in close combat was something the player could control with greater precision as to how far they moved .
changed this by replacing the control with a fixed length " quick step " .
It made close combat more approachable , but at the expense of plateauing the skill of the player .
Other elements also had a functional makeover ; dashing received the ability to curved and change mid-course .
The latter was referred to affectionately as Watari dashing .
The game even afforded aerial - based dashing now .
The biggest changes were twofold ; V - armor and turbo attacks .
V - armor was another layer of defense that deflected shots from a certain range .
Compared this to the original were you could almost dash snipe an opponent on the other side of the map .
The reason behind this was to keep players from running away from another and it actually worked quite well .
Turbo attacks allowed the player to use the dash button in conjunction with a weapon trigger to power up certain attacks , this added another layer to the menu of attacks available to the player and deepened the game further .
also saw four major revisions , this was down to the further fevered following the first game had generated and the tournament scene was suitably ferocious .
Essentially , balancing became a far greater issue .
The M.S.B.S. 5.2 was the starting version and featured the most problems both technical and functional .
This was swiftly followed by 5.4 , with faster quick - stepping close combat , more available energy for weapons and a slew of other balancing tweaks across the board .
Some maps even received reworking .
5.45 was the Dreamcast port and turned out to be a monumental challenge for theteam .
A lot of hardware reliances simply did n't exist on the Dreamcast and the code base required extensive re-working , doubly so as the game had to run at 60 fps and still retain the visual accuracy from the arcade version .
Amazingly , the Dreamcast port received one of the best conversions the series has ever seen .
It was practically faultless .
It also featured online versus play over a 56 k modem that , speaking as someone that played this originally in Japan , puts a lot of contemporary online games to shame .
The port also had a bespoke twinstick peripheral much like its Saturn cousin , which with 's increased input speed was absolutely essential .
This is n't to say you can't play the game on the pad but with the sticks you can control far more precisely , allowing you to do things like this The final arcade version was 5.66 and released on Naomi hardware to allow for Dreamcast VMU integration and a partial porting of some of the codebase .
5.66 turned out to be a vast change to the previous iterations , with new rendering tech and new VRs ( this generated large animation / art tasks for the team not to mention the monolithic task of balancing them properly ) .
To think that 5.66 is basically the Dreamcast version in the arcade would be a grievous misunderstanding .
The dash speed had been increased and the game was totally balanced around the aforementioned twinsticks .
So the precision and speed the player could command was far in advance of what the Dreamcast version offered .
This is why the newly announced console port of 5.66 is terrifying as there 's no news of any kind of twinstick peripheral .
A pad could n't keep up on the Dreamcast version , which was a custom made port .
This is specifically an arcade perfect port but without anything approaching arcade perfect controls .
It 's awful to think that the finest iteration of Oratan is being released to the public but with only half the functionality available to the gaming populace .
After 5.66 graced the Japanese arcades , many of the team left SEGA and took up jobs with Squaresoft ( now Square Enix ) .
Watari and Oguchi stayed but much of the expertise was no longer present , which is where the problems started .
With most of the team now elsewhere , the sequel to Oratan had a tough life ahead of it .
It only got worse , as the new team now had to work with the notorious Hikaru board .
If this had been a simple update to Virtual On , with two player versus intact , they might have had a chance of making something good .
Unfortunately , the high concept was four - player .
Ignoring the awful functional ramifications for a moment , the technical nightmare of getting two VRs working in game was difficult enough but four ?
The entire development was must have been an uphill struggle , with newer staff members desperately trying to get to grip with the code base , work with awkward hardware and deliver the impossible at the same time .
All things considered , they did a pretty impressive job but unfortunately it followed hot on the heels of the near - perfect
The big problem withwas in three major areas ; the four player did n't work with Virtual On 's single lock dash based combat , the game avoided any and all dash freeze to hide the limitations of the lock - on system ( allowing you to dodge everything , removing any of the original core tactics that had made the games such a success ) and then a hugely unbalanced card system that awarded better players with even better VRs .
The sum of all this practically killed Virtual On in the Japanese arcades . , in its defense , did try and utilize the four player setup as best it could though .
Specifically , each team of two was split into a leader and a wingman .
If the enemy team killed your leader , that resulted in a victory for them .
If they killed the wingman , they lost their lock - on briefly as the leader could share some of their health to bring you back to life .
This approach fostered a very cogent form of teamwork in the arcades , for the few that stuck with the game .
Yet for all the teamwork , the card system nullified any real kind of fanbase , as newer players were absolutely thrashed by veterans with better VRs .
The card system was from Virtua Fighter 4 , and while that offered purely aesthetic upgrades , for obvious balancing reasons , someone decided to copy Armored Core 's approach to customization for Force , where upgrades would give functional variance .
It was really very unfortunate , as the team focus was undermined by the possibility of having one veteran in a souped - up VR trounce two newcomers .
Even with 's dwindling numbers , there were a total of two revisions for the game .
That said , things were only about to get much worse for the series .
After Force tanked in the arcades , much of the new team were suitably jaded by the whole experience .
So when a PlayStation 2 port was announced , many again left and others managed to work on something else .
So without the core knowledge of how the arcade version worked , a new console specific team had to be assembled .
Again , the higher ups had their input stating that the reason for 's demise was that it lacked a compelling single - player experience ( overlooking the fact that it was an arcade versus series of games ) .
The new console team took this onboard and re-worked thecodebase into something that would feature a greater emphasis on a single - player campaign .
Now before I go off on one here , there is one element I have n't covered yet about these games : between the releases of each game Watari had penned a serialized novel filling the narrative gaps .
These were One Man Rescue and Fragmentary Passage .
They explained a lot of the background for bothandrespectively , yet there were still large mysteries unresolved .
was Watari 's attempt to answer a lot of the narrative inconsistencies to the Japanese fan base .
Unfortunately , for everyone else , not only did we get a comedically - awful localization , but the historical context did n't exist outside of Japan ( as neither of the sidestories were published abroad ) .
That aside , was n't shaping up to be that good .
Many of the game 's environments were long and winding , yet the original Force lock - on system was sadly still present .
This meant you'd be locking on to an enemy kilometers away in another canyon whilst you were trying to negotiate your way through a veritable maze .
The whole game was infuriatingly like this and what with 's ported sluggish mechanics the final game was n't exactly great .
The real nail in the coffin was down to the fact thatwas the first console game not to receive a twinstick peripheral .
Considering thatrelied so heavily on quick jump cancels , having to attempt that on a pad with woolly dual analogue controls made the game a lot harder than it needed to be .
The only way to for me to playproperly was to complete the game on Ultimate difficulty , which unlocked the Shirokis Temjin ( the VR at the beginning of this article in case you 're wondering -- a wonderfully quick VR that basically made the game play likeagain .
It also helped having a custom built pair of twinsticks
The final level was noteworthy , though , as it reversed gravity , which was functionally quite interesting .
If only the rest of the game had experimented with different mechanics and reduced the size of the environments , may have been a bit more worthwhile .
So what happens to the series now ?
After the one two punch ofand , the series is still on its knees .
Having Temjin et al appear in Super Robot Wars ( both in Alpha 3 and now K ) only confirms the fact that the series is in dire straights with its fanbase , as the cameos are a feeble attempt to generate interest again .
A digital download version of Oratan 5.66 may appear on the surface to be a beneficial thing but the lack of twinsticks only shows that this is an exercise in kudos generation rather than anything worthwhile for the series .
Not to mention that playing 5.66 on pad will be pretty heartbreaking , as you just wo n't be able to control the game properly .
Of all the mecha games I love , Virtual On is and always will be my favourite .
Instead of approaching mecha as something literal , the team approached how the combat would work instead ; basically what the mecha do rather than what they are .
That insight is probably the most inspiring aspect of the original games .
I just hope one day that insight will re-surface .
Researchers quizzed young people about sexual activity and music Listening to music with degrading sexual lyrics could prompt teenagers to start having sex at an earlier age , a US study suggests .
Researchers from Pittsburgh University quizzed 711 teenagers about their sex lives and music listening habits .
They found those who regularly listened to music with explicit and aggressive sexual phrases were twice as likely to be having sex .
But experts said it was too simplistic to link music directly to behaviour .
The team classed degrading sexual lyrics as songs which described sex as a physical rather than loving act and also where it was linked to power , the American Journal of Preventative Medicine reported .
Parents should be talking to their children about sex and putting these sorts of lyrics in context
Dr Brian Primack , lead researcher Researchers refused to name which songs would fall into the degrading category , but cited phrases such as " I 'm gonna beat that pussy up " as the kind of lyrics that were being used .
They split the 13 to 18 - year - olds into three groups - those who listened to such music regularly , sometimes and not often .
Regularly was classed as anything over 17.6 hours a week , whereas not often was under 2.7 hours .
They found 45 % of regular listeners had had sex , compared to just 21 % of infrequent listeners .
Lead researcher Dr Brian Primack said : " There certainly seems to be a link , but it is hard to say whether listening to music is directly contributing to having sex earlier .
" However , I think parents should consider this .
It is tempting to say music is just ' teenage stuff ' .
" I am not saying parents should try to ban such music , that is unlikely to help .
" But they should be talking to their children about sex and putting these sorts of lyrics in context . "
But UK experts were sceptical about the extent of the role played by such music .
Too simplistic A spokeswoman for Brook , the sexual health charity for young people , said : " Obviously the cultural environment plays a part , but that is not to say there is a causal link .
" It is far too simplistic to say just because someone listens to this music they have sex .
There are a variety of factors that influence decisions . "
And Rebecca Findlay , of the fpa , formerly the Family Planning Association , agreed that sexual behaviour " could not be put down to one factor alone " .
" I think what this does show is the importance of good sex education to address these issues . "

TinyRB : A Young , Tiny Ruby VM for Us to Play With
By Peter Cooper
Marc -André Cournoyer has proven that almost anything is possible by developing a small , functional , and surprisingly " unslow " Ruby VM called TinyRB .
Some basic testing shows that it 's faster than 1.8 on a Fibonacci benchmark , though slightly slower than JRuby , Rubinius , and YARV ( Ruby 1.9 ) .
Coming in at just 1541 lines of code so far , TinyRB is not going to be replacing your usual Ruby interpreter anytime soon .
While it supports most of the keywords and some base classes including Class , Object , Fixnum , Symbol , and String , there 's no support for Array , Module , Float , and a whole ton of essential stuff .
TinyRB , in its current state , is a playground for you to mess around in .
In his last keynote at RubyConf 2008 , Dave Thomas suggested we " fork Ruby " in many different ways , and TinyRB enables you to do that on a small scale .
So newbies .. move on - but if the thought of experimenting and playing with a Ruby VM is something that gets you putting in a major Red Bull and pizza order .. dive in .
Nasser al - Amoudi on his motorbike outside the remains of his shop for BMW spare parts shop .
( Malian / PCHR )
BMW
Nasser al - Amoudi , with his biker ’s jacket and sunglasses , embodies the essence of a car enthusiast .
For years he has been the proud owner of the onlyspare parts shop in the Gaza Strip .
People would travel from every corner to purchase second hand parts from his shop .
Now Nasser ’s workshop and garage , which were worth $ 300,000 before the Israeli army destroyed them during its latest offensive , lie in tatters , and his financial security has gone .
Al - Amoudi BMW Spare Parts is situated on a main street running through the Salateen area of Beit Lahiya , northern Gaza .
This area was one of the worst affected during Israel ’s ground offensive — hundreds of houses and greenhouses were completely destroyed in Salateen , thousands of trees were uprooted , and there are still 100 families living in a tent camp just a few meters away .
This predominantly fishing community has sustained many Israeli incursions over the years but the scars of the latest one are all pervasive and have made the area almost unrecognizable to its residents .
Even the cemetery with its cracked gravestones and deep tank tracks , was not spared .
“ This land belongs to me and my family and we have had this business for 22 years , ” says 38 - year - old Nasser , his hand leaning on the edge of the tent he has erected on the site of his shop .
“ I worked in the garage when I was a small boy , and I took over from my brother when I was old enough .
We had customers from Gaza City , from Khan Younis , and Rafah .
This was the only place to find good used spare parts for BMW cars .
All of Gaza knew this shop . ”
Nasser al - Amoudi outside the symbolic tent erected on the site of his BMW shop .
( Malian / PCHR )
Nasser used to have friends in Germany whom he did business with to secure the spare parts , but everything collapsed with the closure of Gaza ’s borders two years ago : “ People were still coming here before the war , but business had slowed down , almost to a standstill .
Gaza has been closed off from the outside world for two years , and it ’s impossible for businesses like mine to function under those conditions . ”
The economic blockade and closure of Gaza ’s borders since June 2007 has had a devastating impact on the Strip ’s economic sectors .
Most production facilities have ceased operations and the import and export of goods are severely limited .
Israel ’s policy of collective punishment has left the territory unable to secure basic foods , medicines , or other supplies and the result has been a skyrocketing of poverty rates and unemployment .
During the offensive , while Nasser sheltered in his home in the Beach refugee camp with his wife and three children , Israeli fighter jets , helicopters , naval vessels and ground tanks pounded Salateen .
His garage and workshop were leveled by Israeli military bulldozers around the 14 of January 2009 , when many of the local residents had fled the area .
“ I drove back here on my motorbike on the first day of the ceasefire , on 18 January 2009 , ” says Nasser .
“ There was absolutely nothing left .
Years of work , just gone . ”
Piled up around the refugee tent on Nasser ’s site , are the crumpled metal bumpers of BMW cars .
Nasser has tried to salvage whatever he could but the tent is little more than a testament to the human spirit .
“ I ’ve set up this tent with the old sign from my shop as a symbol , even though I have no goods to sell , ” Nasser adds .
“ Just to let the world see what happened to me . ”
During the 22 - day offensive Beit Lahiya suffered extreme levels of devastation and the resulting crisis is still affecting all aspects of life .
Civilians like Nasser al - Amoudi and others , continue to be denied their economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights .

Meanwhile , the European Union is considering upgrading its trade relations with Israel under the - Israel Association Agreement , which offers Israel preferential terms in its trade with the .
Article 2 of the - Israel Association states that the relationship between Israel and theshould be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles , as a core part of the agreement and as a precondition for economic cooperation .
In light of Israel ’s latest actions in the Gaza Strip , and continuing breaches of international law , the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) is calling on the EU - Israel Association Council to reconsider Israel ’s request for a significant upgrading of relations , and to hold Israel to account for its continuing violations of international law and the human rights clauses within the Agreement .
Upgrading the Association Agreement gives Israel tacit approval to continue violating its contractual obligations and makes the EU complicit in these acts .
More than 120 industrial and commercial workshops were completely destroyed by Israeli Occupation Forces between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 , and at least 200 others were damaged , as well as some of Gaza ’s largest factories producing soft drinks , concrete and other basic items .
The high civilian death toll and the extensive destruction to public and private property indicate that one of the objectives of the Israeli political and military establishments was to cause the maximum possible damage in Gaza .
As Nasser al - Amoudi rearranges the metal sign hanging from his tent , it is apparent that the Israeli army achieved that objective .
“ What is the point of addressing the international community about this issue ? ” asks Nasser .
“ No one seems to care .
I will try to rebuild my shop .
What else can I do ?
Where else can I go ?
I just hope that this will not happen again in Gaza . ”
This report is part of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights series “ Aftermath ” that looks at the aftermath of Israel ’s 22 - day offensive on the Gaza Strip , and the ongoing impact it is having on the civilian population .

Hiking in one of the most crowded places in the world ?
It sounds bonkers but , as Carole Cadwalladr discovers , minutes from the city 's cocktail bars , there are spectacular peaks to climb , idyllic beaches to surf , coral reefs to snorkel
Who needs a rucksack to go hiking when you can take a wheelie case ?
As well as strappy sandals , a summer dress , a Time Out city guide , a big fat novel , various hair products and unguents , and there , buried at the bottom of my case like an afterthought , a pair of stout walking boots , and a sensible fleece .
When I finished packing it struck me that it looked like the kind of case Bear Grylls might pack if Bear Grylls were a tranny , but then I was going on the most surreal hiking holiday known to man , in one of the most densely populated cities on earth , and , frankly , luggage was really the least of my issues .
I was , in fact , going hiking in Hong Kong , which sounds like one of those oxymorons made up by an overenthusiastic tourist board , like a Dubai culture break or a Scottish winter sun holiday , with the crucial difference that you actually can go hiking in Hong Kong .
No. Really .
Proper , in the middle of nowhere , slogging your guts out up a mountain trail , hiking .
It surprises a lot of people who have n't been to Hong Kong but then again it also surprises a lot of people who have .
I went pre-handover and had no idea it was anything but high - rises until my friends Aussie Pete and Czech Zuzana , who live there , rang up and invited me camping .
" Camping ?
Are you mad ? " I said .
But then I rang the tourist board and they said , oh yes , as if it were the most normal thing in the world , and found me a guide and a really spiffing hotel , the Mandarin Oriental , which , while not a tent - in that it had a marble bathroom as well as walls , a roof , a bed , liveried doormen etc - was , I decided , tent - like enough .
For all I knew , Pete 's idea of " camping " could easily involve sleeping rough on a Kowloon pavement .
There was a snag , though .
Usually on a walking holiday , I end up in an Alpine hut sharing a room with four snoring Germans , the plus side of which is that when you put on your three - quarter - length trousers and your microfibre top , your thick socks and your stout boots , you do n't have to walk past breakfasting businessmen and liveried doormen .
I think I may have looked somewhat unusual .
Since Pete and Zuzana were working for the first part of the week , I was going to go walking in the day and then meet up with them for a spot of big city entertainment , and the tourist board had rustled up a walking guide called Fred .
Fred was n't quite a walking guide , it turned out , so much as a guide , who appeared to have been cajoled into doing some walking .
What do you normally do with your tourists , Fred ?
I asked .
" Shopping .
Always shopping .
Sightseeing .
Eating .
But mostly people come here to shop . "
Not walking then ?
" Oh no ! "
We were starting off with the Dragon 's Back trail , a gentle warm - up on Hong Kong island , about a 20 - minute cab ride away .
I really could n't believe that a 20 - minute cab - ride could take you anywhere remotely wild , but by the time we had climbed to the first viewpoint , it was spectacular : undulating hills covered with thick vegetation , a series of beautiful bays , and not a soul to be seen .
It 's the best urban hike in the world , according to Time magazine , although apart from a distant tower or two , and a couple of far - off villages , it did n't feel very urban at all .
Over the top of the hill was the throbbing metropolis , the gorgeous shimmering Bank of China tower designed by IM Pei , and Norman Foster 's HSBC tower , then the as - yet - unfinished International Finance Centre , which Batman jumps off in The Dark Knight .
But on this side , butterflies fluttered in the breeze , and the sea shimmered in the distance .
" What 's that building on the cliff top over there ? "
I asked Fred , thinking it must be some millionaire 's pad .
" That , " said Fred , " is a prison . "
There was something else bothering me .
Where was everybody ?
" They are working .
Maybe some come at the weekend but Hong Kong people are very lazy .
Take me .
On Sunday , I sleep until maybe one o'clock and then I go and see my family and eat a very big lunch . "
The amazing thing about Hong Kong is that it is both one of the most populated cities in the world , and one of the least populated countries ... well , not a country , a " territory " , but you know what I mean .
Everybody lives in tiny flats in soaring skyscrapers but only some 30 % of the land is built on .
Because of Britain 's world - leading position in petty bureaucratic planning rules - and here feel your patriotic heart swell with pride - the other 70 % is countryside , most of it protected national park .
Parts of it are nothing less than breathtaking .
The next day , I went out into the Sai Kung national park in the New Territories with an outfit called Kayak and Hike , set up by an Australian called Paul Etherington , and could n't believe that I was n't in Thailand or back a hundred years in time - give or take the fact that we were in an ex-police powerboat of the type that tends to get blown up in Bond films .
We zoomed out into the South China Sea , past tiny wooden boats containing fishermen wearing conical bamboo hats of the type I 've only ever seen in blatant racist stereotyping , past towering sea-cliffs and circling sea-eagles and postcard - perfect white sand beaches and the occasional semi-abandoned village or lone building .
" What 's that ? "
I asked Paul , thinking that it was perhaps a simple traveller 's hostel rather like the ones you get on Thai beaches .
" A drug rehabilitation unit . "
This is the madness of Hong Kong .
Anywhere else , it would be a boutique hotel , but here people have been too busy working to take time to appreciate the glories of nature , so it has been left to the junkies and prisoners .
Even the tourists do n't come here .
Everybody else on the boat either lived in Hong Kong , had lived in Hong Kong , or was visiting relatives in Hong Kong .
" I 've tried for years to get tourists out with us , " said Paul .
" But they 're just not interested .
I think they prefer to go shopping . "
They 're mad .
Really , they are .
We stopped at a tiny village and then got into kayaks and paddled out to a crumbling sea arch , although the sea was too rough to go through it , and then off to a deserted beach where we snorkelled above a coral reef , climbed a hill to get a view of the bay , and then paddled back to the village , where we had a slap - up lunch in a simple fish restaurant .
It 's a grand day out by any reckoning .
And half an hour after zooming over the waves in the Bond boat , I was back among the skyscrapers of Central making plans to meet Pete and Zuzana in a bar .
" It 's the best city break in the world ! " I said .
All the joys of a big Asian city , and none of the stuff you feel obliged to do on most minibreaks : the sightseeing , the museums , the shopping .
Instead , it 's all the spirit - lifting , feel - good , hard - earned kicks you get from a walking holiday .
The next day , I head for Lamma , an island a half - hour ferry from Central , and can't believe I 'm just 30 minutes away from one of the financial centres of the world economy , in a hippy enclave that is one of the last vestiges of the old trans - Asian overland trail .
There are no cars , just bicycles , and notices everywhere for " Free Healing " and " Psychic Massages " and little shops selling dodgy handmade tie - dyed things last in fashion around 1969 .
And everywhere , ageing western men with greying ponytails who washed up here in the Seventies and appear not to have heard that Hong Kong has become a financial powerhouse , is part of the People 's Republic , and that shrooms are now illegal .
It 's lovely , though , Lamma .
Once you 're past an ugly power station , and the hippy bead shops , it has endless footpaths and a rugged coastline .
At a beach at the far end , there is just enough civilisation - spotless showers and changing rooms - and a slightly disconcerting notice : " Please note that we have taken down the shark nets for annual maintenance . "
I swim anyway but keep feeling things brush past my legs , make a quick exit , and head back to Central and the sharkless water of the rooftop pool of the Four Seasons hotel .
I swim back and forth in the fading light , with the neon lights of the skyscrapers all around me , as transcendental an experience as you can have on any Lamma shroom .
I 've gone , deliberately , in the best month - November - when the raging humidity has subsided and the skies are blue and clear .
There are other Asian cities , such as Shanghai , that are even buzzier and more exciting ; or more exotic ones , like Beijing ; but what Hong Kong has , like Sydney and San Francisco have , is an amazing natural setting that dwarfs even its tallest buildings and its busiest highways .
With Fred , I climb Lantau Peak , Hong Kong 's second - highest mountain - a relentless vertical slog , capped with amazing views .
But the highlight is my day back in the Sai Kung national park with Pete , who wants to take me to his favourite beach .
We do a four - hour walk that culminates at a tiny semi-abandoned village , Ham Tin , on a gorgeous deserted beach and eat delicious beef fried noodles in a beach - side shack .
" Wow , " I say .
" You 're right .
This beach is amazing . "
" Oh no , " he says .
" We 're not there yet . "
And we climb over a final headland to the kind of beach I 've only ever seen in a Seventies aftershave advert - long , rugged , backed by dunes and jagged hills , and pounded by surf .
It 's completely undeveloped and we had planned to camp but Pete had an early shift the next day , and since the sun was setting we figured we ought to start on the two - hour walk back to the nearest stretch of road and the bus stop .
And then we see the boat .
It has brought in provisions for the restaurant and the boatman agrees to take us back to Sai Kung , the nearest town , for 20 quid a head .
" What a bargain ! " says Pete .
" I love a boat ride . "
" Me too ! " I cry and we take photos of each other larking around on the beach before getting on board .
When I look at them later , they remind me of photos of young men playing cricket on the playing fields of Eton shortly before being slaughtered in the Great War .
We were so innocent !
It takes about two and a half minutes to realise that we have made a terrible , terrible mistake .
It 's a flat - bottomed motor boat , the sun is setting , and as soon as we 're out of the little bay , the waves are huge .
Of course !
That 's why there was such good surf .
There 's a single piece of rope to hold on to and we keep on hitting the waves at strange angles and ploughing into the troughs , and the boat is very light and very flat and I 'm no marine engineer but this strikes me as not ideal when it comes to not capsizing .
In the dark .
In the middle of the South China Sea .
" We 've gone on holiday by mistake ! " I say , a line from Withnail & I , although I 'm not sure Pete gets the allusion , seeing as how he 's clinging to the rope and making strangulated noises .
" What 's the worst that can happen ? " I shout over the wind with extremely faux bravado .
" We 'll get wet . "
" It 's like concrete at this speed ! "
I think back longingly to my day out on the James Bond powerboat .
A lovely bit of soft adventure as opposed to the half - hour , white - knuckle , terror boat ride from hell , but then the marvellous thing about near - death experiences is that when you do n't actually die , the adrenaline high makes you realise why people go sky - diving or take cocaine .
We arrive back in Sai Kung in the pitch dark , our legs shaking , our hair at 90 - degree angles to our heads , laughing semi-hysterically .
Thirty minutes later , we step off the metro , in the gleaming Central station , still in our walking boots and with crazy hair , and bump into some friends of Pete 's before joining them in a city slicker bar .
They have spent the day in the office .
We feel as if we 've come back from the moon .
It 's the best city break in the world , I tell you .

For today ’s TunesDay , why do n’t we forget about the music and talk about music lawyering ?
Because really , chicks dig the suits .
Let ’s start with my favorite assortment of anti-music fucknozzles , the RIAA .
Up first , one of the industry group ’s top hired guns wants to “ intervene ” in a probable cause hearing .
Seems some kids at NC State are n’t terribly happy about the RIAA ’s business model random trolling for file - sharing violations .
You know how it works – ‘ let ’s sue everybody on the off chance that they might be guilty and / or unable to afford a lawyer . ”
Of course , those Woofpack students can at least stand up for themselves .
Check this episode of asshaberdashery , though :
Their RIAA is suing a young transplant patient in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Nineteen - year - old Ciara Sauro has pancreatitis and because she needs an islet cell transplant , she ’s hospitalized every week , a situation resulting in a huge accumulation of medical bills .
Now , “ Because she did n’t defend herself against a copyright lawsuit , a federal judge in Pittsburgh ruled she ’s a music pirate , and that could cost the Sauros almost $ 8,000 in fines , ” says Pittsburg news channel WTAE.com .
“ I already have severe depression , ” the story has her saying .
“ I mean , it ’s so hard to sit there and think that I have to get in trouble for something that I did n’t do .
It ’s not fair . ”
As SlashDot notes , Sauro “ claims that she did not infringe any copyrights . ”
However , “ she failed to answer the complaint in time , and a default judgment was taken against her . ”
Ignorance of the law is no excuse .
Apparently neither are poverty , grave illness or innocence .
But hey , enough about the innocent .
Now let ’s talk about the damn - sure - looks - guilty .

Coldplay might want to make a settlement offer here , though .
I mean , George Harrison got punked for infringing on “ He ’s So Fine , ” and Satch has a better case .
Seriously .
His lawyer will have to demonstrate that Coldplay had been exposed to “ If I Could Fly , ” I suppose , but Coldplay ’s lawyer is going to have find a jury with a profound belief in coincidence .

At an ISSCC session Monday , Intel went into new detail on its forthcoming 8 - core , 16 - thread Xeon processor , a 64 - bit processor that 's a member of the Nehalem family .
Much of the session was focused on the packaging and power aspects of the device , so I 'll recap some of the more interesting parts of that here .
The Intel presenter explained that the Xeon has three different clock and voltage domains : the core region , the uncore region , and the I/O region .
( You may recall from previous coverage of Nehalem that the " uncore " region of the processor is so named because it 's the area that does n't have a processor core in it ; this area is mostly cache . )
These separate clock and voltage domains are used for power management , and the isolation that they provide also aids Intel in implementing " Turbo Mode . "
Turbo mode is Intel 's name for its technology that lets it shut down one or more cores in order to focus the chip 's power budget on the cores that are actually active ( i.e. , by increasing the voltage and clockspeed of the active cores ) .
The cores ' variable voltage ranges from 0.85 V to 1.1V , while the voltages and clocks of the uncore and I /O domains are fixed .
If it 's broken , just re-label it
One major part of the Xeon presentation is Intel 's " cache and core recovery " scheme , which lets the company salvage a usable part from a defective chip by disabling the defective regions and selling the chip with a lower core count or cache amount .
So for instance , if testing and validation finds a defect in a cache slice on a chip , then Intel can disable that slice and sell the chip with lower cache .
And likewise with cores , so that you might buy a six - core chip from Intel that was originally produced as an 8 - core Xeon but had two defective cores .
An 8 - core Xeon chip with two cores and two cache blocks
The company claims that it can effectively isolate the nonfunctioning cache and cores , so that these extra parts do n't increase the chip 's power draw by letting through leakage current .
During the Intel presenter 's discussion of how this core and cache " recovery " scheme " enables multiple product options " from the same die , I could n't help but think back to one Intel wag 's response to the news of AMD 's triple - core " Toliman " part ; this guy said , and I wish I could find the quote , something to the effect of , " we like for all of the cores on our products to actually work . "
It was an ice burn at the time , but now it appears that Intel has bowed to the inevitable realities of Moore 's Law and will be taking essentially the same tack with all of their parts from here on out .
Both Intel 's 8 - core Nehalem and Sony's 8 - core ( sort of ) Cell processor have this sort of capability to shut down a nonfunctioning core at the production stage , so that the companies can still sell the part at a lower core count .
I realize that a typical journalist needs at least three data points to spot a " trend , " but if you 'll indulge me for a moment , I 'd like to suggest that the 8 - core mark may be the point at which you absolutely have to do this or risk punishingly low yields .
In any event , for as long as the multicore train rolls on , and , as I 'll argue in a forthcoming article , it may not be that long , you can expect to see this " disable the broken parts and sell it anyway " strategy used by everyone who 's selling into the 8 - core and up space .

Children from all socio-economic backgrounds are suffering the effects of an unhealthy diet .
Are we doing enough ?
" Salt is a silent killer , " says Professor Graham MacGregor of St George 's Hospital , London , the cardiovascular specialist I spoke to when researching my OFM story about the hidden dangers in middle - class children 's diets .
" When you eat more salt , you retain more fluid " – an extra 1.5 kg of liquid that is " sloshing around inside you and putting your blood pressure up , then suddenly , oops , you 've had your stroke or heart attack and you 're dead . "
High blood pressure accelerates atheroma – the build - up of furry deposits in the arteries that causes strokes and heart attacks .
Disturbingly , the early signs of " atheroma streaking " are found during post - mortems on children who have died in accidents – some of them as young as three or four years old .
Not all of these are children raised on the calorie - rich fast food often blamed for the ticking timebomb of obesity , high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease and even cancer .
It 's all too easy to criticise the diet of people represented in programmes such as Jamie Oliver 's Ministry of Food , but the problem is much broader .
My focus was on kids who eat a diet of things like breakfast cereals , toast and Marmite , croissants , cereal bars , pasta with sauce , ham sandwiches and sausage and mash – in other words , a typical middle - class child 's diet .
Salt is hidden in all manner of seemingly healthy foods , as are sugar and refined carbohydrates that pile on calories but offer little in the way of nutrition .
Hence the government 's £ 275 m Change4 Life campaign , aimed at tackling obesity ( and by implication all the above diseases ) in every section of society , launched in January with TV advertisements by Aardman Animations , the creators of Wallace and Gromit .
" We want families to engage with the campaign and understand that obesity is not someone else 's problem , " said public health minister Dawn Primarolo at the launch - but I 'm not sure I would have really noticed the Change4 Life campaign if I had n't been researching this story .
Was the campaign prominent enough ?
Has it changed the way you shop , cook or live ?
Was it a big enough investment ?
Overweight and obese people cost the NHS £ 4.2bn a year to treat , and the cost to the wider UK economy is £ 16bn , so in that context £ 275 m does n't seem a lot .
The bigger joke is that £ 200 m of it was put up by food companies such as Kellogg 's and Pepsico , manufacturers of some of the least healthy foods for children .
Their initiatives focus more on sport and activity than they do on diet .
Pepsico ( Pepsi , Walkers , Tropicana ) is promoting " active play " , Kellogg 's has a Swim4 Life programme and Asda a Bike4 Life initiative .
It all calls to mind the Cadbury 's Get Active campaign of 2003 , which offered £ 9 m - worth of sports equipment to schools in return for tokens on sweet wrappers .
" If you make chocolate , you are not going to put money into any campaign that directly tells people not to eat chocolate , " says Dr Ian Campbell , a Nottingham GP and medical director of the UK charity Weight Concern .
" You will put it into promoting physical activity to negate the harmful effects of eating too much chocolate .
It is the only choice these companies have . "
Dr Campbell even believes the food industry unwittingly sabotages the government 's efforts to get the healthy - eating message across .
" You drive past a bus stop and there is a lovely billboard promoting the Change4 Life concept , " he says .
" Immediately beside it is one from a company offering a 99 p burger .
Any impact is almost negated by the efforts from the other side . "
Is it wrong to blame manufacturers for peddling unhealthy food to children when it is we , their parents , who demand convenience foods because we are too time - poor or career - obsessed to cook ?
And are the food companies and the government genuinely at odds , or is there a comfortable alliance between them ?
Mission
One will take part in this summer 's TTXGP Isle of Man race , the world 's first clean emissions grand prix

A Californian company has unveiled the world 's fastest production electric motorbike , the Mission One .
Manufactured by San Francisco - based Mission Motors , the bike is capable of 150 mph - considerably quicker than the British - designed , pre-production TTX01 bike - and is on sale now to US customers , with deliveries due in 2010 .
The bike 's history has echoes of Tesla Motors '
Roadster , the luxury electric sports car that was conceived , designed and built in California with funding from clean technology investors including Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin .
Mission Motors ' founder , Forrest North , is a former Tesla employee who , in 2007 , began work on converting a petrol - powered Ducati motorbike into an electric model , with the aspiration of combining the performance of petrol with zero exhaust pipe emissions .
" As a motorcycle enthusiast and engineer , I knew I could combine my passion for motorcycles with my passion for innovation and create a motorcycle that truly sets a new standard in the perception of electric vehicles , " North said at the bike 's launch at the TED conference in Long Beach , California .
North 's bike is powered by lithium - ion batteries - the type found in laptops and mobile phones - and will reportedly run for 150 miles between recharging , which takes two hours .
The model demonstrated was a hand - built prototype .
It is yet to be tested on the road at 150 mph , but a Mission Motors ' spokesman said they " have no doubt that this prototype will achieve its target speed " .
Tesla and Mission Motors are targeting affluent green motorists , with the Tesla selling for £ 92,000 in the UK and the first 50 limited - edition Mission Ones likely to sell for $ 68,995 ( £ 47,100 ) .
A cheaper version of the Mission One is due to be announced this summer .
UK bikers and electric vehicle fans will get their first glimpse of the Mission One at this summer 's TTXGP , a motorbike race on the Isle of Man that bills itself as the world 's first clean emissions grand prix .
" Mission are really breaking the barrier on speed , and they also have a team of people that has a lot of experience in electric vehicles , " said Azhar Hussain , TTXGP 's founder .
Most of today 's electric motorbikes in the UK are effectively scooters limited to speeds of 60 mph or below , such as the high - end Vectrix VX - 1 and budget Ego Street Scoota .

' Bailout Bill ' is giving out amounts ranging from $ 50 to $ 5,000 Imagine getting £ 35 for doing absolutely nothing .
Well in New York , a man is giving away stacks of cash to anyone who 's prepared to stand in line for it .
The mystery man , who calls himself ' Bailout Bill ' , says in the middle of an economic crisis ordinary Americans who are struggling to make ends meet deserve a bailout .
In order to get the money people have to go the ' Bailout Booth ' in the heart of Manhattan 's Times Square .
It 's a small cubicle , a couple of blocks away from the massive Virgin Megastore .
The minimum anyone can get is $ 50 ( £ 35 ) .
The maximum is $ 5,000 ( £ 3,513 ) .
No matter who you are or what you do Bailout Bill guarantees that you 'll get something if you just show up and tell your story .
Hundreds have already braved the freezing temperatures to get their free dosh .
Some have stood in line for hours before getting to the front .
Gerrard Rinemoof , 34 , was covered in snow before he got his cash .
He told Newsbeat it was worth it : " Our cat is sick and we had to take him to the vet , so the 50 bucks helps me pay the bill . "
Hundreds queued in the cold in New York 's famous Times Square But perhaps there is something Bailout Bill would like in exchange - even though he does n't necessarily spell it out .
His staff hold up banners which have the address of his website printed on them .
They encourage the public to go online and check it out .
It 's an advertising site where people can post their videos and adverts in order to sell items they no longer want .
So maybe Bailout Bill is giving away thousands to promote his business ?

They ’re kidding , right ?
March 26 , 2009 by lestro

So apparently , the Republicans today released their budget proposal , which is very funny .
Almost as funny as this :
“ Two nights ago , the president said we have n’t seen a budget yet of the Republicans , ” said House Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
“ Well , it ’s not true , because here it is Mr. President . ”
He waved a thin document called “ The Republican Road to Recovery ” that describes the GOP proposal .
That ’s funny because Boehner is trying to do a bit of a Ha - Ha on the pres , making it out as though the president is out of touch and did n’t know the Republicans had a proposal , when the truth is , THEY DIDN ’T WHEN HE SAID IT .
How dumb do these guys think we are ?
oh , right :
Republican lawmakers refused to offer details of how much their alternative budget proposal would cost or how much it would increase the deficit , saying they would release overall numbers next week .
Instead , they provided a general outline of proposals that included cutting overall government spending except for defense , banning any additional spending for bailouts of financial companies and a huge income tax cut that would make the maximum tax rate 25 % instead of 36 % as under current law .
They ’re joking , right ?
First of all , to complain about the president ’s budget and then provide no specifics in what you are touting as the Republican counter - proposal is just fucking dumb .
But beyond that , at a time when government revenues are dropping and spending is increasing to fix the fucking messes created over the past eight years by Boehner and his buddies ( who had no problem running up huge deficits and borrowing , borrowing , borrowing when Bush ( who never once saw a spending bill he did n’t like ) was in office ) , their plan is to cut taxes for the wealthy AGAIN , putting even more of the tax burden on the backs of the middle class ?
Even Michael “ Humpty ” Steele is more together and sane than this .
I have just downloaded the 17 - page document ( budgets typically run thousands of pages ) .
Seventeen pages ?
seriously ?
And you expect me to believe that this is not a last - second response to the president ’s comments two days ago ?
Wanna know why you guys are a political laughingstock ?
This thing is fucking ridiculous .
I mean , totally laughable all the way through .
For example , their big plan is to eliminate the progressive tax system in favor of a two - tiered code : a tax rate of 10 percent for any one making up to $ 100,000 and a 25 percent rate for anyone making more .
That ’s insane .
The revenue loss that would generate is completely untenable .
it would create a loss in revenue for the gov of between 5 and 18 percent for the various levels up to $ 100,000 and up to 15 percent lost on those over .
It is important to note there is NOT a number detailing what this would cost nor a single spending decrease to match said loss .
Their reasoning ?
Republicans believe that future generations should not be burdened by mountains of debt for the misguided choices made by Democrats today …
Fair enough , but how do we pay for the last eight years of misguided choices by Republicans ?
It ’s one thing to oppose anything new , it ’s another to pretend like you guys did n’t already sell out the next three generations already .
Even Reagan , the great Tax - Cutting Godhead of the Republican party , realized the mistake he made in 1981 and was forced to raise taxes in 1982 and 1983 at a rate that is literally the Largest in American History .
But what do actual facts have to do with anything the Republican party has said in the past 20 years ?
The document , for the record , continues to lie about the president ’s proposal , repeating the same , tired , bullshit from the campaign , claiming that he would raise taxes on middle class Americans which , especially now that we have seen the actual document , is totally not true .
In the Obama plan , only those making $ 250,000 or more will see an increase ( back to the levels it was in the 90s , before the Bush Administration crashed the ship of state onto the rocks ) .
In fact , everyone making less than $ 200,000 gets a tax cut .
Try and find that mentioned in the Republican proposal , however .
What is fun , however , is to go through and detail the hypocrisy of these fucking screwheads .
Like this , for example :
Our inability to formulate an American energy policy is breaking local budgets , hampering our economy , undercutting U.S. foreign policy , and compromising our economic freedom .
Now , correct me if I am wrong , but is n’t the US energy policy a product of Dick Cheney ’s secret task force made up of oil executives ?
I mean , put blame where blame is due : it is the Republicans in Congress and the former Republicans in the White House that wrote the policy that is breaking local budgets , hampering the economy , undercutting foreign policy and compromising our freedom .
So why did Boehner and his slackjawed yes men vote for it ?
Seriously , is n’t this YOUR FAULT Johnny ?
( their solution , by the way , is “ drill , baby , drill ” and build nuclear plants .
Their idea of “ alternate ” fuel sources is oil shale , which is very , very costly to produce and actually creates more greenhouse gases in the process , which they , interestingly enough , acknowledge , though they offer no help in regulating them … )
Overall , this document is a joke .
A ridiculous sham of a plan filled with stale , failed ideas , rushed out at the last minute and packaged in falsehoods , lies , and bullshit .
It ’s like a junior high kid ’s idea of what the federal government does and how to fund it .
Though considering one of the main voices in the conservative movement is a 14 - year - old , perhaps that ’s not far off …
The Republican proposal is available here , on the House GOP Web site ( which , by the way , now bears a very striking and obviously copied resemblance to the styles used by the Obama campaign and White House… ) .
( Adds comment from Daimler , background )
DETROIT , Jan 13 ( Reuters ) - Electric car start - up Tesla Motors Inc on Tuesday said it had been selected by Daimler AG DAIGn .
DE to supply battery packs and chargers for an electric version of the Smart minicar .
Tesla founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said that the privately held company expected to supply components for about 1,000 battery - powered Smart cars initially .
But Musk also told a conference organized by the Society of Automotive Analysts that the supply agreement could run to tens of thousands of vehicles over time .
Tesla markets the $ 109,000 Roadster , a battery - powered performance car that is one of the first entrants in a segment of the auto market expected to grow quickly as consumers shift from traditional gas - powered engines to reduce carbon emissions and save money .
An electric - version of Daimler ’s Smart minicar has been on trial in limited numbers in Berlin and London .
The German car maker expects to launch the battery - powered car later this year in Europe and possibly the United States , said Daimler spokeswoman Julia Englehardt .
In December , Daimler , the maker of the Mercedes luxury line , bought a 49 - percent stake in Evonik ’s [ RUHR.UL ] lithium - ion battery unit .
But Englehardt said it would take time to develop Daimler ’s own in - house battery technology .
In the meantime , she said , Daimler engineers had determined that Tesla had the best available technology for the Smart .
San Carlos , California - based Tesla is also looking for electric car partnerships with one or two other major automakers , said Musk , who became a billionaire from founding the Internet payment service PayPal .
“ Sometimes there ’s this notion of Silicon Valley versus Detroit , which is completely untrue .
We want to work with Detroit , ” said Musk .
Tesla ran into a series of cost overruns and production delays with the Roadster before slashing 24 percent of the company ’s workforce and launching a $ 40 million convertible debt financing round late last year .
Separately , Tesla said on Tuesday at the Detroit auto show that it had begun taking orders for the $ 128,500 Roadster Sport , an even - faster version of the car capable of going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 4 seconds .
Musk said Tesla would unveil a battery - powered sedan known as the Model S at the end of February .
The company has applied for $ 450 million in U.S. government loans to fund the production of that car and to build a new plant that would supply electric - drive components to other automakers .

Developed economies such as Japan , the US and UK are in recession World economic growth is set to fall to just 0.5 % this year , its lowest rate since World War II , warns the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
In October , the IMF had predicted world output would increase by 2.2 % in 2009 .
It now projects the UK , which recently entered recession , will see its economy shrink by 2.8 % next year , the worst contraction among advanced nations .
The IMF says financial markets remain under stress and the global economy has taken a " sharp turn for the worse " .
In another gloomy view of the UK economy , the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( IFS ) said Britain would be saddled with government debt for more than 20 years .
IFS director Robert Chote warned that spending would have to be cut or taxes raised by more than planned to allow public finances to recover .
The predictions came as Pascal Lamy , the director general of the World Trade Organization , urged countries not to react to the global economic crisis by resorting to protectionism .
Speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos , Mr Lamy said such a move would be " a big mistake " .
' Virtual halt '
According to the IMF , the outcome of the economic slowdown has been to send global output and trade plummeting .
The current projection is a protracted recession and we have not reached the bottom yet
Justin Yifu Lin , World Bank Protectionism haunts the economy UK debt ' will last 20 years '
" We now expect the global economy to come to a virtual halt , " said IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard in a statement .
The IMF says that despite a number of policy moves , which have been carried out by many states , financial strains remain .
International co-operation is needed now to draw up new policy initiatives , and for capital injections to support " viable financial institutions " .
Meanwhile , it predicts that the eurozone economy is poised to shrink by 2.0 % in 2009 and the US economy by 1.6 % .
Banking crisis
The report comes on the same day the International Labour Organization said that as many as 51 million jobs worldwide could be lost this year because of the global economic crisis .
It had been hoped that growth in developing nations would continue at a steady pace and help offset the recession in developed nations such as the US and UK .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But the seemingly endless crisis in the banking system has put paid to that notion .
Countries such as China are now struggling with a collapse in demand from their primary export markets .
Meanwhile , developed economies such as Japan , Spain , the US and UK are in recession , with new job losses being announced on a daily basis .
' Uncertainty '
The IMF says that growth in emerging and developing economies is expected to slow sharply , from 6.25 % in 2008 to 3.25 % in 2009 .
It cites the main reasons for the drop as being falling export demand , lower commodity prices and much tighter external financing constraints .
If the recession deepens in 2009 , as many forecasters expect , the global jobs crisis will worsen sharply
International Labour Organization
Global job losses ' could hit 51 m '
The IMF points out that policy efforts to tackle the downturn so far - such as liquidity support , deposit insurance and recapitalisation - have been drawn up to address the immediate threats to financial stability .
However , it says that these emergency measures " have done little to resolve the uncertainty about the long - term solvency of financial institutions " .
" The process of loss recognition and restructuring of bad loans is still incomplete , " says the IMF 's World Economic Outlook Update .
' Bad bank '
The IMF says future co-ordinated financial policies should concentrate on recognising the scale of financial institutions ' losses and on providing public support to those institutions that are viable .
" Such policies should be supported by measures to resolve insolvent banks and set up public agencies to dispose of the bad debts , including possibly through a ' bad bank ' approach , while safeguarding public resources . "
The IMF says the global economy is projected to experience a gradual recovery in 2010 , with growth picking up to 3 % .
" However , the outlook is highly uncertain , and the timing and pace of the recovery depend critically on strong policy actions , " it warns .

A few moves escaped notice because they were never announced by the press office .
The White House 's missing documents
In his first weeks in office , President Barack Obama shut down his predecessor ’s system for reviewing regulations , realigned and expanded two key White House policymaking bodies and extended economic sanctions against parties to the conflict in the African nation of Cote D’Ivoire .
Despite the intense scrutiny a president gets just after the inauguration , Obama managed to take all these actions with nary a mention from the White House press corps .
Advertisement
The moves escaped notice because they were never announced by the White House Press Office and were never placed on the White House web site .
They came to light only because the official paperwork was transmitted to the Federal Register , a dense daily compendium of regulatory actions and other formal notices prepared by the National Archives .
They were published there several days after the fact .
A Politico review of Federal Register issuances since Obama took office found three executive orders , one presidential memorandum , one presidential notice , and one proclamation that went unannounced by the White House .
Two of Obama 's actions on regulatory reform were spotted by bloggers , lobbying groups and trade publications after they emerged in the Federal Register .
There was no apparent rhyme or reason to the omissions .
A proclamation Obama issued on February 2 for African - American History Month was e-mailed to the press and posted on the White House web site .
But another presidential proclamation the same day for American Heart Month slipped by .
Such notices were routinely released by the White House press office during prior administrations — making their omission all the more unusual given Obama ’s oft - repeated pledges of openness .
Most of the documents were posted to the White House web site Tuesday night , after Politico inquired about their absence .
“ It was a simple oversight , ” a spokesman , Ben LaBolt , said .
One order Obama signed Feb. 5 expanded the National Economic Council to 25 people by adding the Secretary of Health and Human Services ; Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ; senior adviser Valerie Jarrett ; “ climate czar ” Carol Browner and two other officials .
Another order the president signed the same day added two slots to the Domestic Policy Council , bringing it to a total of 26 people .
Some slots were reassigned .
The chief technology officer was among those added to the panel , while “ AIDS Policy Coordinator ” was removed .
It was unclear if that was a substantive change , simply reflected plans to keep the AIDS czar post at the State Department , or perhaps both .
Another Obama executive order , signed January 30 , canceled two Bush - era executive orders relating to regulatory review .
The White House did release chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ’s memo halting regulations in the works at federal agencies , but did n’t release another Obama memo setting a 100 - day deadline for agency heads to recommend a new regulatory review process .
The memo indicates that Obama may want to do some things differently on the regulatory front than the last Democrat in the White House , Bill Clinton .
Also waylaid was a notice Obama signed February 4 extending sanctions against some nationals of Cote D’Ivoire because of what he termed “ the massacre of large numbers of civilians , widespread human rights abuses , significant political violence and unrest , and attacks against international peacekeeping forces leading to fatalities . ”
Cable modem speeds are about to zoom a whole lot higher .
Thanks to the magic of channel bonding , DOCSIS 3.0 modems will soon be able to reach 300 +
Mbps — though cable users wo n't see Internet speeds in that range anytime soon .
DOCSIS is the cable modem spec that defines IP transfer across a cable company 's hybrid fiber coax ( HFC ) system .
Unlike earlier DOCSIS implementations , version 3.0 of the spec introduced channel bonding , a technology that can use parallel 6 Mhz cable channels to transmit data .
With each channel capable of around 40 Mbps , DOCSIS 3.0's baseline requirement that four channels be bonded meant that the cable industry had a technology that could compete with fiber by offering 160 Mbps of bandwidth .
( Comcast , one of the most aggressive of the cable operators , has already rolled out 50 M bps speed tiers . )
But four channels is merely a minimum .
Last year , Texas Instruments announced that its Puma5 DOCSIS 3.0 equipment would support the bonding of eight channels , and Broadcom announced the same thing at this year 's CES .
Eight channels offers 320 Mbps of downstream bandwidth ( these two systems feature only four bonded upstream channels , so they are n't designed for symmetrical connections ) , and cable operators must be pleased to see that their IP delivery solution has the headroom to compete with FiOS .
CableLabs , the industry 's research consortium , believes that the system can scale to " potentially gigabits per second . "
Now , only days after the Broadcom announcement , Cisco has revealed its plan to develop a new DOCSIS 3.0 modem based on the Broadcom silicon .
According to Multichannel News , the device will be submitted for CableLabs certification this spring , with widespread deployment scheduled for 2010 .
Not that home users will see 320 M bps downloads any time soon ; the new silicon is more about offering future room to grow than it is about immediate speed bumps .
Cable operators are n't yet taking advantage of even existing DOCSIS 3.0 capability in full , but a 320 M bps ceiling certainly gives operators like Comcast the ability to match Verizon 's speed increases at its discretion as the two companies play hare to AT&T's U - Verse tortoise .
Since Chevy Chase broke America ’s heart and shattered its will by leaving Saturday Night Live halfway through its second season , the show has conducted a sort of open - ended , decades - long casting call for the Next Chevy Chase .
Prerequisites for the gig include conventional good looks , height , smugness , and an almost blinding level of whiteness .

Charles Rocket was the first and most tragic of these faux - Chevys , a “ Weekend Update ” anchor tapped for Chase - like breakout status during the show ’s darkest hours .
Alas , Rocket ’s career nosedived when he flagrantly violated the show ’s strict prohibition against doing anything spontaneous by swearing during a “ Who Shot J.R ? ” bit .
Rocket ’s career never recovered , and after decades playing what I like to call the “ Chad ” character — the sleazy cad the heroine leaves in a romantic comedy so she can be with her true love — Rocket committed suicide by slitting his own throat in 2005 .

Contenders to Chase ’s smirktastic throne could naturally be found in the anchor chair of “ Weekend Update ” : twitchy sentient ball of sarcasm Dennis Miller , hunky Jimmy Fallon , and most spectacularly , the star of Dirty Work , Norm MacDonald .
( Thanks to commenter Dr. Venkman PhDs for suggesting Dirty Work for My Year Of Flops .
Incidentally , I was originally going to do this as a double entry with Screwed , but it was running long , and Screwed is just a terrible fucking film , in spite of a cast led by MacDonald , Dave Chappelle , Sarah Silverman , and Elaine Stritch .
It really does n’t merit being dug up just to be buried all over again . )
As anchor , MacDonald took Chase ’s air of Zen comic detachment to wonderful new extremes .
MacDonald embodied a sublime aloofness that made him a little dangerous .
At the same time , MacDonald won fans and enemies by regularly acknowledging facts that pretty much everyone in pop culture knew but mostly tiptoed around : that Michael Jackson was a pedophile , and O.J. Simpson a brutal double murderer .
As “ Weekend Update ” anchor , MacDonald was a riveting combination of schoolyard smartass and angry - white - man truth - teller .
Advertisement
He was also a whiz at impressions .
He did a definitive Burt Reynolds and a Bob Dole that usurped even Robert Smigel ’s impersonation as the gold standard .
Then in 1997 , something unexpected happened .
Norm MacDonald got fired because an NBC executive named Don Ohlmeyer did n’t think he was funny .
Briefly , it seemed like getting fired by “ The Man ” in such bizarrely public fashion was the best thing that could have happened to MacDonald .
Being fired by some fat - fingered , scotch - swilling , Cuban - cigar - smoking , comedy - illiterate cad in an Armani suit threatened to transform MacDonald from a divisive cult comedian into a full - fledged cult hero .
According to NBC ’s curious logic , MacDonald was n’t funny enough to be a cast member on Saturday Night Live in late ’ 97 , but he was big enough to host the show in 1999 .
Advertisement
MacDonald seemed to be failing upward , especially when he scored his own big - screen vehicle in 1998 ’s Dirty Work , which he co-wrote .
He seemed primed for Chevy Chase - like cinematic stardom .
Alas , after a few too many Chevy Chase - like bad decisions , he was widely seen as a Chevy Chase - like has - been .
These days , MacDonald pops up in sad Chevy Chase - like thankless supporting roles in dumb comedies ( Senior Skip Day , Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo ) while plotting a comeback and cultivating his contempt for humanity , Chevy Chase - style .
MacDonald lurched briefly back into the public eye during a roast of Dirty Work director Bob Saget with the following bit of brilliant , perversely wholesome meta-comedy .
But for a brief , shining moment at the tail end of the Clinton era , greatness seemed within MacDonald ’s boozy grasp .
Does anything take you back to the halcyon days of 1998 quite like a movie prominently using “ Semi - Charmed Life ” in its first 10 minutes ?
For those who do n’t remember ’ 98 , every film that year was legally required to use the ubiquitous Third Eye Blind hit , even Holocaust dramas and documentaries .
Especially Holocaust dramas and documentaries .
Advertisement
Like they say about the Age of Aquarius , if you remember ’ 98 , man , then you were n’t there !
’ Cause if you were there , you would have abused so many psychotropic drugs that they would have completely destroyed a lot of your cognitive functions , especially regarding memory retention .
Dirty Work scores a trifecta by using “ Semi - Charmed Life , ” Better Than Ezra ’s “ Good , ” and Chumbawamba ’s “ Tubthumping ” in its first 15 minutes .
Had it thrown in The Verve Pipe ’s “ The Freshman , ” the cheap nostalgia receptors in my brain would have exploded from overwork .

In Dirty Work , MacDonald plays a put - upon loser whose only joy in life comes from enacting revenge on people who ’ve done him wrong .
After he ’s fired from his 14th job in three months and is kicked out of his apartment by his angry girlfriend , MacDonald and best friend Artie Lange decide to combine business with pleasure by starting a revenge - for - hire business .
[ pagebreak ]
In its hilarious first half , Dirty Work embodies a curious cinematic subgenre I ’m beginning to suspect exists only in my mind : the ironic dumb comedy , the slyly postmodern lowbrow gag - fest that so lustily , nakedly embraces and exposes the machinations and conventions of stupid laffers that it becomes a sort of sublime bit of meta -comedy .
Doctor Detroit and Boat Trip are other examples of ambiguously ironic dumb comedies that constantly call attention to their own arch stupidity .
Advertisement
Also , Dirty Work is funny as fuck .
In the early going , at least .
MacDonald and co-writers Fred Wolf and Frank Sebastiano make no effort whatsoever to hide the hilariously transparent nature of their setups and payoffs .
Before finding their calling as professional pranksters , for example , MacDonald and Lange get jobs at a movie theater run by Don Rickles .
Does Rickles ’ movie - theater boss treat his employees with the respect and dignity they so richly deserve ?
Does he listen patiently to their concerns and work to foster an open , mutually symbiotic relationship between management and labor ?
No , he most assuredly does not .
On the contrary , he hurls invective and abuse his employees ’ way , almost like some sort of professional “ insult comic ” heckling his audience .
To get revenge , MacDonald and Lange swap out a print of Men In Black for the similarly titled Men In Black Who Like To Have Sex With Each Other , a film with telltale dialogue like the following :
“ Hey , it ’s an alien .
We better have sex with each other . ”
“ Hey , this alien looks like a hot guy . ”
“ You ’re right .
We better have sex with it . ”
But the setup / payoff for MacDonald and Lange ’s ill - fated movie - theater gig is subtle and seamless compared to the glorious , glorious scene where MacDonald learns that the cute girl he likes works as an accountant for a sleazy car dealer ( David Koechner ) who , in a funny , seemingly random twist , is about to become the first businessman in 40 years to film a live television commercial .
Advertisement
Has anyone taped live commercials since TV made the big switch from black and white to living color ?
Yet for the sake of a gag , live commercials are back , and Koechner is doing them without bothering to , I dunno , hire security so that some tall , lanky goofball gifted in the dark arts of revenge does n’t wreak comic havoc on his set .
MacDonald takes advantage of Koechner ’s appalling lapse of foresight by moseying onto the set , insisting that there ’s something wrong with the trunks of Koechner ’s cars , then watching in delight as Koechner opens trunk after hooker - filled trunk .
But why take my word for it , when you can watch the legendary hookers - in - trunks scene yourself ?
On Saturday Night Live , Norm MacDonaldcame to own the word “ whore ” the way Too $ hort owns the word “ bitch . ”
A drinking game could be devised from the many , many times Dirty Work derives titters of amusement from utterly gratuitous references to whores , dirty and otherwise .
Advertisement
If a great movie is one with two great scenes and no bad ones , then Dirty Work is half a great movie .
It contains more than its share of bad scenes , but it does have two brilliant ones .
There ’s the setpiece above , plus the genius sustained gag where MacDonald and Lange get revenge on a dude ’s loud , obnoxious neighbors by sticking dead fish all over their tacky new mini-mansion .
Advertisement
The revenge - happy slackers ’ delight turns to horror , however , when they overhear the house ’s mobbed - up inhabitants respond to the horrible new scent by brutally murdering each other in increasingly elaborate ways .
As the bloodshed escalates from garden - variety killing to way - beyond - Scarface ultra-violence , MacDonald and Lange ’s expressions go from child - like glee to absolute mortification .
I love how MacDonald and Lange maintain the same comic - book pose ( greedily clutching giant fish like characters in an old Looney Tunescartoon ) as their innocent little prank turns deadly .
Advertisement
Dirty Work also boasts what may be Chris Farley ’s finest big - screen performance , as a man whose life is defined by having had his nose bitten off by a Saigon whore .
( He ’s still a little bitter . )
And there ’s a rare return to form from Chevy Chase — who praised MacDonald as the only “ Weekend Update ” anchor to “ do it right ” — as a gambling - addicted doctor who sees everything through the filter of his imminent demise at the hands of enraged bookies .
Advertisement
MacDonald ’s commitment to his character begins and ends with not insisting that everyone call him “ Norm MacDonald , ” but that really does n’t matter , as Dirty Work is essentially a series of blackout gags , inspired one - liners , and non sequiturs stitched together with an arbitrary plot involving an evil real - estate mogul with a silly little dog he may or may not be fucking ( professional heavy / Chad Christopher McDonald ) and the daffy duo ’s attempts to raise $ 50,000 so they can afford to pay Chase to perform a shady operation on their desperately ill , whore - obsessed father ( Jack Warden ) .
Advertisement
After a certain point however , Dirty Work stops being a sly , funny meta -commentary on slobs - vs. - snobs comedies with stock characters and stupid plots , and becomes what it ’s ambiguously spoofing .
In its weak third act , Dirty Work devotes way too much time and effort to a plot it ’s better off ignoring .
But while it ultimately devotes too much time to trying to get audiences to care about its aggregation of one - dimensional joke machines , it still finds ways to undercut its plot ’s sentimentality by making Warden a horrible , foul - mouthed bastard and by having everyone ignore the earnest speeches of a philosophical homeless man played by veteran Saturday Night Live writer Jim Downey .
MacDonald is n’t much of an actor .
He basically has two moves : an “ Ain’t I a stinker ? ” smirk / grin , and an abashed , little - boy - with - hand - in - cookie - jar look of contrition .
But Dirty
Work does n’t call for anything more .
It lives and dies on a gag - by - gag basis , but that ’s no problem when it has lines like the following :
“ I understand you ’re upset .
Maybe you ’d feel better after we had some dirty sex . ”

[ To frat boys . ]
“ Now you go back to doing something latently homoerotic . ”
“ That ’s a picture of you and my mom having sex .
Why would you show me that ? ”
“ Back then , we did n’t have fancy birth - control methods , like pulling out . ”
“ If someone was taking bets on your father ’s bout with death , I ’d put everything I own on death .
It ’s a good bet .
The odds are he ’ll probably die . ”

“ Are you telling me you bet on the fight in Rocky III and you bet against Rocky ? ”
“ I ’ve never seen so many dead hookers in all my life . ”
“ It ’s either from sleeping the wrong way , or bookmakers throwing me out of a car . ”
Advertisement
“ You know how I feel about the homeless .
They ’re human beings and they have no homes . ”
“ Good Lord , I ’m in whore heaven . ”
But my favorite line in the film approaches slacker profundity : “ Note to self : no matter how bad life gets , there ’s always beer . ”
That line alone is enough to bump this half - genius , half - moronic comedy from Secret Failuress to Secret Success .

NEW DELHI , Feb 12 ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A hardline Hindu organisation , known for its opposition to “ corrupting ” Western food imports , is planning to launch a new soft drink made from cow ’s urine , often seen as sacred in parts of India .
The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) , or National Volunteer Corps , said the bovine beverage is undergoing laboratory tests for the next 2 to 3 months but did not give a specific date for its commercial release .
The flavour is not yet known , but the RSS said the liquid produced by Hinduism ’s revered holy cows is being mixed with products such as aloe vera and gooseberry to fight diseases such as diabetes and cancer .
Many Hindus consider cow urine to have medicinal properties and it is often drunk in religious festivals .
The organisation , which aims to transform India ’s secular society and establish the supremacy of a Hindu majority , said it had not decided on a name or a price for the drink .
“ Cow urine offers a cure for around 70 to 80 incurable diseases like diabetes .
All are curable by cow urine , ” Om Prakash , the head of the RSS Cow Protection Department , told Reuters by phone .
Prakash , who is based in Hardwar , one of four holy Hindu cities on the river Ganges where the world ’s largest religious gathering takes place , said the product will be sold nationwide but did not rule out international success .
“ It is useful for the whole country and the world as well .
It will be done through shops and through corporates , ” he said .
The Hindu group has campaigned against foreign imports such as Pepsi and Coca Cola in the past , which it sees as a corrupting influence and a tool of Western imperialism .
The RSS was temporarily banned after a Hindu mob tore down a mosque in 1992 which lead to bloody religious riots .
The Shiv Sena , a hardline Hindu political party also known for attacking what it sees as threats to Indian culture such as Valentine ’s Day , started a similar initiative last year to appeal to its powerbase in Mumbai .
To promote the food of the native Marathi culture , the Shiv Sena said it was “ making a chain like McDonalds ” to sell a popular local fried snack .

Fundamentalism is an term used to describe religious movements that reject modernism ( particularly scientific thought and secularism ) , that claim to find all truth , including science , history , and psychology , in their sectarian scriptures , and that often try to impose some degree of religious law on all citizens of any government they are able to control .
The type species is the Christian Fundamentalism of the 1920s , which is a reaction against Darwin 's theory of evolution ; by extension the term is applied to Haredi Judaism and Wahhabism in Islam .
In more abstract terms , it can refer to any movement to recapture an ideological " purity " within a religion , that supposedly has been lost by mainstream adherents of the religion at large .
Note that this definition would also apply to liberal Christians who seek a Sermon - on - the - Mount purity by engaging in works of charity .
Fundamentalists often assert the primacy of their own idiosyncratic interpretation of religious texts over centuries of acquired knowledge and practice .
This has the advantage of making great insights and profound wisdom available to all believers , but puts them at odds not only with the secular world and members of other religions , but also with their own brethren who find meaning in the modern world .
Though the term has been applied to anyone within any religion desiring to go back to the so - called fundamentals of the religion , the term originally applied to a more formal movement within Protestant Christianity in the 1920s that emphasized a literal reading of the Bible and a more militant approach to Christianity .
The formal movement ( often represented with a capital F ) ran out of steam in the mid-1930s , but the emphasis on literalism , inerrancy , and exceptionalism have permeated many different denominations within Christianity , giving rise to local churches within the larger body , who self - identify as " fundamental churches " .
Fundamentalists are sometimes referred to pejoratively as " fundies . "
Fundamentalist Christian groups can be Pentecostal and / or otherwise pietistic ( doctrinally focused on one 's personal relationship with God ) .
Fundamentalism is generally not fun at all , but is usually quite mental — duh .
Introduction [ edit ]
“ ” The problem is that moderates of all faiths are committed to reinterpreting or ignoring outright the most dangerous and absurd parts of their scripture , and this commitment is precisely what makes them moderates .
But it also requires some degree of The problem is that moderates of all faiths are committed to reinterpreting or ignoring outright the most dangerous and absurd parts of their scripture , and this commitment is precisely what makes them moderates .
But it also requires some degree of intellectual dishonesty because moderates can't acknowledge that their moderation comes from outside the faith .
The doors leading out of scriptural literalism simply do not open from the inside .
In the 21st century , the moderate 's commitment to rationality , human rights , gender equality , and every other modern value , values that are potentially universal for human beings , comes from the last 1000 years of human progress , much of which was accomplished in spite of religion , not because of it .
So when moderates claim to find their modern ethical commitments within scripture , it looks like an exercise in self - deception .
The truth is that most of our modern values are antithetical to the specific teachings of Judaism , Christianity , and Islam .
And where we do find these values expressed in our holy books , they are almost never best expressed there .
Moderates seem unwilling to grapple with the fact that all scriptures contain an extraordinary amount of stupidity and barbarism , that can always be rediscovered and made wholly anew by fundamentalists , and there 's no principle of moderation internal to the faith that prevents this .
These fundamentalist readings are , almost by definition , more complete and consistent , and therefore more honest .

Conversely , every moderate seems to believe that his interpretation and selective reading of scripture is more accurate than god 's literal words .
— Sam Harris , Islam and the Future of Tolerance : A Dialogue [ 2]:65
Fundamentalist rhetoric is frequently apocalyptic in order to provide their crusade with a driving theological imperative .
Typically , the world has become decadent and corrupt ; their co-religionists have become tainted by it ; and [ insert deity of choice ] is but a short time away from unleashing its loving Wrath ( of DOOM ! ) upon the whole sorry mess .
Only those who attain their stipulated degree of " purity " will be saved .
In more extreme cases , only the 'elect ' , or those chosen before birth for salvation , have the opportunity for salvation , and those less fortunate , no matter how saintly , are doomed to damnation by a fickle and capricious deity .
Although such rhetoric may serve to recruit wavering co-religionists to the cause , it also serves as a natural limiting factor on how successful fundamentalist thought can be outside of these circles .
Put simply , the majority of people respond very poorly to such a relentlessly negative message .
That they then champion 1000 + year old texts over the explanatory width and depth of modern science leaves the widespread acceptance of fundamentalist thought utterly hamstrung .
After said date of apocalyptic fury , you 'd expect for there to be apologies to those who believed .
Instead , however , a new date is often set .
This can get boring and lead to de-conversions after the fifth time someone has given away all their worldly goods in anticipation of the apocalypse .
Thus , fundamentalism is often doing harm to its own cause .
Etymology [ edit ]
The name " fundamentalism " is derived from the The Fundamentals , a series of pamphlets published anonymously in 1910 by Lyman Stuart , founder of Union Oil . [ 3 ]
The movement started among conservative Presbyterian theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary .
Fundament ( the foundation or basis of something ) + al ; Middle English ( also denoting the base of a building , or the founding of a building or institution ) , from Old French fondement , from Latin fundamentum , from fundare , " to found . " [ 4] :687 In fact , fundament shares a root with foundation , thus meaning " base , " " underpinning , " or " support . "
However , it also has a connotation of " bottom " , sharing the same informal meaning , as fundament is also synonymous with asshole .
[ 5 ]
Similarity to " fund a mental " is largely coincidental .
The five fundamentals of Christian fundamentalism [ edit ]
See the main article on this topic : Fundamentalist Christianity
Infallibility of the Bible .
The fundamentalist views the Bible as a divinely - inspired work authored by men acting under the direction of God , and as such is entirely error - free , even when it contradicts itself , which it does n't really , because … we said so , ok ?
Biblical literalism .
Biblical literalism is an approach to Biblical interpretation ; literalists hold that the meaning of the text is given by the plain meaning of the author (s ) .
Only those passages which are clearly allegorical or symbolic ought to be understood as allegory or symbolism .
That said , discerning which passages are clearly allegorical is exceedingly difficult , and , tellingly , differs from one congregation to another .
Also , it is hard to treat a text as the literal word of God when that text is a translation from a dead language .
The virgin birth of Jesus Christ .
Fundamentalists hold this against encroaching materialism which denies the supernatural .
The doctrine of substitutionary atonement .
Christ inserts his own perfect record , in place of ours , into the divine retributive mechanism .
The ethical implications of substituting guilt , like the questionable ethics of original sin , are studiously ignored .
The bodily resurrection of Jesus and the imminent personal return of Jesus Christ .
This fundamental is held in opposition to those who say Jesus appeared to Peter as a spirit , or that He will return only in a symbolic sense .
Jewish fundamentalism [ edit ]
The term Jewish fundamentalism may refer to militant Zionism , or Ashkenazi or Sephardic Haredi Judaism .
It may also refer to the more extreme elements within the settler movement in Israel , like Meir Kahane .
It has recently taken the form of attempting to get public buses segregated by gender , with women having to sit in the back of the bus .
The year 2013 also saw the start of ethnic bus segregation in Israel , but that may not have to do with Jewish religious fundamentalism .
Sometimes , Jewish fundamentalism gets violent , [ 6 ] such as pogroms against Palestinians by settlers in the West Bank ( or Gaza , back in the day ) , or Judaism - inspired terrorism in the West Bank , in the case of the Bat Ayin Underground , or like when violent , somewhat arsonist , demonstrations took place in recent years within Israel proper to protest the Israeli government getting more serious about preventing parents from using corporal punishment .
Attacks on LGBT Israelis at times have occurred .
There are also , however , Jewish fundamentalists that oppose the current Zionism movement — the Neturei Karta , for example — based on the doctrine that God must give approval to retake the Promised Land first , since them losing control of it was apparently a punishment from God .
Some of these go so far as supporting Palestinian terrorists .
Islamic fundamentalism [ edit ]
See the main article on this topic : Islamism
2013 Pew Research Poll concerning global Muslims ' views of various fundamentalist groups .
Islamic fundamentalists see sharia ( Islamic law based on the verses of the Qur'an ) as the cornerstone of their faith .
Their primary goal is the establishment of sharia - governed states .
Nations such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia are frequently criticized by human rights advocates for their brutal and illiberal treatment of women , homosexuals , and non-Muslims .
An example : for the " crime " of having been raped , a Saudi woman could be severely beaten , perhaps to death , by her own family for bringing dishonor upon the tribe . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Apostasy , the renouncing of one 's faith , is regarded as an insult to Allah and can also be punishable by death .
Terrorism [ edit ]
See the main article on this topic : Terrorism
Several Sharia - governed states have been accused of supporting terrorist groups .
The most notorious example was the Taliban government of Afghanistan , which sheltered Osama bin Laden and his Al - Qaeda terror organization , until being toppled by the US government .

Characteristics of fundamentalists [ edit ]
“ ” The problem not only with fundamentalist Christians but with
The problem not only with fundamentalist Christians but with Republicans in general is not that they act on blind faith , without thinking .
The problem is that they are incorrigible doubters with an insatiable appetite for Evidence .
What they get off on is not Believing , but in having their beliefs tested .
That 's why their conversations and their media are so completely dominated by implacable bogeymen : marrying gays liberals , the ACLU , Sean Penn , Europeans and so on .
Their faith both in God and in their political convictions is too weak to survive without an unceasing string of real and imaginary confrontations with those people — and for those confrontations , they are constantly assembling evidence and facts to make their case .
But here 's the twist .
They are not looking for facts with which to defeat opponents .
They are looking for facts that ensure them an ever - expanding roster of opponents .
They can be correct facts , incorrect facts , irrelevant facts , it does n't matter .
The point is not to win the argument , the point is to make sure the argument never stops .
Permanent war is n't a policy imposed from above ; it 's an emotional imperative that rises from the bottom .
In a way , it actually helps if the fact is dubious or untrue ( like the Swiftboat business ) , because that guarantees an argument .

Once you grasp this fact , you 're a long way to understanding what the Once you grasp this fact , you 're a long way to understanding what the Hannitys and Limbaughs figured out long ago :
These people will swallow anything you feed them , so long as it leaves them with a demon to wrestle with in their dreams .

Religious fundamentalism and education [ edit ]
One of the tenets of religious fundamentalism is how easy it is for the " pure " to be spoiled , which leads to a desire for as much of life as possible to be lived outside of mainstream society .
Obviously the unrestrained contact with others of different opinions / beliefs is dangerous to the young fundamentalist , and avoiding such opportunities may be achieved by homeschooling , or in whole institutions dedicated to maintaining the purity of the schooled , with the added advantage of captive audiences who are more easily indoctrinated .
See Pensacola Christian College and Jesus Camp for prime examples .
The world of fundies [ edit ]
The world of fundamentalists consists of snake handlers , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Moonies , primitive rockin ' back 'n forth , eyes rolled back in their heads Southern Baptists , roll - in - the sawdust , babble - in - tongues gibbering Pentecostals , whacked - out television and radio " send us yer money Thank Yaw Jesus !

Atheist fundamentalism ? [ edit ]
See the main article on this topic : Atheist fundamentalism
There really is no such thing , since atheism is not a religion and does not have a set of tenets or doctrines .
Thus the concept of " fundamentalism " cannot easily be applied to atheism .
Nevertheless , terms like " atheist fundamentalist " are often used by critics of atheism to associate prominent and vocal atheists such as Richard Dawkins with the excesses of fundamentalism .

More on : Monetary Policy
Over the last couple of years it was often asserted that sovereign investors -- due to their long time horizons -- tend to be a stabilizing presence in markets that they invest in .
The argument was generally made about sovereign funds , but it presumably applied at least in part to central banks as well .
They have a somewhat shorter time horizon than most sovereign funds , but they also presumably care a bit more about financial stability .
Alas , there is now one clear case where an abrupt shift in central bank purchases destabilized a market .
Central banks stopped buying Agency bonds in August and never resumed their purchases .
The US Treasury now says that Agency bonds are " effectively " guaranteed -- and they certainly have more Treasury backing than in the past .
But that was n’t enough to convince the world ’s central banks .
They now want nothing less than a full guarantee .
The latest ( year - end ) data from the New York Fed on foreign central banks ’ custodial holdings shows that the magnitude of the shift out of Agencies and into Treasuries in the later part of the year .
Central banks went from buying $ 250 - 300b of Agencies a year ( judging from the growth of their FRBNY portfolio ) to net sellers of Agencies in a rather short period of time .
The 3 month ( proxied by the 13 week ) change , in billions of dollars , in the Fed ’s custodial holdings is even more dramatic in some ways .
It leaves no doubt that central banks have been large sellers of Agencies .
The Fed ’s custodial holdings of Treasuries rose by $ 250 billion over the last three months of 2008 while the Fed ’s custodial holdings of Agencies fell by $ 150 billion .
Try annualizing these numbers .
In the fourth quarter , central banks were buying Treasuries at a $ 1 trillion annual pace and selling Agencies at a $ 600 billion annual pace .
It seems hard to argue against the proposition that a sudden increase in central bank ’s risk aversion has contributed to the distress in a key part of the US market .
Central bank reserve managers ’ core concern , of course , is n’t stabilizing the US debt market .
It is making sure that they have enough liquid assets to meet their own country ’s liquidity needs .
It used to also be to make a bit of profit on the country ’s -- before it swung to making sure that they did n’t take credit losses .
The net result , though , was a lot of pressure on the Agency market in the fourth quarter -- and a lot of central bank demand for Treasuries just when private demand for Treasuries also soared .
Suddenly risk adverse reserve managers sold what was cheap and bought what was dear , magnifying rather than dampening market moves .
This experience should also to some way toward settling another debate : are central banks ’ purchases and sales big enough to impact prices in large , liquid markets ?
Many argued that the Treasury market was so deep and so liquid that it could absorb even large central bank sales without too much trouble .
Central banks ( net ) purchases were large relative to the Treasury ’s ( net ) sales , but they were n’t that large relative to total Treasury market turnover .
That led many to argue that if central bank sales ever pushed a bond away from its fundamental value , private buyers would step in -- preventing any large move in price .*
The Agency market is n’t a perfect analogue to the Treasury market .
But it is quite large -- the outstanding stock of Fannie and Freddie bonds ( counting Fannie and Freddie guaranteed MBS ) is over $ 5 trillion .
Agency issues are n’t quite as homogenous as Treasury issues , but they do n’t differ that much from each other either .
Both Freddie and Fannie have lots of outstanding bonds in the market -- and , at least until recently , the Agency market was also considered to be fairly liquid .
It still does n’t seem to have been able to absorb the big swing in central bank demand .
Agency spreads widened significantly when central banks pulled back ( the expansion in the supply of debt with an implicit if not explicit guarantee also played a role ... ) .
They only came back in when the Fed indicated it would start buying Agencies ...
And it sure seems like the enormous increase in central bank demand for Treasuries is one -- though certainly not the only -- reason why Treasury yields are so low right now .
The obvious risk here is that the US government will infer too much from the fact that Treasury yields collapsed even as Treasury issuance soared .
The current surge in central bank demand for Treasuries is unlikely to be sustained , if for no other reason than global reserve growth has slowed and central banks have a finite supply of Agencies to sell .
I personally think this risk is manageable , as I expect a meaningful rise in US savings ( an a fall in investment ) will free up domestic funds for the Treasury ( or start to flow into the banks , allowed the Fed to scale back its loans to the banks and scale up its Treasury holdings ) .
But it is a risk .
In one key respect though , central banks have remained a stabilizing force : they abandoned the Agency market , not the dollar market .
This underscores an important point , one that I wish I had recognized earlier .
Central bank reserve managers can influence the US market in two very different ways :
a) By shifting out of one asset and into another asset .
Selling Agencies and buying Treasuries for example .
Or selling equities to buy Treasuries .
b) By shifting out of the dollar
A country like China that is effectively pegged to the dollar can shift the composition of its US portfolio around without putting much pressure on the dollar or its peg .
Moving from Agencies to Treasuries is consequently a fairly low cost option for China .
Sure , China gives up a bit of yield .
But it does n’t have to abandon its exchange rate regime .
It is an option that China can exercise at a low cost to itself .
Moving away from the dollar , by contrast , would require adjustment in China - not just adjustment in the US ... and that has n’t been something that China has been willing to do .
NOTE : I replaced by initial charts -- which used the monthly data -- with charts that show the 52 week and 13 week change in the custodial holdings .
Thanks to Paul Swartz for help with the more detailed charts .
* The argument could also be made in reverse .
If central bank purchases drove a bond ’s price up too much , private investors would sell -- so the bond ’s price ( and yield ) would n’t move away from its " fundamental " value .
That led some to argue that central bank purchases could n’t have much of an impact on say the Treasury market .

For the longest time , ALL Nokia phones use the same plug , so any Nokia can use any other Nokia 's power plug .

How about laptop power adapters ?
Every company , every model is different .
Sony has no less than a dozen different adapters of various voltages and sizes , even though as far as I can tell they all seem to have the same plug .
And those " universal " ones sold in stores ...
They do n't seem to sell a tip for the Sony series I got .
I had to order one off eBay ( which is much cheaper than one of these " universals " as well ) .
Nick Clegg said the temporary VAT cut had made little difference Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has added his voice to concerns that the government 's temporary 2.5 % VAT reduction has been a " waste of money " .
The party would have spent the £ 12.5 bn cost of the measure on creating jobs through investments to make schools , hospitals and homes greener , he said .
Tory leader David Cameron has branded the VAT cut an " expensive failure " which did not encourage shoppers .
The government insists it is offering help to families .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , Mr Clegg restated the Lib Dems plan to build a " fairer " tax system through income tax cuts for low and middle - income earners .
" We would not waste £ 12.5 bn on the VAT cut which the Prime Minister has delivered , which we do n't think makes much difference , " he said .
" We would use all of that money for a green investment programme , insulating every school and every hospital in this country , and installing smart meters in every home .
" That kind of radical action not only creates jobs but it 's good for the kind of green economy we need in the future . "
' Radical action '
On Friday , Mr Cameron cited figures from the latest Retail Insight Report , which suggested retail footfall was down 3.1 % in December from a year earlier .
" This government , that lectured us about prudence , has spent £ 12.5 bn of our money ... and wasted it , " he told the BBC .
But the government has defended the decision to reduce VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % until the end of 2009 .

It says the cut was the fairest way to get money into the economy because low - income households spend a larger share of their income on VAT than richer households .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown also argues that he acted to recapitalise the banks , bring forward public spending and increase child tax credit and payments to pensioners .
There has been some criticism of the VAT change from two German politicians and the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund .
The Lib Dems tried to get it overturned in a Commons debate in December , when Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said it was " seriously defective " as a way of getting money into the economy .

LOS ANGELES
WHEN Emily Cook , a screenwriter , bought a house four years ago in Eagle Rock , a neighborhood on the Northeast side of Los Angeles , she fantasized what the area might look like in a year or two , with cafes and boutiques replacing tattered old businesses .
“ It was like fantasy football , ” said Ms. Cook , 38 , who also sings in a band named Fonda .
A sad flower shop on the corner , she thought , could become a miniature Whole Foods .
An upholstery store could be a gastropub where she and friends would grab a beer , and a neglected 1940s diner could become a retro spot for a quick meal .
But Ms. Cook has stopped fantasizing about what might be , and started worrying about what might shut down .
The flower store has closed ; no gourmet market is moving in .
Lucy Finch , a vintage boutique , folded last month .
That Yarn Store , a hangout for crochet - heads , did n’t survive a bad winter .
And what will become of the storefront that once housed Blue Heeler , which sold Australian imports ?
“ Please do n’t make it another martial arts studio , ” Ms. Cook pleaded .
“ What is it about Eagle Rock and martial arts ? ”
The EU equality law that will let ' upset ' atheists sue companies that hang up crucifixes
Crucifixes in public places - including hospices - could provoke civil action under the new laws
Organisations which hang crucifixes on walls could be sued if they upset atheists under equality laws proposed by the European Union .
Any group offering a service to the public , including hospitals , charities , businesses and prisons , would be at risk .
Legislation may also allow Christians to bring an action against a hotel if it displayed something they deemed offensive - such as a poster for the 1979 Monty Python film The Life Of Brian .
There are already laws banning harassment in the workplace , but the new Brussels regulations are designed to offer people protection from providers of goods and services .
However , they are so broad that critics say they could lead to a spate of civil cases by anyone claiming their dignity has been violated by the ' hostile environment ' of an organisation .
The Church of England says hospices or charities for the homeless could face legal action if people using their services felt degraded by their religious practices or symbols , such as the cross .
The Archbishops ' Council even fears that charities could be challenged by atheists if grace is said before meals .
The Law Society says religious believers may also be able to launch a civil action for harassment .
In an official submission to the EU , the society said : ' For instance , in a shop or shared lodging house , there may be a notice board on which is posted material that some of those who see it will find offensive on religious grounds ( for instance , a poster for a film , such as The Life Of Brian ) . '
The proposals , which go before EU governments for approval later this year , are part of a new directive outlawing discrimination by businesses on the grounds of sexual orientation , age , disability or belief .
If approved , it will become the latest in a swathe of European - inspired equality laws which critics say stifle freedom of speech and marginalise religion .
The Government tried to introduce a similar law in 2005 but dropped it after a resounding rejection by the House of Lords .
Peers feared it would encourage politically correct officials to stop public expressions of religion , such as carol services or Bibles by hospital bedsides .
Simon Calvert , of the Christian Institute , said the proposed EU directive would ' open a Pandora 's box ' .
He asked : ' What about Gideon Bibles in hotel bedrooms ?
Would councils ban nativity scenes from Christmas displays ?'
A spokeswoman for the Government Equalities Office , which is responsible for the EU directive , said it was felt that existing UK law was ' adequate ' .
The idea of a national smart grid might be hitting the mainstream and may also have a considerable budget behind it , but up until now there is no federal law to aid it ’s implementation .
That is all set to change this week when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will unveil a bill to create some federal muscle to push the smart grid forward .
The Nevada senator told a meeting of political , business , energy and labor bigwigs in Washington , D.C. , yesterday , that he plans to introduce an energy bill late this week that , if passed , would expand government authority for siting transmission lines .
It would , he said , put an end to an era in which one state can “ hold up forever something that needs to be done for the good of the country . ”
Such a move would make it easier to build infrastructure for carrying energy from places with abundant wind , solar and geothermal energy resources to population centers with higher demand for electricity .
He said the bill will be bipartisan , but did not disclose a Republican co-sponsor .
Senator Reid revealed his timetable and a few important details about the bill at the National Clean Energy Project summit .
The event that had in attendance such luminaries as former Vice President and Kleiner Perkins partner Al Gore , Secretary of Energy Steven Chu , energy magnate T. Boone Pickens , former President Bill Clinton ( who called for Congress to pass a federal decoupling mandate ) , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Asked in a press conference about potential resistance to the bill on the part of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners , a group of 253 state regulators , Reid said , “ Whatever we pass at a federal level trumps all of that . ”
However not everybody supports this one rule for all route .
VantagePoint Venture Partners VC and longtime environmental advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , did n’t express flat - out opposition at today ’s summit , but he wondered if three systems — one for the East , West , and Texas regions , respectively — might offer a more viable solution .
Each of the three regions has a workable balance of renewable energy supply and demand , and the smaller scale could simplify negotiations .
The real fight will come from state regulators , according to Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Jeff Bingaman .
States that would get transmission lines but no energy ( crossover states ) have reason to worry about getting short shrift .
Not so with Nevada — part of the reason Reid has championed the issue .
He noted that his state has far more geothermal and solar resources than its population demands .
“ We ca n’t use it all , ” he said .
“ We need to be able to take the energy where it ’s needed . ”
Gore added that long - distance transmission lines offer a way to transition off of faraway coal power plants , but could eventually be used to support distributed systems .
Much of the resistance to a national grid stems from the issue of where and how electricity gets dropped off along a transmission route .
Here , the DOE may be able to help .
Secretary of Energy Steven
Chu said he plans to support development of advanced switches and industry - wide standards .
With improved technology , off - and on - ramps along an interstate highway system for electricity would become more feasible , helping to bring crossover states on board .
February is rapidly becoming a milestone month with respect to renewable energy in the U.S. with first the stimulus bill and now a possible smart grid bill coming into being .
In American politics , “ Europe ” is usually a code word for “ big government . ”
So in the midst of a global recession , with the U.S. and China shelling out trillions in fiscal stimulus , you might expect that European governments would be spending furiously , too .
Far from it .
While the U.S. is devoting almost six per cent of its G.D.P. to fiscal stimulus , France and Germany are spending a barely noticeable twenty - six billion euros and fifty billion euros , respectively .
Whereas the U.S. hopes that the upcoming G20 summit will lead to a global stimulus package , European policymakers have been warning against the dangers of “ crass Keynesianism . ”
The U.S. Federal Reserve has been flooding our economy with money , but the European Central Bank has cut interest rates slowly and reluctantly .
Far from wild - eyed leftists , Europeans are looking downright conservative .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
Europe ’s response has earned it plenty of criticism , with pundits arguing that its politicians are oblivious of the seriousness of the crisis .
There may be some truth in this charge , but Europe ’s caution also reflects important differences between its economy and ours , as well as a profoundly different attitude toward things like inflation and debt .
If European and American policymakers seem , in their public statements , to be dealing with two very different financial crises , it ’s because , in some sense , they are .
To begin with , the biggest European countries , which have the most influence on policy , have not been crushed by this recession .
In countries like Ireland and Spain , where huge housing bubbles burst , the devastation has been immense .
But in Germany , where there was no bubble , fewer people are struggling with debt or watching their wealth go up in smoke .
To be sure , Germany ’s economy , which is heavily dependent on exports , is not in good shape ; it looks set to shrink more this year than the U.S. economy .
But the unemployment rate in Germany has risen much less than it has here .
Indeed , in most of Europe job losses have been less severe , in part because unemployment was already quite high .
The U.S. unemployment rate has risen nearly three percentage points since January , 2008 .
Europe ’s is up barely one per cent .
In addition , since most European countries have an elaborate social safety net , a recession has a less dramatic impact on people ’s daily lives .
In the U.S. , unemployment insurance pays relatively little and runs out relatively quickly , so losing a job usually means a precipitous decline in income .
In European countries , unemployment benefits are typically substantial and long - lasting .
This is not entirely a plus — it probably makes unemployment higher than it otherwise would be — but in hard times it keeps money in people ’s pockets .
( And paying for it means that European government spending automatically rises quite a bit during recessions . )
Furthermore , universal health care enables Europeans to see a doctor even if they ’re out of work .
None of this means that Europeans are indifferent to recessions or unemployment .
But it does reduce the pressure to get their economies moving again at any cost .
Furthermore , there seems to be an underlying difference in psychology .
Americans talk a good game about the need for balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility , but we ’ve proved ourselves happy to borrow trillions in order to maintain our life styles .
And , while Americans hate inflation , they love economic growth more : the Federal Reserve ’s mission is not just to fight inflation but also to maximize employment .
Europe runs a much tighter ship : if an E.U. member has a deficit of greater than three per cent of G.D.P. , it ’s subject to disciplinary action .
And the European Central Bank has only one mandate : keep inflation low .
European economic policy seems to reflect the conviction that inflation , not stagnation , is the greatest threat to an economy .
If the episode that haunts the U.S. is the Great Depression , in Europe , where the Germans have been dominant in shaping economic policy , the defining historical moment is the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany , when prices rose more than seventy - five billion per cent in just one year , 1923 , and , in the words of Walter Benjamin , “ trust , calm , and health ” vanished .
The legacy of that episode lives on not just in German policymakers ’ inflation phobia but also in their sense that there is something fundamentally distasteful about debt .
For Germany , fiscal rectitude even in the face of a crisis is not just economically sensible but morally correct .
There ’s a price to be paid for hostility toward fiscal stimulus and easy money : Europe and , arguably , the world will take longer to recover .
But European policymakers seem willing to weather this outcome in exchange for stability .
They ’re also probably counting on the fact that , even as they sit tight , their economies will get a boost from the American and Chinese stimulus packages .
The thing about government spending is that it “ leaks ” : a good chunk of our stimulus package will buy other countries ’ goods .
So Europeans can avoid getting too deeply into debt and still reap some of the benefits of our borrowing .
This is unfair : in effect , Europe is refusing to carry its share of the global economic burden and is piggybacking on us .
But it ’s hard to see how things could have turned out otherwise .
The U.S. economy , much more than Europe ’s , is like the proverbial shark : if it does n’t keep moving forward , it dies ( or at least creates a lot of misery ) .
In some sense , we need economic growth more than Europe does .
It ’s not surprising that we ’re going to be the ones who end up paying for it .

William Black , now a professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri ( Kansas City ) was a senior bank regulator during the savings loan crisis ( his claim to fame was his pursuit of Charles Keating of Lincoln Savings , in which he was removed from the initiative and more management friendly investigators were assigned , and events later proved Black correct ) .
Black has seen a lot of bad behavior at close range .
He is not at all impressed with how the Treasury has handled AIG .
Via e-mail :
This is the consequence of six things on the Treasury end of things : ( 1 ) the failure to use Chapter 11 bankruptcy / pass - through receivership to deal with deeply insolvent financial institutions ( 2 ) the failure to expose , and to the extent possible , remedy through restatements the massive accounting fraud that AIG was / is engaged in that triggers the bonuses ( 3 ) the failure to bring criminal charges against the control frauds ( 4 ) the failure of Treasury as negotiators — they had all the leverage when they bailed out AIG and could have conditioned the aid on at least the VP tier and above giving up their bonuses ( 5 ) the weakness of Treasury ’s current lawyers who , if press reports are accurate , could n’t think of any way for the U.S. government to take effective action against what it reportedly views as a scandal , ( 6 ) ( and I have n’t seen this discussed ) why was Treasury blind - sided by this ?
It confirms that they did not conduct even the most obvious due diligence on AIG ’s assets and contingent liabilities Given what we know about the lack of due diligence by AIG on underlying assets , particularly nonprime paper , this confirms exactly how dangerous Treasury is to the the nation .
It is also consistent with the concern that it faces such a critical staff shortage , particulary in the relevant skills ( which the folks it hires from Wall Street lack ) .
I doubt that they have five senior officials that have ever reviewed loan files for a living or conducted meaningful due diligence ( which requires cracking the loan files ) .
On the AIG end we see the perverse incentives of keeping the senior level folks on that caused the crisis .
They have every incentive not to be honest about the true extent of the losses .
They know the place is dead ( hopelessly insolvent ) and have strong incentives to loot the corpse , e.g. , through bonuses .
They do not alert Treasury sufficiently in advance even to bonuses that they should know will be perceived as scandalous ( though another problem with keeping these failed elites in power is that they are clueless about the reaction of normal people ) .
They do not work to limit bonuses , e.g. , by being honest about past accounting fraud .
I believe when the facts come out that we will find that they did not make criminal referrals on the prior senior officials that led AIG ’s accounting fraud ( which would have given AIG and the Treasury a far stronger legal basis for refusing to pay bonuses that were “ earned ” via accounting control fraud .
I do n’t oppose bonuses that are actually earned through long term performance .
That is not the case with the AIG bonuses .
We can offer well designed performance pay if we use bankruptcy or receiverships .
We see tonight another lame defense that the Treasury is trying really hard to claw back the bonuses .
Please .
Even if Treasury consulted outside counsel , I would strongly suspect it would be a large firm with a big corporate clientele .
Guess what ?
At those firms , HR is a backwater .
The best HR lawyers are typically at boutiques or solo operators because they sue large corporations ( that would represent a rather insurmountable conflict of interest for any firm seeking to represent those nice big meal ticket clients ) .
I ’m not current , but a decade ago , there was a woman lawyer ( I can not recall her name to save my life ) who was an absolute killer , When a wronged executive or employee walked in with her at their side , BIg Co. knew they had a very serious problem on their hands .
I am told by people who used her she was also a phenomenal negotiator on deals .
It ’s certain that Treasury did not attempt to secure advice from that sort of attorney .
And to Black ’s point , the real issue is fraud .
Why is no one at Treasury willing to use the F word ?
Who would it embarrass ?
There is not reason for NOT pursuing that angle , save that AIG must have the 5 ×7 glossies on some pretty influential people , or that pursuing fraud at AIG would , via a daisy chain of connections , reveal that fraud was pervasive , and the Treasury is desperate to preserve the false image that the system has integrity .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the drugmaker Wyeth on Wednesday , holding that pharmaceutical companies can be held liable for harm from medicines that carry warnings approved by federal regulators .

By a 6 - to - 3 vote in a major defeat for the pharmaceutical industry , the high court ruled that U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling approvals do not pre-empt state laws and shield companies from damages as part of liability claims .
A Vermont jury awarded $ 7 million in legal damages to a guitarist , Diana Levine .
Part of her arm had to be amputated after she was improperly injected with the anti-nausea drug Phenergan made by Wyeth as part of treatment for a migraine .
“ The question we must decide is whether the FDA ’s approvals provide Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine ’s tort claims .
We conclude that they do not , ” Justice John Paul Stevens concluded in the court ’s majority opinion .
Levine ’s attorneys argued Wyeth should have given stronger warnings about the dangers of administering the drug in the way she received it .
Wyeth said its labeling on Phenergan provided clear instructions and warnings .
The company also said it believed federal law prohibited it from revising the information .
“ We regret that the Supreme Court disagreed , ” Bert Rein , an outside lawyer for Wyeth , said in a statement .
Levine ’s attorney and consumer advocates welcomed the ruling as a win for patients .
The court ’s opinion “ reaffirms the important role state laws play in promoting consumer safety and providing compensation for injuries , ” said David Frederick , the lawyer who argued the case for Levine .
Federal pre-emption has been a major drug industry goal and was backed by the Republican Bush administration and business groups upset by large damage awards .
Stevens rejected the argument that Levine ’s claims of harm were pre-empted because it would be impossible for Wyeth to comply with both state - law and federal labeling requirements .
He said Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about the IV - push administration used with Levine , and there is no evidence the FDA would have rejected the change .
Under federal law and FDA regulations , the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times , Stevens said in the 26 - page opinion .
He also rejected Wyeth ’s argument that requiring it to comply with state - law duties to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress ’ purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions .
Stevens said Levine presented evidence of at least 20 incidents before her injury in which a Phenergan injection resulted in gangrene and an amputation .
As the amputations mounted , Wyeth could have analyzed the accumulating data and added a stronger warning , he said .
Stevens said the FDA traditionally has regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation .
“ The FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market , and manufacturers have superior access to information about their drugs , especially in the post - marketing phase as new risks emerge , ” he said .
Chief Justice John Roberts and justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito dissented .
“ This case illustrates that tragic facts made bad law , ” Alito wrote .
Neither federal law nor FDA regulations “ suggest that juries may second guess the FDA ’s labeling decisions , ” he wrote .
Mexico's war on drugs taking toll on tourism
Police investigate a car where three bodies were found in the border city of Tijuana , Mexico , Wednesday Jan. 28 , 2009 .
Three men , one as young as fifteen , were found dead of gunshot wounds inside the car .
Homicides and kidnappings have surged in Mexico recent years as cartels battle each other for territory and fight thousands of troops deployed to drug hotspots across the country .

When planning a January vacation with his girlfriend , Oakland resident Jeremiah Nadya had only Mexico in mind .
" Tickets are dirt cheap if you know where to look , " he says .
" It 's close .
It 's beautiful . "
His sentiment is shared by many Bay Area travelers .
But Nadya readily admits that a trip south of the border can also be something else : dangerous .
As President Felipe Calderon attempts to weed out police corruption and break down drug cartels , there has been a power vacuum among narcotic traffickers - and a new wave of narco - violence in Mexico .
In its latest travel warning , the State Department declared in October that " some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have taken on the characteristics of small - unit combat . "
Although experts say the major tourist destinations remain safe , many travelers from the Bay Area and elsewhere are avoiding areas like Rosarito Beach in Baja and limiting trips to border towns such as Juarez and Tijuana .
More than 5,600 people in Mexico died last year as a result of drug - related violence - double the number from 2007 , according to Mexican newspaper El Universal .
" The bigger concern for American citizens - for whom the odds of getting kidnapped or killed are still extra-small , something like the odds of getting struck by lightning - are the increases in other incidences of crime : small - scale robbery , assault , rape , " says David Shirk , a criminal justice expert and director of the Trans - Border Institute at the University of San Diego .
" I think that Mexico in the past 10 years has experienced a significant increase in criminal activity , " he adds , a situation he feels is likely to worsen in a global recession .
Skipping some destinations
Travel writer Maribeth Mellin , who lives in San Diego , has been happily exploring Mexico for more than 20 years .
But during the past year , as drug - war - related crime shot upward , certain destinations have become off - limits to her .
" I live about 20 miles from Tijuana , and I have n't been for over a year .
When I write about San Diego and Mexico , I no longer include information about Tijuana , " she said .
" Now I do n't even recommend daylight trips there .
" I 'm sorry to say that - I feel sorry for the businesspeople .
I just think that your chances of being an innocent bystander or witnessing something bad are higher now . "
The State Department declined to give numbers of U.S. victims of crime in Mexico , but noted in its update that " rates for robberies , homicides , petty thefts and carjackings have all increased over the last year across Mexico generally , with notable spikes in Tijuana and northern Baja California . "
The reason for the rise in crime , according to Shirk and others , is the breakdown of the large cartels .
It may be too soon to judge Calderon 's strategy of making the criminal syndicates smaller , but , at least in the short term , it has n't stopped the flow of narcotics through Mexico and has only fueled the violence .
Spike in kidnappings
" The problem with that ( tactic ) is that the crime gangs got broken but are not ' more manageable , ' " Shirk said .
He noted an increase in lower - level criminal activity - " not quite petty crime , but smaller - scale stuff .
The big cartels never had much of an interest in kidnapping , for instance . "
As of late November , there had been 943 reported kidnappings in the country , up from 630 in November 2007 , according to the Christian Science Monitor .
( Kidnapping is also known to be extremely underreported . )
In one of the most publicized cases , an American security expert in the northern town of Saltillo to give corporations advice on how to avoid being abducted was himself taken away mid-meal at an upscale restaurant in late December .
He remains missing .
Some recent visitors to Mexico say the reports of disorder have been overblown .
Music teacher John Gabriel , 31 , of San Diego recently returned from a month in the Mexican state of Veracruz and spent time in Tijuana .
He said that the recent increase in drug - related violence was " a topic of conversation , " but it did n't affect his trip .
" I would definitely say that the impression that the Americans get in the media is more intense and hyped - up than reality , " Gabriel said , although he did acknowledge that he has curtailed drives down the Baja coast in response to criminal activity .
Bay Area resident Larry Habegger , who writes the syndicated World Travel Watch column , called security issues in Mexico " complicated . "
' Be careful , stay informed '
" Millions of people go to Mexico every year without any incident whatsoever , " he said .
" The situation is grave in some sense , but it 's not that significant for most tourists .
...
But people need to be careful and stay informed where the major incidences are happening .
I would not do a road trip to Baja , for instance .
I would not go to the surf sites . "
Mellin , the travel writer , says that although she has seen evidence of reduced tourism in certain parts of the country , the demand for her articles on Mexico seems to be just as strong in 2009 .
" People who know Mexico will keep going .
It is less expensive than many places , and it is easier to get there , " Mellin said .
She does n't intend to do much differently other than avoid certain places .
" But then , I 'm cautious .
I do n't do stupid things .
I dress appropriately and I 'm not rude to people .
I try to speak Spanish as much as possible , " she said , " These are all the things that I do as a traveler anywhere . "

Thousands of UK workers are being trained to help respond to a future terror attack as part of an updated counter - terror strategy , ministers say .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said shop and hotel workers would be among 60,000 people able to deal with an incident .
The updated approach , aimed at tackling immediate terrorist threats and the causes of extremism , would be the most comprehensive in the world , she added .
But the Tories said not enough action was being taken against extremists .
' Closed doors '
The Home Office 's new counter - terrorism document - to be published on Tuesday - will go into more detail than ever before in the interests of public accountability .
It will reflect intelligence opinion that the biggest threat to the UK comes from al - Qaeda - linked groups and will also take into account recent attacks on hotels in the Indian city of Mumbai .
Ms Smith told BBC One's Politics Show : " What we 're completely clear about is that if we 're going to address the threat from terrorism , we need to do that alongside the 60,000 people that we 're now training up to respond to a terrorist threat , in everywhere from our shopping centres to our hotels .
Tens of thousands of men and women throughout Britain ... have now been trained and equipped to deal with an incident
Gordon Brown
" We need to do it alongside the 3,000 police officers now working on counter - terror and we need to do it with international partners .
" This is no longer something you can do behind closed doors and in secret . "
The paper - called Contest Two - will update the Contest strategy developed by the Home Office in 2003 , which was later detailed in the Countering International Terrorism document released in 2006 .
Over the last six years the strategy has concentrated on preventing radicalisation of potential terror recruits to disrupting terrorist operations , reducing the UK 's vulnerability and ensuring Britain is ready for the consequences of any terror attack .
The updated strategy will increase the focus on challenging individuals and groups who undermine the UK's " shared values " - even if they are not breaking the law .
' Daily business ' Gordon Brown said tens of thousands of civilians had already been trained in how to look out for suspicious behaviour in crowded places and to react in the event of an attack .
The prime minister told the Observer : " Today , not only the police and security and intelligence officers and our armed forces , but also the emergency services , local councils , businesses and community groups are involved in state - of - the - art contingency planning .
" Tens of thousands of men and women throughout Britain - from security guards to store managers - have now been trained and equipped to deal with an incident and know what to watch for as people go about their daily business in crowded places such as stations , airports , shopping centres and sports grounds . "
We have really got to do more to stop some of the fostering of hatred that is still visible and present in our society
Chris Grayling , shadow home secretary
While the paper will look into the lessons learned from the November attacks in Mumbai , it is not thought attacks are likely on hotels in the UK .
The terrorism threat level , set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre , has since July 2007 been " severe " .
Ms Smith said an attack was " highly likely " but stressed the UK was " much better " at identifying threats , particularly international ones , and foiling them than in the past .
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling welcomed some of the proposals but said too little was being done to tackle the " root causes of extremism " .
Earlier this week , the Tories claimed the government had failed to close down a single terror website since Tony Blair pledged action in 2005 .
" The government is not doing enough to deal with some of the groups who are potentially fostering extremism , " Mr Grayling said .
" We have really got to do more , I think , to stop some of the fostering of hatred that is still visible and present in our society . "
One terrorism expert said equipping people to react quickly to an attack in the workplace and in public areas was a " bold and imaginative " step .
" There are thousands of people not only in the public sector but in the private sector also who have the necessary knowledge and skills to help in the constant vigilance that is needed against the terrorist threat , " said Professor Paul Wilkinson , from St Andrew 's University .
By 2011 , Britain will be spending £ 3.5 bn a year on counter - terrorism , the Home Office has said .
The number of police working on counter - terrorism has risen to 3,000 from 1,700 in 2003 .

Computer scientists affiliated with the Center for Research on Computation and Society ( CRCS ) , based at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) , in collaboration with scientists at the Université Catholique de Louvain ( UCL ) in Belgium , deployed the first practical , web - based implementation of a secure , verifiable voting system for the presidential election held at UCL earlier this week .
Called Helios , the system was developed by Ben Adida , a fellow at CRCS and an instructor / researcher at the Children 's Hospital Informatics Program , Harvard Medical School .
Professors Jean - Jacques Quisquater and Olivier Pereira and Ph.D. student Olivier de Marneffe at UCL worked closely with the UCL Election Commission to integrate Helios into the University 's infrastructure , implement UCL 's custom weighted tallying system , and optimize the verification tools for the election size .
" Helios allows any participant to verify that their ballot was correctly captured , and any observer to verify that all captured ballots were correctly tallied , " said Adida .
" We call this open - audit voting because the complete auditing process is now available to any observer .
This revolutionary approach to elections has been described in the literature for more than 25 years , yet this is the first real - world open - audit election of this magnitude and impact of outcome . "
The verifiable voting system , available as open - source / free software , implements advanced cryptographic techniques to maintain ballot secrecy while providing a mathematical proof that the election tally was correctly computed .
Helios relies upon public key homomorphic encryption , a method where a public key is used to encrypt a message ( in this case , a vote ) ; messages can be combined under the covers of encryption ( in this case , tallying the votes ) ; and multiple independent private keys are required to decrypt the message ( in this case , the election tally ) .
In an election , Helios works as follows :
• first , each voter receives a tracking number for his / her vote and the vote is encrypted with the election public key before it leaves the voter 's browser ;
• second , with the tracking number , a voter can then verify that their ballot was correctly captured by the voting system , which publishes a list of all tracking numbers prior to tallying ; and
• finally , the voter , or any observer including election watchers from outside the election , can verify that these tracking numbers ( the encrypted votes ) were tallied appropriately .
The election results contain a mathematical proof of the tally that cannot be " faked " even with the use of powerful computers .
" Because the tallying happens under the covers of encryption , the entire verification process is done without revealing the contents of each individual vote , " explained Adida " Moreover , by using Helios , voters no longer need to blindly trust those supervising the election , as officials must provide mathematical proofs that everything was done appropriately . "
The system was first tested in smaller elections throughout 2008 and then , in early February 2009 , on a population of 3,000 voters at UCL in anticipation presidential election held during the first week of March .
The UCL Presidential election was available to 25,000 eligible voters , of which 5,400 registered and 4,000 cast a ballot .

The assassinations were committed gangland style – a bomb in a stairwell , and a rapid fire shootout – which is perhaps not so surprising in a country that has swiftly become a major transit hub for narcotics into Europe .
But the tit - for - tat revenge killings of Guinea - Bissau 's top two leaders , its Army chief and its president , have left this poor country without leaders and the prospect of continued military rule .
By Monday evening , the tiny African country 's Army had shut down two private radio stations , and had escorted the president 's widow and children to the home of the United Nations representative in Guinea - Bissau .
Meanwhile , the Armed Forces assured citizens on state - run radio that no coup was in process , but that the Army would respect the Constitution and allow the head of parliament to succeed the president .
Unstable region
Coming just a month after an apparently popular coup in the neighboring country of Guinea , the double assassinations in Guinea - Bissau are a troubling sign for a region with weak institutions for self - government and strong incentives for corruption .
" This is bad news for the country , and there are real risks of factional fighting between elements of the military , " says Richard Moncrieff , senior analyst for the International Crisis Group , based in Dakar , Senegal .
" But the question now is what direction the Army intervention takes .
To my mind , the risks are the mid-level officers , [ who ] are not used to running a country and tend to react harshly if a problem comes up . "
With a weak economy and institutions of governance , it 's not surprising that Guinea - Bissau is seen as a haven for criminal enterprises .
In recent years , Colombian drug cartels have begun flying small planes across the Atlantic , landing on tiny islands dotting the Guinean coastline .
Since Guinea - Bissau has no navy to patrol its waters , the cartels were free to unload tons of cocaine destined for Europe .
The drugs were then distributed to impoverished African migrants , who would carry the drugs north by boat to the shores of France , Italy , and Spain .
Government corruption , fed by poor government salaries at the bottom and uncertain political leadership at the top , means that Guinea Bissau has few tools to stop the drug trafficking .
Rivalry goes back decades
While the bad blood between Army chief Gen .
Tagme na Waie and President Joao Bernando Vieira goes back decades , tensions increased during the country 's November 2008 elections , after General Waie accused President Vieira of involvement in the drug trade .
After a narrow escape from an assassination attempt in November , Waie publicly stated that the president wanted to get rid of him and was using his personal armed militia of 400 men to hunt him down .
" This recent set of killings can be explained [ as ] the action of the drug traffickers , who would not allow anything to get in the way or to obstruct their links with Europe , " says David Zounmenou , a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Tshwane , formerly known as Pretoria .
" Africans are very reluctant to call for external interventions , " Dr. Zounmenou adds , noting that many African countries are still suspicious of Western countries , some of which were colonial rulers less than 50 years ago .
" But drug trafficking is not a domestic matter anymore .
It affects the stability of many countries , it affects systems of governance , and it allows groups to acquire weapons . "

As predicted Rush Limbaugh took the bait that Democrats laid out for him as today he went on the attack against the White House as he accused Barack Obama of trying to malign him and as an added bonus he attacked Michael Steele for calling him an entertainer .
Limbaugh said that Obama is using him to distract America , “ Well I do n’t hurt .
I am not hurt by any of this .
What this is , though , is cruel .
It is cruel because it is a game of manipulation emanating from the Oval Office .
It is an attempt to distract Americans from the destruction of their ability to earn a living .
It is an attempt to distract you from your plunging economy .
It is an attempt to distract you from your ability to save for retirement and to pursue happiness .
You see , honest face - to - face discussions are fair … ”
Limbaugh talked about naming him the head of the GOP as a game , “ This ongoing game of naming me the head of the Republican party …
The point here is to take me … malign me , take me out of context , what I said , attach it to the Republican party in general because President Obama wants no debate .
President Obama wants no discussion .
President Obama , as has been his modus operandi since he got into politics , is not a level playing field , is to clear the playing field and he has , of course , this army of the drive - by media assisting at every turn . ”
Advertisements
Notice that Rush ’s ego would not let him say that he is n’t the head of the Republican Party .
Limbaugh could have said that this was all silly , because of course Michael Steele is the head of the GOP , but instead Limbaugh chose to attack Steele , “ Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds ?
I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda .
I have to conclude that he does because he attacks me for wanting it to fail . ”
Well if Michael Steele is n’t the leader of the GOP , then who is ?
My guess is that Limbaugh , despite his protests about liberal conspiracies and being taken out of context , sees himself as the leader of the Republicans .
He obviously served notice to Steele today that he is n’t going to give the RNC chairman any respect .
In fact , by lumping him in with Obama , Limbaugh is trying to discredit Steele , and push him out the door .
Limbaugh is also trying to construct a fantasy about Obama .
In reality , all the president has done is consistently try to reach out to Republicans and talk about the issues , or perhaps Limbaugh did n’t see Obama ’s fiscal summit on television where he took questions from Republicans like John McCain and Eric Cantor .
This myth that Limbaugh is trying to create about Obama not wanting to have honest discussions , does n’t ring true to anybody with a set of eyes and ears .
Rush not only took the Democratic bait , but he gleefully attacked the chairman of the GOP .
This is a big test for Steele .
Does he back down to Limbaugh or stand his ground ?
The answer to this question will go a long way in determining the future path of the Republican Party .
Limbaugh has no power outside of his conservative listeners , so he means nothing to Obama , but for Steele , Rush is a major problem that could tear the Republican Party along its fault lines .
Oh , I ’ve heard many reasons why we should circumcise a baby boy .
Some of the popular ones are :
I want him to look like me .
He ’ll be a freak in the locker room .
You have to .
Boys who are n’t circumcised are dirty .
Jennifer ’s post last week , WTF ?
Baby Boys ’ Circumcised Foreskins Used for Wrinkle Treatment made me laugh out loud .
Mostly it was her shock at upcycling foreskins .
As I commented on that blog , I ’d already known they “ reused ” foreskins .
My sister had been involved with a skin grafting on a foot that used those circumcised scraps .
If feet and penises combined for life are n’t your idea of fun , perhaps you ’ve already hopped on the no-circumcise bandwagon .
Still not sure ?
Here are 11 Reasons to Avoid Circumcising Your Son…
1 . It is not your body .
This is a huge reason to leave your son intact .
It is his body , and he should be allowed to choose whether to have surgery on his most private parts .
If you choose now not to circumcise , he can always make a different choice later in life .
Not so if you snip .
2 . For the dads :
Your son will never “ look like you ” in every way .
Boys rarely see their fathers ’ penises past a young age , and no matter what , grown men ’s penises look very different in size and hair content from their baby boys ’ .
Daddy , that “ because I am ” argument is a pretty poor one .
Your mother made the decision to circumcise you in a culture very different from ours .
Would you also have your wife not breastfeed if your mother did not ?
3. Trauma .
I ’d say being born was a pretty hardcore experience , would n’t you ?
At least from the mama ’s end , it ’s hard work .
I can only imagine how rough it is for that little guy to work to get out !
And how do we give him the big “ congratulations ” ?
By cutting off a part of his body !
Good job , young chap …
Now , you wo n’t be needing this anymore .
4 . It ’s cosmetic surgery .
Would we get him rhinoplasty , too ?
Actually , lets have the circ doc toss that one in for free , shall we ?
5 . Locker room fears : if 40 % of boys are now left intact ( and more in some places ) , your son wo n’t look much different than others in the locker room .
And anyhow , why would boys be checking each other out in the first place ?!
I should think that the one poking fun would be the guy with the real problem !
6 . On the supposed increased risk for urinary tract infections : UTIs are rare in boys , much less common than for girls .
Recent studies suggest there is no difference in the amount for circumcised boys than for intact boys .
7 . On the supposed increased risk for STDs : Some of the studies suggesting that the risk for HIV is lessened by circumcision are flawed , in that they concentrate on populations in Africa , where HIV rates are much higher than Western countries .
A 2007 study offers that it is the percentage of female sex workers in the female population , not the incidence of male circumcision , that determines the level of HIV infection .
As an alternative to cosmetic surgery , I suggest you teach your son to respect his body , choose partner (s ) wisely , and always use protection .
8 . And another medical “ reason to circumcise ” : phimosis , or a foreskin that wo n’t retract .
The foreskin gradually becomes retractable between infancy and 18 years of age .
For most kids it ’s in the first few years .
It ’s nothing we should either rush or worry about .
In fact , only 1 percent of males over 18 still have an unretracted foreskin , and then it can be easily treated with a topical steroid cream .
The risks of this happening , however , are small , because stimulation of the foreskin during adolescence helps this happen naturally .
( And that ’s something that no adolescent boy minds doing ! )
9 . Have you heard it decreases the risk of penile cancer ?
Yeah , I got that one a bunch , too .
My argument was this : breast cancer in females is much more prevalent than the risk of penile cancer for males .
So tell me , when your daughter begins to develop breasts , will you cut those breast buds off … just in case ?
And according to the medical dictionary from the National Institutes of Health ( which I was delighted to see use the word “ smegma ” ) ,
Uncircumcised men who do not keep the area under the foreskin clean and men with a history of genital warts or human papillomavirus ( HPV ) are at higher risk for this rare disorder .
10 .
The cleanliness thing .
A boy is not dirty who bathes regularly .
Given a little soap and water , he should stay clean .
Incidentally , this “ dirty ” thing is the same argument used by proponents for female genital mutilation .
1l .
And , finally : Would you circumcise your daughter ?
Actually , you ’re lucky I ’m not going all hardcore on you , and posting a video of the process .
It ’s quite horrific .
If you can stomach it , look and pics and videos before you finalize a decision that your son will have to live with for the rest of his life .
As one pro-intact group says :
Circumcision is a solution in search of a problem .
I mean , we all believe in recycling , but how ’bout if they use that soft foreskin on a middle - aged woman ’s wrinkles ?
What fun !
This was n’t an easy decision in my house when I found out I was having another boy .
I went a little bit more into our “ debate ” over the matter in my original post discussing circumcision at Nature ’s Child blog .

It may be possible to " read " a person 's memories just by looking at brain activity , according to research carried out by Wellcome Trust scientists .
In a study published in the journal Current Biology , they show that our memories are recorded in regular patterns , a finding which challenges current scientific thinking .
Demis Hassabis and Professor Eleanor Maguire at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL ( University College London ) have previously studied the role of a small area of the brain known as the hippocampus which is crucial for navigation , memory recall and imagining future events .
Now , the researchers have shown how the hippocampus records memory .
When we move around , nerve cells ( neurons ) known as " place cells " , which are located in the hippocampus , activate to tell us where we are .
Hassabis , Maguire and colleagues used an fMRI scanner , which measures changes in blood flow within the brain , to examine the activity of these places cells as a volunteer navigated around a virtual reality environment .
The data were then analysed by a computer algorithm developed by Demis Hassabis .
" We asked whether we could see any interesting patterns in the neural activity that could tell us what the participants were thinking , or in this case where they were , " explains Professor Maguire , a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow .
" Surprisingly , just by looking at the brain data we could predict exactly where they were in the virtual reality environment .
In other words , we could ' read ' their spatial memories . "
Earlier studies in rats have shown that spatial memories – how we remember where we are – are recorded in the hippocampus .
However , these animal studies , which measured activity at the level of individual or dozens of neurons at most , implied that there was no structure to the way that these memories are recorded .
Hassabis and Maguire 's work appears to overturn this school of thought .
" fMRI scanners enable us to see the bigger picture of what is happening in people 's brains , " she says . "
By looking at activity over tens of thousands of neurons , we can see that there must be a functional structure – a pattern – to how these memories are encoded .
Otherwise , our experiment simply would not have been possible to do . "
Professor Maguire believes that this research opens up a range of possibilities of seeing how actual memories are encoded across the neurons , looking beyond spatial memories to more enriched memories of the past or visualisations of the future .
" Understanding how we as humans record our memories is critical to helping us learn how information is processed in the hippocampus and how our memories are eroded by diseases such as Alzheimer 's , " added Demis Hassabis .
" It 's also a small step towards the idea of mind reading , because just by looking at neural activity , we are able to say what someone is thinking . "
Professor Maguire led a study a number of years ago which examined the brains of London taxi drivers , who spend years learning " The Knowledge " ( the maze of London streets ) .
She showed that in these cabbies , an area to the rear of the hippocampus was enlarged , suggesting that this was the area involved in learning location and direction .
In the new study , Hassabis , Maguire and colleagues found that the patterns relating to spatial memory were located in this same area , suggesting that the rear of the hippocampus plays a key role in representing the layout of spatial environments .

BURNETTOWN , S.C. , Feb. 10 ( UPI ) -- Police in South Carolina said a pair of 10 - year - olds allegedly tried to trade marijuana for money , bubble gum and pies .
Burnettown police said fourth - grade classmates of the two children at Jefferson Elementary School told teachers Thursday that the boys were attempting to sell marijuana to other children , the Aiken ( S.C. ) Standard reported Tuesday .

Police Chief David Smith said the school 's principal seized more than three grams of the drug from the two boys .
He said investigators do not believe any children smoked the marijuana .
" Right now , we believe this was an isolated incident , " Smith said .
Smith said police do not know where the children obtained the marijuana and the two boys have changed their stories numerous times during questioning .
The police chief said the boys face a school advisory council to determine punishments and a date in family court .
ハクビシン駆除は、まずは建物からの追い出しや捕獲、そして消毒と侵入口の封鎖という流れでおこなわれます。これによりハクビシンは建物からいなくなりますし、再度の被害も生じなくなります。昨今ではハクビシンの数も被害件数も急増しているので、ハクビシン駆除の需要は高まっています。
ハクビシン駆除を専門業者にお願いする時には、その業者がそれぞれの自治体から狩猟の許可をちゃんと得ているのかを確かめておきましょう。またハクビシン駆除はホームセンターなどで売られている道具を使えば専門業者に頼まずとも自分で行うこともできます。
意外な場所に生息します
ハクビシンと は
一時期ニュースでも話題になっていたある害獣がいます。それはハクビシンです。都内でも生息が確認されています。でも、可愛い姿とは裏腹に夜行性で獰猛な一面を持つハクビシンは、屋内に生息してしまうととても厄介な存在です。では、具体的にはわたしたちの生活に、どのような影響を与えるのでしょうか。屋内に巣を作る場合、特に多い生息場所は天井裏や屋根裏などの暗い場所です。夜行性の特徴として、暗い場所を好むため、こうした人間の目につきにくい場所に住まう傾向があります。すると、糞尿を残していくため、非常に不衛生な場所と化してしまうのです。また、寝静まった後に物音が激しくなるので不快感もあります。
的確に駆除するためには
ハクビシンは、ゴキブリ・ハチなどの害虫とは異なり、サイズが大きい害獣です。そのため、駆除は大掛かりになる事があるので、対策を考える場合捕獲よりも追い出しの作戦を考える方が、ハクビシン駆除は早まります。では、どのようなものを使用すると良いでしょうか。ハクビシン駆除には嫌う匂いを散布するという方法があります。特にハーブの匂いを嫌うので、ハーブを焚くことで追い出しやすくなります。また、煙の匂いも嫌うので、煙を屋根裏に焚くことも効果的です。ハクビシン駆除に苦慮している場合には、専門の業者もいます。こうした業者は、アフターケアで巣の存続がないかもチェックしてくれるので、素人では行き届きにくいハクビシン駆除が完了しやすくなります。また、業者では害獣による駆除の他にも、シロアリ駆除やハチ駆除も行なっているところもあるため、被害に合って困っている人は専門業者へ相談してみるとよいでしょう。シロアリ駆除やハチ駆除を行なうことで被害を食い止めることができます。
( Our restaurant is within walking distance of an assisted living center so many of our regulars are special needs adults .
We get a regular group of four people who have to make their order the same way every time .
The routine involves the four of them reading the menu board for about five minutes and then one of them ordering each of them a hamburger individually . )
Me : “ Hey !
What can I get you ? ”
Special Needs Customer : “ I would like a hamburger and a hamburger and a hamburger and a hamburger . ”

Ah , the magic of Twitter .
I ’ve been on there for the past year and during that time have become a green business hub of sorts .
Every day , 10 - 20 new people “ follow ” me ( choose to have what I say be tracked by them )
One particularly interesting one was EnergyCircle .
In a miraculously concise statement of purpose , they say , “ Our singular goal as a company is to take the complexity out of home energy . ”
How do they do that ?
Through telling their own stories .
Exploring what ’s going on out there .
Teaching you how to best do it yourself .
And know when it ’s time to bring in a professional .
Then , armed with knowledge , encouragement , and others to identify with , they have a store full of ways to put talk into action .
My antennae went up when I saw they sell space heaters .
Seeming to know this would be an issue , they have a quick , fun video in their blog entry YES !
Sometimes an Electric Space Heater Makes Sense .
[ social_buttons ]
It argues that the ones they sell more broadly ( and vertically ) distribute heat , so they ’re not just heating at the ground level .
But , um , does n’t heat rise ?
I ’d be interested to see one that is energy efficient as well .
Well , more efficient then their other energy hog brethren .
Energy Circle is a great example of the effective use of blogs and other social media to add value , enhance their offering , create more sales , but not be ham fisted about it .
They create a believable “ We ’re one of you ” feel about the site , basically being people that were in the same place many of their potential customers were a few years ago – wanting to have a healthier , more energy efficient home , but a bit at a loss as to how to do it , and where to start .
In challenging economic times like these , EnergyCircle may be just the thing for many homeowners , looking to save money without having to spend a lot to do so .
Readers :
What other businesses are you seeing out there effectively integrating being a resource with being a business ?
What energy efficiency tools have you been using / interested in recently ?
I look forward to your comments below .
This has been a serious problem for months so it ’s still not clear what is going on between Dodd and Obama on who asked for what bailout language .
Either way , it does n’t look good nor does it help the case of the floundering Geithner .
Obama is in a deep hole with this problem and does not have the right team to move forward .
He can either stay with Timmy or cut his losses now and find a grown up who is more focused on helping the country as a whole instead of remaining friends with Wall Street .
As I ’ve said before , Obama is making a mistake if he thinks this is not going to drag him down .
The entire process including bringing in Geithner and his team has been chaotic and that does not help bring confidence to anyone .
Three in four Americans ( 76 % ) want the government to take actions to block or recover the bonuses insurance giant AIG paid its executives after receiving federal bailout funds .
The results are based on a one - night Gallup Poll conducted March 17 , 2009 , after reports that AIG , the recipient of about $ 170 billion in federal aid , recently paid its executives $ 165 million in bonuses .
AIG contends it had to pay the money because of existing contracts that were in place before the company received bailout funds .
On Capitol Hill Wednesday , members of the House Financial Services committee said they were determined to get the money back , demanding from Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy the names of the bonus recipients .
Answering questions from lawmakers , Liddy acknowledged that doling out the bonus money was “ distasteful . ”
Reports about the AIG bonuses have dominated the news cycle this week , with lawmakers and journalists chiming in about taxpayer “ outrage . ”
In the Tuesday night Gallup Poll , 59 % of Americans said they were personally “ outraged ” by the bonuses .
One in four ( 26 % ) said they were “ bothered ” and just 1 in 10 ( 11 % ) said they were not that bothered .
In an earlier post I mentioned that I was using CorePy for my cryptographic fiddlings .
Rather than writing the code in assember in the traditional way , I took advantage of CorePy to program directly against the x86 ISA in Python .
In CorePy , machine instructions , registers and suchlike are first - class objects which can be composed to create executable code .
The result is something like writing code to generate assembler input as text , but far more satisfying to work with , resulting in cleaner abstractions and code .
We do not shell out to an assembler , but directly call the CorePy code object we generate .
I probably would not have written this at all if I had not been inspired to try CorePy when our colleage Majek drew attention to it , and if I had I doubt it would have been finished within a few hours of starting as it was .
Well , I still think CorePy is very cool , but it turned out to introduce some tricky problems of its own , and by taking more care about how I use it I have sped up my program by nearly three orders of magnitude .
At first I thought that it was simply that my assembly was so fast that the Python excution time was dominating .
In fact , Python is a little faster than I thought , and it was CorePy itself that was taking the bulk of the time .
My inner loop executed in less than 1000 clock cycles , but the per-call overhead was far greater – more like 21,000 cycles .
In addition to this per -call overhead , however , I had to reckon with a cost of nearly 1500 cycles for every 32 - bit integer I loaded and stored from CorePy ’s native arrays .
This contrasts with a cost of less than 200 clock cycles to store one in a native Python list , or around 250 cycles for a NumPy array .
If you have CorePy installed , you can see for yourself .
So I had a very powerful machine , but I could only talk to it through a very narrow pipe .
My workaround can be found in the latest version of trivium - corepy .
In addition to the assembly for computing Trivium itself , there ’s now assembly specific to performing the cube attack .
The code now takes a list of bit indexes to flip .
Looping over these indicies it runs Trivium , XORs the output bits into a result area , and then flips the indexed bit in all 128 instances of Trivium inside the buffer before doing it all again .
This means that each run lasts much longer , making the 21000 cycle overhead less significant .
It ’s still better to have more than one run , though , because of the cost of the writes needed to set up this index array – in fact , the sweet spot is reached when the total penalty from the writes to set up the index array is equal to the total penalty from the per-call overhead , because it is easy to double one by halving the other .
So the indices are divided into three groups – those that will be handled in Python , those that will be handled by looping in assembly , and those that will be calculated in parallel by our 128 simultaneous instances of Trivium .
It ’s with this technique that I ’ve been able to find the problematic maxterms in the original Dinur and Shamir paper , and verify that the replacement maxterms I recently received from Dinur all work fine .
I ’ve even set the code on finding new maxterms , and found some for output bits up to 714 , though the techniques I ’m using are fairly basic ( for example , I do n’t yet take advantage of the fact that we get lots of output bits at once for free ) .
Overall I think that I ’m still glad of what CorePy gives me , but I think that it could be simpler still to write fast programs if those overheads could be significantly reduced .

America the beautiful ...
Let 's not forget :
In spite of the right ( and left ) wing psychos , the criminal politicians and their clients in corporate America , and the utterly corrupt news media , there still is a " genius for humanity " in America .
Here is one of the people who represents the highest ideal of what it means to be an American : Stan Ovshinsky .
Take the time to learn about this man and please share this with others .
MONTREAL –
It might be quite beautiful , with its golden cross next to the steeple , its triumphal arches inside , its extraordinary Casavant organ presiding , but that has n't stopped Notre - Dame - du - Perpétuel - Secours from steadily becoming abandoned .
Barely 100 seats in its pews built for 1,000 are taken on Sundays , and that 's on a good day .
" We take in maybe $ 100 or $ 125 during the collection , " says Father Pierre Charbot , shrugging .
Not nearly enough to even pay the heating .
As a result , the church is for sale .
But the west - end edifice has been on the market for more than a year , and so far , no one 's buying .
Officials are still hopeful , but as of now , the majestic grey - stone church is a white elephant .
The fire sale of Catholic churches in Quebec continues unabated ; they are victims of a population that , more than elsewhere in Canada , has turned its back on organized religion .
Fewer than 10 per cent actually attend mass .
This has meant that virtually no parish has been free from the dilemma of what to do with a church it does n't want to part with , but can no longer afford .
Some churches have found new lives as community centres , libraries and social housing projects ; others as condos , factories and even a rock - climbing gym .
And though the provincial government has stepped in to help , a new headache is creeping up .
Parishes are facing the prospect of finding no buyers for their churches , not even the municipalities of which they 're a part , and so they 're being increasingly abandoned , barricaded and demolished .
" There are churches that are not finding takers and it will be necessary to barricade them , " said Germain Tremblay of the Montreal - based Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Quebec .
" Even in selling them for $ 1 , it 's happening that no buyer is interested in the churches for sale .
This is new . "
Well more than 100 churches have been sold in the last decade , a very conservative estimate considering that in the dioceses of Montreal , Quebec City and Sherbrooke alone , 74 have disappeared in roughly that time frame .
However , that 's only three of 25 dioceses in Quebec .
The exact number sold has never been tabulated .
" It 's sad , but it 's reality , " said Gérald Baril , spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Canada .
" People do n't care much about spirituality and do n't care much about the church . "
" We simply have too many churches under our charge , " said Rémy Gagnon , who advises parish administrative counsels for the diocese of Quebec City .
" And so for those judged in excess , we must mobilize all the organizations , public and private , to propose new uses for the buildings we can save . "
A few years ago , Quebec did an inventory of churches with the most historic value .
The province also launched a program to help parish administrative councils , or fabriques , pay for 70 per cent of the costs of keeping the churches standing , but only for those built before 1945 .
In 2006 , concern that the province 's religious history was in " great peril " led a National Assembly committee to call on the Liberal government to halt the sale of churches .
The then - culture minister refused , saying it would put local parishes in financial dire straits .
The sales continued .
A church 's historic significance does not mean it will be saved .
Take the case of the dual - steepled Church of Saint - Eustache , north of Montreal , whose stones still bear traces of cannon fire by the British in 1837 .
Quebec Patriote leader Jean - Olivier Chénier and 100 of his followers died there in the decisive battle .
The church 's maintenance has become so cost prohibitive for the parish , they 're giving it away .
The fabrique 's president , Nycole Pepper , said it must , however , remain a church .
But to make it viable , they 're considering turning it into a music recording hall , because of its good acoustics .
More churches have been sold in the region of Sherbrooke than anywhere in the province because , officials there say , an activist bishop in the 1950s wanted to make sure a church was accessible in even the smallest place .
Twenty - five churches have changed hands , some for $ 1 , in the last few years .
And it 's also in this diocese where the most varied uses for unwanted churches have been realized .
One has been turned into a rock - climbing school and gym .
Another is a concert hall .
Still another is a factory .
There are community halls and the finishing touches are underway on a library .

Eight of the 14 churches sold in the Quebec City region in recent times have gone into private hands , and two have been demolished .
" What should we expect for the next 20 years ?
Well , remember that the majority of people in the parishes nowadays are in their sixties to eighties , " said Louis - Philippe Desrosiers , who 's in charge of selling churches for Montreal 's parishes .
" People are not interested in the life of their souls anymore .
Less and less of them means less and less churches . "

The Supreme Court is entering the YouTube era .
The first citation in a petition filed with the court last month , for instance , was not to an affidavit or a legal precedent but rather to a YouTube video link .
The video shows what is either appalling police brutality or a measured response to an arrested man ’s intransigence — you be the judge .
Such evidence vérité has the potential to unsettle the way appellate judges do their work , according to a new study in The Harvard Law Review .
If Supreme Court justices can see for themselves what happened in a case , the study suggests , they may be less inclined to defer to the factual findings of jurors and to the conclusions of lower - court judges .
In 2007 , for instance , the Supreme Court considered the case of a Georgia man who was paralyzed when his car was rammed by the police in a high - speed chase .
The chase was recorded by a camera on the squad car ’s dashboard , and that video dominated the court ’s analysis .
The federal appeals court in Atlanta had ruled for the driver , Victor Harris , at a preliminary stage in the case , saying a jury should decide whether his driving warranted the aggressive measures taken by the police .
In effect , the bankers had siphoned off this bailout money in advance , years before the government had spent it .
I understand this chain of events sounds a bit like a conspiracy .
And in some cases , it surely was .
Some A.I.G. employees , to take one example , had to have understood what their credit derivative division in London was doing .
But more innocent optimism probably played a role , too .
The human mind has a tremendous ability to rationalize , and the possibility of making millions of dollars invites some hard - core rationalization .
Either way , the bottom line is the same : given an incentive to loot , Wall Street did so .
“ If you think of the financial system as a whole , ” Mr. Romer said , “ it actually has an incentive to trigger the rare occasions in which tens or hundreds of billions of dollars come flowing out of the Treasury . ”
Unfortunately , we can’t very well stop the flow of that money now .
The bankers have already walked away with their profits ( though many more of them deserve a subpoena to a Congressional hearing room ) .
Allowing A.I.G. to collapse , out of spite , could cause a financial shock bigger than the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
Modern economies can’t function without credit , which means the financial system needs to be bailed out .
But the future also requires the kind of overhaul that Mr. Bernanke has begun to sketch out .
Firms will have to be monitored much more seriously than they were during the Greenspan era .
They ca n’t be allowed to shop around for the regulatory agency that least understands what they ’re doing .
The biggest Wall Street paydays should be held in escrow until it ’s clear they were n’t based on fictional profits .
Above all , as Mr. Romer says , the federal government needs the power and the will to take over a firm as soon as its potential losses exceed its assets .
Anything short of that is an invitation to loot .
Mr. Bernanke actually took a step in this direction on Tuesday .
He said the government “ needs improved tools to allow the orderly resolution of a systemically important nonbank financial firm . ”
In layman ’s terms , he was asking for a clearer legal path to nationalization .
A spokesman said : " The warm , sunny weather is likely to bring out very big crowds - we are on full alert . '
They were hoping to prevent a repeat of the violence which followed the last general strike in France on January 29 .

In addition to offering three different rendering engines , the company blog announced that Lunascape5 has emerged as a winner in the SunSpider Javascript benchmark outperforming IE8 ( alpha ) , FF3.1 ( beta ) , Google Chrome and Opera 10 ( alpha ) .
We also have a short interview with the CEO of Lunascape Inc , Mr. Hidekazu Kondo .
A Redwood City man was sentenced to a year in jail Friday for stomping a kitten to death because his roommate 's 4 - year - old daughter had drawn all over the bathroom door .
Jesus Calderon - Franco , 33 , pleaded no contest in December to felony abuse for killing the 4 - month - old kitten , named Pucci .
BARACK OBAMA has assigned a top priority to financial reform when the new Congress assembles today .
If history is any guide , legislators can perform a signal service by moving beyond the myriad details of the rescue plans to provide a coherent account of the origins of the current crisis .
The moment calls for nothing less than a sweeping inquest into the twin housing and stock market crashes to create both the intellectual context and the political constituency for change .
For inspiration , Congress should turn to the electrifying hearings of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , held in the waning months of the Hoover presidency and the early days of the New Deal .
In historical shorthand , these hearings have taken their name from the committee counsel , Ferdinand Pecora , a former assistant district attorney from New York who , starting in January 1933 , was chief counsel for the investigation .
Under Pecora ’s expert and often withering questioning , the Senate committee unearthed a secret financial history of the 1920s , demystifying the assorted frauds , scams and abuses that culminated in the 1929 crash .
The riveting confrontation between Pecora and the Wall Street grandees was so theatrically apt it might have been concocted by Hollywood .
The combative Pecora was the perfect foil to the posh bankers who paraded before the microphones .
Born in Sicily , the son of an immigrant cobbler , Pecora had campaigned for Teddy Roosevelt and been imbued with the crusading fervor of the Progressive Era .
As a prosecutor in the 1920s , he had shut down more than 100 “ bucket shops ”  seamy , fly - by - night brokerage houses  and this had tutored him in the shady side of Wall Street .
With crinkly black hair and flashing eyes , Pecora was an earthy populist who appealed to Depression audiences .
He was fond of playing pinochle and was often portrayed with a thick cigar clamped between his teeth .
When he was hired for $ 255 per month by the Senate committee , Pecora was earning less money than most Wall Street mandarins disbursed weekly in pocket change .

The Propaganda has Expired for Israeli State Terrorism
Watching the video as the one above , produced by international witnesses , showing unarmed Palestinian farmers and foreign civilians being repeatedly fired upon , without provocation , in an open field , makes me livid .
This kind of terrorism cannot be justified .
This is not response .
This is not defense .
This is pure , unmitigated terrorism .
All of the old Israeli propaganda lines abundantly expired when their latest criminal assault began on Dec. 27 , 2008 , and you can now find them , at bargain basement prices , at the Hasbara Surplus Store otherwise known as Twitter .
There it is , documented , from this past Thursday , Feb. 5 , 2009 .
Now watch it get ignored by all the “ right thinking ” citizens , the “ impartial ” BBC , and the usual assortment of despicable mother fucking cunts .
Please tell me once again that condemning this outrage is “ anti- semitism ” ( because the anti-semitic denial of genocide is acceptable only if aimed at Palestinians ) .
Please continue , like cowards and criminals , to protest the clinical observation that Zionism is racism , that Zionists and Nazis have become indistinguishable .
Continue making your case for your “ right to exist , ” when this is how you manifest your existence .
Bigots , cowards , racists , and terrorists — you are welcome to post your comments here , so I can mount your material as an ethnographic freak show in tribute to state terrorism … except that on this issue , this video , I expect you to suddenly go silent .
Thanks to the invaluable work of courageous volunteers for the International Solidarity Movement for bringing this to the attention of those are willing to even just look at reality .
From Israeli forces open fire on Palestinian farmers and internationals in Al Faraheen , Friday , February 6 , 2009 :
The soldiers continued to shoot on the group , despite the fact that many members of the group had their arms in the air and were wearing fluorescent vests to make them highly visible , and identify them as Human Rights Workers ; had erected a banner indicating that the farmers and accompaniment were civilians ; contact had been made with the Israeli army to advise them that Palestinian civilians and internationals would be working in the area ; the various international embassies had been advised of the planned accompaniment ; and the internationals were announcing their presence via a megaphone – demanding that the soldiers stop shooting on unarmed civilians .
“ We are unarmed civilians !
We are farmers and international Human Rights Workers ! Stop Shooting ! ”
Thanks also to karmalised for drawing my attention to this atrocity .

France paralysed by a wave of strike action , the boulevards of Paris resembling a debris - strewn battlefield .
The Hungarian currency sinks to its lowest level ever against the euro , as the unemployment Figure rises .
Greek farmers block the road into Bulgaria in protest at low prices for their produce .
New Figures from the biggest bank in the Baltic show that the three post - Soviet states there face the biggest recessions in Europe .
It ’s a snapshot of a single day – yesterday – in a Europe sinking into the bleakest of times .
But while the outlook may be dark in the big wealthy democracies of western Europe , it is in the young , poor , vulnerable states of central and eastern Europe that the trauma of crash , slump and meltdown looks graver .
Exactly 20 years ago , in serial revolutionary rejoicing , they ditched communism to put their faith in a capitalism now in crisis and by which they feel betrayed .
The result has been the biggest protests across the former communist bloc since the days of people power .
Europe ’s time of troubles is gathering depth and scale .
Governments are trembling .
Revolt is in the air .

Alexandros Grigoropoulos , a 15 - year - old middle - class boy going to a party in a rough neighbourhood on a December Saturday , was the first fatality of Europe ’s season of strife .
Shot dead by a policeman , the boy ’s killing lit a bonfire of unrest in the city unmatched since the 1970s .
There are many wellsprings of the serial protests rolling across Europe .
In Athens , it was students and young people who suddenly mobilised to turn parts of the city into no - go areas .
They were sick of the lack of jobs and prospects , the failings of the education system and seized with pessimism over their future .
This week it was the farmers ’ turn , rolling their tractors out to block the motorways , main road and border crossings across the Balkans to try to obtain better procurement prices for their produce .

New shots of the game in action were released today , showing off an optional anti-aliasing graphical style , one that makes SNK Playmore fighting royalty a little less pixelated .
These shots represent our first look at that mode , according to Joystiq .
Never was a fan myself .
Specifically , of anti-aliasing on 2D visuals .

In other The King of Fighters XII developments , producer Masaako Kukino reveals in the newest issue of Game Informer that when the 2D fighter comes home , it will do so with a roster beyond the 20 confirmed for the arcade release .
Any requests ?
Mull it over while enjoying four new screens .
I ’ve written a book – Getting Started with Dwarf Fortress , available at O’Reilly and Amazon !
It covers the current version and takes you from knowing nothing to being a confident Dwarf Fortress player !
Note :
This version is not the current build .
You can still learn how to play DF with this tutorial and you will learn enough to play the new build .
If you follow a link to the DF Wiki then try and read the pages for version v0.23.130.23a ( see links at the top of each wiki page ) .
Newer versions may have significantly different information .
Dwarf Fortress is an extremely interesting and complex game , but one which people find exceptionally difficult to get into .
Although it is n’t hard to find tutorials , many assume some basic knowledge of the interface and what the player is looking at .
They also do n’t take into account different tilesets and versions and the difficulty new users have in finding a good site for that first fortress .
But all that is in the past as AfterActionReporter.com is pleased to present The Complete and Utter Newby Tutorial for Dwarf Fortress !
It comes with a pre-made world and save and full game download for you to play along with .
And a ton of screenshots .
Yes , many , many screenshots .
So grab a drink , get your thinking cap on and be prepared for some dwarfy fun !
And carp .
Never forget the carp …
Set Up
First things first .
You need to grab a copy of the client .
Lucky for you we ’ve made that easy and the copy you ’ll need for this tutorial is available from Sling File ( temp not working ) or mirrored at FileDropper and Mediafire .
Even if you ’ve already got DF installed you should grab this version as it has the world and save file we ’ll be working from for this tutorial .
In case you ’re wondering , this version includes a copy of MayDay ’s Green tileset and it ’s worth grabbing new versions of the tileset as the game is updated .
I use that tileset as it ’s a little easier to view than the pure ASCII of the original game .
Next you need to unzip the folder on to your had drive .
Then create a shortcut on your desktop ( if you wish ) leading to dwarfort .exe .
While you ’re at it , go into the DwarfManager folder and create a shortcut to DwarfManager .exe , we ’ll need that later .
Run the Game
Now we ’re ready to get going !
Run the dwarfort .
exe shortcut and you should get the screen below .
Bear in mind , this game version is optimised to run in 1280 x 800 resolution , if your game does n’t look like the screenshot , you might have to fiddle with the .ini file found in \data\init\init.
txt .
You can read the DFWiki entry on grid size for a bit of help .
So , you ’ve got the game running and enjoyed the exciting ASCII intro movie .
Well done !
I can tell you ’ll go far !
Next step is to hit “ enter ” on “ Continue Playing ” , which should be highlighted .
You ’ll then be presented with this screen .
This is the save game list , which gets cluttered very quickly as seasonal saves build up .
But for now all you have to do is use the down - arrow key ( not the number pad arrow key ) to select the region1 - spr - 201 save .
Hit enter and the game will load .
First Look
Once the game loads you will be presented with this screen .
Although it ’s confusing on first glance , do n’t panic !
It will all be made clear shortly .
First thing though , hit “ space ” to pause the game .
Space pauses DF and also backs out of any menu you ’re currently in .
Lets talk about what you can see .
First up , the screen is divided into three sections :
The left shows the local view .
The center shows the action menu , the right shows the area map .
To make things a lot neater hit “ tab ” .
“ Tab ” cycles through various menu arrangements .
Stop when your view matches the one below .
Now we ’re really cooking with gas !
Soon you ’ll be melting foes with magma- falls , and drowning goblins in artfully engineered traps !
But before then , lets look around .
Use the arrow keys to navigate around the local area .
You ’ll notice the we ’ve got a decent amount of space to work with .
While you examine your surroundings you should be able to spot trees and the grassy areas easy enough , same with ponds and rivers and bushes .
Other tiles wo n’t make much sense , these tend to be the slightly - arcane zones like open air spaces ( pale blue tiles , or tiles with dots ) and the earth ( brown tiles ) and slope tiles ( up and down triangles ) .
The screenshot below should help point those features out .
Key to understanding DF ’s local view is getting your head around the fact that DF is a 3D game displayed on a 2D map .
To display a variety of heights the world is sliced into dozens of Z - levels .
Each Z - level is numbered .
If you look on the bottom right of the window you ’ll see we ’re currently at level 144 .
To move between levels you need to hit “ Shift + < ” to go up , and “ Shift + > ” to go down .
If you go up a level the map will look like image below .
Try it yourself now .
If you ca n’t get this to work , scroll down and read the comments .
There ’s a helpful poster there who has some tips for odd keyboard layouts .
You ’ll see that what was black dirt is now grass and trees .
It ’s like we ’ve gone up a floor in a lift and we ’re no longer looking at a slope , now we ’re looking across a grassy plain .
Below us is open space and tree tops .
Make sense ?
Now , try going back down to 144 and then down to 143 , a level below “ ground ” level .
Your view should look something like this .
We ’re basically underground now with mostly dirt around and earth between the river and the rest of the ground .
With luck you ’ll note a fish and who knows what else swimming around down there .
You may have noticed the river does n’t appear to have changed much , but do n’t be confused .
The difference is that on this lower level we ’re on the same level as the body of the river itself , at the level above , we ’re actually above the river a little looking at the top of it .
Continue having a look around .
If you follow the river to the west you ’ll note it drops down a few levels into a chasm before flowing off the map , what a pretty waterfall !
See if you can find it yourself .
When you ’re done looking around , return to Z - level 144 and find the dwarf caravan with our fresh immigrants .
The helpful graphic below explains what you ’re looking at .
Lets get digging !
So now what do we do ?
In Dwarf Fortress we ’re usually trying to get a bustling community of dozens of dwarfs up and running , while fending off goblins , the whims of nobles and assorted other evils .
To do this we need to build ourselves a mighty fortress !
Preferably underground .
So lets find a cliff face to dig into and get this show on the road !
If you go down and a little across from where our dwarfs are ( using the arrow keys ) you ’ll see a nice cliff face .
Lets dig an entrance into this spot and plan to eventually dig down way underground where it ’s safe and cosy .
First up , get the map centered around about where we want to dig ( shown on the screenshot below ) .
Once you ’re ready :
Hit the “ d ” key .
You ’ll see the menu on the right changes and in the local view a yellow X has appeared .
The menu on the right should show the “ mine ” option highlighted .
If it does n’t , hit “ d ” “ again , to select it .
Move the cursor to the edge of the cliff , like this :
Now hit enter and move your cursor down with the arrow keys .
You ’ll see that you ’ve dropped a flashing “ anchor ” .
This is going to mark out what your dwarfs will dig .
Move it down 20 and across 3 and hit enter , your screen should look like this :
The browned out area shows where your miners are going to come along and dig .
But they wo n’t act until you back out of the “ designations ” menu as the game is paused .
Hit “ space ” and you should see the game unpause and the menu reset to its master list .
Oh , when you have the “ d ” menu up you can actually click on the map with your mouse and select areas to mine .
Some people prefer to select areas this way .
With the game unpaused you should notice three dwarfs race to the cliff face and start digging .
With our entrance under way we should also think about laying out some rooms for our dwarfs to live in , who wants to spend time out under that hot yellow disk when lovely rock and earth beckon !
Right now we ’re not worried about making our fortress perfect and creating the strongest entrance , we ’re simply trying to scratch out a space to live !
To that end we ’ll need three or four rooms off this main entrance .
See if you can match the layout below by marking out areas to dig , as you ’ve learnt .
If you make a mistake you can hit “ x ” from the “ designations ” ( “ d ” ) menu and you ’ll note that the menu on the right has “ remove designation ” highlighted .
Now when you hit enter and select an area , any area set for digging will be cleared of that designation .
Anyway , enough detail , on with the room building !
Look at my little dwarfs go !
Are n’t they industrious !
They ’re quickly digging away and leaving a lot of dirt floor behind them .
Good lads !
Lets leave them to their work while we sort out some other important jobs .
Chopping trees , setting up piles
Dirt and rocks are handy , but so is wood to make nice dwarven beds , and we ’re short on it right now .
To get wood , we need to chop down some trees .
And we do that by designating an area of trees to be chopped .
Lets get cracking and clear the trees in front of the entrance .
Designating trees to chop is like designating rocks to be dug , so lets decimate the local environment !
Move the map around so you ’re looking out front of your fortress .
Hit “ d ” .
Hopefully this time you ’ll notice the game has automatically got “ Chop down trees ” selected , if it does n’t , hit “ t ” and it will be highlighted .
Move the cursor to the upper left , hit enter , and move the cursor to the bottom right , hit enter again .
Any trees in that area will now be set to be cut , as indicated by them all being marked brown .
Your view now should look something like this , note all the trees highlighted in brown :
Although you ’ve done well neither man nor dwarf can live on wood and dirt alone !
Luckily for us there are plenty of bushes out there loaded with ripe berries .
Lets set some of them to be picked :
Hit “ d ” again and then “ p ” .
One the right “ Gather plants ” is now selected .
Designate about the same area as we did with the wood cutting .
All the bushes will be highlighted now , and when you unpause you should see a plant harvesting dwarf join the woodcutter .
Now lets sit back and watch the dwarfs work for a minute !
It wo n’t take long before our miners have cleared out our temporary living quarters and our woodcutter and plant gatherer have begun their work .
Once the interior space is clear we have lots of work to do , so lets break it down into useful chunks .
Our First Farm
Farming is how you will make most of your food in Dwarf Fortress , and it ’s important to get farming quite quickly .
If food runs out your dwarfs will starve and your game will end prematurely , and we do n’t want that , right ?
Dwarfs usually farm underground and handily , we have a space all prepared .
So follow along , and lets get some tasty mushrooms growing for our stumpys to chow down on !
Find the bottom right room .
Hit “ b ” for the build menu and then “ p ” for farm plot .
Move the cursor to your farm area .
The screen instructions tell you how you can increase the size , we need a good 6 by 6 plot , so hit “ u ” and “ k ” a few times until you ’ve got a big green grid , like the one below .
Move the grid around with the arrow keys until it ’s in about the same position as the one in the screenshot .
If you get the size wrong , “ h ” and “ m ” will reduce the plot .
Hit “ enter ” and the green area marker will change to a flashing brown field marker .
When stuff flashes it indicates that dwarfs are on their way to come build the construction , in this case , a field .
And lookee - here !
A farmer has come to build our field for us !
He will take a short while to build your field .
When you see the dwarf run off , you know he ’s done .
Now it ’s time to set the field to grow delicious plump helms all year round .
Hit the “ q ” key .
This is the key for “ Set building tasks and preferences ” .
Again you ’ll notice a cursor on the local screen and if it ’s anywhere near the field , the field will be flashing .
You can move that cursor around with your arrow keys , this is useful later on when you need to select different workshops and buildings .
You ’ll note that on the right the menu now shows you specific task details associated with that field , like so :
What we want to do is set “ plump helmets ” as the food to be planted every season .
You can see on the top right of the menu we have the various plants we could try and grow and in the middle area we have the different seasons .
Right now “ Dimple cups ” are selected ( but not highlighted , note ) and the season is set on “ Spring ” , as it ’s Spring currently .
We need to change these settings .
Now comes an important skill !
Menu scrolling !
Using “ alt+arrow down ” , scroll down through the list to “ Plump helmets ” and hit enter .
You should now see “ Plump helmets ” highlighted .
By the way , if you do n’t like this key configuration , hit escape when we ’re done and re-bind the keys to your liking .
Good work !
But right now we ’ve only set the spring planting .
It ’s time to set the planting for Summer , Winter and Autumn too .
To do this , with the field task menu up , hit “ b ” for Summer and then scroll to “ Plump helmets ” and hit enter again .
Hit “ c ” for Autumn , set “ Plump helmets ” and then “ d ” for Winter , repeating your selection .
You may have noticed that what you can plant changes with the seasons , but do n’t worry about that for now .
Hit “ space ” to back out of the menu and resume the game .
Your two farmer dwarfs will quickly begin planting in your new field , well done !
Now we ’ve got a field down hopefully none of your dwarfs will starve , go crazy and resort to eating rats , or each other .
Pretty soon you ’ll have a few seeds in the ground and your farm will begin to look a bit like this :
Oh , by now you may have noticed the game pausing itself now and then .
This is generally because the game wants to let you know that something important has happened .
You can hit space to let the game resume , or hit “ a ” to see the alert and find out what caused the game to pause ( if you miss the alert at the bottom of the screen ) .
Hitting “ space ” will take you back out of the alerts menu and resume the game .
Stockpiles
While you can just leave all of your dwarfs ’ stuff strewn around the countryside , it ’s much more efficient to have it all inside near where it ’s needed .
You may have noticed your farmer dwarfs running in and out of the fortress to grab the seeds that they need ( when they flash between their icon and a little red dot ( the seed icon ) you know they are carrying seeds ) .
This is where stockpiles come in .
They make everything more organised .
A stockpile for all our food and seeds right next door to the farm would probably be pretty handy , right ?
We do n’t want the dwarfs running across the map to get a bite to eat or a seed to plant , so lets make a food stockpile inside !
Find the room opposite the farm .
Hit the “ p ” key ( for “ piles ” of course ) , a cursor will appear .
Hit “ f ” to select “ food ” , we want to make a food stockpile , after all .
Move the cursor to the bottom left of the room , hit enter , move it to the top right and hit enter again .
You have now set that entire space as a food stockpile , well done !
After a few seconds your spare dwarfs will start moving food inside , you ’ll see barrels and bags being hauled and pretty soon the stockpile will look something like this :
You do n’t have much room inside the fortress yet , so no more piles for now .
In time you ’re going to want to put stockpiles everywhere to help manage your production and resource gathering .
For now , well done , you ’ve got food production up and running , you ’ve set up a stockpile , you ’ve set wood to be chopped and plants to be gathered and you know how to do some basic digging !
You ’ve come far !
Before reading the next instalment , how about setting some more pants to be gathered and more wood to be chopped .
Then , head on to Part 2 and we ’ll learn all about workshops , bedrooms , dinning rooms and stairs !
It will be ever so exciting , I promise !

Apollo 13 is spinning out of control .
< @khmer > < Radio >
All right , we 've evacuated the command module and we 're sealed in the LEM , but the oxygen filter is broken !
we need another !
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
All right , Captain , we 'll put together a team .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
Team , here are the supplies they 've got .
We need to build an air filter for the LEM socket , right now .
< @khmer > < moshez >
They should n't have gone into the LEM .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
We 're kind of past that , moshez .
They 've evacuated all the oxygen from the command module .
< @khmer > < moshez >
Well it 's just the right answer , they should n't have gone into the LEM .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
All right , anyone else ?
We have to make sure it does n't take sharp movements , because a good kick could tear right through the aluminum wall .
< @khmer > < moshez >
Well , you should n't have used aluminum .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
All right , you know what , dickhole ?
That 's not problem solving .
They 're in the LEM , the walls are aluminum , and they 're in fucking space , so we need to solve this problem !
< @khmer > < moshez >
Well , they should n't have gone into space .
I never need to .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
What ?
This is n't about you .
This is their situation and their problem and we need to build this air filter !
< @khmer > < moshez >
Well do n't get mad at me for having the right answers .
< @khmer > < moshez >
I just drive to my house and I never have air filtration problems .
< @khmer > < Mission Commander >
So , the astronauts have holed up in the LEM and they want us to build an air filter , and your solution is for them not to go into the LEM , not to build it with aluminum , not to go into space , and to drive to your house ?

In the beginning ( 1995 ) , Java was created by Sun Microsystems .
Then Sun saw that Java was bigger than just Sun ( NASDAQ : JAVA ) and opened up the process of building Java with the Java Community Process ( JCP ) in 1998 .
Yet now with rumors of IBM acquiring Sun swirling , the Java community could undergo its most significant change in a decade .
There have been questions about Sun 's leadership of the JCP for years dating back to at least 2002 and percolating still with the soon to be finalized JavaEE 6 specification as well .
With IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) owning Sun , leadership of the JCP could shift and that would be a change welcomed by members of the executive committee of the JCP as well as Java stakeholders outside of the JCP .
" Sun 's inability to invest in the JCP combined with its desire to maintain control is stifling the innovation and investment in Java , " Rich Sharples , director of product management at JBoss , told InternetNews.com .
Red Hat is a member of the JCP Executive Committee which oversees the JCP .
Sharples notes that what drives many of Red Hat 's contributions is the desire to make Java simpler to use for more people while retaining the power of the platform .
JBoss contributions to the JCP include EJB 3 ( nterprise java beans ) , Web Beans , Seam Framework and Hibernate .
" All JSR 's require a reference implementation which is a huge burden for the spec , " Sharples argued .
" Other standards bodies do n't require reference implementations .
( JSR stands for Java Specification Request ) .
The openness of the JCP is something that JCP executive committee Rod Johnson , CEO of SpringSource also has concerns about .
" The JCP is still less open than we would like , " Johnson told InternetNews.com .
" However , there have definitely been improvements in the last few years . "
SpringSource develops a lightweight framework for Java that runs on Java middleware from a number of vendors including Red Hat JBoss , Oracle and IBM .
Does Sun have too much influence in the JCP ?
Red Hat 's Sharples noted that early in Java 's evolution - it needed control and direction and investment and Sun did a great job .
" In the last 5 or so years as Java has become mainstream and really successful and Sun 's control is now limiting its growth , " Sharples alleged .
SpringSource 's Johnson went a step further arguing that in his view Sun does have too much influence in the JCP .
" Broadly speaking , if Sun wants something , it happens ; if they do n't want it , it does n't happen , " Johnson said .
At least one vendor in the Java system does n't participate in the JPC at all due to concerns about its organization .
" MuleSource does not have active participation with the JCP , " Ross Mason CTO and founder of MuleSource , told InternetNews.com .
" While we believe the JCP was set up with good intentions , it has turned into a community that is out of touch with Java and driven by stakeholders with conflicting agendas . "
Mason argued that the JCP no longer works on real standards , but rather what he referred to as pseudo - standards .
That is standards where the reach is too broad or ones that do not or cannot fully understand the problem domain .
" A standard should be a set of well defined rules that address a well - defined problem , the solution should be discrete , simple and easily understood , " Mason stated .
" However , there seems to be a propensity to create new standards around pieces of the software stack that will never be standard until we 've been through enough cycles to truly understand how the problem is best solved . "
Mason added that he did n't think that Sun has managed the JCP well .
In his view it 's a process that now creates standards that ignores what the Java community really wants or needs .

Basil pesto is a treat and the best way to enjoy basil .
And I ’m talking about homemade pesto sauce , not the shop bought one form the jar .
The fusion of flavours in it is a marriage made in heaven .
Basil is an annual herb that likes warmth .
It ’s easy to grow your own in the garden during the summer or in pots indoors all year round .
Pick tender leaves regularly to prevent it from flowering and stems getting woody .
Leave one plant to mature and collect the seeds for the next season .
Alternatively , buy fresh basil in shops .
Pesto can be made using mortar and pestle , chopped with a herb cutting knife ( takes a while ) or in a food processor .
To make fresh basil pesto sauce you ’ll need following ingredients :
A large bunch of basil ( about 3 - 4 cups of leaves )
3 cloves of garlic ( add more or less depending on taste )
1/3 to 1/2 cup roasted pine nuts ( cashews , macadamia nuts or roasted almonds )
1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino
1/2 cup good quality olive oil
Sea salt
Use the quantities as a guide only and do n’t be afraid to experiment .
To be honest , I do n’t follow the recipe anymore .
I just pick some basil leaves from the garden , add few cloves of garlic , salt , nuts , Parmesan or Pecorino cheese and some good olive oil .
Traditionally , pine nuts are used in basil pesto recipe , but I often substitute macadamia or cashew nuts for pine nuts .
Here is a step by step guide on how to make your own basil pesto sauce :
1 . Pick the leaves and wash them in a bowl of water .
Dry immediately in a colander and then on a clean tea towel .
The leaves will turn black if left in the water for too long .
2 . Put basil leaves , nuts of your choice and salt into food processor .
Blend it until finely chopped .
3 . Add grated Parmesan and crushed garlic .
Whiz it until combined .
4 . Add olive oil and process again .
For a smooth pesto , run the food processor for a bit longer .
5. Voilá !
Basil pesto can be kept in the fridge for up to a week .
At my place it disappears mysteriously after a couple of days 🙂 !
Pesto is suitable for freezing .
Some ideas for basil pesto use :
spread it on a fresh crusty bread great tossed with pasta wonderful with tomatoes top bruschetta with pesto great alternative to butter or margarine in sandwiches substitute basil pesto for tomato sauce on homemade pizza :

2010 Basil Pesto Update
This year most of our basil is coming from our container garden at home and from only two plants :
As you can see one is green and the other – purple !
Nevertheless , purple pesto has the same great taste .
I really love this purple variety .
Its gorgeous , strong colour is great contrast to green leaves and makes an unusual garnish .
So far , I ’ve made about 4 batches of pesto from these two basil plants and they still keep on growing thanks to a sunny spot and homemade compost .
I have not attempted to make purple basil pesto yet .
I ’ll give it a shot next time I make pesto to see the colour .
The pesto from green and purple leaves is still green ( a bit darker green ) .
You can see small purple freckles :
Basil is one of the herbs that does n’t like cold , so make the most of it while you have it in the garden .
For the winter days , if you have oversupply of basil , freeze some .
I usually put them into smaller containers or in an ice cube tray .
The best way to enjoy freshly made basil pesto is to put it on some crusty homemade bread .
Our daughter gives this batch of homemade pesto thumbs up !
I do hope this guide has been useful , please leave a comment below if you have any thoughts or tips on how to make basil pesto sauce .
Does atheism need be considered sacred , for defacing of an atheist ad to be considered desecration ?
I noticed this on my way home on the subway last night , and am actually surprised it 's the first I 've seen ( considering the Athiest Bus ad campaign has been around since the middle of February ) .
Clearly atheism ads on pubic transit are a contentious issue .
This one had a black marker taken to it :
There 's probably no god .
The posted paper reads :
" The most important thing in life is to do everything you do with the most love for others .
It is not how much you do , but rather how much love you put into it that really counts . "
Has anybody seen any other incidents of sign modification ?
I think it 's kind of cute .
I did n't have my camera with me , so I took the pic using my Macbook .
If you see any other vandalism , snap a pic and add it to the Flickr pool .
Today , I went to get the Apple store , my Mac had been making a grinding noise from the fan .
The guy put his ear to the keyboard and said there was a CD in the drive so I could n't hear the grinding from the fan .
He ejected the CD .
It was porn .

Like any person who once was a pre-teen girl , I got through the awkwardness of puberty by fixating on a celebrity crush .
While my peers kissed posters of Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Jonathan Brandeis , trying to visualize the real thing , I loved David Duchovny .
All my older - man fantasies began with Agent Fox Mulder , FBI .
His pictures ( torn from Sci - Fi magazines as opposed to Tiger Beat ) lined my bedroom walls .
I knew where he went to school , his birthdate , his sign , his favorite food .
I cried when he got married , cried harder when he had kids that were n’t from my womb .
As I advanced into my 20s , I was no longer preoccupied with the personal life of an actor 22 years older than me , but the fixation was still there .
And thirteen years after my crush blossomed , I actually met him .
And it sucked .
There are a few benefits to being a gossip columnist and one of them is going to glitzy Hollywood parties where there ’s free food , alcohol and celebrities .
Usually I just stick to ogling the food and booze , since famous people are boring close up .
None of them are fighting Nazis or making sensual love or spouting one - liners , so who cares .
Except at this particular party , David Duchovny was there .
It took me two hours of staring at his morose countenance to work up the courage to go up to him .
He was getting out of his chair , heading towards the door , when I timidly stopped him and told him my name and what a huge fan I was .
He said thank you and shook my hand .
Houston , we ’ve made contact !
And then it was over .
That ’s it ?
That ’s what I waited 13 years for ??
To mumble out hello and not grab him by the collar and lick his face ?
To smile politely and not slip him my email address , Duchovnite@aol.com , for some late night cyber sex ?
It was the most disappointing climax of my life , including the time I thought I had an orgasm but it was really just me hyperventilating .
Sure , David Duchovny knows I exist now – but he does n’t know I have a French maid outfit with his name on it .
If my 13 year - old self was around today , she ’d kick me in the shins and write bad poetry about it .
You know who else you should never meet in real life ?
The people who make the music you like .
The conversation is never as good as you imagine it will be .
When I met Alanis Morissette at an autograph signing , I was head over feet ( worst pun ever ) to meet my music idol .
I thanked her for coming out – I meant on the music scene , not the closet .
Now Alanis thinks I think she ’s gay , and I ca n’t ever listen to Jagged Little Pill without remembering what a retard I am .
If I ’m ever famous enough to have fans , I ’m becoming a hermit .
That way I ’ll never disappoint anyone .
Over the weekend The Times and other newspapers reported leaked details about the Obama administration ’s bank rescue plan , which is to be officially released this week .
If the reports are correct , Tim Geithner , the Treasury secretary , has persuaded President Obama to recycle Bush administration policy  specifically , the “ cash for trash ” plan proposed , then abandoned , six months ago by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
This is more than disappointing .
In fact , it fills me with a sense of despair .
After all , we ’ve just been through the firestorm over the A.I.G. bonuses , during which administration officials claimed that they knew nothing , could n’t do anything , and anyway it was someone else ’s fault .
Meanwhile , the administration has failed to quell the public ’s doubts about what banks are doing with taxpayer money .
And now Mr. Obama has apparently settled on a financial plan that , in essence , assumes that banks are fundamentally sound and that bankers know what they ’re doing .
It ’s as if the president were determined to confirm the growing perception that he and his economic team are out of touch , that their economic vision is clouded by excessively close ties to Wall Street .
And by the time Mr. Obama realizes that he needs to change course , his political capital may be gone .
Too bad they did n't have a full - sized jail .
The rise of Avigdor Lieberman as the kingmaker of Israeli politics is a disaster for American supporters of Israel and for U.S. interests in the region , albeit not entirely a surprise , at least to regular visitors to this space .
The circumstance of his entry into the government as minister of foreign affairs or some other key policymaking post will mark the end of the old Labor Zionism and its passage into history as yet another failed experiment in utopian socialism , along with Fourierism , Owenism , and the Icarians .
With Lieberman and his party the catalyst as the up - and - coming force in Israeli politics , the Zionist project enters a new post - democratic era .
One recent indication of this were the virtually unanimous calls for outlawing the Arab parties .
Not only Lieberman but also Livni and the " Left " chimed in , with Yisrael Beiteinu , the Lieberman outfit , setting the tone .
Gideon Levy , writing in Ha’aretz , reminds us where we have seen this kind of thing before :
" If [ Rabbi Meir ]
Kahane were alive and running for the 18th Knesset , not only would his list not be banned , it would win many votes , as Yisrael Beiteinu is expected to do .
The prohibited has become permitted , the ostracized is now accepted , the detestable has become the talented  that ’s the slippery slope down which Israeli society has skidded over the past two decades . "
Kahane was the George Lincoln Rockwell of Israeli politics : he advocated expulsion of all Arabs and the immediate launching of an armed struggle to achieve a " Greater Israel . "
Twenty years ago , his party was disqualified from running for office and banned under the strictures of the election code , which forbids parties that advocate racism and incitement to violence .
Today , avers Levy , " his doctrine has won . "
The formerly forbidden " has become legitimate in public discourse . "
The signal result of this pivotal election has been " the transformation of racism and nationalism into accepted values . "
Not only accepted , but dominant : as Daniel Levy acerbically titles his analysis of the Israeli elections , the country has become " The Israel of the Three Likudniks " :
" So here we are in the Israel of the three Likudniks .
Allow me to explain : Israel ’s three largest parties ( together accounting for about 75 of the 110 mandates decided by the Jewish vote ) are now all led by Likudniks and by a Likud - derived outlook  albeit of slightly different emphases .
Kadima was of course birthed by the Likud , its founding father is none other than Ariel Sharon ; its current leader Tzipi Livni was a former stalwart Likudnik ; and its number two joined the Likud following a career in the military ( Shaul Mofaz ) .
Let ’s call this Likud - lite .
Then one has the brand name version of Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud party .
Let ’s call this traditional Likud .
Finally , there is Yisrael Beiteinu ( or Israel Our Homeland ) led by longtime Likud party functionary and the party ’s former director - general , Avigdor Lieberman .
His number two , Uzi Landau , was a 22 - year Likud Knesset member and led the so - called Likud rebel faction during Sharon ’s Gaza disengagement .
Lieberman rebranded the Likud for a Russian audience and gave it a nasty and overtly racist edge .
Let ’s call this Likud gone wild . "
Israeli politics has largely become a matter of which brand of nationalistic intransigents will hold the reins of power .
In a race to the right , the ultras have the advantage and the momentum .
As I warned in this space , the future belongs to Lieberman ’s vision of a secularized and Russified Zionism  authoritarian , expansionist , and increasingly hostile to U.S. interests and the constraints of the " special relationship . "
There is n’t much controversy about what Lieberman represents , even in the ranks of Israel ’s most fervid supporters .
Marty Peretz , writing in The New Republic , declares Yisrael Beiteinu to be " neo- fascist , " a party led by a " certified gangster " who is " the Israeli equivalent of Jorg Haider of Austria ( now dead ) and Jean - Marie Le Pen , who , with Bridgitte Bardot , is a leader of National Front in France . "
While there are some superficial similarities , Lieberman fails to fit into the Euro - rightist mold in two important ways  aside from his complete dissimilarity to Bardot , who would undoubtedly object to his pork obsession .
To begin with , Lieberman is no defender of traditional cultural norms and religious values , championed by both Le Pen and Haider .
The former bouncer has earned the opprobrium of the religious parties , which denounced him as an agent of Satan for taking on the prohibitions against pork  a favored food of his Russian immigrant constituency  and for trying to break the Orthodox monopoly on marriage by allowing secular ceremonies .
More importantly , the Le Pen and Haider movements are anti-immigrant .
That is their major platform plank , whereas Lieberman is himself a Russian immigrant and the leader of a party of recent arrivals .
Le Pen , for all his shenanigans , is a Poujadist , not a Vichyite , and Haider ’s party was and is very similar : a movement of middle - class burghers who object to the expense of subsidizing recent immigrants with all the accoutrements of the Austrian welfare state .
Lieberman and his party are quite a different breed .
Like the German National Socialists , they are avowed enemies of religion and tradition , revolutionaries impatient to sweep away the failed remnants of the old order and root out an internal " fifth column " they claim represents a threat to the nation .
As I put it some months ago , what we have in Lieberman is the final proof that we are , indeed , living in Bizarro World , and reality has been turned on its head .
Because what we are seeing in Israel today is the rise to power of a Jewish Hitler .
American policymakers , consumed as they are by the possibility that some homicidal maniac will acquire access to nuclear weapons  Saddam Hussein , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Osama bin Laden  should ask themselves what will happen if Lieberman gets his hands on them .
After all , here is a man who called for bombing Tehran  and the Aswan dam !  about to become foreign minister of Israel .
Is anybody paying attention ?
In the nuclear age , " Likud gone wild , " as Daniel Levy put it , is a truly frightening prospect .
In yet another example of how the principle of " blowback " works , the country we spend billions subsidizing and protecting , backing its leaders and policies to the hilt , is on the verge of becoming a nuclear rogue nation .
In which case , I will not join those who call for a preemptive U.S. invasion to eliminate an imminent threat  but do n’t think I wo n’t be tempted .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Check out my piece on " Obama as Lincoln : Mask and Mirror , " in the current Chronicles magazine , published by the Rockford Institute , available in a print edition and online .
In the six - and - one - half years since the federal government began certifying food as “ organic , ” Americans have taken to the idea with considerable enthusiasm .
Sales have at least doubled , and three - quarters of the nation ’s grocery stores now carry at least some organic food .
A Harris poll in October 2007 found that about 30 percent of Americans buy organic food at least on occasion , and most think it is safer , better for the environment and healthier .
“ People believe it must be better for you if it ’s organic , ” says Phil Howard , an assistant professor of community , food and agriculture at Michigan State University .
So I discovered on a recent book tour around the United States and Canada .
No matter how carefully I avoided using the word “ organic ” when I spoke to groups of food enthusiasts about how to eat better , someone in the audience would inevitably ask , “ What if I ca n’t afford to buy organic food ? ”
It seems to have become the magic cure - all , synonymous with eating well , healthfully , sanely , even ethically .
But eating “ organic ” offers no guarantee of any of that .
And the truth is that most Americans eat so badly  we get 7 percent of our calories from soft drinks , more than we do from vegetables ; the top food group by caloric intake is “ sweets ” ; and one - third of nation ’s adults are now obese  that the organic question is a secondary one .
It ’s not unimportant , but it ’s not the primary issue in the way Americans eat .
The internet ’s been clogged with rumors about a possible film adaptation of the wonderful sitcom Arrested Development .
Last week , I had a chance to talk with one of the show ’s stars , Jeffrey Tambor , and I took the opportunity to ask him to clarify exactly what he knows about the film as part of our extensive in - person interview with Tambor , which you can hear here .
This is what he told me , in no uncertain terms : “ Well , here ’s the real truth of it : we are going to do it .
It ’s very , very probable .
The script is not finished yet , and when the script is finished , we will go into production .
I ’m positive . “
As Tambor explains in the full version of the interview ( which will be up here and in the podcast feed in a couple of weeks ) , he and Mitch Hurwitz have been close since before Arrested was even a television show , so Tambor knows what of he speaks .
Here ’s the audio of this small portion of my 40 - minute conversation with the actor behind George Bluth Sr. ( and of course Oscar Bluth ) .
And speaking of Oscar , he shares a little tidbit at the end about how Hurwitz created the long - haired Bluth .
The transcript of the Arrested Development film portion of the interview follows .
Do n’t miss our full interview , which is now on the web and covers Tambor ’s career from Kojak to Hellboy and beyond .
Jesse Thorn :
What do you understand is the current state , according to the current knowledge of Mr. Jeffrey Tambor , celebrity actor and cast member of Arrested Development , of the proposed Arrested Development film ?
Jeffrey Tambor :
Well first of all , that wonderful actor who does Spongebob , what ’s his name ?
Tom Kenney ?
Tom .
Tom said to me , “ Jeffrey , before we go on … ” and it was a colloquy about Word Girl , “ is there gonna be an Arrested Development movie ? ”
And I said “ yes ! ” and there was a big huzzah .
Well you could n’t find a house full of more committed comedy nerds than at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater .
But previous to that , there was a reporter who had asked me about the Michael Cera thing , I think that ’s what you ’re referring to .
And I said , “ I will go to Michael Cera ’s house and I will pull him out by his hair … ” and like that .
Well what I did n’t know was that there was this kerfuffle that was going on about Michael Cera .
Well , here ’s the real truth of it : we are going to do it .
It ’s very , very probable .
The script is not finished yet , and when the script is finished , we will go into production .
I ’m positive .
Have you signed any papers or anything ?
No , what I have done is I talked to Mitch .
He called and said , “ Hey pal , you on board ? ” and I said , “ absolutely . ” Jason [ Bateman ] and I just had lunch the other day , and we ’re all excited about it so everyone , to a man , is on board .
Including Michael Cera , who was said to be circumspect about it ?
( And Michael Cera has been a guest on this program , best guy in the world … )
Oh he ’s … yeah , yeah yeah .
Do I have 100 % certainty ?
No .
But I think when everything comes together , and he sees the script , I know that Mitch can take care of all of this .

5 Stellar Black Holes Stellar black holes are so - named because they are only " sort of " more massive than our sun , in contrast with supermassive black holes that can stomp an entire galaxy into oblivion because they feel like it .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
There are thousands of these stellar black holes floating around space .
The problem is , we have no way of finding them unless they interact with another stellar object and we happen to see it .
One way they interact is by completely annihilating the object ( in fact , that is their preferred method -- they 're kind of dicks about it ) .
Actual science picture .
In other words , a black hole could be right next to our solar system and we would n't know it until it starts snacking on the sun .
What You 'll See
The sun will suddenly start unwinding itself , and then everything will go black .
Soon after the black hole will begin the process of collapsing all matter into a single point .
So you , your mom , your couch , your porn , the Pacific Ocean and a billion Chinese people will all be crushed into an area the size of a golf ball .

It 'll look like this , only less photoshopped .
The good news is that you wo n't live to see that .
The first thing that happens to you after you get sucked into space is that you get " spaghettified . "
That 's the actual term used by scientists , and we 'll let you use your imagination as to what it means .
Hint : it has nothing to do with the black hole feeding you lots of delicious spaghetti .
Here is a handy little gem of a “ tool . ”
It takes some nerve to worry about FGM when at least 30 % of the world ’s male population is circumcised .
That is NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ( 975,000,000 ) MEN / BOYS walking around with MGM .
In the United States about 60 % of men a re circumcised that is ONE HUNDRED FIVE MILLION MEN / BOYS .
Why is it that people object to calling male circumcision Male Genital Mutilation ?
An intact penis has 33 – 50 % more tissue , one can hardly say that has no effect .
It is argued that circumcision does limit feeling and sexual pleasure for men and can and does cause ED .
When a baby is circumcised it does not just take skin it takes nerves away with it .
That is why a baby boy cries when it is preformed , DUH !
How did female circumcision become such issue when since damn near since the beginning of time men have been circumcised ?
Is it me or does it take an issue that has always been a men ’s issue to come to women before it receives any attention ?
Ironically though female circumcision still exceptionally shadows this male issue .
This is truly remarkable .
I also believe that this an affirmation that men and infant boys in our society are still second class citizens behind women and their issues .
When will it change ?
It will change when men feel that it is not unmanly to open their mouth about how poorly boys and men are treated by our society .
Remember folks be you man or woman , you have a father , son , husband , nephew , cousin , boyfriend , friend that is affected by these issues and they not only deserve the same treatment by society but under the Constitution and the 14th Amendment are to be legally protected equally .

Here is a blog that concerns itself only with female circumcision
and another at the same blog female circumcision
Here is the best part .
At one point in time in the not so distant past 90 % of all infants in the United States were circumcised .
Now it is on the order of 60 % .
Have you ever noticed that feminist sites do not mention the numbers of females circumcised and mostly only state the percentages in specific countries ?
Have you ever wondered why ?
Well I think that I know why .
It is because the number of men / boys in the US out number the amount of women circumcised in the world and we are a sparsely populated country .
Think about it , comparing numbers to numbers their cause would be embarrassingly insignificant compared to that of boys / men .
So the feminists do not slant what I just said , I am not saying that female circumcision is insignificant in and of itself it is just the numbers do not compare to the number of males .
So the real question is why did circumcision not become an issue until it was happening to women .
Answer : Men and their issues are not as important and their lives and issues are extremely devalued and insignificant compared to women even if the same issue affects 100 times more men than women .
That is how the world views men . . . we are disposable .

BARCELONA – The only Googlephone to appear at the Mobile World Congress could n't even be bothered to turn up in person .
HTC and Vodafone made a joint announcement Tuesday of their forthcoming Android - based Magic , formerly known as the G2 , but all they provided were tantalizing specs and a few images .
The handset is notable for a few reasons .
First , it looks a lot nicer than the G1 from T - Mobile .
Second , the Magic will be almost completely exclusive to Vodafone ( the Magic will be on Vodafone in the UK , Spain , Germany and France ; and non-exclusively on Vodafone in Italy ) .
And third , it 's the first Android phone without a keyboard .
The Magic will be touchscreen - only .
There is still a little navi-nipple like the G1 , but the hard QWERTY keyboard on the T - Mobile G1 is gone , leaving only a 3.2 - inch , 320x240 - pixel screen .
The phone also has a 3.2 MP camera , Wi-Fi and GPS .
Like the G1 , it will support a wide range of Google applications , including Gmail , Google Maps , Google Talk and YouTube videos .
The Magic will also support video recording and playback .
At the phone 's launch , Vodafone 's Patrick Chomet called it the " the thinnest , nicest Android - powered device on the market . "
This is a somewhat empty claim , seeing as there is only one other Android handset out there .
Still , if Vodafone does n't pump the tariffs here in Spain like Telefónica did with the iPhone , I might just be buying it .
If it ever turns up .
Gizmodo's Jesus Diaz got two minutes with a prototype in Barcelona and posted a brief video showing off the Magic 's onscreen keyboard and video capabilities .
The screenshot above shows how the HTC Magic ( right ) compares in size to the iPhone ( on the left ) .
Vodafone 's official press image , above , is a bland Illustrator job , not a real photo – but it gives you an idea how the thing will eventually look .
Note that the buttons on the bottom are slightly different than they are on the prototype in the Gizmodo video above .

PRINCETON , NJ --
Of seven actions Barack Obama has taken during the early days of his presidency , five are supported by large majorities of Americans .
The Jan. 30 - Feb. 1 USA Today / Gallup poll asked Americans to say whether they approve or disapprove of seven specific actions Obama has taken as president .
Americans ' general support for most of these is in line with Obama 's initial overall job approval ratings .
The public is most supportive of his decisions to name special envoys to oversee the administration 's efforts in the Middle East , and Pakistan and Afghanistan , and to tighten rules on people working as lobbyists either before or after serving in his administration .
Both of these moves are favored by 76 % of Americans .
Americans are nearly as supportive of Obama 's actions to limit the interrogation methods that can be used on military prisoners -- actions designed to ensure the United States does not resort to torture to find out information from prisoners .
Seventy - four percent of Americans favor that decision , the same percentage who favor his executive order to institute higher fuel efficiency standards .
Two in three Americans approve of his signing a bill to make it easier for workers to sue for pay discrimination , the first legislation he has signed into law as president .
The public does not agree with everything Obama has done , however .
For example , more Americans say they disapprove ( 50 % ) than approve ( 44 % ) of his decision to order the closing of the Guantanamo Bay prison for terrorist suspects in Cuba within a year .
Further , Obama 's decision to reverse the prohibition on funding for overseas family - planning providers may be the least popular thing he has done so far .
This was an executive order that forbade federal government money from going to overseas family - planning groups that provide abortions or offer abortion counseling .
Fifty - eight percent of Americans disapprove of Obama 's decision to lift this ban , while only 35 % approve of it .
The ban on federal funds to these groups was put in place by Ronald Reagan , but lifted by Bill Clinton .
George W. Bush re-instituted the ban after taking office in 2001 , but Obama has once again lifted it .
The abortion and Guantanamo Bay prison decisions are especially unpopular among Republicans ; only 8 % approve of the former and 11 % of the latter .
But these are also the least popular decisions among independents and Democrats as well , though a majority of Democrats still approve of both .
Republicans are in general less supportive of all of Obama 's important early actions than are Democrats and independents , as would be expected .
But a majority of Republicans do approve of four of the seven decisions , including 58 % who approve of limitations on certain interrogation techniques , something the Bush administration resisted .
Implications
While the public has not supported everything Obama has done in his presidency thus far , he continues to receive strong overall job approval ratings around 66 % .
It appears that Americans believe the good outweighs the bad to this point in the Obama presidency .
Admittedly , many of Obama 's early actions have been noncontroversial , and ones that did not receive a great deal of continuing news coverage .
His work in passing an economic stimulus plan is a departure from that , and may provide a stiffer test of how strong his public support is .
The U.S. House version of his plan met with opposition from the entire Republican caucus , and the Senate will work this week to craft a different version of the plan that enjoys broader partisan support .
Still , like prior presidents , Obama appears to be enjoying solid public support during this early stage or " honeymoon " phase of his administration .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,027 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 30 - Feb. 1 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
A software engineer who wrote what he calls a " terrible " and " crap " app in less time than it typically takes to eat lunch has since watched it shoot to the top of Apple 's App Store , where it 's now generating over $ 200 an hour despite being a free download .
22 - year - old High Gloss has worked on more than 20 other iPhone apps for an iPhone software developer .
Â
After running out of ideas to make his own app , he looked through the Top 100 apps for inspiration .
Â
( He uses a pseudonym to keep his personal efforts separate from his work with the aforementioned iPhone software developer ) .
Â
In just 20 minutes , he wrote Sound Grenade ( Free , App Store ) , which is currently listed third under the top free apps , in the wild card category of " Utilities " .
Written in 20 minutes
" The goal of my app was to create a tool for people to annoy others , " Gloss wrote in a blog entry at his website .
Â
He set a one - hour time limit to write and upload it to Apple . Â
" The end product was Sound Grenade , which is a really terrible app , one button turns a sound on or off , period .
Â For 20 minutes ' work , I thought it would be interesting to take the ride . "
The app took off quickly on its first day .
" You can imagine my shock when I checked the App Store page on the first day to see 50 glowing reviews .
Â
Two days later , another 50 reviews .
Â
Five days later , Sound Grenade is in the top ten free apps almost everywhere in the world . "
In an interview with AppleInsider , Gloss said Sound Grenade is the easiest app he 's worked on yet , and he did n't put as much effort into it as he does his other work .
Â
It simply plays a loud , high - pitched sound and shows an image .
" We 're talking maybe 10 lines of code , " he wrote .
Â " For example , rather than generating the [ sine ] wave programatically , I knew it would be quicker for me to just play a looping sound .
Â
From a technical point of view , it 's quite an embarrassing effort , but my goal was to do it in the hour , and I easily achieved this . "
Young user base ?
On Tuesday alone , the app was downloaded more than 100,000 times .
Â
Although Apple does not release specific demographic information to developers , Gloss has reason to believe most of the user base for Sound Grenade is young .
" From reading a number of reviews , it seems fairly obvious that the majority of people are high school , college - aged people , " he wrote .
Â
" A lot of them mention wanting to play pranks on teachers ( and ) classmates . "
Â
He cautioned against drawing any authoritative conclusions as there are only 500 reviews compared to 200,000 total downloads .
The YouTube of software
Gloss said he 's troubled by how popular " crap " can be on the App Store , calling it " a sad state of where the world seems to be at . " Â
However , he still had high praise for the App Store concept .
" I really enjoy the App Store , I think it is amazing , " the New Zealand - based programmer said .
Â
" If you know what you 're looking for , you can find an app and download it either paid or free in a very minimal amount of time from almost anywhere in the world . "
" The problem for the ' quality ' app developers is they want to make theatrical films , and they can only premiere them at the same place as everybody else in the world , " he continued .
Â " Let 's call it the YouTube of software . "
So while some users may waste a few bucks on useless software , Gloss does n't think that will turn people off to the App Store as a whole .
Â
After all , even though not all of the content on YouTube is worth viewing , enough quality does remain to keep users coming back .
" There will be a few apps that people download that put them off [ from ] the idea of apps , but then there are apps that they 'll hear about from friends , or see and spend the money on , and they will love them , " he said .
Â
" They 'll enjoy using them , and it will make it worth it . "
A quick and easy moneymaker
At first , Sound Grenade was completely free . Â
Once it entered the Top 50 , High said he decided to switch to an ad- supported model .
Â
Now , after processing a million ad requests in 24 hours , the app is generating upwards of $ 200 per hour in clickthrough revenue .
Â
In order to keep the app popular , he is looking into a few strategies .
" I have an update I 'm putting the finishing touches on that allows people to ' confess ' what they 're doing with it , " he wrote .
Â
" The idea is that adding some interactivity will get people coming back .
Â ( I 'm following the ) standard method of getting users to open your app again and again . Â
Might work , might not . "
Appealing to the lowest common denominator ?
As a developer , High says he enjoys making software that he'd like to use , just like how he enjoys playing Beethoven or Mozart 's music .
Â
But sometimes , " it 's good to earn some money " and " there is a time and place for everything . "
In his blog entry , he expanded on that comparison :
" The App Store is not like any other software market we 've ever seen .
Â
If it could be compared to any other market , it 's like the Billboard Charts for Music .
Â
A good pop music producer can take someone with minimal talent , get them to sing some lyrics , and then run it through auto tune .
Â Bam . Â Number one song .
Â
That 's all it takes with the App Store .
Â
Do some market research , work out that most of the people that download free apps are immature and seriously uncool .
Â
Then wrap an average idea that you think will appeal to immature and uncool people with some average graphics , and boom , top 10 app .
Â
Like the pop market , it 's hit or miss ; sometimes it will work , sometimes it wo n't . "
While Sound Grenade is self - admitted " crap " , Gloss said he believes the App Store is a blessing for consumers .
Â
He says he is simply taking advantage of the market by trying to give customers what the numbers prove they want .
Â
As he tries to strike gold with another hit , he 'll soon be releasing a private browser , decibel meter , and a angle measuring utility ( as three separate apps ) that are " not big on features , but they work , and they do what you 'd expect and I think they look reasonable . "
Regardless of the more extensively developed apps he might like to create , he knows he 's leaving money on the table if he does n't meet the demand for " crapware " .
Â
It 's the same demand that has pushed apps like Sound Grenade to the top of the most downloaded lists .
Polymorphisms Of Fear - Genetic Gating And Anxiety
Polymorphisms are variations in genes which can result in changes in the way a particular gene functions and thus may be associated with susceptibility to common diseases .
In a new study in Psychological Science , psychologist Tina B. Lonsdorf and her colleagues from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the University of Greifswald in Germany examined the effect of specific polymorphisms on how fear is learned and how that fear is subsequently overcome .
Many symptoms of anxiety disorders are thought to be learned and research on fear conditioning ( a method of learning to fear a particular stimulus ) shows that individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders are quick to learn to fear a stimulus but have a difficult time getting rid of that fear .
In this study , the researchers focused on polymorphisms in two genes thought to play a role in anxiety disorders : the serotonin transporter gene and the gene for the enzyme COMT .
Serotonin is a brain chemical involved in mood regulation .
The serotonin transporter , which is the target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI ) used to treat anxiety and depression , harbors a common polymorphism in its gene .
This polymorphism can come in two different versions that differ in their length .
The shorter version of the gene leads to less serotonin being cleared away and is also associated with higher neuroticism scores and anxious behavior .
The COMT enzyme is involved in breaking down dopamine , a brain chemical important for learning , motivation and seeking rewards .
A specific polymorphism in this gene results in higher levels of extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex , leading to enhanced working memory but also greater levels of anxiety .
In this experiment , volunteers were shown a picture ( A ) and then immediately received a mild electric shock .
They were also shown another picture ( B ) that was never associated with a shock .
The participants learned during the experiment to fear picture A as assessed by physiological responses , the so - called fear potentiated startle response .
To test if this learned fear could be overcome ( also known as fear extinction ) the volunteers came back into the lab the following day .
There they were shown the same pictures , but without any shocks .
If their physiological fear responses disappeared , that meant that they had overcome their fear .
In addition , blood samples were drawn from the volunteers and tested for the variants of the two genetic variations the researchers were studying .
The results showed that while the participants with the shorter version of the serotonin transporter gene developed a very strong physiological fear response to picture A , participants with a longer version of the gene did not .
In addition , a variation in the gene coding for the COMT enzyme was associated with fear extinction - volunteers with this particular variant were able to very quickly overcome their fear while volunteers with the other variant failed to do so .
Writing in " Genetic Gating of Human Fear Learning and Extinction " , the researchers note that these findings have very interesting implications for understanding gene - environment interactions and that " genes may act through the environment by making carriers of particular gene combinations more likely than other individuals to easily pick up and retain fear of stimuli associated with threat and trauma . "
The authors go on to suggest that these findings may indicate that individuals with specific polymorphisms may be more susceptible to anxiety disorders by being more prone to developing fear and being less likely to overcome that fear by common cognitive behavioral treatments which are based on the extinction principle .

Colbert : New York
Times drops to its knees in back alley for $ 20 John Byrne
Published : Friday January 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Delivering a blow to the New York Times for " abandoning its dignity " by allowing ad buyers to purchase a spot on page one , Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert declared Thursday that the Times was " dropping to its knees " in a " back alley " for $ 20 .
" Bravo , Times !
For abandoning your dignity and dropping to your knees in a back alley for 20 bucks like the rest of us , " he declared .
The Times is suffering under the weight of a rapidly hemorrhaging advertising market .
The Wall Street Journal and USA Today already sell ads on their front page .
A year ago , the Times ' company stock was above $ 16 ; today it is lower than $ 8 .
" Frankly , I 'm a little bit disappointed , " Colbert added , " because the very first ad was supposed to be in last Monday 's paper .
It 's supposed to be on the front page , and I can't find it anywhere .
All I see is this exciting , front - page news about how America chooses CBS . "
CBS was the first buyer for the Times ' front page ad slot .

Well , it is n’t only in Europe that we are having a hard time of things .
Last week Kazuo Momma , head of the Bank of Japanâ€™s research and statistics department , warned that Japanâ€™s economy now faced an â€œunimaginableâ€ contraction , and today we can begin to see just what the unimaginable might look like , since the preliminary data for fourth quarter GDP are now out .
And what we find when we come to stare the unimaginable in the face is that Japanâ€™s economy contracted by 3.3 per cent in the three months to December ( compared with the previous quarter ) , effectively the country ’s worst economic performance in 35 years .
On an annualised basis , gross domestic product declined at a rate of 12.7 per cent , a number which perhaps better than any other highlights the depth and severity of a slump that has surely now dispelled all those early hopes that the global economy might be able to shrug off the effects of the financial crisis just like that .
To puts things in a comparative setting , the contraction was three times as bad as that of the US in the same quarter .
Year on year GDP was down by 4.6 % .
This quarter ’s big slide in GDP was in fact the second - worst the country has experienced in modern times , lying just a thin hair ’s breadth away from the record 3.4 per cent quarterly contraction clocked up in 1974 , in the wake of the first Middle East oil shock , and well beyond anything Japan ’s economy has experienced in what is now the “ lost decade and a half ” .
The slowdown was pretty generalised , but lead most decisively by exports which plunged an unprecedented 13.9 percent from the third quarter ( see chart below ) .
In fact Japan has become systematically more dependent on sales abroad for growth over the past decade , and overseas shipments make up 16 percent of the economy today compared with about 10 percent in 1999 .
Domestic demand , which includes spending by households and companies , made up 0.3 of a percentage point of the contraction , while capital investment fell 5.3 percent .
Manufacturers cut investment spending by a record 11.3 percent in the quarter , indicating they have little need to buy equipment as factories lie increasingly idle .
Consumer spending , which accounts for more than half of the economy , dropped 0.4 percent on the quater , as exporters began firing workers .
â€ œThereâ€™s no doubt that the economy is in its worst state in the postwar period , â€ Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Kaoru Yosano said in Tokyo .
â€ œThe Japanese economy , which is heavily dependent on exports of autos , electronics and capital goods , has been severely hit by the global slowdown.â€ 
After ten years of sacrifice and reform , it must be pretty shocking for most Japanese to discover that their economy is still in “ terrible shape ” .
And The Worst Is Still To Come
Evidence of Japanâ€™s slowdown can now be found right across the economy .
On Monday the countryâ€™s electric utilities industry association said that power generation had fallen 6.4 per cent in January as the industrial sector rapidly winds down .
This was the sixth straight monthly decline and the steepest fall since a 6.9 per cent drop recorded in July 2005 .
Even Japan ’s services sector is suffering , and the new Japan Services PMI , compiled by Markit Economics on behalf of Nomura and published for the first time on the 4th February , showed the countryâ€™s downturn deepening in January .
In addition the Nomura / JMMA Manufacturing PMI survey indicated that the goods producing sector contracted at a series record rate in January , in excess of the 22.5 % annual decline indicated by official Trade and Industry Ministry ( METI ) data for December , with plummeting export sales leading the sectorâ€™s decline .
With both manufacturing and service sectors reducing employment at sharp rates in January , consumer confidence â€ “ and therefore household forthcoming spending on both goods and services â€ “ looks set to deteriorate further moving into Q1 , dragging Japanâ€™s economy deeper into recession .
Japanâ€™s consumers remained at their most pessimistic level in at least 26 years in January ( see chart below ) , indicating households are likely to keep cutting back on spending as the recession deepens .
The confidence index nudged up very slightly 26.4 from December ’s 26.2 , according to the Cabinet Office last week .
December ’s numbers had been the lowest since the government began compiling the figures in 1982 .
Export Dependency Is The Heart Of The Problem
But why is Japan so export dependent ?
Well here you will find explanations to suit every palate , but if I can just add my 5 cents worth , I would say that the fact that Japan ’s population currently has the highest median age on the planet is not simply an incidental correlate ( nor is the fact that Germany has the second highest median age and is currently struggling with the same problem simply another incidental detail ) .
Basically years of ultra low fertility coupled with relatively unfriendly immigration attitudes means that the median ages of the Japanese and German population ( at 43 ) are now the highest on the planet .
Previously it was assumed that we would n’t see much in the way of economic consequences from all this till much later in the century , but now , to me at least , it is obvious those consequences are already here .
The consequences are , basically , to be seen in very weak domestic consumption growth , which means that economic growth ( which is needed to pay all those pensions and health care costs ) is totally dependent on exports , and hence the economic well - being of others .
And this growth roller - coaster ( which can only get worse as the median age rises further ) cannot be that much fun for the population at large .
One minute you have the best growth in a decade , and the next you go crashing through the floor .
Ouch !
So – in addition to the bank regulations fix – something also needs to be done to slow down the rapid ageing of the Japanese and German populations , and as far as I know there are only two ways to do that , get fertility up , and open the doors to immigration .
In this context it is interesting to note that an 80 - strong group of economically liberal politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , led by Hidenao Nakagawa , a former LDP secretary - general , are pushing for a change in immigration policy ( full story in the Economist here ) .
These venerable gentlemen are calling for the number of foreigners living and working in Japan to rise to 10 m over the next half century , and for many of these immigrants to become naturalised Japanese .
In addition the Keidanren , the association of large manufacturers , is also shifting position , and last autumn called for a more active immigration policy to bring in more highly skilled foreign workers .
The Keidanren estimates the present number to be a mere 180,000 .
The Economist refers to these moves as bold , I would rather term then “ baby steps ” in the right direction , although we must wait and see what material outcome such pressures lead to , for good intentions have often been expressed in this regard in the past .
As for fertility , again there is a lot of debate about how to encourage people to have more children , and I am sure there is no easy answer here , but I can think of one thing which would help , and that is a change in the national mindset .
You see , maybe it is n’t true to say that countries like France , the United States and Sweden will have no problems with population aging , but they will certainly have a lot less than many others , since their underlying pyramids are much more stable .
And you know what ?
Few people in these three countries would question the fact that having enough children to maintain national economic stability is important , while in the worst affected countries – Japan , Germany , Italy , Russia , China etc – we find precisely the opposite situation , with few people thinking of the fertility topic as an important one .
Indeed many people in very low fertility countries attempt – often vociferously – to deny that long term demography has any economic significance at all .
No wonder then , that people in these countries have less children .
So when you make your long list of all the lessons which need to be learnt from all the hurting we are just about to get , be sure to remember to add this one .
This is the first in a series of three posts looking at the lessons for the United States from broadband deployment in other countries .
Bits readers have a serious case of broadband envy .
I ’ve been writing about the debate about how the government might encourage more high - speed Internet use and you ’ve complained loudly that people in other countries have faster , cheaper , more widely available broadband service .
Even customer - service representatives of Internet service providers overseas are nicer too .
I do n’t know about manners , but it ’s easy to find examples that American ’s broadband is second - rate :
In Japan , broadband service running at 150 megabits per second ( Mbps ) costs $ 60 a month .
The fastest service available now in the United States is 50 Mbps at a price of $ 90 to $ 150 a month .
In London , $ 9 a month buys 8 Mbps service .
In New York , broadband starts at $ 20 per month , for 1 Mbps .
In Iceland , 83 percent of the households are connected to broadband .
In the United States , the adoption rate is 59 percent .
There ’s more than just envy at stake here .
President Obama campaigned on a promise of fast broadband service for all .
On the White House Web site , he writes “ America should lead the world in broadband penetration and Internet access . ”
And the recent stimulus bill requires the Federal Communications Commission to create a national broadband plan in order to make high - speed Internet service both more available and more affordable .
I ’ve spent the last week trolling through reports and talking to people who study broadband deployment around the world to see what explains the faster and cheaper service in many countries .
We ’ll start with where the United States is n’t doing quite so badly : the basic speed of broadband service .
If you take out the countries that have made significant investment in fiber optic networks — Japan , Korea and Sweden — the United States is in the middle of the pack when it comes to network speed .
The large European countries have average download speeds ranging from 3.2 Mbps in Italy to 6.4 Mbps in Germany , according to a study by the Saïd Business School at Oxford .
The United States has an average speed of 5.2 Mbps .
The study looked at speeds in May 2008 , as measured by consumers checking their connections on a Web site called Speedtest .
net .
Japan was the standout , with an average speed of 16.7 Mbps .
Sweden was 8.8 Mbps .
And Korea averaged 7.2 Mbps .
Urban density explains much of that disparity .
In most of the world , by far the most common way to deliver broadband is DSL technology that sends data over copper phone lines .
The shorter the length of the wire from the phone company office to your home , the faster the service can be delivered .
The first generation of DSL could offer speeds of up to 7 megabits per second .
The very latest generation offers up to 100 Mbps for very short distances .
The reason you see offers of DSL service in many European countries of 10 or 20 Mbps , sometimes more , is that in densely populated urban areas , the telephone companies have been able to wire homes using shorter connections and thus faster speeds .
Half the population of South Korea lives in very dense apartment complexes , mostly in or near Seoul .
And most of its very fast broadband service has been delivered by fiber connections into the basements of these buildings , then delivered by fast DSL up to each apartment .
In the United States , phone companies could have offered a faster tier of DSL service to urban apartment dwellers .
But instead they chose to offer slower speeds that they could also offer in the suburbs , where most of the more affluent customers live .
There ’s another thing to keep in mind while comparing Internet speed : truth in advertising .
Data from Ofcom , the British communications regulator , shows that advertising from Internet providers in the United States overstates the speed of their broadband connections less than providers in Japan and the major European countries .
( See Figure 10 in this study . )
Even without any change in government policies , Internet speeds in the United States are getting faster .
Verizon is wiring half its territory with its FiOS service , which strings fiber optic cable to people ’s homes .
FiOS now offers 50 Mbps service and has the capacity to offer much faster speeds .
As of the end of 2008 , 4.1 million homes in the United States had fiber service , which puts the United States right behind Japan , which has brought fiber directly to 8.2 million homes , according to the Fiber to the Home Council .
Much of what is called fiber broadband in Korea , Sweden and until recently Japan , only brings the fiber to the basement of apartment buildings or street - corner switch boxes .
AT&T is building out that sort of network for its U - Verse service , running fiber to small switching stations in neighborhoods , so that it can offer much faster DSL with data speed of up to 25 Mbps and and Internet video as well .
And cable systems , which cover more than 90 percent of the country , are starting to deploy the next generation of Internet technology called Docsis 3.0 .
It can offer speeds of 50 Mbps , and eventually much more , compared to a maximum offer of about 16 Mbps on today ’s cable systems .
In the United States , high broadband speeds have brought even higher prices .
The new 50 Mbps service costs between $ 90 and $ 140 a month .
My next post will bring us to the question of why broadband costs so much more in the United States that in other countries .
On prices , unlike speeds , those tantalizing reports from overseas are correct .
By the way , if you want to follow along , you can wallow in too much data comparing international broadband networks at these sites : The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , Point - Topic , the Technology Policy Institute , the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation , and DSL Prime .
There are a lot of places and a lot of policies , so I ’ve condensed a lot of information .
Many of you know much more than I do about the state of each foreign market .
So please add your experiences in the comments .
In 1932 , an aristocratic , white , crippled version of Barack Obama was elected president , and the Republican Party watched in horror as he eased a weary nation into the warm embrace of European socialism .
Here 's how the Republicans tried to stop him back then :
A sharp attack on the policies of the Roosevelt Administration is contained in the pamphlet entitled " Let 's Look at the Record , " issued by the Republican National Committee .... [ It ] contends that President Roosevelt has not lived up to his campaign promises , in that he has not maintained a sound monetary policy , has broken his pledge to reduce the cost of the Federal Government 25 percent , and has failed to make good on public works and agricultural relief .
Since the Republican Party today comprises many of the same legislators who wrote the aforementioned anti-Roosevelt tract , look out for an imminent similar attack from the opposition party .
Insert all the relevant aphorisms about history here , please :
First time history second time farce ; those who do not learn are doomed to repeat ; it 's not dead it 's not even past ; it is a slaughterbench , etc .
Here 's how House Minority Leader John Boehner outlined his party 's take on Obama 's budget last week : " It 's everything that he said that he was never going to be for when he ran for president .
Now it 's time for him to keep his word . "
The whole New York Times story from 1933 is pasted below , so keep it in your back pocket for reference .

Back in the day , Cope2 , a Bronx graffiti legend as big as a linebacker , usually found himself in proximity to police officers only when they were tracking him in the metallic darkness of a subway yard or when they finally caught up to him and hauled him in .
But on Thursday night he sat willingly within reach of three officers — or at least three retired ones — on a comfortable couch at the powerHouse Arena , an art gallery and bookstore in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn .
The officers , one of whom had arrested Cope2 several years earlier when he was leaving his house to walk his pit bulls , sat on another couch across from him and two fellow graffiti artists .
For the next hour and a half , in front of a packed room , all six were guests on a kind of bizarre hip - hop “ Dick Cavett Show , ” featuring profanity , accusations of police brutality and lots of memories from the days when both the artists and officers were younger and more agile , fully enlisted in the cat - and - mouse game of New York City graffiti in its heyday .
The event was occasioned by the publication of “ Vandal Squad : Inside the New York City Transit Police Department , 1984 - 2004 , ” by Joseph Rivera , a veteran anti-graffiti officer who retired from the force in 2004 and has written perhaps the only book to look at the graffiti movement from the law enforcement perspective .
But the book , which was issued late last year by powerHouse Books and is lavishly illustrated with pictures and resembles a lot of publications that celebrate graffiti , has come in for heavy criticism from some of the artists mentioned in it , who complain that Mr. Rivera is simply trying to cash in now on an urban phenomenon that he spent his career vilifying .
So eager to call CNN ' Communist News Network , ' Fox fudges name of Latin American leader David Edwards and John Byrne

In the war between Fox News and the facts , the facts are always handicapped .
On Fox & Friends Monday , host Steve Doocy took time to note that a former CNN employee , Mauricio Funes , has been elected President of El Salvador .
" He is from a party down in El Salvador that is essentially the communist party , " Doocy explained .
" I wonder if he is just on a leave of absence from CNN , which , given his political inklings CNN could stand for the Communist News Network , " he said .
But Fox was so eager to tie CNN to communism that they could n't get the name of Venezuela 's leader right when making an unsourced allegation .
A second Fox pundit pointed out that Funes ' party , Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front , is liberal and said it was essentially communist .
He then declared that FMLN " allegedly " has ties to Caesar Chavez .
Except that Caesar Chavez does n't lead a party in Latin America .
He was a Mexican - American farm worker and labor activist who died in 1993 .
It took a few moments before the Fox pundits corrected themselves -- they were accusing the former CNN employee of being tied to Hugo Chavez , Venezuela 's sharp - tongued liberal president .
" Scary , guys , " quipped Fox 's Ainsley Earhardt .
Scary , indeed .

Bales of heather fell from the sky onto a peat plateau in the Peak District yesterday , in the latest attempt to halt what scientists believe is a dangerous emitter of carbon dioxide .
Instead of acting as a natural store , or sink , for CO2 , peat bogs such as the district 's Bleaklow are leaking the gas , a process which experts put down to exposure to 200 years of pollution , overgrazing and fire .
The gas is thought to be a big contributor to climate change .
Helicopters interrupted the January tranquillity of a few sheep and muddy walkers to drop billions of heather seeds embedded in bales of brash , or cut heather , which should start sprouting in the spring .
The seeds will also be spread across the moorland by volunteers in the coming weeks .
The rate of CO2 emission from eroded peat bogs is a matter growing concern for scientists : along with neighbouring Peak District hills such as Kinder Scout , it is thought the 700 sq km of the southern Pennine hills could be leaking as much CO2 as a town of almost 50,000 people .
Britain 's peat bogs store the equivalent of 10 times the country 's total CO2 emissions .
Fiona Reynolds , director general of the National Trust , said emissions - a " ticking timebomb " - from the land are potentially as serious as those from cars and planes .
Instead of being a squelchy green blanket covered in moss and cotton grasses , Bleaklow is , in parts , dry as southern Europe , and gullies 4 m deep cross the moor .
" Along with Kinder Scout , Bleaklow is one of the most degraded peat moors in Britain .
The idea is to turn it back from being a source of carbon dioxide to a sink , " said Mike Innerdale , property manager of the trust 's High Peak estate .
When exposed to the air , the peat soil , prized by generations of gardeners and used to fuel homes , quickly crumbles and runs off .
According to Dr Fred Worrall , a leading peat researcher at Durham University , land - based carbon emissions are potentially as serious as cars and aviation .
Peat , one of the most efficient natural reservoirs of CO2 , is vulnerable to degradation , and the Peak District is one of the worst affected because it is at the southern end of global peat stores .
" The further north you go , the less the danger .
If you do nothing , it will only get worse , " Worrall said .
On the moor , landscape expert Rebecca Burtt was supervising the drops .
" This is pioneering work , " she said .
" We 've been encouraging cotton grass , bilberries , crowberry and heather to grow .
The ultimate plant we want up here is spaghnum moss .
The [ degradation ] comes from a combination of old industrial pollution and sheep stopping anything growing back . "
WASHINGTON  Secret Service agents on Friday arrested a man in Mississippi who wrote a series of entries in an Internet chat room saying he intended to kill President - elect Barack Obama , the Justice Department said .
The man , Steven J. Christopher , who is from Wisconsin , was arrested in Brookhaven , Miss. , for making threatening entries on Jan. 11 , 15 and 16 , said Dunn Lampton , the United States attorney in Jackson .
The entries , which included racial and anti-Semitic remarks , were on a Web site that features information and articles about extraterrestrials , government conspiracies and unexplained physical phenomenon .
In one Jan. 11 entry , according to the Justice Department , Mr. Christopher wrote : “ Yes , I have decided I will assassinate Barack Obama .
It ’s really nothing personal about the man . ”
The plan to turn toy rocket technology into new weapon for the U.S. Army is racing ahead .
Last year , we looked at a proposal from toymakers Lund & Company Invention to use their know how to build a Variable Velocity Weapon System ( VVWS ) .
The idea was that by varying the muzzle velocity , the same gun could fire crowd - control impact rounds or lethal high - velocity bullets .
Now , the program has been refined into what might be the ultimate non-lethal paintball gun .
The company has received a$ 723,109 contract to mature their technology and build a weapon that 's supposed to be a significant improvement over one of the main non-lethal weapons used by the U.S. military and law enforcement today .
The FN303 " paintball gun on steroids " ( pictured ) can fire pepper spray , paint , and non-lethal impact rounds – making it awfully useful for keeping crowds in check .
Soldiers and cops rate it very highly .
But it 's got some problems at longer ranges .
And in America , it still suffers from image problems after the death of Victoria Snelgrove , who died after being hit in the eye by an FN303 round in a disturbance after the Boston Red Sox won the World Series .
The version of the VVWS currently being developed would be a purely non-lethal replacement for the FN303 .
The key advantage is the ability to vary the muzzle velocity ; no details have been released , but this may be controlled automatically by a laser rangefinder .
At short ranges , it will have a low muzzle velocity , ensuring the impact is safe ; but the speed can also be increased to extend the maximum range beyond what can currently be achieved .
The VVWS will have a maximum range of 150 meters , compared to a range of 50 meters for the FN303 for point targets .
Longer ranges are sometimes quoted for the FN303 but these seem to refer to using it to deliver volleys of " pepperball " rounds to saturate an area with a cloud of PAVA pepper powder .
The military do not use this type of ammunition , being confined to impact rounds which , unlike paintballs , are hard and shatter on impact .
( Paintball - type rounds are also available for marking with washable or indelible dye ) .
The VVWS will be able to fire five hundred shots on a single fuel canister , compared to a hundred and ten for the FN303 .
Note that this is fuel rather than compressed air ; Lund 's rockets use an ingenious method of electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen gas .
The exact propulsion method for the VVWS has not been disclosed .
" Tremendous progress is being made , " CEO Bruce Lund told Danger Room , although he was not at liberty to give many details .
" We have reduced the unit to a portable hand carried second - generation Beta model and are ready for preliminary field tests . "
The VVWS will also be lighter than the five - pound FN303 .
The motive for this is likely to be the need for an under - barrel version that can be attached to an M4 carbine .
An under - barrel version of the FN303 has already been fielded - taking us back to the original set - up of having both lethal and nonlethal options easily to hand .
However , the VVWS will still suffer the same limitation of any kinetic weapon ; during riots in detention centers , Iraqi prisoners have been known to use mattresses as shields which is going to block most non-lethal rounds .
( The beam from the Active Denial System might go through though ) .
Lund also says that the VVWS should be lower in cost than the older weapon .
Lund & Company are toymakers after all , and used to building products to a tighter price specification than military suppliers .
The VVWS is certainly not a toy .
But if its cheap enough , the technology may well be featured in recreational products , like paintball guns , in the years to come .

Exclusive : Twitter integration coming to OnStar
OnStar users , look out — Twitter is about to become a part of your experience .
How so ?
Well , being an owner of a couple of Cadillacs with OnStar built - in , we sometimes receive surveys or phone calls asking us how we are liking things .
Nothing out of the ordinary .
However , in today ’s survey , I found a portion that was particularly interesting :
“ While in your vehicle , you can use OnStar to submit and retrieve tweets ( messages ) via your Twitter account .
Using OnStar ’s Voice - Activated Hands - Free Calling system , and having your voice converted into text , you can provide updates which would appear in the “ What are you doing ? ” section of your Twitter homepage .
It is also possible to listen to a tweet that was sent to you by someone else after it has been converted into voice .
You can send and receive tweets without having to type or read anything . ”
Did you get that ?
Voice to text conversion using your in - car hands - free system so that you can both post to Twitter , and hear what is going on with your friends .
Kind of crazy when you first think about it , but after a few minutes , you can start to imagine some cool uses .
You can voice - tweet something like “ I ’m headed to downtown Seattle , where can I find the best slice of pizza ? ”
You can then listen for responses , and when you hear one , have OnStar direct you to that location .
Or you can just , you know , mess around on Twitter while driving without trying to juggle your iPhone and the steering wheel .
No word on when exactly the service will go live .
Oh , and you can follow Gear Live on Twitter .
The Times ' Scott Glover reported earlier this month that the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles sent a confidential memo to prosecutors in February ordering them to stop filing charges against medical marijuana dispensaries -- then reversed himself on the issue a few days later .
Now there is word out of Washington that the Justice Department 's stance on pot dispensaries might be changing .
The Associated Press reports that Atty .
Gen. Eric
Holder says authorities will target marijuana distributors that violate both federal and state law — " a departure from the Bush administration , which targeted medical marijuana dispensaries in California , even if they complied with that state 's law . "
Holder has not spelled out details -- or whether Drug Enforcement Administration raids of California clinics will stop .
[ UPDATE at 1:45 : Times reporters are looking at Holder 's comments and will have a story later in the day .
It remains unclear whether his comments will immediately change any DEA or Department of Justice policies ] .

We 're tracking every taxpayer dollar and every recipient .
All searchable – and translated into English . ]
Last Wednesday , federal regulators announced that they were beginning the so - called stress tests on the country ’s largest banks .
One thing that has n’t been entirely clear : exactly which banks are getting the treatment .
Based on the criteria announced by the Treasury Department and publicly available data , we ’ve compiled a list of those 19 banks below .
Some , like GMAC and American Express , were n’t banks until a few months ago , when they converted to bank holding companies in order to be eligible for Treasury Department programs .
All but one , the insurance company MetLife , which qualifies because it ’s a bank holding company , have already received billions from the Treasury .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has said the test will be used to assess how much more ( if any ) in bailout billions these institutions need .
A GMAC spokeswoman confirmed the company was among those participating in the stress tests , but declined to comment further .
A MetLife spokesman declined to comment on the tests and referred questions to the Treasury .
Spokespeople from both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve declined to comment .
The Treasury has announced that the tests will be applied to 19 U.S. - based bank organizations with more than $ 100 billion in total assets .
These fit the bill :
Name Total Assets ( Billions ) 1 . JPMorgan Chase 2,175 2 . Citigroup 1,947 3 . Bank of America ( not including Merrill Lynch ) 1,822 4 . Wells Fargo 1,310 5 . Goldman Sachs 885 6 . Morgan Stanley 659 7 . MetLife 502 8 . PNC Financial Services 291 9 . U.S. Bancorp 267 10 .
Bank of New York Mellon 238 11 .
GMAC 189 12 . SunTrust 189 13 .
State Street 177 14 .
Capital One Financial Corp. 166 15 . BB &T 152 16 . Regions Financial Corp. 146 17 . American Express 126 18 .
Fifth Third Bancorp 120 19 .
KeyCorp 105
The assessments , directed by regulators but performed by the banks themselves , will analyze how a bank would fare under a grim economic scenario ( some argue not grim enough ) in the next couple of years .
Based on those tests , the Treasury will force the bank to raise a specified amount of money – between 1 percent and 2 percent of the company ’s risk - weighted assets , though in special cases the Treasury could decide more is needed .
If the money ca n’t be raised privately , the Treasury will provide it .
For the biggest banks , like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , 1 percent of risk - weighted assets amounts to about $ 13 billion .
If the Treasury decided each institution required the maximum , more than $ 140 billion would be needed , most of that likely coming from public coffers .
The investments will made as preferred shares convertible to common shares .
GMAC , the financial arm of General Motors that also has insurance and mortgage divisions , converted to a bank holding company in December .
Then , as part of the bailout of GM and Chrysler , the Treasury invested $ 5 billion in GMAC .
It ’s unclear exactly how much more GMAC could get after the stress tests since the company does not publicly disclose its risk - weighted assets , but the extra bailout dough would most likely range from $ 1 billion to $ 3 billion .
A number of insurance companies have sought to convert to bank holding companies to get a piece of the bailout , but MetLife , which has been a bank holding company for years , apparently has n’t applied for aid .
As of yet , no insurance companies have been approved .
The Paco
Japanese architect Jo Nagasaka and the Schemata Architecture Office have come up with a home design that rethinks just how much space one person needs .
6,000 square feet ?
600 ?
Well , try 30 square feet .
( Pics )
The Paco home has a hammock to sleep on , a Japanese - style recessed desk , and a sink , toilet and shower all in a crate that ’s a 3 - meter - cube .
It ’s not intended to replace where you live now , but rather to supplement it .
It could be a beach house , a portable office – anything , really , as long as you find a way to lug it into place and hook up the water .
Trying to open that hatch - like roof to get in does n’t look like the most comfortable solution , either , though maybe that ’s a doggy door on the side .
Still , toss some posters on the wall , maybe put a rug down , and you ’ve got yourself a happy little home .

I wanted something to sink my teeth into on just how large IPV6 really is .
As such , I decided to do it graphically .
Initially , this meant just representing each IP address with a single pixel .
Surely , the images would be doable .
However , as I started crunching the numbers , they were much larger than I thought , and I came to a very quick realization that this would n't be possible .
I needed to do some compression if I wanted to show it visually .
So , I took advantage of compression where possible , and I let your imagination work in a couple spots where even compression wo n't turn out anything reliable or representational .
To start , it 's well known that we 're running out of IP v4 addresses .
IP v4 only address 2^32 possible IPs , which is 4,294,967,296 .
There are already 6.5 billion in the world , so we do n't even have enough IPs for 1 per person .
Given the fact that many of us have more than 1 ( Internet , cell phones , cable / satellite TV ) and many businesses have gobbled up millions at a time , such as IBM and Sun Microsystems , we 're in trouble .
It 's estimated that we 'll be out of IP v4 addresses within the next 2 years .
There are things we can do to extend that life , but for the most part , it 's time to move on to IPv6 .
To give a visual of how much of the space is left , consider the image below .
This first image is 256x256 pixels , for a total of 65,536 pixels .
As already mentioned , there are currently 4,294,967,296 possible IP v4 addresses .
As such , each pixel in my image represents 256 unique IP v4 addresses .
There are currently only 511 million addresses left , or about 12 % .
My graphic below gives an accurate representation of the exhaustion , if black is all the used addresses and white is what is available .
Now , what about IPv6 ?
Well , to start , it addresses 2^128 possible IPs , which is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible addresses .
There are a lot of technical points of interest with IPv6 .
First , it is NOT backwards compatible with IP v4 , which means we 'll be living a dual IP stack for some time .
Second , 64 - bits of the 128 in IPv6 are dedicated to your Ethernet hardware address , commonly referred to as the MAC address .
Which means , that your ISP could give you the other 2^64 , or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 unique IP addresses when you sign up for an account .
After all , as you 'll see , we have more than enough room .
This number may not look large , but I want to put it into perspective visually , so you have an idea of what we 're looking at .
If each IP was a single pixel , this would produce an image 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 pixels square .
Now , my monitor has the capability of showing 105 pixels per linear inch .
This means my monitor would need to be 2,772,778,991,358 miles in length and width if I wanted to see the image without any scrolling .
Just for comparison , a light year is 5,865,696,000,000 miles .
It would take almost 6 months traveling at the speed of light to start from one end of my monitor to reach the opposite .
Want an image to wrap your mind around it ?
The maximum distance of Pluto from our Sun is approximately 4,557,000,000 miles away .
We need to do that distance about 600 times before reaching the end of my monitor .
We 're still well within the Milky Way however .
Let 's get closer though .
If I were to keep the same allocation of 256 IP addresses for a single pixel , as I did with my first image , then I would need a monitor capable of showing 72,057,594,037,927,936 pixels square .
A linear distance of that size is about 1,083,116,793 miles across .
This is slightly more doable as a visual representation .
The distance from our Sun to Saturn is roughly 886 million miles .
So , drive about 200 million miles further , long before we reach Uranus and we 'll reach the edge of my monitor .
Want a visual representation to scale ?
The yellow blob on the far left , just outside the white monitor is our Sun .
The pink dot on the far right just inside the monitor is Saturn .
Remember , this is our monitor size if each pixel on my monitor was 256 IP addresses .
Certainly , this is much too large .
Can't I get a monitor to fit on my desk ?
Let 's allocate the entire IP v4 space to a singe pixel on my screen .
This should give us a more manageable image , no ?
That means that I would need an image size of 4,294,967,296 pixels square .
An image of this size would require a monitor width of only 645 miles .
Putting the center of the monitor in the center of the United States , and I can see that my monitor is large enough to cover 6 states in the Midwest - Nebraska , Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , Oklahoma and Arkansas .
Again , remember that each pixel in my monitor would be occupying 4.2 billion IP addresses .
Think any hardware manufacturer is willing to make a monitor this large for me ?
So , there you have it .
A visual representation of IPV6 as best as I could do .
Hopefully , this will help you understand just how large IP v6 is , and that I do n't expect us to run out of addresses with that vast number .
Unless , of course , we enter inter-galactic communication on the same protocol .
( If I wanted to fit the entire IP v6 space on my physical monitor right now , each pixel would need to represent 192,903,836,122,980,988,357,922,113,056,557 IP addresses .

Cases Handled
[ digg- reddit - me ] Now that the World Economic Forum 2009 meeting in Davos , Switzerland has concluded , let me present some highlights .
The number one highlight , of course , is the Turkish Prime Minister , Tayyip Erdogan , storming off the stage after not being allowed to finish addressing Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on the issue of Gaza :
Keep in mind that the “ spirit of Davos ” is supposed to be international cooperation and civil discussion between the business and political elites and the journalists who so eagerly report on them - and that Turkey and Israel are allies rather than enemies .
Dr. George Friedman of the Stratfor Institute saw this as the clearest demonstration yet of Turkey ’s increasingly prominent role as the leader of the Muslim world – and certainly Erdogan is being lionized for standing up to the Western media and the Israeli prime minister .
But the immediate buzz in the hall was n’t about the global significance of this fit , but about breakdown of the spirit of Davos .
For journalists , Davos is a kind of ideal as William Lewis of London ’s the Telegraph described it :
The beauty of Davos is that one can meet large numbers of the world ’s most important / interesting / powerful / egotistical people in the space of four days .
Interviews that would otherwise take months to arrange , and hours to travel to , take place in a small Swiss ski resort .
It ’s a journalist ’s dream …
More significantly , Lewis noted that this year , for the first time in many years , Americans did not dominate .
Barack Obama only sent his advisor Valerie Jarrett .
The most prominent American present was Bill Clinton .
More on him later .
Instead , Davos was dominated by the Chinese premier and Russian prime minister , each of whom confronted America and blamed it for the crises in their countries in a different manner .
Joe Conanson of Salon described the mood :
Accustomed to flattering themselves and each other as benevolent masters of the globalizing world , they now confront an unprecedented crisis – actually a conglomeration of crises – that has diminished their financial worth and moral credibility .
What roused the global elitists from their glum torpor was the opportunity to lay blame for the economic catastrophe that has befallen the world .
There was one obvious target : the United States of America , whose stupid and criminal bankers have inflicted so much harm on the whole of humanity .
It is an undeniable fact that the Russian and Chinese leaders explored with great relish at every opportunity .
The Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , in a characteristic manner , did not directly name America as the cause of the financial crisis , but elliptically described it as “ attributable to inappropriate macroeconomic policies of some economies and their unsustainable model of development characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption ; excessive expansion of financial institutions in blind pursuit of profit , ” etcetera .
It was clear to everyone who he was talking about .
Wen ’s speech was warmly received – but his private remarks to a meeting of Western business leaders demonstrated his real political skill – as he charmed the gathered free market capitalists by referencing such touchstones as the work of Adam Smith ( which he had recently re-read . )
Then , there were Vladimir Putin ’s remarks on the “ perfect storm ” that is the current financial crisis .
The theory of the perfect storm – “ the simultaneous occurrence of weather events which , taken individually , would be far less powerful than the storm resulting of their chance combination ” – seems to be a rather apt metaphor for the confluence of events shaking the global system .
Putin placed the blame directly on America though , in part no doubt due to his honest assessment , and in part to deflect responsibility .
While he was giving this speech , violent protests calling on him to step down were being put down back in Russia as many blamed his financial mismanagement as he bet Russia ’s economy on strong commodities prices .
Finally , there was former president Bill Clinton .
Clinton addressed the assembled world political and economic leaders :
This is not a time for denial or delay .
Do something .
Give people confidence by showing confidence .
Do n’t give up .
Do n’t bet against yourself .
Do n’t bet against your country .
This is still a good time to be alive .
Described as “ the lone American to whom anyone at Davos might actually listen as he attempted to uphold the name of his country , ” Clinton not only tried to rally the world leaders from their sour mood , but also responded more specifically to Putin in response to a question :
Later , Clinton met with Putin privately for an hour and a half , seemingly with the consent of the State Department and White House .
The overall lesson of this year ’s Davos seems to be a reinforcement of the consensus view of the foreign policy establishment :
We are now living in a nonpolar world in which , though America retains great power and is the most powerful single force , it will not hold the same leverage that it once did .
We can no longer act as the world ’s only superpower – but instead can take our place as the first among equals .

The largest series of solar installations in history , more than 1,300 megawatts , is planned for the desert outside Los Angeles , according to a new deal between the utility Southern California Edison and solar power plant maker , BrightSource .
The momentous deal will deliver more electricity than even the largest nuclear plant , spread out among seven facilities , the first of which will start up in 2013 .
When fully operational , the companies say the facility will provide enough electricity to power 845,000 homes — more than exist in San Francisco — though estimates like that are notoriously squirrely .
The technology is n't the familiar photovoltaics — the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity — but solar thermal power , which concentrates the sun 's rays to create steam in a boiler and spin a turbine .
" We do see solar as the large untapped resource , particularly in Southern California , " said Stuart Hemphill , vice president of renewable energy and power at Southern California Edison .
" It 's barely tapped and we 're eager to see it expand in our portfolio . "
BrightSource is the reincarnation of Luz International , which built the only currently operating solar thermal facility during the 1980s in the Mojave Desert .
After natural gas and energy prices plunged in 1985 , that operation became unprofitable .
The group 's engineers and founders moved the business to Israel , where they continued to work on their technology .
The new deal breaks the company 's own record for the largest ever solar deal .
The new installations , when completed , will produce 3.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year .
Previously , they 'd cut a deal to deliver 900 megawatts of power to the Northern California utility , PG&E .
" Coupled with our earlier partnership with PG&E , this agreement proves that the energy industry recognizes the important role that solar thermal will play in the energy future , " John Woolard , CEO of BrightSource , said in a press conference with reporters .
While Brightsource is a leader in the field , a variety of other companies compete in the solar thermal space .
Google.org and other investors have backed eSolar 's with $ 130 million funding .
Abu Dhabi 's clean - tech fund , Masdar , has funded a $ 1.2 billion solar thermal company called Torresol .
Yet another player , Abengoa , recently signed a $ 4 billion deal with Arizona Public Utilities , and Stirling Energy Systems , a company that has adapted the Stirling Engine , a 200 - year - old invention , for concentrated solar power , even pulled in a $ 100 million investment .
The first of the seven installations will be in Ivanpah ,
California and will be rated at 100 megawatts of peak power .
The companies expect it to produce 286,000 megawatt hours of electricity per year .
When all the installations are finished , they 'll stretch over
10,500 acres of land .
Southern California Edison 's
Hemphill said that the new plants would provide a valuable hedge against volatile natural gas prices , noting that his company had seen natural gas prices as low as $ 4 per thousand million cubic feet ( a standard industry measure ) and as high as $ 16 .
Given the variability of natural gas pricing , Hemphill said that his company did not expect the solar thermal electricity to exceed the market cost of electricity in California .
The 1980s - era solar thermal plants use the oldest solar thermal technology around , known as a parabolic trough .
Mirrors shaped like a paper - towel roll cut in half concentrate the sun 's rays on a liquid .
That heat can be transformed into various types of energy .
The Luz fields made electricity , but Frank Shuman built a plant based on this principle to pump water in Egypt in the first decade of the 20th century .
The new design sounds more exciting .
Mirrors that track the sun —
heliostats — sit in a massive field around a tower with a boiler .
All those mirrors concentrate the sun's heat on the boiler , which makes steam and drives a turbine .
Solar thermal is seen as a promising source of energy for city - scale power because it works on very well established principles .
Photovoltaics have come down in price — and thin - film plastic solar cells could get even cheaper — but the conversion of sunlight to electricity remains a novel source of energy .
The first working cells were only built half a century ago , and they were truly something new in the world .
Steam - driven turbines , on the other hand , make almost 90
percent of the world 's electricity and their ancestry stretches back to the start of the Industrial Revolution .
Solar thermal engineers , then , can use the knowledge gained from more than a century of tinkering at coal , natural gas , and nuclear fission plants .

There is a new blog about the Irish economy by a very impressive list of professional economists , which I ’m sure that many of you have been following .
It ’s definitely a blog worth keeping an eye on .
One post that I noticed recently , “ On German Concerns About US Monetary Policy “ , contains too many interesting points for me to deal with in one post , but I would like to focus on one simple idea and see if my analysis can add to the conversation .
The question is : are central bank asset purchases inflationary ?
And what about loans ?
I will write generally about my understanding of some important effects of money creation .
From the blog post :
… it is simply not accurate to refer to the recent expansion in the Fed ’s balance sheet as “ literally printing money ” .
Bernanke occasionally gets referred to as Helicopter Ben , as in the Milton Friedman ’s famous analogy about dropping money from a helicopter .
Basic intuition explains why a helicopter drop will increase prices :
It represents an increase in private - sector nominal wealth and this higher level of wealth is chasing the same real amount of goods and services , which leads to an increase in the price level …
“ Most Federal Reserve money creation does not represent an increase in private - sector nominal wealth .
The Fed expands the money supply by purchasing securities from the public and paying for them by crediting the reserve account of the seller ’s bank .
From the point of view of the private sector ’s balance sheet , a security of a certain value has been swapped for cash of that value , with no corresponding change in private sector wealth . ”
I want firstly to make clear the distinction between money and wealth .
In general , once we have a functional medium of exchange , what wealth does society gain from an additional supply ?
In the case of fiat paper money , which has no ( or negligible ) non-monetary use value , the answer is none .
Since paper money only serves as a medium of exchange , and since we have assumed that there was already enough money to serve this purpose , an additional supply can provide no extra value to society as a whole .
This is in contrast to a real commodity money like gold , where an additional supply enriches us through its many applications .
In a paper money ( € ) scenario , suppose that a counterfeiter prints € 50 k in his basement , and then goes out and buys a car .
Considering the balance sheet of the counterfeiter versus the balance sheet of everybody else in society , would we say that there had merely been an exchange of an asset of a particular value for cash of that value , and that there had been no change in everybody else ’s wealth ?
I do n’t think so .
The goods purchased by the counterfeiter have been replaced on the balance sheet of everybody else by debased paper money .
The counterfeiter has received a car , while everybody else has only received useless paper money .
The counterfeiter is better off , while “ society ” ( i.e. everybody else , taken together ) is worse off , in terms of useful goods and services , by exactly one car .
There are some subtleties as to how exactly the cost of the car is borne .
It would be wrong to say that everybody else in society had been made worse off by the counterfeiter .
Naturally , he who voluntarily sold his car for counterfeit paper can experience a benefit ( presuming that the money is not rejected as counterfeit when goes to market with it ) .
Depending on how much is paid for the car , the seller of the car can now better outbid others for the goods and services he desires .
Those who supply him , by experiencing increased demand for their products , can do likewise in their own capacity as buyers .
In this way the new money flows through the economy , enriching first of all the counterfeiter , and then secondarily those in his or her chain of supply , and impoverishing everyone else to the same extent .
If the counterfeiter had instead been a thief , and had simply stolen the car , the difference in the resulting distribution for everybody else would of course have simply been that the original car owner had been left without his car .
It ’s worth noting at this point that whereas those who bear the costs of monetary inflation may have little or no idea about what is happening to them , victims of theft tend not to suffer from that problem .
If we are talking not about a car , but about a security such as corporate or government debt , the principle still holds .
The government via the central bank experiences the primary benefit , while the bondholders experience the secondary benefit from increased demand for their assets .
For the same reasons as above , everybody in the chain of supply to these bondholders benefits in this way .
Wealth has been redistributed to the government and to everybody else in their capacity as suppliers to government , while it is redistributed away from people in their other capacities .
To picture some of these dynamics in very simple terms , we might imagine a small village which uses shells as its medium of exchange .
Suppose that one particularly clever or lucky inhabitant of the village , called Ben , discovers a cache in a nearby forest containing an unlimited supply of shells .
Ben starts using these shells for his expenditures , outbidding his rivals for the goods he wishes to purchase .
Now imagine that Ben has a particular fondness for fish .
By supply additional money to the fishermen than they would otherwise have received , Ben will thus stimulate the fishing trade .
Fishermen will be able to use the money they receive to satisfy their own various desires , outbidding rivals from other trades in the marketplace .
Thanks to Ben ’s activities , fisherman will be able to live more comfortable lives than they otherwise could , and this will be at the expense of , for example , the farmers , whose customers , unlike Ben , have no new means to boost farming income .
The result is that fewer people will farm , and more will want to fish .
There is a rebalancing of the labour market as people seek the lucrative returns provided by Ben ’s virtually limitless demand .
This will help to satisfy
Ben ’s demand by increasing the supply of fish , and yet to the same extent it will impoverish those who consume other items , by reducing the supply to them .
Thoughout all of this the economy ’s total productive potential has n’t changed , it has only been altered to take into accout Ben ’s heightened buying power .
So we understand that the economy evolves to reflect Ben ’s demands .
How much it changes depends on how many shells
Ben is releasing to the market at any particular time relative to the stock already in supply at that time .
The extreme case is where everybody else is directing their efforts only to satisfy his demands , when nobody else can afford to outbid Ben for any good .
This system breaks down when people figure out what is happening and stop using shells as their medium of exchange .
If shell - prices are no longer useful for economic calculations , and if shells no longer act as a reliable store of value , then people will start looking for other commodities to serve this purpose .
Therefore , to maximise his discovery for the long - term , Ben would probably be better off not letting anybody else know about his cache , and supplying additional shells to market only infrequently so that the inflation will not be too severe and the integrity of the shell money can be maintained for as long as possible .
Additionally , if Ben is powerful enough , he could try to secure the long - term usage of shells by simply outlawing the use of any other currency .
Note that hyperinflation in our village would n’t actually be so bad as a 21st century hyperinflation , since at least the villagers would be left with an unlimited supply of pretty shells in their possession .
The main point that I want to drive home here is that swapping newly created money for assets does not avoid the inflationary implications of a helicopter drop .
What you can say about the helicopter drop is that at least it only raises the price level , but the printing of money for asset purchases also has the effect of removing assets from the productive sector of the economy .
Instead of having more money and the same stock of assets , the productive sector is left with more money and fewer assets .
“ Nominal wealth ” ( money ) has increased , while the stock of real wealth has decreased .
What ’s more , the cost of these assets is borne through the higher prices faced by everybody outside the chain of supply to the government , and in such a way that they are unlikely to understand what is happening ( this is in contrast to the outcome if the assets had just been expropriated or stolen ) .
It ’s a particularly oblique form of wealth transfer .
It might be a little bit confusing in the case where the newly created money is used to buy debt instruments such as bonds or mortgages .
In this case , can the inflationary effect of money creation be nullified by the deflationary effect of removing debt from society ’s balance sheet ?
Not at all : the debt instruments are not part of the money supply .
The money which was lent to create this debt is a part of the money supply , but the debt instruments themselves are not .
They are merely claims to money , constituting part of the demand for money , not part of the supply .
Thus , replacing them on society ’s balance sheet with money is no less inflationary than would be replacing a car .
Next , we read :
“ These types of permanent purchases are actually pretty rare : More common is that the Fed provides a temporary loan , securitized by some collateral .
The Fed provides liquid funds ( which is an asset for the private sector ) but this is owed back to the Fed ( which is a liability for the private sector ) .
Again , no private - sector wealth has been created . ”
It is true that no wealth has been created , since , as we discussed , money and wealth are different categories of item , and the creation of a loan is merely the temporary creation of money .
But using a similar analysis to the above , we can see that whoever voluntarily accepts money in exchange for their collateral has benefited from this transaction .
Of course the Fed or other central bank has gained too , because they only had to will into existence the unbacked paper ( or more likely , digital ) money in order to receive a conditionl claim to the collateral for lending it .
The losers are the people who are in competition with those who receive the new money and everybody who depends upon these people .
To take an example , a bridge loan to a car manufacturer will enable that manufacturer to outbid his rivals for factors of production ( land , labour , capital ) .
These can be rivals from the car or from any other industry , and this is why attempting to address the imbalance caused by aiding just one manufacturer wo n’t work : providing loans to every car manufacturer would merely divert productive resources into the car industry and away from everywhere else .
The only thing that can be said in favour of loans versus asset purchases is that the amount of wealth transferred to the government and its chain of supply in the case of a loan need not be nearly so great in comparison to the amount of wealth transferred in the case of an asset purchase of a similar amount ( simply because the central bank may subsequently absorb the loan repayments and allow the money supply to revert to its orginal level ) .
Of course there is much more to be said about all of this , but I hope that what has been said is reasonably clear .
Money creation is always “ inflationary ” in the modern sense of the word ( which is why historically the terms money creation and inflation were synonymous ) , and the benefits of money creation , whether it is used for purchases or loans , and whether it is created by a central bank or an illegal counterfeiter , accrue first of all to the creator , and secondly to the creator ’s supply chain .
It thus redistributes wealth and changes the structure of the economy as a whole .
* U.S. Central has $ 34 billion in assets
* Settles for all other wholesale credit unions
* Western Corporate also seized
* Action comes as three small banks closed by FDIC ( Adds NCUA spokesman , moves to bolster insurance fund )
By Karey Wutkowski
WASHINGTON , March 20 ( Reuters ) - Regulators seized the top clearinghouse for U.S. credit unions , citing a critical deterioration in the finances of the provider of services to thousands of retail credit unions .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) took control of U.S. Central Federal Credit Union , a huge wholesale credit union with about $ 34 billion in assets based in Lenexa , Kansas .
It also seized Western Corporate ( WesCorp ) Federal Credit Union of San Dimas , California , another corporate credit union with $ 23 billion in assets .
Stress tests of corporate credit unions had uncovered an “ unacceptably high concentration of risk ” at these two institutions , the regulator said in a statement .
The immediate costs of the takeover are coming out of a $ 7 billion industry - maintained insurance fund , but will mean higher premiums levied on retail credit unions .
The action highlighted strains in the nonprofit banking sector that has recently been touted as a source of new lending , even as many for - profit banks limit their lending and receive billions of dollars of taxpayer - funded capital injections .
U.S. regulators also seized another three small banks on Friday , bringing the total to 20 so far this year .
U.S. Central and WesCorp were carrying the bulk of the soured mortgage - backed securities that have been causing woes to the corporate credit union industry , said NCUA spokesman John McKechnie .
“ We ’ve been intervening in the corporate networks ... for several months now and it just got to a critical stage , ” McKechnie said .
“ In the last couple of months the problems have moved from liquidity to be more capital and asset - based . ”
In January the NCUA injected $ 1 billion into U.S. Central after the corporate credit union suffered dramatic declines in the value of mortgage - backed securities it had bought .
Corporate credit unions are the retail credit union ’s credit union , providing services including lending , and check and payment clearance services .
The NCUA also moved in January to guarantee the $ 80 billion that regular credit unions have on deposit in the corporate network .
The moves were considered a bailout of the U.S. credit union network .
Credit union retail customer deposits are insured up to $ 250,000 per account , in line with bank deposits , a step taken last year as part of a wider effort to increase consumer confidence in banking .
The NCUA said service will continue uninterrupted at U.S. Central and WesCorp , and said member accounts are guaranteed through Dec. 31 , 2010 .
“ When a credit union or a corporate credit union is taken into conservatorship ... it remains business as usual , all insured deposits are protected , ” said Henry Kertman , spokesman for the California Credit Union League .
A HIT TO INDUSTRY EARNINGS
U.S. Central has 26 corporate credit union members and says it provides settlement services to 100 percent of corporate credit unions and 93 percent of all U.S. credit unions .
WesCorp based in San Dimas , California , has approximately 1,100 retail credit union members , the NCUA said .
McKechnie said the industry will have to pay an additional $ 1.2 billion to cover the resolution of the the two institutions , on top of a $ 4.7 billion assessment the NCUA announced earlier this year for its actions in January .
“ The direct impact is going to be to the earnings of credit unions as they pay to replenish the fund , ” McKechnie said .
He said the NCUA does not anticipate having to tap into its $ 100 million line of credit with the U.S. Treasury Department , meaning taxpayers will not be on the hook for the latest dramatic financial rescue .
Legislation moving through Congress would increase the credit union industry ’s borrowing authority to $ 6 billion , and give it more time to replenish its insurance fund .
McKechnie said he would not speculate about any future actions the NCUA might have to take to stabilize the credit union industry , which he said is “ very well capitalized at this point . ”
“ I do think that we have taken whatever steps are necessary to maintain a well - functioning , safe and sound credit union industry , ” McKechnie said .
Separately , the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said it had found other banks to acquire the deposits of TeamBank TFIN.O of Paola , Kansas , and Colorado National Bank of Colorado Springs , Colorado .
But the FDIC became receiver of FirstCity Bank of Stockbridge , Georgia , and approved the payout of its insured deposits .

The Whole Story
On September 2nd 2010 , on my blog Barf Stew - I ran as a headline `Mohawk Punk Time - Traveler Caught in 1905 Banana Pier Photo ' - a photo that I found on the award winning website Shorpy 's a day or two prior .
Indeed , immediately upon seeing the photo on Shorpy I KNEW I was going to use it in a RUSE of sorts - a tongue in cheek effort to throw some light on `time - travel ' ( a subject I cover often on Barf Stew ) and to `mock ' a man in the `alternative ' community that believes he has found HIMSELF in an oldtime photo .
I also knew that earlier in 2010 that a similar photo went viral about a ` Hipster ' Time - Traveler - that was eventually disected by a fine website named Forgetomori .
Indeed , I was so sure this photo was worthy - that I alerted two fellow bloggers that I would have something big the next day ( when I posted ) .
Immediately , the day after I posted - the two fellow bloggers ( and writers with me on The C Influence Blog ) - who run The Debris Field and Phantoms and Monsters - carried my photo link and post on their site .
But , at about 6 in the morning - I posted to Reddit my link - and within minutes I had 25 hits and nearly a thousand by the end of the day .
The next day - The Anomalist picked up my Barf Stew post and gave it a great write - up - and suggested that it was a tongue in cheek effort .
Eventually , The Anomalist picked the link up again when Forgetomori decided to weigh in on my picture http://forgetomori.com/2010/fortean/do-you-feel-lu...
( without EVER listing my original story link ) .
I also got a few hits from Area 51 which covers links of The Anomalist and others .
So , Forgetomori started off the comments about the picture with an in - depth analysis about haircuts and more - but , it was really only the beginning of the public and blogger analysis of the photo .
Next came this in - depth look at the picture from a site called Ectomo - a paranormal site .
The Ectomo analysis I 'll get to in a moment after noting some of these comments from a forum that also took up the controversial photohttp://www.alien-ufos.com/conspiracy-theories/32149-mohawk-punk-time-traveler-caught-banana-pier-1905-picture.html
- here 's some comments from the actual post and the various websites that carried my post on Barf Stew .
Comments :
1. Is n't that the lead singer for the Clash ...?
Hmmmmm ?
LOL
2. All of you should be ashamed to mock the guy with the big spider on his head .
3 . The barber who was shaving his head at the time was shot through the window , for giving the previous customer a bad haircut , so he could n't finish this dude's ,
4. Not that there was any doubt , but if you look at the original , I do n't think it is a fake , but i also think this guy is just a local with short hair .
It is not really a mohawk as such ....
Great post , I love old photos .
5.I honestly believe that this photo is NOT doctored .
I believe the guy simply has a whitewall haircut .
I can't find an example here , but I feel certain I saw 19th century photos of some Scandinavians with this kind of haircut .
6 . The thing leading me to believe this could be doctored is the oddity that he 's the only one there without a hat and is wearing a different top to anyone else ( short sleeved ) ,
7.Yup ... that 's what his hairstyle looks like ... seen pictures like that before in my northern European great grandmother 's ( something like that ) , old sepia photograph collection of relatives tht my family has ...
Some of those types of hairstyles look like bad day self done hack job haircuts to me ... the poor could n't afford to pay for haircuts ...
It 's also obvious why he has no hat and looks different to the rest ...
He 's one of the hired deckhand and help for the boat and they often never wore hats and dressed quite differently to the ' gentelmen ' in the suits and hats who obviously are the ' paying ' pasengers for the boat ( s ) ..
8. Yeah , Fen .
Many native americans wore Mohawks and the hair style was named after the tribe called the Mohawks .
9. If he wore a legit mohawk ( think liberty spikes ) and like a sex pistols t- shirt then I would think about it
10 . It does n't seem that much out of place really ...
Not really any signs of digital tampering ...
11 . It looks like an ordinary dock worker from his time .
His other suspender is back behind him .
There 's something going on and you can see that the local constable is there in a white shirt .
You can almost see the badge on his shirt ( left pocket ) and he 's wearing a hat that 's different than anyone else , white at that .
I think it 's a tremendous stretch to make such a bold statement concerning this guy in the white undershirt being a time traveler .
Now , if you show me a picture from the past with a cell phone in it , you 'll make a believer of me , not about the possibility of time travel , but that the guy you 're looking at is , indeed , a time traveler .
12 . There is a line of longshoremen , unloading bananas from the cargo hold at the left lower corner of the photo , to the wagon on the pier .
The guy with the exotic haircut is standing right in the middle , waiting for the next stalk of bananas coming from the two guys in front of him .
So he is obviously one of the longshoremen
13 . You ARE kidding , right ?
You DO see that it 's more of " high and tight " , with a fairly full top ; and certainly no " landing strip " of hair on top as with the true Mohawk ?
Also , you DO know that from late in the 19th century until well in the middle of the 20th that it was quite common for Caucasian men , particularly if they had at one time served in the American , British or Western European military , to wear their hair almost to the scalp on the sides and backs , but with their top longer ... sometimes MUCH longer ?
Even if you were goofing here , this kind of intellectual slovenliness just displays the ignorance of your poster .... and how ready other ignorant cretins are to carry on with his work .
14 . You give retarded people a bad name .
He is just a dock worker dressed exactly like the individual behind him to the right .
Such ludicrous supposition only re-enforces my view .
15 . He is unique in at least one fashion , he is virtually the only one the photo not wearing some type of hat .
It 's possible that everyone is wearing the same hairstyle .
More likely that he woke up after a hard night of drinking and could n't find his other suspender .
Kind of a cool picture though .
16 . If you will look at the whole picture there are several men either taking off or putting on shirts , etc .
So the fact the subject does n't have a coat on is not unusual .
Also the other half of his suspender is probably behind his back .
If you look closely at the so - called ' Mohawk ' it looks more like a piece of cloth , though I do n't know why it would be on his head .
Like many professionally taken pictures of this time period this one is extremely sharp and from looking at everything going on and the people that are moving something in their hands I think this is a photo of American - style clothing being given to some new immigrants and this person just happens to be a bit slow about getting his .
No " time - traveller " here , just a very good example of a person not looking at what he is seeing .
17 . Cliff Pickover focused on the out of focus Man With A White
Hat just in front of our subject .
I 'm glad everyone is having fun with this - Shorpy is a great site for real time - travel .
( I sent this to Cliff Pickover too )
18 . Who 's jacket and hat is hanged up against the inner wall of the ship in the bottom right corner ?
Right next to the big bunch of Bananas .
Now , as I said , Ectomo REALLY got into the photo - with analysis like this :
Sensing clicks , a somewhat tongue - in - cheek sequel to the time traveling hipster has surfaced more recently , appropriating a nifty though not that unusual photo from 1905 New York ....... Each of these cases is baffling .
These images are propagating on the internet , a repository not just of a massive chunk of human knowledge , but one where vintage photos are readily available and a steady stream of amusement .
It 's not the vaunted collapse of objective knowledge or authority or the usual arguments that all is lost because the information age decenters " good " information .
It 's not that at all ..... Instead , it is the realization that no matter how well documented the past becomes , no matter how much it is described , photographed , curated in museums , and preserved by heritage laws , it becomes an alien place .
Objects , clothes , people , devices , ideas that we might recognize as not that different , we simply can't believe existed in the past .
The past is foreign territory , and we have become so convinced of this that even a hint of the familiar is jarring because we expect something other .
We instead envision our past in symbolic little chunks .
People in the 1940s have to look like they stepped out of a Rosie the Riveter poster or an episode of Band of Brothers .
The farther back we go , the stronger the symbols must become , passing flapper dresses and bowlers , monocles and sideburns , waistcoats and powdered wigs as we travel through time .
And that 's just the realist perspective , never mind the postmodern fantastical , imagining what ifs and it would have been cools of aether goggles , Nazi necromancers , flying monks , secret societies , Nazca balloons , and so on .
Insert well - read discussion of simulacra and the imagined past here .
... It 's almost as if an inverse law is in effect .
As we gain ever greater ability to see and hold the past , our collective memory getsshorter and shorter until the nostalgia recycling period drops closer and closer to a decade in length , after a few decades we can't recognize what is real , and within a century only our myths and fantasies remain in any meaningful way .

The World Water Council is dominated by two of the world ’s largest private water corporations Suez and Veolia .
They have promoted policies of Public - Private Partnerships ( PPP ’s ) that put water services under private ownership usually resulting in price hikes and decreased pollution control .

Since Obama 's victory in November , Smith and Wesson and Ruger , the only two publically traded US gun makers , have experienced major increases in their stock prices .
Ammo manufacturers are running 24/7 attempting to keep up with demand .
Military - pattern semi-automatic rifles , including AR - 15's and AK - clones are expensive , stocked - out , or both .
Are these price increases " gouging , " as some would say , or are they a natural response to the forces of supply and demand ?
If these prices are elevated over normal conditions , will they continue to soar upwards ?
To both questions I say , " No , there is no gouging , prices will probably fall in the future . "
Ruger and S&W share prices from Election Day to the present :
Since mid-late 2008 , the gun market has bifurcated into two separate and distinct segments .
Understanding the difference is very important .
Historically , hunting rifles and sporting shotguns have made up the lion ’s share of civilian gun sales .
Smith and Wesson ( SWHC ) attempted to capitalize on this trend in 2007 by purchasing Thompson / Center arms ( a niche upscale maker of muzzleloaders and single shot hunting rifles ) and importing a line of high - end Turkish shotguns and rebranding them as S&W .
Unfortunately , their timing was proven to be pretty bad .
Since the stock market fell into freefall last October , sales of hunting rifles , sporting shotguns , and accessories for the like have fallen off dramatically .
Hard numbers are difficult to come by , but speaking to dealers at the 2009 SHOT ( Shooting Hunting Outdoor Trade )
Show , sales have fallen dramatically .
Hunting as a segment is shrinking , and rifles are a long - lived asset .
So hunting rifle demand has cratered .
Now , onto the " booming " segment of the gun market .
Three sub-divisions are worth highlighting :
Semi-automatic handguns and accessories ( magazines mostly ) Military - pattern semi-automatic rifles ( AR - 15 ’s , AK - clones , etc. ) and accessories ( magazines and parts ) Ammunition and ammunition components
Since it became likely that Obama was going to win the election , groups like the NRA and GOA ( Gun Owners of America ) have been highlighting past statements by Obama and his Attorney General , Eric Holder , suggesting that while in office he would ban and regulate guns much more severely than previous administrations .
Highlighted proposals include : A 500 % ammo tax , a ban on all military - pattern rifles , a ban on magazines with a greater than ten round capacity , federally licensing all gun owners and registering their guns .
As a result , gun shows , ranges , military bases , shooting matches , online forums , etc. , have been a cacophony of people fueling the fear of an upcoming ban .
Gun owners , who have never seen , much less held a military - pattern rifle , are going out and purchasing $ 1200 AR - 15 ’s , a pile of 30 - round magazines , and cases of 5.56 mm ammo .
Gun owners that already own such a rifle are going out and purchasing all the military pattern rifles they think they will EVER want / need .
The presumption , of course , is that the ban will be similar to the federal Assault Weapon Ban of 1994 or the California ban of 2000 that grandfathered all preexisting guns .
The AWB of 1994 in particular , because transfer after the ban was legal , caused prices for grandfathered guns to double or triple over their post - ban counterparts .
S&W was smart to introduce the M&P line of pistols and rifles , which have been selling VERY well since November .
Ammo prices from 20032007 tracked the run up in the price of lead , copper , and brass .
Following the major correction of lead , copper , and zinc prices in 2008 , one might have assumed that ammo prices would have fallen as well .
Wrong .
Instead , ammo prices have soared even higher .
Last year , Q3131 ( Winchester 's standard 5.56 mm commercial ammo ) could be found as cheaply as 28 cents per round .
Now prices have risen to roughly 50 cents per round .
Other military calibers , 9×19 , 7.62×51 NATO , 7.62×39 , 5.45×39 , have also increased substantially , some having doubled or tripled in price .
Pistol ammo , while not affected to the same extent of rifle ammo , has all but vanished from the shelves of almost every major retailer in South Florida .
Primers ( one of the key requirements to manufacture ammo ) have increased in price by about 50 % , and their availability has also declined .
The questions I have :
Are these trends sustainable ?
When will these markets return to normal ?
To answer these with certainty , I would need a crystal ball regarding policy in the Obama administration .
I could definitely be wrong on this , but given the continuing economic catastrophe , gun control is probably the last thing on Obama ’s mind .
The Democrats have not forgotten 1994 , the year they were thrown out of office for voting yes on the Assault Weapon Ban .
Also , in 1994 , gun ownership was very different than in 2009 .
In 1994 , it was MUCH easier for the politicians to split the gun owners down the middle into “ hunters and sportsmen , ” who owned bolt - action rifles and skeet guns , and “ gun nuts ” who owned “ crazy assault weapons . "
The latter group was small and easily marginalized .
Eric Holder , the new Attorney General , has stated on several occasions his desire to enact draconian new gun control laws .
Nancy Pelosi , on the other hand has shot down the idea , for now .
These days , the two groups are considerably more mixed .
The AR15 ( the civilian version of the M16 ) is the dominant rifle in ALL forms of rifle competition outside of some niche sports ( benchrest , biathlon , etc. ) .
Remington , the hunting rifle maker ( owned by Cerberus Capital ) , has rebranded Bushmaster ( another Cerberus portfolio company ) AR - 15 ’s as hunting rifles .
These days , the AR - 15 , far from being the choice of militia members and wingnuts , has become the best selling rifle in America for hunting , self - defense , competition , and general collecting .
So trying to outlaw them would be political suicide for politicians from either party .
Also , the Supreme Court has stated in the 2008 Heller decision that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms , so even if a ban were enacted , it would be unlikely to hold , in my opinion .
Clayton Cramer is probably one of the best equipped to discuss the jurisprudence on the matter , but the wording of the Heller opinion makes a ban on rifles that are common and not unusually dangerous unlikely to stand up .
If we assume that there is no second assault weapon ban , where does that fact get us ?
Well , let 's look at the microeconomics of supply .
Many start - ups , consisting of little more than a couple of machinists and a CNC mill have begun cranking out serialized rifle components .
Many have bought expensive and unique tooling ; those people are going to want to stay in the business until the price of parts falls below marginal cost .
While I do n’t have precise estimates on costs , I do know that AR - 15 lower receiver forgings can be purchased for $ 35 dollars and the finished product sold in 2005 for $ 90 dollars and now sells for $ 175300 dollars .
To me , this suggests that prices may have a long way to fall to a new equilibrium .
Regarding ammo , supply has n’t responded as quickly .
Ammo production is a capital - intensive business and the supply of newly manufactured ammo competes with foreign ammo and foreign military surplus .
Supplies of foreign military surplus ammo seem to be drying up .
In addition , most ammo companies are running 24/7 to meet demand for military contracts .
There are some signs supply might be increasing : Black Hills ( a prominent producer of match ammo ) has bought a 65,000SF facility to triple capacity .
Handguns are considerably more differentiated than military - pattern rifles .
No significant startups can be expected to enter because of the present high demand .
The big names , S&W , Ruger , Glock , Sig , etc. do n’t seem to be dramatically adding capacity , as they probably expect the bump in demand to be temporary .
What about demand for all these products ?
I think this will be crucial .
Can gun-ban anxiety panic shopping be sustained for four ( or maybe eight years ) ?
No , and I think we ’re beginning to see signs of cracking .
Having spoken to gun owners , gun dealers , gun show exhibitors , and other people in this industry , I find that the undercurrent of what people are beginning to say is , “ Okay , I have what I need . ”
For a gun owner of modest means , that means an AR - 15 , 10 magazines , a quality handgun , 10 magazines , and a few thousand rounds of ammo for each .
A key point to remember is the backdrop of this is still the ongoing depression ; consumers are cutting back , de-levering , selling their knickknacks .
When people fear losing their job , $ 450 dollars for a case of military surplus 5.56 mm becomes substantially less attractive , especially when it sold for $ 125 just a few years ago .
Most consumers will likely build their stockpile , and if they lose their job , be forced to divest some of it to make ends meet .
For the change in ammo demand to be sustainable , gun owners would have to be shooting thousands of rounds per month , which aside from a few thousand competitive shooters , is unlikely .
Military demand for ammo has been consuming the majority of domestically produced military caliber ammo .
Currently , Olin , Prvi Partisan , IMI , Black Hills , and several other companies are producing flat out to meet military demand .
As military contracts get priority , this has squeezed supplies to the civilian market .
Is this sustainable ?
Possibly , but unless Obama is planning on invading Pakistan , demand should fall as we disengage from Iraq .
However , if Obama proves to be a hawk , this trend could continue .
Based on the preceding , I think that increasing supply and decreasing demand will alleviate the scarcity and reduce the price of most military pattern weapons and ammo .
However , there are risks that events could complicate this analysis .
The most obvious possibility is that a ban DOES come into effect .
But again , this would likely cause a temporary hyperbolic rise in market prices , but a permanent curtailment of demand for the products of S&W , Ruger , Bushmaster , DPMS , Remington , etc .
Another possibility is that the increased attention to guns due to crime and Obama represent a secular shift in the attitude of the public .
Indeed , there are signs of this .
Florida has a backlog of 93,000 citizens applying for concealed carry permits .
Tennessee has also experienced soaring gun purchases and permit applications .
Concealed carry permit holders tend to differ from hunters in their consumption patterns .
Hunters tend to buy bolt - action rifles , concealed carry permit holders purchase small handguns .
Concealed carry permit holders also tend to purchase “ tactical ” training and equipment ( rifles , shotguns , etc ) .
Concealed carry permit holders also tend to be more politically active than hunters .
Once this “ new batch ” of gun owners is armed , their demand for guns will fall along with their demand for fancy cars , RV’s , vacations , and other consumer discretionary purchases .
I believe I have laid out a case that suggests that the torrid boom in the gun industry may be a frictional blip in response to the Obama election , similar to IT spending in preparation for Y2K .
Eventually , however , increasing supply and decreasing demand will put downward pressure on prices and backlogs .

Starbreeze working on new Syndicate title for EA Collaboration on ' Project Redlime ' is update to classic cyberpunk franchise

Starbreeze Studios is working with Electronic Arts on a new title in the Syndicate series , sources have confirmed to GamesIndustry .biz .
The studio , already responsible for critical hits The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness , has been working with EA since August 2007 on the title , before confirming a collaboration in February last year .
The game has had a working title of Project Redlime , and is due for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PC .
However , the game is n't likely to see release until work is completed on Starbreeze 's other collaboration with EA , for a new game based on Robert Ludlum 's Jason Bourne character .
Syndicate 's cyberpunk future first appeared in 1993 and was developed by Bullfrog Productions , a company co-founded by Peter Molyneux .
Bullfrog was later acquired by Electronic Arts .
EA has not responded to requests for comment .
How to Really Hit Back at Wall Street Editor ’s Note : Americans are understandably outraged over Wall Street ’s refusal to accept that its days of wine , roses , pricy - commodes , multi-million - dollar bonuses , extravagant parties , ultra - exclusive vacations , et cetera must finally end .
In this guest essay , former congressional staffer Brent Budowsky suggests that the old ways of Wall Street banks greasing the palms of Washington politicians must end , too – and that it may be time to rehabilitate “ Wall Street sheriff ” Eliot Spitzer :
Let ’s ban political contributions to any candidate , of any party , for any office by any company that receives bailout money , until the money is paid back in full .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Taxpayer money should not be used to pay for political donations designed to influence how the taxpayer money is spent .
It is ridiculous for political leaders to take political campaign donations with one hand while they hand out taxpayer dollars to the donors with the other .
And let ’s bring back Eliot Spitzer to a position in the government involving reform of our financial system .
Sure , Spitzer made a whopper of a mistake .
But on the great issue of today and tomorrow , fixing the problems of our financial system , the world should have listened to Eliot Spitzer .
He was brilliant , he was visionary , he was ahead of his time , and he was damned right .
Enough of these lame pseudo - reforms that keep good people out of government but do virtually nothing to reform the system — and , in some cases , make the system worse .
Want a reform that will have immediate impact ?
Ban political contributions from companies that receive bailout money until the money is paid back .
I suspect the Supreme Court will find this a constitutional limit on how federal aid is spent .
But just in case , here is Plan B : Elected officials can state today that with or without a new law , they will not accept campaign money from bailed - out firms .
The very idea that taxpayer money would be so abused — i.e. , by using it to influence the terms of distribution of taxpayer money — is absurd .
The very idea that last year , as it was first being bailed out , AIG was dishing out the dough , while negotiations for the bailout were under way , to Obama , to McCain and to leading members of both parties in Congress , is totally ridiculous .
Let me emphasize that if this ban goes into effect , every company should have every right to lobby every day .
The problem is not the lobbying .
Lobbying with information and perspective is valuable , including from Wall Street and banks .
The problem is the money , the buying and selling of influence and ( let ’s be honest ) the buying and selling of votes .
Let ’s break the money link .
Let ’s enact the one reform that really matters .
Regarding Eliot Spitzer , I think everyone deserves a pass for one huge blunder .
Including Spitzer .
And for any Republicans who may object , including a certain sitting Republican senator with a similar problem , let ’s give him a pass , too , and let the voters of his state decide .
Spitzer was light years ahead of his time , and for being right , he was demeaned and ridiculed and attacked by many on Wall Street .
He was attacked , too , by their shills in the media , including the network that Jon Stewart so brilliantly dissected , which demeaned Spitzer by the hour , not for the problem that led to his removal , but for his attempts to reform the markets and reveal wrongdoing .
In terms of knowledge , understanding , grasp of the issues and the guts to fight for average Americans , Eliot Spitzer is the man , and should be brought back into government to help fix the financial system he presciently warned about when almost all others went along with what was so disastrously wrong .

My last column was all about the culture of Microsoft and how it makes real change difficult for the company .
It ’s not just at Microsoft that these things happen , by the way : nearly all mature organizations get into similar ruts .
And if , like Microsoft , they are spectacularly profitable ruts , well then it is n’t surprising that things stay more or less permanently dysfunctional .
I said last time that a second column would follow with my specific suggestions for restructuring Microsoft , but now that I am really into it I think we might be looking at a total of three columns , not two .
But then I ’ll be finished with Microsoft for a few months .
Setting out to rebuild Microsoft for the next 30 years it is tempting simply to throw away the parts of the company that do n’t make money , which is to say almost everything except Windows , Office , and MAYBE the xBox .
Most parts of Microsoft lose money .
But those parts that are profitable are SO profitable that they more than make up for all the losers , as I have explained ad nauseum before .
The part of Microsoft that it would initially make sense to dump is easy — everything related to MSN , including MSNBC , the MSN home page , and the many MSN websites .
Even though some MSN sites are relatively successful , such as MSN Money , Microsoft should never have gone into the content business and stayed there so long .
It ’s not Microsoft ’s core business , and MSN has cost the company billions of dollars over the years .
But I said it would INITIALLY make sense to dump MSN , not that I still believe that completely .
After all , was n’t it MSN that Microsoft intended to augment by attempting to buy Yahoo for $ 44 billion ?
How could Microsoft be so stupid to throw another $ 44 billion into a toilet that already contained close to $ 10 billion in cumulative MSN losses over the years ?
Yet CEO Steve Ballmer seemed very intent on doing just that .
The arguments for dumping MSN are that it never made money and never felt like the rest of Microsoft .
The arguments for keeping MSN are that in many ways it is the future of PC technology and Yahoo has shown it is possible to make a pretty good living in the content business .
Just because MSN has n’t made money does n’t mean MSN COULDN ’T have made money if that was an important goal .
One could argue , in fact , that someday the Windows and Office franchises will start to fade so Microsoft needs to learn how to build new and successful lines of business .
Yes MSN , so far , has been a failure .
It is a management failure and to be successful well into the future , Microsoft needs to fix this problem .
Yet there is big money still to be made online as Google and Yahoo have shown and it is something Microsoft should somehow do .
Microsoft needs several new lines of business that can each generate billions in profits .
“ Online ” has the potential to do that .
There are big bucks to be made there and Microsoft needs to be in the game .
The problem , though , is that the folks in Redmond do n’t know how to build an online business , which is a big reason why they wanted to buy Yahoo .
Ballmer suggested , remember , that Yahoo ’s DNA , not MSN ’s would be perpetuated in the combined online business .
This is a nice argument , but who can believe that Microsoft would spend $ 44 billion and then not take an active and probably destructive role in managing that business ?
I can’t .
Worse still , it can be argued Yahoo has forgotten how to manage an online business , too , for reasons I have written about in the past .
But Microsoft was willing to take that risk , or so they said .
There was a good foundation for an online business at Yahoo and it could be obtained at a bargain basement price .
Only it would n’t work .
Microsoft would meddle and screw it up while Yahoo might just as easily self - destruct .
The only answer to optimizing the online operations of both companies , then , would be for YAHOO TO BUY MSN .
This actually makes some sense in a weird way .
The only way to keep Microsoft from screwing - up Yahoo is by making Microsoft a minority partner in the operation .
The only way to push Yahoo management into being less boneheaded in its own way is by having a demanding minority owner .
And you can be sure Ballmer would be demanding .
Let ’s put a value of MSN at $ 10 billion giving the combined companies a worth of $ 29 billion and Microsoft a 34 percent ownership of Yahoo , perhaps with warrants to buy the rest at some later date under certain conditions .
Yahoo , for all its problems , knows how to make money on the Internet .
It could use Hotmail and other parts of MSN to increase economies of scale and become even more successful .
Yahoo still would n’t defeat Google but it would be a much stronger number two and even number one in certain areas .
Because Microsoft could n’t control Yahoo it could n’t impose Microsoft culture on it .
Because Microsoft was a big enough minority owner , it COULD push Yahoo into being more logical , less emotional , and probably more profitable – something Microsoft could never force MSN to do itself .
And Microsoft , suddenly unburdened by MSN losses would look better to Wall Street , which would appreciate , too , any option to recapture Yahoo at a later date , but only if it made sense then to do so .
Unlike Microsoft buying Yahoo or even
Yahoo remaining completely independent as it is now , this plan actually makes some sense , at least to me .
But then you know me …
Next column we ’ll deal with the rest of Microsoft , chopping those 20,000 to 50,000 heads .
New Kindle ?
A few hours from when I ’m writing this Amazon will reportedly introduce the second - generation Kindle ebook reader .
A lot of money has been lost on ebooks over the years and I have my doubts that the Kindle is yet profitable .
Still , if any company can make a go of eBooks it is probably Amazon .
As for what ’s in the new Kindle I ’ll take a chance and guess right here .
It will be thinner , have a better user interface and probably a touch screen of sorts .
Also I shot some interviews last year at E - Ink near Boston and got some idea of where that technology , which is used in the Kindle , is headed .
Last spring I saw full color video running on an E - Ink display , so I ’m guessing that will be a part of the next Kindle , too .
But that ’s as far as my guessing goes .
Update – The Kindle 2 has now been announced .
As predicted it is lighter , thinner , and faster , but it does n’t have a color screen — 16 - level grayscale instead .
That color model must be the Kindle 3 .
– Bob
All Bob All the Time !
Now some news about me .
Sometime this spring I will start a weekly online video show in cooperation with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California .
Think of this as a follow on and an improvement to NerdTV .
It will be 52 weeks per year and unlike anything you ’ve seen to date on the Internet , even from me .
This spring I will also start writing a blog about the global financial crisis with my friend of 25 years Adam Smith , author of The Money Game , Super Money , Paper Money , etc. and for 14 years the managing editor of Adam Smith ’s Money World on PBS .
I ’m definitely the junior partner in this operation , which will be done as a co-production with a major New York publisher .
My reasons for mentioning these two projects are entirely self - serving : we need sponsors .
If we can bring in a launch advertiser for the blog , especially , we can grandfather that arrangement at a lower CPM before the New York guys get a chance to mess with it .
So give me a call if you or your company are seriously interested .

But the real question : Will Westboro picket the planet 's funeral ?
by Jeremy Hooper
The world 's about to end .
America 's excitement about having an intelligent man in office is the main indicator of our impending doom .
Oh , and said intelligent man is the anti-Christ , working in unison with Satan and the Pope to dupe this planet 's inhabitants ( all expect for one oh - so - insightful church ) into embracing their own destruction .
So says Westboro Baptist , a body of people who , ironically , have themselves been led by one fiery orator into adopting thoroughly wacky views on humanity :
(** Warning : Disturbing photos in first video )
(** Warning : Disturbing justification of Fred Phelps 's aforementioned wacky views can be found throughout )
Paid for by Palin / Jindal 2012 .
Just kidding .
We think .
Your thoughts
Holy ass crap Fred !
If you pulled your head out of your butt long enough for some fresh air you might think a little more rationaly .
You are so angry , that I can only believe that there is one very nasty drag queen trying to get out of you .
Posted by : Jim Casella | Feb 3 , 2009 7:37:24 PM
Anyone who dares to stray from the strictest interpretation from the Bible is spitting in the face of God , Jesus , and / or the Holy Ghost ?
Freddy , you and your followers are full of it .
Thank you for turning a religion based on understanding , love , and forgiveness into a noxious poisonous ( please note my sarcasm ) .

These people obviously have really serious mental health issues and would probably best be ignored entirely .
My point is that if no one reported on them - they 'd loose a whole lot of publicity .
Why do we really care so much WHAT these whack jobs think ?

How does this man continue to ramble on like this ?
There 's this disturbing giddiness in their eyes .
It 's as they 're daring people to hate them because they know that 's where their real power and satisfaction comes from .

Part of activism on behalf of the Queer community is understanding the different communities it consists of , and we can be better advocates for other minorities by being educated and going out and seeking to educate others .
Asexuality is often misunderstood but it does in fact lie on the sexual continuum .
Asexuals simply put do not experience sexual attraction .
Like sexuality itself many people do not identify as strictly heterosexual or homosexual but line up on the continuum somewhere in between the Kinsey scale .
( Homosexual ) -------------------( Bisexual )-----------------( Heterosexual )
Some asexual 's have some desire for aspects of sexuality while others have no desire to engage in intercourse .
( Asexual ) ----------( Some degree of sexuality ) ---------( Sexually driven )
Asexuality is different from sexual dysfunction because Asexual 's are healthy and sexually functioning people without the sexual drive .
Asexuality is also different from celibacy because abstinent individuals desire sex but choose not to engage for various reasons , whereas the asexual person has no desire for sex at all .
So Asexuals just want to be alone ?
Many asexuals enjoy romantic encounters and are happily partnered , one can be involved and in love without having sex .
They enjoy one anothers company and enjoy physical contact , showing affection for one another through kissing , holding hands , and being romantic without needing intercourse .
On the other hand like some sexual people , some people do not feel the need to be in a relationship and prefer the single life .
Why do n't they change ?
Asexuals do not need to change , that is the way they were created .
People cannot change their sexual orientation and asexuals cannot help the way they are .
Asexuals do not feel depressed about their lack of sexuality , it is n't a component of their life and therefore they do not feel they are missing anything .
How many people are Asexual ?
It is hard to estimate how much of the population is Asexual , either because people are unaware they are asexual , or do not come out with this information .
A recent study in the U.K. determined up to 1 % of the population self identified as asexual .
With more education and outreach , more people are classifying themselves as asexuals .

One of my goals with Modern Perl is to improve the entire Perl ecosystem for both Perl 5 and Perl 6 such that everyone can take advantage of all of the wonderful improvements already provided and yet to come .
First , we have to convince people that that 's possible .
In Sacrificing the Future on the Past 's Golden Altar I mentioned that Perl 5's deprecation policy has harmed Perl 5 over the past decade , if not longer .
Several people asked me for a better alternative .
It 's no coincidence that I 've worked on Parrot for the past several years .
At the most recent Parrot Developer Summit last December , we discussed our support policy for Parrot as we near the Parrot 1.0 release .
I 've just finished writing the initial version of Parrot 's release , support , and deprecation policies .
( I apologize that it 's in raw POD form ; we 'll add it to the website soon . )
I do n't want to get into too many details about deprecation and support , nor how aggressive the Parrot schedule is for the foreseeable future , but I do want to explain some of the reasoning .
It 's important for all projects , not just large and , we hope , successful community - developed projects .
I believe strongly that the best way to invent the future is to iterate on a theme .
That 's part of the reason I write these posts -- I 'm trying out new ideas on a growing audience of smart , dedicated , and committed readers who rarely hesitate to challenge my underthought assumptions or ask for clarity when I 've been obtuse .
The same principle goes for software .
If you know exactly how to solve a problem before you 've written any code , it 's worthless to solve the problem yourself .
Re-use existing code , then spend your time and resources on something that matters more .
If you do n't know exactly how to solve a problem , you 're unlikely to find the best solution on your first attempt .
That may be fine .
Your first attempt may be good enough .
If so , great !
The problem starts in so many cases where the first attempt is n't perfect and needs further work .
We call this debugging .
Usually it 's also a design problem .
Two complementary schools of thought address this problem from different approaches .
The agile movement suggests that working in very small steps and solving small pieces of larger problems in isolation helps you avoid thrashing and rework and all of the organizational problems you have when you 're trying to solve very large and very complex problems .
The refactoring school suggests that very focused and reversable changes to the organization of code and entities within the code make it easier to write good code in the future .
It 's possible to have one without the other , but they build on each other .
The allure of both approaches is that they promise to free you from the golden chains of " I Must Get This Completely Right The First Time . "
You do n't .
You do have a minimum standard of quality and efficacy , and it 's important to meet those goals , but they make change less risky and even cheap .
I did n't say that practicing either one is easy or simple , just that I know of no better way to reduce the risk of mistakes .
If they 're small and easy to detect and easy to fix , you do n't have to worry about making them .
Of course , this only matters if you 're going to change your software in the future .
If you write a program and run it and you do n't need it in ten minutes , none of this matters .
If you write a program and install it on a machine and it can run for the next year or ten years untouched , none of this matters .
The cost of change is irrelevant for software that never changes .
Most of us rarely have the luxury of writing software that never changes .
Perhaps there 's a common illusion that people who write software for other coders to reuse in their projects -- whether languages , libraries , platforms , or tools -- should meet a standard higher than most other projects .
To some degree it 's true .
Many projects which get widely used attract better developers and development strategies .
Many do n't .
Yet I do n't believe there is a general solution to the problem that we do n't get code and design right on our first try .
We make mistakes designing languages and libraries .
We make mistakes implementing platforms and tools .
Sometimes the best we can do to make things righter is to make an incompatible change .
As long as our code gets easier to use and maintain over time , I can live with that .
The question is n't " Should a project make backwards - incompatible changes ? "
( The question very much is n't " Should a project do so gratuitiously ? " , so if you want to argue that point , please do so elsewhere .
The real question is " How do you do make incompatible changes when necessary without hurting your users ? "
I 'll discuss some ideas next time .

Today , the Obama administration took another step towards disabling the wall of secrecy around the government that George W. Bush put into place , by directing agencies to handle information requests with a presumption of openness , unlike Bush who created new policies to deny requests .
Attorney General Eric
Holder said , “ By restoring the presumption of disclosure that is at the heart of the Freedom of Information Act , we are making a critical change that will restore the public ’s ability to access information in a timely manner .
The American people have the right to information about their government ’s activities , and these new guidelines will ensure they are able to obtain that information under principles of openness and transparency . ”
The Attorney General also changed the standard for defending a denial of an FOIA request .
Under the Bush administration , an information request could be denied by an agency and defended by the Justice Department if there was “ sound legal reasoning ” behind the denial .
The new standard is that a denial will only be defended if “ an agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the statutory exemptions , or disclosure is prohibited by law . ”
In other words only those denials that do n’t fall under the FOIA or are illegal requests will be defended .
Advertisements
The Bush administration not only changed the standard for denials , but also eliminated an ombudsman position that was supposed to be monitoring agency compliance with FOIA requests .
Oh , it gets even better .
The Bush administration also created another category of information that did n’t have to be shared under FOIA , called sensitive but unclassified The Bush administration used this category to deny FOIA requests .
Neither the Bush administration ’s behavior , nor the repudiation of it by the Obama administration is a surprise , but it is reassuring to know that if you request information from the government , the new administration will not be looking for ways to deny your request .
This is policy change is an example of the difference between an administration that only thought the people needed to know what they told them , and an administration which believes that people have a right to know .
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer likens economy to depressions of 1837 , 1873 , and 1929
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer sketched a dire portrait of the world economy on Friday , likening it to market conditions in 1837 , 1873 , and 1929 , each of which involved bank failures , high unemployment , and a depression .
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime economic crisis , " Ballmer told a retreat of House Democrats in Williamsburg , Va .
" There is a lot of history around that , and frankly if you stop and think about it , 1837 , 1873 , 1929 , 2008 , it 's almost exactly a whole lifetime between each of the major economic difficulties that we face . "
Ballmer said that economic growth in the last 25 years was fueled by innovation , globalization , and debt -- and that the current levels of debt were unsustainable .
" In 1929 , for example , just before the stock market crash , the private debt - to - GDP ratio was 160 percent , " he said .
" Last year , private sector debt as a percentage of the GDP : 300 percent , far more leverage . "
His warning of a protracted downturn that could become a depression comes amid a stock market that is down by more than 40 percent from its October 2007 peak , and housing prices in many metro areas that have been falling consistently since July 2006 - - a feat not equalled since the Great Depression .
" In my view , what we now have will be a fundamental economic reset , " he said .
" The economy is going to have to re-establish itself at a level of spending that reflects the real value of underlying assets before we can all start growing again at a healthy rate . "
富不过三代 ( fu bu guo san dai )
Meaning :
It 's rare the wealth of a family can last for three generations ( the 2nd may see the value of hard work , the 3rd , forget it ) .
[ Mish Note :
The following example is based in the South African currency of the Rand , but that does not detract from the message . ]
Year zero : First generation : Wealth creation
Starting capital : Zero .
The family income generators ( 2 parents ) are hard - working and manage to invest 10 % of their after - tax income equating to R30 / month into the South African stock market .
( Yes , this was pre-Union , but we did say " equating to " ) .
Remember this is the sixties and an income of R300 is a very decent monthly wage .
Year 45 : Second generation : Wealth preservation
The parents ensured that their three children did n't have to experience hard times .
The children attended decent enough schools and were fortunate enough to mix with similarly privileged friends .
There is general unease in the family however , as the second generation gain independence .
The pressures of wanting to keep up with the lifestyles of their wealthier friends , coupled with an unfortunate down - turn in the economy , results in a halt in savings and as a result the R10.5 m family wealth no longer enjoys any debit order increases .
In addition , the capital base is required to maintain an income for the folks who have now retired .
Year 75 : Third generation : Wealth destruction
The second generation finally inherit the family wealth and it is split three ways .
By this time the R45,000 / month comfortable family living has ballooned to R600,000 / month as a result of inflation .
Each family now only enjoys income from a capital base of R110 m and , because they themselves are approaching retirement they opt to de-risk their portfolios , which results in the capital invested unfortunately realising a more sedate 3 % real rate of return .
After a torturous revelation later on in life , one of the 3rd generation children decided to carve out a career as a financial advisor .
She made the following insightful observations :
1 . Her grandparents did a fantastic job of consistently placing 10 % of their monthly income into an equity investment over a 45 year period .
2 . As they had generated sufficient capital to live off the dividend income there from , her grandparents had stuck with their equity investment throughout their retirement .
3 . Unfortunately , her parents had failed to adopt a savings ethic and they had relied optimistically on their inheritances to generate their own retirement income .
4 . The 3rd generation children ( herself included ) failed to comprehend the importance of generating an income and as a result were unable to adopt a savings plan or meet their own costs .
Time to start again .
The Role Of Attitudes
" Planet Forward " Takes Your Ideas on Energy to Television and the White House
March 23rd , 2009 by Frank Sesno
Editor ’s Note :
This post is a guest contribution by Frank Sesno , Emmy - award winning journalist and former CNN Washington Bureau Chief .
“ Planet Forward ” is an innovative , viewer - driven program driven by the power of ideas , as citizens make their case for what they think about the nation ’s energy future .
The show debuts on the web first and then moves to television , in a primetime PBS special on April 15th .
[ social_buttons ]
I ’ve been in the media for a long time .
I know the power we have to reach and to teach .
We can take people places they ’ve never been , show them wonders – and horrors – to inform or motivate .
Good , important stuff .
Of course we also drive people crazy .
Critics shout that too many in the media are too removed , too insular , too quick to talk and too slow to listen .
Too much is dumbed down or shouted out .
So when we created Planet Forward , we wanted to do something different .
We wanted to take this huge issue facing us — how we move to a sustainable , 21st century approach to the energy we use – and explore it in a way that is open , inclusive , creative and smart .
We wanted to combine the power of the internet and the reach of television to bring together citizens , experts and decision - makers in a place where imagination and ideas would prevail .
Sure , serious business — but also spontaneous and fun and unexpected .
Planet Forward starts online and works its way over to television .
We invite people to submit a video , an essay , a photo spread , whatever works .
We say show us your ideas , your invention or what your community ’s working on .
Share your research .
Talk technology .

While I have not changed my beliefs on the illegal , immoral policies and actions of the state , somehow , in the past few months , I have , in the opinion of some readers , changed political affiliations .
When I was writing of the illegal wars of the warfare / welfare state , I was often asked to leave the country , called a traitor , a coward , and accused of being a commie liberal .
Now , since I have attacked the illegal , immoral actions of the welfare / warfare Obama administration regarding the Second Amendment , I am accused of being a fascist and questioned as to why I supported Bush and his torture of " enemy combatants , " and the Patriot Act .
To many Americans , calling the state on its many crimes when their chosen candidate / party is in power automatically places one in the enemy camp .
Freedom , liberty and the Constitution have been swept away in the flood of party politics .
Nowhere is the folly of allowing party politics to frame the debate on freedom better illustrated than in Lew Rockwell ’s newest , The Left , The Right , and the State .
The belief that an answer to the problems now facing this country can / will be found in Washington , D.C. is totally insane .
Washington is the home of criminals , those who rob with a gun , and those who rob with unconstitutional laws and regulations .
Begging / lobbying either to change their ways is madness .
At least , the criminal who robs with a gun does not claim to be a public servant and doing so " for the children . "
It is my belief , our last chance at subverting the criminality occurring within the federal apparatus known as the federal government is the reclaiming of the rights of the people and the repudiation of overreaching federal tyranny as defined in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution .
This movement , which is now gaining a foothold in many states , is referred to as the State Sovereignty Movement .
Oklahoma State Representative , Charles Key authored HJR 1003 , which passed the Oklahoma State House by the vote of 83 - 13 on February 19th .
The following is the official summary from that piece of legislation ,
" A Joint Resolution claiming sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over certain powers ; serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates ; providing that certain federal legislation be prohibited or repealed ; and directing distribution . "
New Hampshire has introduced similar legislation , HCR6 , based in part on Thomas Jefferson ’s Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , according to NH State Representative , Daniel Itse .
Itse can be seen here being interviewed about this legislation by Glenn Beck .
Refreshing is it not to hear an elected official say he does not have an office , but does have a " drawer . "
How much better off we would be if that were true of all politicians .
Perhaps that is one of the reasons state legislators are more responsive to the people in their quest for liberty than those who inhabit the black hole where freedom goes to die inside the Beltway .
At least 20 states now have some form of state sovereignty bill , either introduced , or in the process of being introduced at this time .
It is imperative that we , as citizens of our states , become involved in promoting similar legislation .
If our state is not presently considering such a stand , we must encourage the proposal of state sovereignty legislation and support state legislators who have the courage to introduce / support constitutional legislation and stand behind the 9th and 10th Amendments .
It is totally delusional to believe the DC crowd will ever again be responsive to the will of the people .
Now would be the perfect time for organizations such as the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) and Gun Owners of America ( GOA ) to cease all support for national politicians and direct their monies and efforts towards passage of these State Sovereignty pieces of legislation .
If they refuse to do so , we should take that as an indicator of their actual motives concerning our 2A rights and their hidden allegiance to those who seek to disarm the people .
Both organizations have actively supported politicians who have declared by word and action their opposition to our God - given rights defined in our Constitution .
Bush and McCain certainly come to mind as two that have recently received their support .
It is imperative we understand , just because a large number of states pass this legislation , the government will still , most likely refuse to honor the wishes of the people to cease and desist the efforts to rob us of our liberty and our money .
A quick look at the atrocities Lincoln visited on the South will illustrate what we can expect from those in DC when we re-claim our constitutional rights and move to de-fund the monster .
I highly recommend Professor DiLorenzo ’s works on Lincoln and his illegal war , along with , When in the Course of Human Events : Arguing the Case for Southern Secession by Charles Adams .
Both authors totally debunk the popular theory that the unconstitutional war that claimed the lives of over 600,000 Americans and was instrumental in the polarization of the black and white races was fought over the issue of slavery .
If there still exists a political solution to the problems we the people presently face , this could be our last hope .
If a majority of the states were to pass such legislation , we would send a very clear message that the American people have awakened and intend to seek redress of their grievances with the out of control federal bureaucracy .

Mental abilities decline at a relatively young age , experts suspect Mental powers start to dwindle at 27 after peaking at 22 , marking the start of old age , US research suggests .
Professor Timothy Salthouse of the University of Virginia found reasoning , spatial visualisation and speed of thought all decline in our late 20s .
Therapies designed to stall or reverse the ageing process may need to start much earlier , he said .
His seven - year study of 2,000 healthy people aged 18 - 60 is published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging .
To test mental agility , the study participants had to solve puzzles , recall words and story details and spot patterns in letters and symbols .
The natural decline of some of our mental abilities as we age starts much earlier than some of us might expect
Rebecca Wood of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust
The same tests are already used by doctors to spot signs of dementia .
In nine out of 12 tests the average age at which the top performance was achieved was 22 .
The first age at which there was any marked decline was at 27 in tests of brain speed , reasoning and visual puzzle - solving ability .
Things like memory stayed intact until the age of 37 , on average , while abilities based on accumulated knowledge , such as performance on tests of vocabulary or general information , increased until the age of 60 .
Professor Salthouse said his findings suggested " some aspects of age - related cognitive decline begin in healthy , educated adults when they are in their 20s and 30s . "
Rebecca Wood of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust agreed , saying : " This research suggests that the natural decline of some of our mental abilities as we age starts much earlier than some of us might expect - in our 20s and 30s .
" Understanding more about how healthy brains decline could help us understand what goes wrong in serious diseases like Alzheimer's .
" Alzheimer 's is not a natural part of getting old ; it is a physical disease that kills brain cells , affecting tens of thousands of under 65s too .
" Much more research is urgently needed if we are to offer hope to the 700,000 people in the UK who live with dementia , a currently incurable condition . "

Quantum mechanics and general relativity are fundamentally incompatible for reasons that relate to views of the world that simply cannot be reconciled .
In general relativity , space and time are regarded as continuous objects , while quantum mechanics requires that , at some level , space and time be discrete .
Now , although we know that quantum mechanics will have to be modified to include gravity , which will allow it to incorporate the behaviors ascribed to general relativity , it should be noted that general relativity needs to be replaced for other reasons as well .
For example , the continuous nature of space allows black holes to collapse to point - like objects .
Likewise , using just general relativity , the universe began with an infinitely dense point .
Physicists do n't like infinity , and we tend to object to theories that distill down to it .
Among the many contenders for combining gravity and quantum mechanics is loop quantum gravity .
As with all proposals of this sort , this one has its detractors .
One of the most serious failings of the theory is that it was thought that it might not be possible to perform what are called gauge transformations using it .
This would have been a significant problem , because gauge transformations are fundamental to quantum mechanics and it would be unlikely that loop quantum gravity would be able to encompass all of quantum mechanics without them — a major failing for a theory aiming to replace the standard model .
A recent publication , by scientists at the University of Rome , shows that gauge transformations generally do work in loop quantum gravity .
Loop quantum gravity might be thought of as the dark horse in the race for a quantum gravity .
Nevertheless , it has some remarkable features .
For instance , gravity becomes repulsive at high densities , preventing the formation of singularities .
This naturally prevents black holes from collapsing to a point - like object .
Similarly , the big bang becomes a big bounce , and questions like " what happened before the big bang ? " become physically meaningful .
Importantly , space and time quantization occurs naturally with loop quantum gravity .
Its biggest problem lies not in its ability to encompass gravity but in its ability to retain the properties of the standard model .
The standard model relies heavily on something called a gauge transformation .
The point to gauge transformations is that , when this mathematical trick is played , certain parts of the physics remains the same , while others change .
The way these changes and invariants crop up tells us about the symmetry that 's observed in nature and explain a huge variety of results .
This is such a powerful tool in physics that it will take a significant amount of evidence to convince physicists to give up gauge transformations .
That makes it a really important that any theory that replaces the standard model is compliant with gauge transformations as well .
This latest work shows that gauge transformations work in loop quantum gravity for systems which do n't change with time — everything traveling at constant speed and in straight lines .
Furthermore , the way it is constructed shows that time varying systems should work as well — they 'll just be much more difficult to work on .
This is great hurdle that loop quantum gravity has overcome .
It should still be considered an outside contender , at least as far as most of the quantum gravity community is concerned .
Its very existence , however , shows that physicists will look under any mathematical rock to acquire a unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity .
Physical Review Letters , 2009 , DOI : 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.091301
The U.S. Senate is considered the most exclusive legislative body in the country , and members of its majority say they will not accept Roland Burris -- tapped by embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to fill a vacant seat -- into their own .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , right , has named Roland Burris to fill President - elect Barack Obama 's Senate seat .
Conflicting passages in the Constitution complicate a legal and political fight , with the Supreme Court as the possible final word .
A 1969 high court ruling could ultimately decide who fills the seat recently vacated by the president - elect .
Democrats in the Senate have twice this week said they have the authority to refuse to accept " anyone appointed by Gov. Blagojevich " to fill the seat once held by Obama .
Blagojevich was arrested December 9 , accused by federal authorities of corruption by allegedly trying to sell Obama 's seat for personal , political and financial gain .
Blagojevich , a Democrat , has denied the charges , and this week named Burris , a former Illinois attorney general , to the post .
Burris said he is prepared to present his credentials to Senate officials next week .
" The governor has the constitutional and statutory authority to make the appointment , " he said Wednesday .
" We are certainly going to make contact with the leadership of the Senate to let them know that the governor of Illinois has made a legal appointment , and that I am currently the junior senator for the state of Illinois . "
A legal fight is already under way , with Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White refusing to certify the appointment .
Burris ' attorneys responded by filing paperwork with the state 's highest court .
Burris promised to show up in person to the Senate Tuesday , when new members are sworn in , but Democratic leaders said he would be turned away , at least until the issue is resolved .
Senate sources said Democratic officials and their staff spent the New Year 's holiday dusting off legal and legislative precedents for guidance about how to proceed .
Watch efforts to keep Burris from the Senate
Article 1 , Section 5 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to be " judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members . "
Democratic senators in recent days have cited that provision when asserting " our Constitutional authority " without further explanation .
But Article 1 , Section 3 lists those qualifications : " No person shall be senator who shall not have attained to the age of 30 years , and been nine years a citizen of the United States . "
The potential senator must also be an inhabitant of the state from which he or she is chosen .
Burris , 71 and a lifelong Illinoisan , certainly meets all those requirements .
Senate Democrats chose to focus not on the individual qualifications , but on the process used to select the nominee and the person making that choice .
" This is not about Mr. Burris , " said a statement from Senate leaders Tuesday .
" It is about the integrity of a governor accused of attempting to sell this United States Senate seat . "
Senate leadership spokesman Jim Manley added : " We are not making a judgment about the qualifications of the appointee , but about whether the appointment itself was tainted by fraud .
We believe we are entitled to do that .
This is like judging the integrity of an election , free from fraud and corruption . "
Seating Obama 's replacement could take months while the issue moves up the legal food chain in state and federal courts .
In 1967 , the House of Representatives refused to seat longtime Rep. Adam Clayton Powell , D - New York , amid a corruption investigation .
The Supreme Court ultimately intervened two years later with a simple ruling : " The House is without power to exclude any member - elect who meets the Constitution 's requirements for membership . "
There is a significant difference between the Illinois vacancy and the 40 - year - old case :
The Powell case dealt with an elected member , as opposed to a temporary gubernatorial appointment .
Courts could now be asked to decide whether the Senate 's power to seat its members is the same for those elected or appointed .
And , does the Senate have the authority to essentially override a state 's selection process in an effort to preserve the integrity of the entire legislative body ?
Illinois law clearly gives the governor the sole power to select someone like Burris , whose professional resume is extensive and by all accounts spotless .
The state 's supreme court on December 17 refused to consider legal challenges made by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan trying to blunt Blagojevich 's authority .
Days later , the governor named Burris to the Senate seat .
In sensitive matters involving individual members of the legislative and executive bodies , the federal courts have been generally deferential to the other branches of government to essentially police their own .
There is no certainty whether the Supreme Court , if asked to intervene in the Illinois controversy , would draw distinctions between the criteria the Senate would use for elected versus appointed members , between qualifications and integrity .
Having judges sort out that contrast between the person and the process would be a time - consuming , complex process .
The justices of the Supreme Court may ultimately decide not to rule on whether Burris ' appointment would " taint " the Senate , concluding that such questions on the process -- not the person -- would be a political question , not a legal one .
And unforeseen events , such as the pending indictment of Blagojevich and any decision about whether he should resign , could ultimately affect this unusual showdown of political , legislative and constitutional prerogatives .
All About Rod Blagojevich • Illinois • Roland Burris • U.S. Senate
I made a gravity bong while I was bored , and even made a tutorial of it .
Here is a pic : I put the tutorial on YouTube , cause for those who are not as experenced will not get it just by reading text on a screen .
Check out my tutorial I made on how to make this wonderful toking tool :
A certain newsmagazine–hint : not this one –has put Populist Rage on its cover this week and features a series of essays , several quite good , about all the fury churning out there in pitchfork land .
I suppose that there is a fair amount of anger about , especially with stories like this one popping up on an almost daily basis .
I certainly loved every minute of Jon Stewart ’s takedown of Jim Cramer .
It got to the heart of the crime : selling , and insuring –and making huge , bonus - driven fortunes off on–piles of mortgages that were bound to go unpaid is a Ponzi fantasy , of Madoffian enormity , even if each of those mortgages represents an actual home that can , and will , eventually , be resold .
So , yes , people are “ angry ” at Wall Street .
They are also “ angry ” at Octomom .
I wonder if the depth and quality of those two rages differ–or is this all just a television show ?
I mean , how many demonstrations , how many economic riots , have there been ?
There have been real free - for - alls , featuring real violence and bloodshed , in places like China , where the level of societal unfairness and desperation makes our own not - insignificant inequities seem like a workers ’ paradise .
There used to be economic riots and marches here –back in the Great Depression , and further back in the populist era of the late 19th century .
But none lately .
There does n’t even seem to be significant movement in the polls , which are our own , latter - day way of marching on Washington .
There is a real crisis out there .
It has existed for a while .
It has been spreading slowly as factory after factory has shut down , as the gap between rich and poor ballooned , as the rich found ways to get richer betting on exotic financial instruments with all the economic substance of a roulette wheel , as the middle class found it harder to pay for college , for health care , for gasoline .
But most of the anger we see and hear comes from people who are paid to be angry , on cue , on cable television–as opposed to people with actual grievacnes .
Suddenly , the White House press corps goes barking mad over the AIG Bonuses .
It is said that the bonuses are an aspect of the bust that the “ public ” can understand ; in truth , the bonuses are an aspect of the bust that reporters can understand .
Suddenly , the Obama Administration has a “ crisis . ”
The President has to go on television and act as if he ’s angry , even though he knows these bonuses are the tiniest outcropping of outrageousness .
( I mean , AIG insured mortgage - backed instruments that any qualified CPA could have seen were as solid as a soap bubble and thereby came close to bringing down the world ’s financial system–that ’s outrageous . )
The problem with outrage is that it occludes vision .
Today Geithner proposes a bank bailout plan .
The markets love it –the Dow is up 350 points as I write–and so we can move on .
No more calls for Tim ’s head ; the bank thing actually may get straightened out .
Uh…so where ’s the next Octomom ?
Does Novamom lurk ?
What ’s A - Rod up to this week ?
The trouble is , Geithner ’s plan–if it works –is only the beginning .
We need a new set of rules to prevent the wizards from short - sheeting our pension money .
We need an informed public to stay vigilant and make sure banking lobbyists do n’t shred the thing in committee .
( New York Senator Chuck Schumer , before he got so outraged last week , stood athwart a plan to have hedge fund managers pay regular tax rates , rather than capital gains , on their management fees . )
If you want to be angry about something , get pissed at a media culture that goes beserk about bonuses one week and forgets all about them the next .
And be worried , quite worried , about a society for whom anger is a form of entertainment .
7 Timeless Thoughts on Taking Responsibility for Your Life
“ Man must cease attributing his problems to his environment , and learn again to exercise his will – his personal responsibility . ”
Albert Einstein
“ It is a painful thing to look at your own trouble and know that you yourself and no one else has made it . ”
Sophocles
“ A sign of wisdom and maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your decisions cause your rewards and consequences .
You are responsible for your life , and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make . ”
Denis Waitley
What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever ?
Like discipline , responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you 've developed a bit of an allergy to it .
Still , it 's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life .
Without it as a foundation nothing else here or in any personal development book really works .
So today I 'd like to explore personal responsibility with the help from some timeless thoughts on the topic .
1 . There is always a price to pay .
“ Freedom is the will to be responsible to ourselves . ”
Friedrich Nietzsche
“ Liberty means responsibility .
That is why most men dread it . ”
George Bernard Shaw
“ When you blame others , you give up your power to change . ”
Unknown
Not taking responsibility may be less demanding , less painful and mean less time spent in the unknown .
It 's more comfortable .
You can just take it easy and blame problems in your life on someone else .
But there is always a price to pay .
When you do n't take responsibility for your life you give away your personal power .
2. Build your self - esteem .
“ Disciplining yourself to do what you know is right and important , although difficult , is the high road to pride , self - esteem and personal satisfaction . ”
Brian Tracy
“ The willingness to accept responsibility for one 's own life is the source from which self - respect springs . ”
Joan Didion
Why do people often have self - esteem problems ?
I 'd say that one of the big reasons is that they do n't take responsibility for their lives .
Instead someone else is blamed for the bad things that happen and a victim mentality is created and empowered .
This damages many vital parts in your life .
Stuff like relationships , ambitions and achievements .
That hurt will not stop until you wise up and take responsibility for your life .
There is really no way around it .
And the difference is really remarkable .
Just try it out .
You feel so much better about yourself even if you only take personal responsibility for your own life for day .
This is also a way to stop relying on external validation like praise from other people to feel good about yourself .
Instead you start building a stability within and a sort of inner spring that fuels your life with positive emotions no matter what other people say or do around you .
Which brings us to the next reason to take personal responsibility …
3 . Give yourself the permission to live the life you want .
“ When we have begun to take charge of our lives , to own ourselves , there is no longer any need to ask permission of someone . ”
George O'Neil
By taking responsibility for our lives we not only gain control of what happens .
It also becomes natural to feel like you deserve more in life as your self - esteem builds and as you do the right thing more consistently .
You feel better about yourself .
This is critically important .
Because it 's most often you that are standing in your own way and in the way of your success .
It 's you that start to self - sabotage or hold yourself back in subtle or not so subtle ways once you are on your way to the success you dream of .
To remove that inner resistance you must feel and think that you actually deserve what you want .
You may be able to do a little about that by affirmations and other positive techniques .
But the biggest impact by far comes from taking responsibility for yourself and your life .
By doing the right thing .
4. Taking action becomes natural .
“ Action springs not from thought , but from a readiness for responsibility . ”
Dietrich Bonhoeffer
It is often said that your thoughts become your actions .
But without taking responsibility for your life those thoughts often just stay on that mental stage and are n't translated into action .
Taking responsibility for your life is that extra ingredient that makes taking action more of a natural thing .
You do n't get stuck in just thinking , thinking and wishing so much .
You become proactive instead of passive .
5. Understand the limits of your responsibility .
“ Make the best use of what is in your power , and take the rest as it happens . ”
Epictetus
Taking responsibility for your life is great .
But that is also all that you have control over .
You can't control the results of your actions .
You can't control how someone reacts to what you say or what you do .
It 's important to know where your limits are .
Otherwise you 'll create a lot unnecessary suffering for yourself and waste energy and focus by taking responsibility for what you can't and never really could control .
6 . Do n't forget to take responsibility in everyday life too .
“ I long to accomplish a great and noble task , but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble . ”
Helen Keller
“ You can not escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today . ”
Abraham Lincoln
Life consists of each day .
Not just the big events sometime in the future .
So do n't forget to take responsibility for the little things today too .
Do n't postpone it .
Taking responsibility for your life can be hard and taxing on you .
It 's not something you master over the weekend .
So you might as well get started with the it right now .
7 . Aim to be your best self .
“ Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody expects of you .
Never excuse yourself . ”
Henry Ward Beecher
“ Peak performance begins with your taking complete responsibility for your life and everything that happens to you . ”
Brian Tracy
This is of course not easy .
But it 's a lot of fun and the payoff is massive .
You are not trying to escape from your life anymore .
Instead you take control , face what 's going on and so the world and new options open up for you .
You start taking action not just when you feel like it .
Improvement is n't about short spurts once in a while .
Consistent action is what really pays off and can help you achieve just about anything .
You build your self - esteem to higher levels .
And may discover that many smaller problems you experience regularly such as negative thinking , self - defeating behavior and troubled relationships with yourself and others start to correct themselves as your self - esteem improves .
You gain an inner stability and can create your own positive feelings within without the help of validation from other people .
So how do you take responsibility ?
Well , it 's simply choice that you have to make .
Reviewing the reasons above and also the awesome quotes is for me a powerful way to keep myself in line .
Though it does n't always work .
Doing the right thing in every situation is hard to do and also hard to always keep in mind .
So do n't aim for perfection .
Just try to be as good a person as you can be right now .
When you know those very important reasons above it becomes a lot easier to stick with taking responsibility .
And to not rationalize to yourself that you did n't really have to take responsibility in various situations .
That does n't mean that I beat myself up endlessly about it .
I just observe that I have hurt myself and my life .
And that does n't feel good .
And so I become less prone to repeat the same mistake .
Also , two habits that I think are essential to be able to do the right and often hard thing and take personal responsibility are the ones I wrote about a few weeks ago : increasing your energy levels and learning to be present .
Without the extra energy and the presence it becomes more difficult to take action and to not create extra resistance and negativity within yourself .

Russia has accused Ukraine of stealing gas meant for Europe Russian gas giant Gazprom says Ukraine has blocked gas deliveries to Europe , dashing hopes of ending a row which has hit several countries ' supplies .
Gazprom deputy head Alexander Medvedev said Ukraine had failed to carry the gas onwards to Europe after it resumed pumping it across their border .
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko called on Russia to " stop the blackmail " and work out an agreement .
Hundreds of thousands of Europeans have been without gas for nearly a week .
Moscow has been unable to resolve differences with Ukraine over debts and pricing .

The BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes , at a pumping station on the Russian - Ukrainian border , says the latest twist in the dispute is symptomatic of the total lack of trust between the two countries .
' Limited ' supply European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso telephoned Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to express disappointment at the low levels of gas flowing from Russia and at the apparent lack of access to dispatch centres for EU monitors , EU officials said .
Mr Barroso said he would also discuss the problem with the Ukrainian leadership .
Russia shut off the gas to Europe last Wednesday , accusing Kiev of stealing gas meant for other European customers .
Ukraine did n't open the route for gas transit - if the system is closed , we can't provide gas
Alexander Medvedev
Gazprom deputy chairman
Russian gas ignites tensions Cold comfort for Europe Q&A : Europe needs Russian gas Ukraine 's domestic supply was cut a week earlier .
However , in a deal reached on Monday , Russia agreed to resume supplies if Russian and EU observers were allowed to monitor their transit through Ukraine .
The move was designed to calm Russian fears that Ukraine was siphoning off gas for its own use .
Russia said gas started flowing from the Russian pumping station at Sudzha at 1030 local time ( 0730 GMT ) on Tuesday .
This was later confirmed by EU monitors , although the amount of gas , they said , was " very limited " .
Mr Medvedev said Gazprom had informed the European Commission it was unable to supply gas through Ukraine because Kiev had not opened any export pipelines .
" Ukraine did n't open the route for gas transit , " he said .
" If the system is closed , we can't provide gas .
The Ukrainian side cynically informed us that the gas transport system had been reoriented to domestic consumers .
" We do n't know what to do at the moment . "
Thousands of Europeans have been left without gas in freezing temperatures
After the gas was switched on at Sudzha , Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz demanded " the immediate resumption of even supply of gas along all transit routes " , saying the amount and direction of the gas had not been agreed by the two sides .
Mr Yushchenko , speaking in a televised press conference later on Tuesday , said : " Each person living in Ukraine should understand that what has happened between 1 January and now is not the blackmail of our state , it is the blackmail of each of you . "
He went on : " What is most important in these talks now is to bring a halt to the political emotions , stop the blackmail and let experts start working out answers [ for transit and supply contracts ] . "
Major shortages Russia cut gas supplies to Ukraine on New Year 's Day , saying it would pump only enough for customers further down the pipeline .
But then Moscow accused Ukraine of siphoning off gas intended for third countries and it restricted supplies even further .
Ukraine denied the claim , but the flow of Russian gas ceased completely on 7 January , leaving many European countries with major shortages .
The EU gets a quarter of its gas supplies from Russia - 80 % of which passes through Ukraine - and more than 15 countries across central Europe have been hit by the shutdown of Russian supplies .

As gasoline prices drift and oil falters , the diesel fuel that dominates agriculture , rail transport , heavy construction and road hauling is cheaper than it has been in more than four years , the Energy Department said Monday .
Though that sounds like good news , diesel ’s decline is another sign of the depths of the global economy ’s funk .
“ Diesel prices are down because demand is down , ” said Jerry Nickelsburg , senior economist with the UCLA Anderson Forecast , noting that foreign trading partners have also soured on buying U.S. exports .
“ Californians , and American households in general , are not buying .
Retailers are not ordering .
Factories are not building , and trucks are not delivering , ” Nickelsburg said .

Analysts said that continuing economic malaise was the primary reason for another sharp hit on oil prices Monday .
Unable to find any firm basis for a climb since its record high above $ 147 a barrel last summer , crude oil for April delivery fell $ 4.61 to close at $ 40.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Retail gasoline was mixed , up an average of 2.5 cents a gallon over the last week to $ 1.934 nationwide , according to the Energy Department ’s weekly survey of filling stations .
In California , the average price of a gallon of self - serve regular fell 7.2 cents to $ 2.189 .
Diesel has followed the economy ’s tailspin in a largely uninterrupted decline since the summer , when it hit the record - high averages of $ 4.764 a gallon nationally and $ 5.027 a gallon in California .
On Monday , the national average for diesel fell 4.3 cents a gallon to $ 2.087 , a price not seen since February 2005 .
California ’s average dropped 7.5 cents a gallon to $ 2.144 , the lowest since January 2005 .

Statistics from the American Trucking Assn. illustrate the demand slump .
In December , the most recent month for which figures are available , the truck tonnage freight index fell 11.1 % from November , the biggest month - to - month plunge in 15 years and the third - largest drop since the industry organization began keeping data in 1973 .
Having too little work to take advantage of cheap fuel was frustrating to long - haul truckers like DuWayne Marshall of Watertown , Wis .
Marshall watched colleagues go bankrupt from the record - high diesel costs last year .
Now he ’s watching them go under from the lack of cargo to haul .
“ I know guys who are struggling to make their truck payments .
One is watching his condo go into foreclosure .
Another is throwing up his hands because his truck and trailer is about to be repossessed , ” said Marshall , who hauls produce from California to Wisconsin .
Business is so slow and the orders so small , Marshall said , that he has driven to as many as 14 locations just to fill his truck for one trip back to the Midwest .
In good times , that many stops would have filled his truck seven times over , he said .

Such stories are all too common these days , said Todd Spencer , executive vice president of the Owner - Operator Independent Drivers Assn .
“ The economic situation is exacerbated for truckers , ” said Spencer , whose Grain Valley , Mo. , organization represents more than 150,000 truckers .
“ As fewer goods are shipped , there is less need for the trucks .
You ’re paying less for fuel , but you are n’t any better off . ”

Bad news for memory buyers : if you ’ve waited to buy DRAM , hoping that the market may continue lower , you may have missed your window .
Spot market watcher DRAMeXchange.com reported Monday that spot prices for all types of DDR - 2 DRAM had jumped by 15 to 26 percent , with the highest price increases seemingly reserved for the high end of the DDR - 2 market .
Is this worth getting excited about ?
Depends on if this is a trend or not .
The range in price for a 1 - Gbit 128Mx8 800MHz DRAM was just $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 for Monday .
Combine eight of those for a gigabyte of memory and that ’s a couple of coffees at Starbucks or so .
Although it depends on what you ’re in the market for , you can buy 4 Gbytes of DDR - 2 memory for between $ 70 and $ 360 or so , depending on if want that DRAM spread out over one stick or two .
Even certain DDR - 3 memory is still less than $ 80 .
When Tamara Delaney of Woodville , Wis. , volunteered to find a home for a black Labrador Retriever named Jake last year , she had no idea what she was up against .
Jake , cared for by a rescue group , had already waited nearly three years for a new home .
And he would wait eight more months as Delaney tried to find someone to take in the big Lab .
It did n’t matter much that Jake was a sociable dog and in perfect health .
Jake ’s problem was n’t his temperament — it was the color of his coat .
Jake bore the stigma of the “ BBD , ” an acronym used to refer to big black dogs , who are frequently passed over for flashier , prettier dogs and wind up , like Jake , waiting for years to be adopted .
“ Nobody wants a black - coated dog , ” rescue workers told Delaney as she tried without success to find a home for Jake .
And when Delaney turned to the Internet , she found that shelters across the country were overflowing with black - coated mutts .
“ Please do n’t overlook our black dogs , ” rescue groups pleaded on their home pages above pictures of Rottweilers , Chows and Labs sporting bright bandanas .
One shelter ’s website just came right out with the grim truth : “ The general public is not aware of how doomed black dogs are when they are brought to a pound . ”

The more Delaney learned about the numbers of black dogs in shelters , the more determined she grew to make a difference — one black dog at a time .
She started by adopting Jake , the overlooked Lab .
But Jake would not be the only black dog in Delaney ’s life .
“ I ’m starting to become a middle - person between shelters and rescues , to get their black dogs off death row , ” says Delaney , whose inbox fills with email from shelters and rescue groups asking her to post pictures on her website of black dogs who were passed up on the way to the Golden Retrievers .
When Amy Chase read about Delaney on an Internet message board this spring , she had a big black dog of her own to worry about .
Five months earlier , animal control officers had dropped off Mickie , a Newfoundland mix , at the Ohio County Animal Shelter in Rising Sun , Ind. , where Chase works .
Looking for ways to make Mickie more interesting to those who visited the shelter , Chase highlighted his Newfie heritage , but nothing seemed to work .
To potential adoptors , “ He was just another big , black , hairy dog , ” recalls Chase .
Mickie was scheduled for euthanasia in May , so Chase contacted Delaney , who in turn posted Mickie ’s picture on the Black Pearl website .
She also cross-posted it on other adoption sites , including Jen Wold ’s Gemini Rottweiler and Pit Bull Rescue , where Delaney had found Jake .
Before long , Mickie was no longer just another black dog , but the focus of three optimistic women and their commitment to finding him a home .
Most black dogs have to rely on shelter staff and volunteers to steer potential adoptors their way .
And indeed , many shelters take extra steps to make black dogs more adoptable , according to Kate Pullen , director of animal sheltering issues at the Humane Society of the United States in Washington , D.C.
Teaching the dogs tricks , putting placards on kennels highlighting the dog ’s personality ( “ I may just be a black dog , but I know how to balance a biscuit on my nose . ” ) , making sure multiple black dogs are n’t kenneled next to one other — anything to catch the eye and imagination of potential adoptors .
“ I ’ve had to turn away many black dogs because I ca n’t fill the place up with them , ” says Jill Wimmer , shelter manager at PAWS Atlanta , that city ’s oldest and largest no -kill shelter .
“ And every one I turned away had a great temperament . ”
Wimmer knows that she can likely adopt out three dogs in the time it takes to find a home for one BBD .
Delaney ’s advocacy for Mickie eventually paid off when Shonna Crompton of Ada , Minn. , went online in April and came across Mickie ’s forlorn face — stamped URGENT — on Wold ’s Gemini Rescue site .
“ I could n’t just let him die , ” says Crompton .
In May , Delaney , Chase and Wold arranged for a network of volunteers to transport Mickie nearly 500 miles from Rising Sun , Ind. , to Madison , Wisc. Crompton ’s husband Shane drove Mickie another 400 miles to his new home in northern Minnesota .
“ His hip bones were protruding and his belly was sunken , ” recalls Crompton of her first meeting with Mickie .
“ But he just sprawled out on the grass like it was the best feeling on the planet . ”
Right now , Delaney is feeling pretty good herself , and hopes that her website , which is filled with black - dog facts , convinces more people to give a BBD a chance .
She works for all the black dogs waiting in shelters and foster homes , and for the ones who never got a chance to know what it was like to play and be loved , she says .
“ I mostly just hope it helps people become aware of how overlooked and underadopted these dogs are , ” says Delaney .
“ I had one person tell me , ‘ Thank you for being an advocate for the black dog , because nobody else is . ’ ”
President Barack Obama could swiftly improve U.S. relations with Latin America by announcing the death of the Monroe Doctrine and then presiding over its funeral .
Such a statement would cost him little domestically and win him praise and appreciation throughout Latin America and much of the world .
Most Americans do n’t know the details of this 185 - year - old policy and could n’t care less about it .
Latin Americans , in contrast , can not only describe the Monroe Doctrine , they revile it .
In effect , it has become nothing more than hollow rhetoric that offends the very people it purports to defend .
In 1823 , Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wrote , and President James Monroe proclaimed , a doctrine that asserted the U.S. ’ political character is different from Europe’s .
The United States , President Monroe declared , would consider the extension of Europe ’s monarchical political influence into the New World “ as dangerous to our peace and safety . ”
European powers should leave the Americas for the Americans , he warned , and he strongly implied that there existed a U.S. sphere of influence south of the border .
At the time , Europe shrugged .
After all , the United States possessed neither a formidable army nor navy .
But three serious problems fundamentally vitiated this apparently noble gesture to protect newly independent republics in South America from European re-colonization .
First , Washington proclaimed it unilaterally .
Latin Americans did n’t ask us for protection .
U.S. diplomats did n’t even consult their counterparts .
That was ironic , since the doctrine ’s “ protection ” involved placing the United States between Latin American countries and supposedly malevolent European states .
Second , its paternalism  the claim that “ our southern brethren ” lack the ability to defend themselves  raises hackles in Latin America .
Even if the implication had some validity at one time , it no longer corresponds to the region ’s reality .
The third and most problematic issue Obama faces from the outmoded doctrine relates to its legacy .
For more than a century , the United States has periodically intervened in the domestic affairs of Latin American countries .
Typically the United States invoked the Monroe Doctrine  without threats from Europe  to justify self - serving intrusions that have inflicted heavy damage on Latin American dignity and sovereignty .
Roosevelt Corollary
Under President Theodore Roosevelt , the doctrine stood for the informal colonization of most “ independent ” Caribbean Basin countries .
The so - called Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine claimed Washington ’s right to preemptively intervene and occupy a Latin American nation , even if no European power had yet threatened to impose its power there .
Roosevelt asserted that by virtue of going into debt to a European bank , a Latin American country weakened itself sufficiently to be vulnerable to re-colonization .
Ergo , anticipatory military intervention became a necessity from 1900 to 1933 .
U.S. troops invaded Colombia in 1901 and 1902 ; Honduras in 1903 , 1907 , and 1911 ; and the Dominican Republic in 1903 , 1904 , 1914 , and 1916 , occupying the island nation until 1924 .
U.S. troops landed in Nicaragua on multiple occasions , occupying it for some 20 years , and occupied Cuba for three years ( 1906 - 1909 ) and Haiti for 20 years .
U.S. forces also made incursions into Mexico , Panama , Guatemala , and Costa Rica .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the doctrine in 1954 to justify the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Guatemala .
President John F. Kennedy embraced it from 1961 to 1963 in attacking Cuba , and President Lyndon B. Johnson raised its banner in 1965 when he sent 23,000 Marines into the Dominican Republic in support of generals who tyrannically governed the country over the next 13 years .
President Ronald Reagan said it was the basis for the CIA wars he pursued in Nicaragua , El Salvador , and Guatemala , during which more than 200,000 Central Americans died , as well as the U.S. attack on Grenada .
For these historic reasons , “ Monroeism ” carries a deeply negative meaning in Latin America and the Caribbean .
Throughout the region , the mere mention of the Monroe Doctrine hints at impending U.S. aggression .
Nearly two decades after the Cold War ’s demise , U.S. policy elites still cling to this doctrine as an axiom of U.S. policy .
In recent years they added as the latest corollary a demand that Latin American governments adopt neoliberal economics .
No wonder Latin Americans have elected leaders  in Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile , Ecuador , Nicaragua , Paraguay , Guatemala , Honduras , Uruguay , and Venezuela  who repudiated not only the doctrine ’s implied hegemony , but the economic rules that accompany it today .
Notably , not one Western hemispheric country supported the United States in October , when the UN General Assembly voted 185 - 3 to end the U.S. embargo against Cuba .
The Ballots Did It
Over the last decade , citizens in Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina , Bolivia , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and other Central American nations have declared their opposition to U.S. - backed neoliberal economic policies and voted for candidates who eschew the notion of perpetual U.S. hegemony .
Ballots , ultimately , killed the doctrine .
This new wave of leaders is challenging U.S. supremacy .
Last year , Bolivian President Evo Morales did what would have been unthinkable two decades ago :
He evicted the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency .
Ecuador has kicked out a U.S. military base .
Most Latin American nations now defy the United States on some major policy .
Chile and Mexico , both Security Council Members , voted against Washington when the key UN resolution arose that would have sanctioned Bush ’s invasion of Iraq .
And U.S. influence has been further eroded by the stronger diplomatic , economic , and military ties with China , Russia , and Iran that several countries in the region are developing .
Given the facts , President Obama should announce as soon as possible  and no later than the mid-April Summit of the Americas in Trinidad that he ’s slated to attend  that the Monroe Doctrine is dead and buried .
This move could serve as a rhetorical catalyst for developing real partnerships that acknowledge Latin America ’s new status .
Only the funeral of this 19th - century canon will enable the United States to birth a healthy policy .
