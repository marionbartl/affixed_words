Sometime in the late sixties , as Douglas Engelbart was preparing what would one day be called The Mother of All Demos , his boss flew to Washington to meet with the money man .
The demo that birthed the modern computer mouse - and so much more - was funded by Bob Taylor , a NASA program manager who would one day take his own place among the titans of modern computing .
Engelbart 's boss had a single question on his mind as he walked into Taylor 's office after a cross-country flight from Northern California 's Stanford Research Institute .
" He came from the west coast to see me , which was very unusual , " remembers Taylor , also known for cooking up the ARPAnet and Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory .
" He came into my office and he said ' I want to talk to you about Doug - Why are you funding this guy ? ' "
Needless to say , Douglas Engelbart 's boss was n't the only one who questioned the import of the mouse inventor 's 1968 interactive - computing demo , which received a 40th anniversary celebration at Stanford University 's Memorial Hall yesterday afternoon .
Bill Paxton - one of the SRI researchers who participated in the demo - says that 90 per cent of the computer science community thought Engelbart was " a crackpot . "
" It 's hard to believe now , " he explains , " but at the time , even we [ Engelbart 's fellow researchers ] had trouble understanding what he was doing .
Think of everyone else out there . "
The Demo Relived
Three or four years later , Engelbart repeated his hypertext - meets - desktop - sharing - meets - video - conferencing demo .
In the audience was an MIT prof described by Andries van Dam , another east - coast prof in attendance , as among " the best and the brightest " of the early 1970s computing cognoscenti .
According to van Dam , at the end of the presentation , the MIT man raised his hand and said " I do n't get it - everything you 've shown me today I can do on my ASR - 33 . "
The ASR - 33 was a standard - issue teletype - a machine that did nothing but print stuff you keyed into it .
" In a Turing sense , he was right , " van Dam says .
" But that was completely not the point .
The demo went right over his head , and I thought to myself , ' If the best and the brightest can't grok this , what hope have we got ? ' "
As it turns out , there was hope .
In the years to come , Engelbart 's on - line system - known by the pseudo - acronym NLS - begat the GUI machines developed at Xerox PARC .
PARC begat the Apple Macintosh .
And the Macintosh begat a widely used operating system from a company called Microsoft .
Engelbart did n't just invent the mouse .
He and his team were the first to divide a graphical interface into windows - like subsections .
" Even way back then , we already had the concept of multiple windows , " Engelbart told The Reg in 2005 .
" Any one application could manage multiple windows , and you could easily move objects , paragraphs , and words between them . "
Desktop sharing , 60s style
NLS also foreshadowed video conferencing and desktop sharing , as Engelbart demonstrated for Andy van Dam and about a 1,000 other computer obsessives on that December afternoon back in 1968 .
At yesterday 's 40th - anniversary celebration , Engelbart 's colleagues and peers gathered to hail him as one of computing history 's great visionaries - a man who foretold the future .
" [ Engelbart ] was one of the very few people very early on who were able to understand not only that computers could do a lot of things that were very familiar , but that there was something new about computers that allow us to think in a very different way - in a stronger way , " says Alan Kay , the PARC researcher who built atop Engelbart 's work with the development of the object - oriented computing environment he called SmallTalk .
But those gathered for Engelbart 's anniversary also warned that most of his vision was lost amidst the computer revolution .
You remember Nicolaus Copernicus , right ?
He ’s the 16th - century Polish astronomer who was the first to figure out that earth was not the center of the universe , that the earth and all the other planets orbited the sun .
But he was n’t always so well known .
Copernicus worked as a church administrator since astronomy was n’t a profitable career choice ( thus relegated to hobby status ) .
And when he died , he was buried in an unmarked grave in Frombork Cathedral , the church where he worked .
A few years ago , though , archaeologists found what they thought were his remains .
When we last left this story , in 2006 — in Copernicus Unearthed — a skull , missing the lower jaw , had been found buried near an altar where the astronomer had been known to pray daily .
The archaeologists thought this might be our guy .
The skull was from a 70 - year - old male ( which matched the approximate age for Copernicus when he died in 1543 ) and a forensic reconstruction looked like an older version of the astronomer ’s portraits ( such as the one on the left ) .
But to confirm that they had indeed found their man , the archaeologists needed to perform a DNA test .
The problem ?
Copernicus had no children and though his uncle was known to be buried in the same cathedral , no one knew where .
Now comes news that the archaeologists found a few hairs in a book Copernicus owned .
The archaeologists brought in a geneticist who compared the DNA from the hairs to that found in some bones that accompanied the skull - - a vertebra , a tooth and a femur bone .
The DNA in two out of four hairs matched the bones .
Those archaeologists really did find their guy .
Congrats !
Here is one that I have to tell right now .
because it just happened like 15 minutes ago and it fails SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hard .
My neighbors which I do n't really know to well to begin with , got their kids a Wii for Xmas .
They got no games for it , but they did get a Classic Controller as well as an additional Nunchuck Combo and a carrying case .
They asked me what games they recommended , and I decided to recommend them the Animal Crossing City Folk / Wii Speak bundle , Wario Land Shake It , Mario Kart Wii , and Super mario Galaxy .
I also recommended them some VC games including Super mario World , and Sonic 2 8 - bit .
Anywho , the Mom asks me what VC is , and I told her .
I told her that all she needed to do was put in her credit card when prompted on the Shop Channel , and get the amount of points she wanted .
I also told her what WiiSpeak is , and how to connect her Wii to the internet via an ethernet connection .
Anywho , I got a call today from the mom telling me that the Wii is not working .
I asked what was wrong and you wo n't believe it .........
SHE PHYSICALLY PUT 3 CREDIT CARDS INTO THE DISC SLOT .
HOW STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Also while putting the Wii Speak on top of her sensor bar , she apparently cracked it open .
Just ugh .
I told her she has to cancel her cards and call Nintendo for a 75USD repair , and now she expects ME to pay for this .
Her husband is on my side of the issue , but she is steaming at me right now .
Seriously , she put in 1 , and thought that that one could not be accepted , so she kept putting them in and they will not come out .
I might try to remove them tomorrow with her hubby while she is away on a business trip .
The dude 's cool , but fuck the wife ...
Anywho , post your stories .
Clearly there is more stupid to go around no ?
Fears of measles epidemic as cases soar to 13 - year high in wake of MMR scare
Around three million children are at risk of a measles epidemic because they have n't been vaccinated
There have been more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year – putting Britain at risk of a deadly epidemic , health officials say .
The Health Protection Agency blamed unfounded fears about the combined MMR jab for the increase and urged parents to vaccinate their children .
In the first ten months of 2008 , there were 1,049 confirmed cases in England and Wales – the highest level since the early 1990s .
A recent outbreak of more than 60 cases in Cheshire has prompted the launch of a programme to vaccinate 10,000 pupils .
The agency blamed the rise on a low uptake of the MMR jab over the past decade .
A panic among parents was triggered by researchers who claimed there was a link between the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab and autism .
Most experts believe the jab is safe and effective .
Around three million children and teenagers are believed to be at risk of a measles epidemic because they missed one of two doses of vaccine , or are entirely unprotected .
The disease can lead to ear infections , pneumonia , and permanent brain damage , and may even be fatal .
HPA immunisation expert Dr Mary Ramsay said : ' Over the last few years , we have seen an unprecedented increase in measles cases and we are still receiving reports of cases across the country .
' This rise is due to relatively low MMR vaccine uptake over the past decade and there are now a large number of children who are not fully vaccinated with MMR .
' There is now a real risk of a measles epidemic .
These children are susceptible to not only measles but to mumps and rubella as well . '
The NHS information centre said uptake rates of the triple jab remained at 85 per cent in 2007 - 2008 , the same as the previous year .
A rate of 95 per cent is needed for immunity in the community .
In August , the Chief Medical Officer announced an MMR catch - up programme to reduce the risk of a measles epidemic .
Primary Care Trusts and GPs were urged to identify individuals not up to date with their MMR injections and offer catch - up immunisation
The move was based on models of measles transmission in England carried out by the Agency , which suggested there was a real risk of a large measles outbreak of between approximately 30,000 to 100,000 cases - with the majority in London .
Dr Ramsay said : ' We are glad to see that public confidence in the MMR vaccine is now high , with more than eight out of 10 children receiving one dose of MMR by their second birthday .
' But we should n't forget that the children who were n't vaccinated many years ago are at real risk .
' Measles is a very serious infection as it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis , even in healthy children .
It is highly infectious - it can be passed on without direct contact before the rash appears .
' This is why it 's incredibly important to continue to remind parents about the benefits of having their child vaccinated with two doses of MMR for optimum protection .
It is never too late to get vaccinated . '
A mass vaccination is to take place in Cheshire in early December .
The parents of 10,000 children have been asked to give consent for the MMR vaccine after tests confirmed 19 cases in the region , with a further 49 youngsters being treated for ' probable ' measles .
Most reported cases were in Sandbach , Middlewich and Crewe , but there have also been reports from Congleton , Nantwich and Winsford , Central and Eastern Cheshire Primary Care Trust said .
Guy Hayhurst , consultant in public health at the trust , said : ' We identified 10,534 children who had no record of full MMR immunisation and wrote to their parents to seek consent for them to be vaccinated in school .
' We hope that by doing this we will halt the current outbreak in its tracks , or at least severely curtail it . '
Teams of nurses are being prepared to vaccinate children in 177 primary schools and 33 secondary schools .
The vaccine will also be offered to younger school staff members .
The mass vaccination programme will begin on December 3 and is expected to be completed by December 17 .
MOGADISHU ( Reuters ) - Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf has decided to resign , his spokesman said on Wednesday , in a move the African Union said would be positive for the peace process in the Horn of Africa nation .
Chairman of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia Sheikh Sharif Ahmed ( C ) , flanked by his deputy Sheikh Abdirahman Janaqow ( R ) and Mogadishu mayor Mohamed Osman attend a news conference in the capital Mogadishu December 24 , 2008 .

Yusuf has been accused by donor countries and regional governments of being an obstacle to U.N. - hosted peace talks .
His rift with Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein has pushed the Western - backed interim government , struggling against Islamist insurgents , to the brink of collapse .
“ The president has already written his resignation letter and he is expected to announce it on the coming Saturday , ” Hussein Mohamed Mohamud , a presidential spokesman , told Reuters , declining to give a reason for the decision .
The announcement came shortly after the resignation of a politician Yusuf named prime minister last week , who said he did not want to be an obstacle to peace in Somalia .
“ The move is a dignified move on the part of the president .
If his decision is to resign , I would congratulate him , ” said Nicolas Bwakira , the African Union Commission ’s Special Representative for Somalia .
“ It is , overall , a good move .
It will give the opportunity to all parties to form a new leadership , ” Bwakira told Reuters .
“ It will resuscitate the peace process . ”
Yusuf sacked Hussein earlier this month and appointed Mohamed Mohamud Guled instead , the man who quit on Wednesday .
Parliament and the international community backed Hussein , leaving the already weak government with two prime ministers .
A regional bloc spearheading the peace process agreed on Sunday to sanctions on Yusuf and others seen as hindering the talks .
DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE
“ I think it ’s positive and I hope there is a mechanism for letting Yusuf go with some sort of dignity , ” said a diplomat in the region , adding that his departure should smooth the way for a new government and an extension of its mandate .
“ It will help the process go forward and the timing is right because any new unity government should look at the question of leadership ... I do n’t think it ’s going to do any damage . ”
Diplomats said Yusuf ’s departure could also help take the sting out of plans by Ethiopia to withdraw troops that have propped up the government for the past two years .

The Ethiopians drove Somali Islamists out of the capital at the end of 2006 and have been battling the insurgents ever since .
Islamists now control all of the south and center of the country expect Mogadishu and Baidoa , the seat of parliament .
More then 10,000 civilians have been killed during the two - year insurgency , a million people uprooted and a third of the population need emergency aid in a humanitarian crisis that has been described as one of the worst in the world .
Hussein is open to bringing the Islamist opposition into the peace process and says there is only a small group of hardliners who will never agree to talks , and they can be marginalized .
But analysts say Yusuf , a former warlord , was not interested in forming a broad - based coalition in government and undermined attempts by the prime minister to reach out .
While Washington is very wary of Islamists gaining power , because it fears Somalia will become a breeding ground for al Qaeda , some diplomats and analysts say that may be only option for stability in a country torn by violence for 17 years .
At the request of President - elect Barack Obama , President George W. Bush convened an awkward meeting of all living former presidents at the White House to meet , and presumably give advice and encouragement to , the new guy .
The body language of the participants in the summit photo , taken in the Oval Office , said it all .
The president - elect was amiably chatting with George H.W. Bush , the current presidents father .
Could it be that Obama was complimenting the elder Bush on his realist foreign policy of which the president - elect claims to be a fan ?
Right next to these two political lovebirds were another harmonious duo .
Also visibly enjoying each others company were the modern - day champions of U.S. military interventionism on the left and right Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
Clinton was a Wilsonian liberal who was the titleholder in terms of numbers of military adventures , most of them for ostensibly humanitarian reasons .
He intervened militarily or threatened to use force in Sudan , Afghanistan , Haiti , Somalia , Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq , and North Korea .
The younger Bush , a neoconservative ( a right - wing Wilsonian ) , was the champion in terms of deeply enmeshing the United States in two unnecessary nation - building quagmires simultaneously Iraq and Afghanistan .
Standing apart from the others in the summit photoand looking mighty uncomfortable was Jimmy Carter .
Could it be that the interventionism , actual or professed , of all the others made him a little squeamish ?
While not perfect , Carterin keeping with the original vision of the nations founders exhibited more restraint militarily than the rest .
Although he began giving aid to the Afghan Mujahadeen , his objective was to annoy the Soviets and give them another Vietnam .
( Ronald Reagan , Carters successor , later opened the floodgates to massive aid , tried to win the war , and thus much more significantly enabled a future threat to the United States . )
Carters only overt military foray , which ended in failure because of the incompetence of the U.S. military , was the attempted rescue of U.S. hostages at the U.S. embassy in Iran .
Even this mission exhibited restraint ; when the hostage - takers stormed the U.S. embassy , under international law this action was the same as attacking American soil .
Although Carter could have conducted a retaliatory military assault against Iran , he correctly surmised that the diplomatic hostages would have been killed .
Although the rescue mission failed , the hostages were eventually freed without the United States having made any concessions to their captors ( unlike the macho Ronald Reagans astonishing sale of heavy weapons to this same radical Iranian regime , which was a state sponsor of terrorism , to ransom U.S. hostages in Lebanon ) .
Carter is the most underrated modern president in fact , he usually gets bad reviews .
Yet people have trouble remembering many specifics about why he was so awful .
You cannot have prosperity and liberty if you are always at war .
Whereas other recent presidents have seemed oblivious to this fact , the Vietnam experience seems to have made Carter realize it .
Carter consciously used military power reluctantly and only as a last resort .
The founders would have been pleased .
He also gave the Canal Zonea U.S. colonial chunk of Panama back to its rightful owners .
On the domestic front , Carter did make some mistakes , but he also inherited stagflation caused by the Vietnam War and past presidents  poor economic policies .
At first , he made it worse but then nominated Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Volcker restricted the money supply and drove inflation out of the economy ; and this tight - fistedness contributed greatly to the prosperity of the Reagan and Clinton years .
( Regrettably , it was disastrously abandoned in the George W. Bush era . )
In addition , Carter was able to reduce government spending as a portion of GDP and increase economic efficiency by deregulating the transportation , communication , energy , and financial services industries .
In short , maybe Carter stood apart in the summit photo because he stood above the rest of the men in performance while in office .
Obama seems headed toward pursuing the socialist policies of George W. Bush at home and the realist policies of George H.W. Bush abroad .
Although realist policies are better than the Wilsonian interventionist policies of Clinton and George W. Bush , Obama looks like he will pursue a maximalist , rather than a minimalist , version of that schools policies .
He is already doubling down in the Afghan quagmire and is making noises about doing more militarily in Darfur .
But Obama seems open to outside advice .
Instead of just sending Jimmy Carter on peace and humanitarian missions overseas , Obama should invite Carter to a one - on - one session in the Oval Office and learn from the modern master at practicing the founders  preferred policy of military restraint .
Obama might also learn that domestic benefits might accrue from eliminating U.S. overextension abroad for example , improvement in the nations finances and economy .

WASHINGTON —
The incoming Obama administration is considering changes to the White House ’s role in homeland security policy that could dramatically enhance the influence of the president ’s national security adviser , giving him a primary role in shaping disaster management and counterterrorism policy within the United States ( see GSN , Dec. 3 ) .
According to several former executive branch officials and experts outside government , some of whom have participated in transition proceedings with staffers for President George W. Bush and President - elect Barack Obama , the question is whether to keep the White House ’s Homeland Security Council intact or to merge it with the National Security Council , which handles foreign policy matters .
The homeland council , which Bush created shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , coordinates domestic policy among a range of federal agencies , as well as state and local governments .
But its staff is smaller and bureaucratically less influential than the NSC staff .
If Obama merged the two , the portfolio of retired Army Gen. James Jones , the president - elect ’s pick for national security adviser , would expand .
“ I think they ’re deciding that literally as we speak , ” said Patricia McGinnis , the president and chief executive officer of the Council for Excellence in Government , a nonpartisan group that focuses on government management .
She attended a meeting of the Transition Coordinating Council last week at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , as did representatives from the Obama team .
Bush created the council in October , to assist with the transfer of power .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
According to sources at the meeting , the question of what to do with the HSC came up .
National security adviser Stephen Hadley expressed what he called his personal view , not that of the administration , that he could n’t imagine being in charge of homeland and national security affairs .
White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten then noted a recent speech by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in which he cautioned against major reorganizations by observing that his department had spent five years learning how to coordinate its agencies during an emergency .
Several former Bush administration officials also said that experts are debating whether to keep or eliminate the homeland council .
It ’s not clear what move Obama favors .
But before the election , two think tanks — the Center for American Progress and Third Way — released a homeland security transition study co-written by John Podesta , the head of Obama ’s transition team , and Clark Kent Ervin , a former inspector general at the Homeland Security Department and a transition adviser .
That report recommended that the NSC subsume the Homeland Security Council .
A spokesperson for the Obama transition did n’t respond to a request for comment .
Some former Bush administration officials said that it makes sense to merge the two policy - making bodies .
“ The overlap between the work of HSC and NSC is very considerable , ” said Michael Jackson , who served as the deputy secretary of the Homeland Security Department and sat on deputies committees for both bodies .
Jackson said that “ threat analysis ” from overseas and domestic sources “ has to come together ” and that the NSC has “ the most organizational discipline and clarity of mission ” of all White House policy groups .
Another former White House official said that if he were advising Obama , he would suggest redefining the NSC ’s role .
“ I would look at it more as our nation ’s security , beyond what is traditionally seen as the mission , ” said Frank Cilluffo , who was a special assistant to the president for homeland security and was a principal adviser to Gov. Tom Ridge , Bush ’s first homeland security adviser .
Cilluffo and Jackson favor appointing two principal deputies — one each for domestic and foreign issues — both of whom would report directly to Jones .
President Bush ’s former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser , Frances Townsend , said that whatever structure Obama eventually chooses , the person in charge of those issues should have adequate access to both the national security adviser and the president .
“ Mission , ” she said , “ is more important than structure . ”
Hadley , said sources at the transition meeting , has the same view .
Meanwhile , homeland security transition efforts are moving into high gear .
McGinnis said the Bush administration has identified a number of potential crisis scenarios that could confront the Obama team .
Jackson , the former homeland security deputy secretary , said officials began making plans several months ago to bring their successors into crisis simulation exercises .
According to sources at the coordinating council meeting , the Bush administration is sharing with the Obama team its contingency planning for specific emergencies ( see related GSN story , today ) .
The Bush team is , in effect , handing off to Obama ’s officials a playbook for handling potential crises .

Four people are said to have such " super- memories , " including the latest case , a Southern California man who researchers do n't plan to identify by name .
According to USA
Today , the man recalls in detail most days of his life , as well as the day and date of key public events , said researchers Larry Cahill .
The newspaper interviewed Jill Price , another person with a super memory .
Price discussed her mind lat year in the book " The Woman Who Can't Forget . "
There is much about memory that scientists do n't understand .
Only this month , in fact , they found that a single brain cell can hold a memory for a brief period before it 's put in long - term storage , a feat that requires connections between brain cells .
Two areas in Price 's brain are responsible : the caudate nuclei , typically used for memory when forming automatic habits ; and a part of the temporal lobe that stores facts , dates and events , Cahill told USA TODAY .
The two brain areas might work together , in ways not realized before , to make allow the unforgettable connections .
Better understanding of the condition could lead to improvements in grasping the science of memory in regular folks , the researchers figure .

Advertisement A suicide bomber has killed at least 50 people at a restaurant near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk , a regional official has told the BBC .
Around 100 people were also injured in the blast at the Kurdish restaurant , some 5 km ( three miles ) north of the ethnically mixed city , police say .
Kurdish officials were in the restaurant having lunch with Arab tribal leaders at the time .
The blast came as Muslims celebrated the Eid- al - Adha holiday .
Families were eating lunch in the Abdullah restaurant , located on the main road to Irbil , when it happened .
A suicide bomber activated an explosives belt in the middle of the restaurant , officials and at least one witness say .
A branch of the same restaurant in Kirkuk was hit by a car bomb last year , with 25 people killed .
Relations in Kirkuk have often been tense between Iraqi Arabs , Kurds and Turkmens .
Bereaved families
A restaurant guard said the explosion had happened shortly after a man had parked his car outside and walked into the building .
I do n't know where my children and my father are

Wounded survivor , 24
In pictures : Restaurant attack Analysis : Kirkuk faultline
The injured were taken to Kirkuk 's main hospital , with 30 of them in a serious condition , an AFP news agency reporter says .
As the authorities appealed for blood donors , the reporter met families bereaved by the blast .
Outside the emergency room , a five - year - old boy was crying , saying he had lost both of his parents .
Reskiya Oji , a 49 - year - old Turkmen who was wounded in the arm and the leg , said from a hospital bed that her daughter , four , had been killed and she did not know the fate of her two sons .
Rezkar Mahmoud , a 24 - year - old Kurd who was wounded in the leg , said he had been having lunch with his father , wife and children .
" The restaurant was full when the bomb exploded , " he said .
" It sent glass flying and destroyed the walls .
" I do n't know where my children and my father are . "
At the restaurant , the floor was littered with broken glass and spotted with blood while plates of food and soft drinks cans stood abandoned on tables .
The deputy head of Kirkuk 's provincial council , Rebwar Talabani , said the restaurant had been popular with politicians .
" It was packed with people who go there because it 's safer [ than other restaurants ] , " he told al - Jazeera TV .
" All kinds of people would go there , even politicians would hold their big meetings there . "
Disputed region
The deputy governor of Kirkuk , Saeed Rakan , told the BBC Arabic service that the attack appeared to have been politically motivated .
Children were among the casualties A Patriotic Union of Kurdistan delegation was meeting councillors from the al - Hawija area , he said , adding : " I think al - Hawija councillors were the target .
A number of them sustained light injuries .
The bodyguards of al - Hawija council chairman were badly injured . "
Although violent incidents in Iraq as a whole have dropped sharply this year , the area around the northern cities of Kirkuk and Mosul remains dangerous , the BBC's Humphrey Hawksley reports from Baghdad .
Tension is so high in Kirkuk that provincial elections planned for most of Iraq next year will not be held in the city , our correspondent adds .
Control of oil - rich Kirkuk is disputed between Iraqi Arabs , Kurds and ethnic Turkmens .
Iraqi Kurds believe they should control the city , which has a Kurdish majority , but it lies outside their semi-autonomous northern enclave .
Ethnic Arabs and Turkmens say it should be under the control of the central government .

Editor 's Note :
We are posting this feature from our December 2007 issue because of a discussion on the semantic web at ScienceOnline09 .
Six years ago in this magazine , Tim Berners - Lee , James Hendler and Ora Lassila unveiled a nascent vision of the Semantic Web : a highly interconnected network of data that could be easily accessed and understood by any desktop or handheld machine .
They painted a future of intelligent software agents that would head out on the World Wide Web and automatically book flights and hotels for our trips , update our medical records and give us a single , customized answer to a particular question without our having to search for information or pore through results .
They also presented the young technologies that would make this vision come true : a common language for representing data that could be understood by all kinds of software agents ; ontologies — sets of statements — that translate information from disparate databases into common terms ; and rules that allow software agents to reason about the information described in those terms .
The data format , ontologies and reasoning software would operate like one big application on the World Wide Web , analyzing all the raw data stored in online databases as well as all the data about the text , images , video and communications the Web contained .
Like the Web itself , the Semantic Web would grow in a grassroots fashion , only this time aided by working groups within the World Wide Web Consortium , which helps to advance the global medium .
Since then skeptics have said the Semantic Web would be too difficult for people to understand or exploit .
Not so .
The enabling technologies have come of age .
A vibrant community of early adopters has agreed on standards that have steadily made the Semantic Web practical to use .
Large companies have major projects under way that will greatly improve the efficiencies of in - house operations and of scientific research .
Other firms are using the Semantic Web to enhance business - to - business interactions and to build the hidden data - processing structures , or back ends , behind new consumer services .
And like an iceberg , the tip of this large body of work is emerging in direct consumer applications , too .
Just below the Surface The Semantic Web is not different from the World Wide Web .
It is an enhancement that gives the Web far greater utility .
It comes to life when people immersed in a certain field or vocation , whether it be genetic research or hip - hop music , agree on common schemes for representing information they care about .
As more groups develop these taxonomies , Semantic Web tools allow them to link their schemes and translate their terms , gradually expanding the number of people and communities whose Web software can understand one another automatically .
Perhaps the most visible examples , though limited in scope , are the tagging systems that have flourished on the Web .
These systems include del.icio.us , Digg and the DOI system used by publishers , as well as the sets of custom tags available on social sites such as MySpace and Flickr .
In these schemes , people select common terms to describe information they find or post on certain Web sites .
Those efforts , in turn , enable Web programs and browsers to find and crudely understand the tagged information — such as finding all Flickr photographs of sunrises and sunsets taken along the coast of the Pacific Ocean .
Yet the tags within one system do not work on the other , even when the same term , such as “ expensive , ” is used .
As a result , these systems cannot scale up to analyze all the information on the Web .
The World Wide Web Consortium — an ad hoc organization of more than 400 companies and universities co-hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. , the European Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics in France , and Keio University in Japan — has already released the Semantic Web languages and technologies needed to cross such boundaries , and large companies are exploiting them .
For example , British Telecom has built a prototype online service to help its many vendors more effectively develop new products together .
Boeing is exploring the technologies to more efficiently integrate the work of partners involved in airplane design .
Chevron is experimenting with ways to manage the life cycle of power plants and oil refineries .
MITRE Corporation is applying Semantic
Web tool kits to help the U.S. military interpret rules of engagement for convoy movements .
The U.K. ’s national mapping agency , Ordnance Survey , uses the Semantic Web internally to more accurately and inexpensively generate geographic maps .
Other companies are improving the back - end operations of consumer services .
Vodafone Live ! , a multimedia portal for accessing ring tones , games and mobile applications , is built on Semantic Web formats that enable subscribers to download content to their phones much faster than before .
Harper ’s Magazine has harnessed semantic ontologies on its
Web site to present annotated timelines of current events that are automatically linked to articles about concepts related to those events .
Joost , which is putting television on the Web for free , is using Semantic Web software to manage the schedules and program guides that viewers use online .
Consumers are also beginning to use the data language and ontologies directly .
One example is the Friend of a Friend ( FOAF ) project , a decentralized social - networking system that is growing in a purely grassroots way .
Enthusiasts have created a Semantic Web vocabulary for describing people ’s names , ages , locations , jobs and relationships to one another and for finding common interests among them .
FOAF users can post information and imagery in any format they like and still seamlessly connect it all , which MySpace and Facebook cannot do because their fields are incompatible and not open to translation .
More than one million individuals have already interlinked their FOAF files , including users of LiveJournal and TypePad , two popular Weblog services .
As these examples show , people are moving toward building a Semantic Web where relations can be established among any online pieces of information , whether an item is a document , photograph , tag , financial transaction , experiment result or abstract concept .
The data language , called Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) , names each item , and the relations among the items , in a way that allows computers and software to automatically interchange the information .
Additional power comes from ontologies and other technologies that create , query , classify and reason about those relations .
The Semantic Web thus permits workers in different organizations to use their own data labels instead of trying to agree industry - wide on one rigid set ; it understands that term “ X ” in database 1 is the same as term “ Y ” in database 2 .
What is more , if any term in database 1 changes , the other databases and the data - integration process itself will still understand the new information and update themselves automatically .
Finally , the Semantic Web enables the deployment of “ reasoners ” — software programs that can discover relations among data sources .
Just as the HTML and XML languages have made the original Web robust , the RDF language and the various ontologies based on it are maturing , and vendors are building applications based on them .
IBM , Hewlett - Packard and Nokia are promoting open - source Semantic Web frameworks — common tools for crafting polished programs .
Oracle ’s flagship commercial database , 10g , used by thousands of corporations worldwide , already supports RDF , and the upgrade , 11g , adds further Semantic Web technology .
The latest versions of Adobe ’s popular graphics programs such as Photoshop use the same technologies to manage photographs and illustrations .
Smaller vendors — among them Aduna Software , Altova , @semantics , Talis , OpenLink Software , TopQuadrant and Software AG — offer Semantic
Web database programs and ontology editors that are akin to the HTML browsers and editors that facilitated the Web ’s vibrant growth .
Semantic
Web sites can now be built with virtually all of today ’s major computer programming languages , including Java , Perl and C ++.
We are still finding our way toward the grand vision of agents automating the mundane tasks of our daily lives .
But some of the most advanced progress is taking place in the life sciences and health care fields .
Researchers in these disciplines face tremendous data - integration challenges at almost every stage of their work .
Case studies of real systems built by these pioneers show how powerful the Semantic Web can be .
Case Study 1 : Drug Discovery
The traditional model for medicinal drugs is that one size fits all .
Have high blood pressure ?
Take atenolol .
Have anxiety ?
Take Valium .
But because each person has a unique set of genes and lives in a particular physical and emotional environment , certain individuals will respond better than others .
Today , however , a greater understanding of biology and drug activity is beginning to be combined with tools that could predict which drugs — and what doses — will work for a given individual .
Such predictions should make custom - tailored , or personalized , medical treatments increasingly possible .
The challenge , of course , is to somehow meld a bewildering array of data sets : all sorts of historic and current medical records about each person and all sorts of scientific reports on a number of drugs , drug tests , potential side effects and outcomes for other patients .
Traditional database tools cannot handle the complexity , and manual attempts to combine the databases would be prohibitively expensive .
Just maintaining the data is difficult : each time new scientific knowledge is incorporated into one data source , others linked to it must be reintegrated , one by one .
A research team at Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center is leveraging semantic capabilities to find the underlying genetic causes of cardiovascular diseases .
Traditionally , researchers would search for genes that behave differently in normal and diseased tissues , assuming that these genes could somehow be involved in causing the pathology .
This exercise could yield tens or hundreds of suspect genes .
Researchers would then have to pore through four or five databases for each one , trying to discern which genes ( or the proteins they encode ) have features most likely to affect the biology of the disorder — a painstaking task .
In the end , investigators often cannot afford the hours , and the work falters .
The Cincinnati team , which includes a Semantic Web consultant , began by downloading into a workstation the databases that held relevant information but from different origins and in incompatible formats .
These databases included Gene Ontology ( containing data on genes and gene products ) , MeSH ( focused on diseases and symptoms ) , Entrez Gene ( gene - centered information ) and OMIM ( human genes and genetic disorders ) .
The investigators translated the formats into RDF and stored the information in a Semantic Web database .
They then used Protégé and Jena , freely available Semantic Web software from Stanford University and HP Labs , respectively , to integrate the knowledge .
The researchers then prioritized the hundreds of genes that might be involved with cardiac function by applying a ranking algorithm somewhat similar to the one Google uses to rank Web pages of search results .
They found candidate genes that could potentially play a causative role in dilated cardiomyopathy , a weakening of the heart ’s pumping ability .
The team instructed the software to evaluate the ranking information , as well as the genes ’ relations to the characteristics and symptoms of the condition and similar diseases .
The software identified four genes with a strong connection to a chromosomal region implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy .
The researchers are now investigating the effects of these genes ’ mutations as possible targets for new therapeutic treatments .
They are also applying the semantic system to other cardiovascular diseases and expect to realize the same dramatic improvement in efficiency .
The system could also be readily applied to other disease families .
Similarly , senior scientists at Eli Lilly are applying Semantic Web technologies to devise a complete picture of the most likely drug targets for a given disease .
Semantic tools are allowing them to compile numerous incompatible biological descriptions into one unified file , greatly expediting the search for the next breakthrough drug .
Pfizer is using Semantic
Web technologies to mesh data sets about protein - protein interaction to reveal obscure correlations that could help identify promising medications .
Researchers there are convinced that these technologies will increase the chance for serendipitous discoveries , accelerate the speed of delivering new drugs to market and advance the industry as a whole toward personalized medicine .
“ This is where the Semantic Web could help us , ” says Giles Day , head of Pfizer ’s Research Technology Center informatics group in Cambridge , Mass .
In each of these cases , the Semantic Web enhances drug discovery by bringing together vast and varied data from different places .
New consumer services are being built in similar fashion .
For example , the British firm Garlik uses Semantic
Web software to compare previously incompatible databases to alert subscribers that they might be the target of an identity thief .
Garlik culls disparate personal identity information from across the Web , integrates it using common vocabularies and rules , and presents subscribers with a clear ( and sometimes surprising ) view of their online identity .
Case Study 2 : Health Care
The health care industry confronts an equally dense thicket of information .
One initiative that has been deployed since 2004 was developed at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to better detect , analyze and respond to emerging public health problems .
The system , called SAPPHIRE ( for situational awareness and preparedness for public health incidences using reasoning engines ) , integrates a wide range of data from local health care providers , hospitals , environmental protection agencies and scientific literature .
It allows health officials to assess the information through different lenses , such as tracking the spread of influenza or the treatment of HIV cases .
Every 10 minutes in the greater Houston area , SAPPHIRE receives reports on emergency room cases , descriptions of patients ’ self - reported symptoms , updated electronic health rec-ords , and clinicians ’ notes from eight hospitals that account for more than 30 percent of the region ’s emergency room visits .
Semantic technologies integrate this information into a single view of current health conditions across the area .
A key feature is an ontology that classifies unexplained illnesses that present flulike symptoms ( fevers , coughs and sore throats ) as potential influenza cases and automatically reports them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
By automatically generating reports , SAPPHIRE has relieved nine nurses from doing such work manually , so they are available for active nursing .
And it delivers reports two to three days faster than before .
The CDC is now helping local health departments nationwide to implement similar systems , replacing tedious , inconsistent and decades - old paper schemes .
The nimbleness of Semantic Web technologies allows SAPPHIRE to operate effectively in other contexts as well .
When Hurricane Katrina evacuees poured into Houston ’s shelters , public health officials quickly became concerned about the possible spread of disease .
Within eight hours after the shelters were opened , personnel at the University of Texas Health Science Center configured SAPPHIRE to help .
They armed public health officials with small handheld computers loaded with health questionnaires .
The responses from evacuees were then uploaded to the system , which integrated them with data from the shelters ’ emergency clinics and surveillance reports from Houston Department of Health and Human Services epidemiologists in the field .
SAPPHIRE succeeded in identifying gastrointestinal , respiratory and conjunctivitis outbreaks in survivors of the disaster much sooner than would have been possible before .
SAPPHIRE ’s flexibility showcases an important lesson about Semantic Web systems : once they are configured for a general problem — in this case , public health reporting — they can quickly be adapted to a variety of situations within that field .
Indeed , the CDC would like to roll out a single , integrated , SAPPHIRE - style illness alert system nationwide .
SAPPHIRE succeeds because it can unify information from many places , which can then be used for different goals .
This same attribute is fueling FOAF ’s grassroots growth .
By using an agreed - on Semantic Web vocabulary , the FOAF system finds common interests among friends and acquaintances , even if they do not belong to the same social - networking sites such as MySpace or Facebook .
FOAF enthusiasts are also now developing semantic trust networks — white lists of trusted senders — as a way to fight e-mail spam .
Crossing Boundaries
The success of SAPPHIRE and other applications has prompted calls for more Semantic Web integration in health care .
The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have both recently declared that a shift toward research into translating data across boundaries is necessary for improving the drug development and delivery process .
The same work will enhance the traditional computerized clinical decision support ( CDS ) systems that medical professionals use — knowledge bases that contain the latest wisdom on therapeutic treatments .
Each hospital , physicians ’ network and insurance company has had to custom - design its own system , and all of them are struggling mightily to stay current .
Every time an advance is made about diagnoses , clinical procedures or drug safety — which is often — administrators must rework their systems .
The personnel time required is usually far greater than most of these organizations can afford .
Furthermore , because the custom systems are frequently incompatible , making industry - wide insights or deciphering best practices is slow and cumbersome .
What is more , “ we are investigating Semantic Web technologies because traditional approaches for data integration , knowledge management and decision support will not scale to what is needed for personalized medicine , ” says John Glaser , chief information officer at Partners HealthCare System in Boston .
To remedy this situation , Agfa HealthCare has constructed a prototype CDS system based on Semantic Web technologies .
When a person inputs a change into one part of a system , rec-ords that should be altered in other parts of the system or in the systems of another institution are automatically updated .
For example , Agfa ’s prototype transforms standard radiology protocols into Semantic Web notation and integrates them with other common knowledge bases , such as clinical guidelines from medical societies .
Institutions can maintain their own internally standardized content , yet end users such as hospitals can readily integrate new content , greatly reducing the labor hours required .
As systems such as Agfa ’s are implemented across the health care network , medical knowledge bases will become smarter , easier and less expensive to use .
Imagine a patient who is prone to blood clots and has a genetic mutation that , according to current medical literature , will respond well to a new anticlotting medication .
Over the ensuing months , however , new studies show that particular variants of this mutation actually cause that same drug to increase clotting .
This patient ’s clinician must be notified to change the therapy for anyone with this variant .
How could notifications such as this be effectively carried out given that thousands of genes are involved in hundreds of diseases across millions of patients ?
Meeting this challenge will not be possible without robust semantic approaches .
Daily Life , Too
The same Semantic
Web technologies that are transforming drug discovery and health care are being applied to more general situations .
One example is Science Commons , which helps researchers openly post data on the Web .
The nonprofit organization provides Semantic Web tools for attaching legally binding copyright and licensing information to those data .
This capability allows a scientist , for example , to instruct a software applet to go find information about a particular gene — but only information that comes with a free license .
DBpedia is an effort to smartly link information within Wikipedia ’s seven million articles .
This project will allow Web surfers to perform detailed searches of Wikipedia ’s content that are impossible today , such as , “ Find me all the films nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award before 1990 that ran longer than three hours . ”
As applications develop , they will dovetail with research at the Web consortium and elsewhere aimed at fulfilling the Semantic Web vision .
Reaching agreement on standards can be slow , and some skeptics wonder if a big company could overtake this work by promoting a set of proprietary semantic protocols and browsers .
Perhaps .
But note that numerous companies and universities are involved in the consortium ’s semantic working groups .
They realize that if these groups can devise a few well - designed protocols that support the broadest Semantic Web possible , there will be more room in the future for any company to make money from it .
Some observers also worry that people ’s privacy could become compromised as more data about them from disparate sources is interlinked .
But Semantic
Web advocates argue that the protections are the same as those used in the non-linked world .
If two databases joined by the Semantic Web have different privacy criteria , then the software will have to honor both sets of rules or create a set that covers both .
When SAPPHIRE joins patient databases , it adheres to the privacy requirements of both or it wo n’t proceed ; the nurses who had formerly performed the same mergers manually imposed the same practice .
The Semantic Web will probably operate more behind the scenes than the World Wide Web does .
We wo n’t see how it helps Eli Lilly create personalized drugs ; we ’ll just buy them .
We wo n’t know how Vodafone makes cool ring tones so readily available , but we ’ll appreciate how easy they are to download .
And yet , soon enough the Semantic Web will give more direct power to us , too , allowing us to go on eBay and not just say “ find me the Toyota Priuses for sale ” but “ find me only used , red Priuses for sale for less than $ 14,000 by people who are within 80 miles of my house and make them an offer . ”
Grand visions rarely progress exactly as planned , but the Semantic Web is indeed emerging and is making online information more useful than ever .
Euro anniversaries might seem two a penny these days .
The most recent was the 10th birthday of the European Central Bank in May .
But the anniversary that falls at midnight tonight – the moment , 10 years ago , when the exchange rates of Europe 's major currencies , including the Deutsche Mark , the French franc and the Dutch guilder , were linked together and fixed – marks the point of no return .
A project that had once been a mere gleam in the eye of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing had materialised into European monetary union .
Without it , the notes and coins , now taken almost for granted across so much of Europe , would not have come into circulation three years later .
In a remarkably short time , the euro has become a world reserve currency , cohabiting with the US dollar , if not challenging its supremacy .
That achievement alone would qualify the euro to be judged a success .
That tomorrow 's anniversary coincides with a high point of the euro – in many different respects – is a happy coincidence for its early advocates .
In strictly economic terms , the thesis may be suspect , but at popular level , the strength of a currency reflects the internationally perceived standing of the nation , or group of nations , that use it – and that this in turn reflects the way the country thinks about itself .
After a tentative start , the rise of the euro against the US dollar and the recent sharp devaluation of sterling against both currencies testify to the relative strength of the eurozone economies and the positive light in which the European Union is widely seen .

The present head of the European Central Bank , Jean - Claude Trichet , has steered a steady course through the turbulence of the past year .
Fears that competing pressures from different national economies would weaken the euro , perhaps spelling its collapse , have proved unfounded .
So far , the reverse has happened , with countries that had shunned the single currency , such as Denmark , reconsidering their position .
But the transformation of economic fortunes brought about by the global economic crisis also poses crucial questions for Britain .
As the pound sinks , apparently inevitably , to parity with the euro , it is reasonable to ask not only whether Britain made a mistake in not joining the euro at its inception , but whether euro - membership should not now become a priority .
The Business Secretary , Lord Mandelson – perhaps the chief cheerleader for the euro in the Cabinet – has insisted that the Government has too much on its hands to fast - track such a contentious policy just now , while maintaining that euro membership remains a long - term aim .
But is this really good enough ?
The British public has been given no further insight into official thinking since 2003 , when Gordon Brown , as Chancellor , closed down renewed debate , by saying that his " five tests " had not been met .
That might have been true then .
Now , though , the validity of those five tests – met or not – must be of questionable relevance ; the economic and political context in which they belonged has changed utterly .
Simply listing these tests – convergence of interest rates , the impact on financial services , the need for market flexibility , the effect on growth , stability and jobs , and , finally , investment – shows how outdated they have become .
It is high time for the Government to consider the merits of euro membership in the present circumstances , not against criteria rooted in the past .
With the following file you ’ll be able to have ClusterSSH like experience from within Emacs and some term buffers .
The cssh.el offer those bindings :
C-= asks remote hostname then opens a term and ssh to it
C-= from IBuffer mode opens ClusterSSH controler on marked buffers
C-u C-= asks for the name of the ClusterSSH controler buffer
C - M-= matches given regexp against ssh known_hosts and open buffers in which ssh < remote > is typed
and open buffers in which ssh < remote > is typed C-u C - M -= asks for a name before
While in the * cssh * controler buffer , you ’re in line mode .
Free typing will not impact any term.el buffer until you hit one of those keys :
RET sends current line ( skipping the prompt ) to all controlled terms
C -c sends C-c to all controlled terms
C -d sends C -d to all controlled terms
C-l sends C-l to all controlled terms
[ up ] sends up to all controlled terms
[ down ] sends down to all controlled terms
[ tab ] sends current line content to all controlled terms , then a tab ( C - i )
And those special keys for the mode to be more than practical :
C-= reopens the windows , so you can switch to full screen other buffers etc and get back to your controller and its terms
C-! send the ssh command to log to remote places to all buffers , in case your emacs buffers live for more time than the ssh connection they host

The Treasury rally continued in spectacular fashion in conjunction with the ZIRP Arrival : Fed Targets Interest Rates 0 to 1/4 Percent .
From the FOMC Press Release .
The focus of the Committee 's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet at a high level .
As previously announced , over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets , and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities as conditions warrant .
The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer - term Treasury securities .

Treasury Yields
Quantitative Easing American Style
The Federal Reserve opened a new era in U.S. monetary history , cutting interest rates to as low as zero and pledging to buy unlimited quantities of securities , after conventional policies failed to arrest what may be the worst recession since World War II .
The new strategy is likely to involve unusually close cooperation with the Treasury of President - elect Barack Obama , which is still formulating its economic - rescue plans .
The aim is to kick - start borrowing and spending to propel the economy toward a recovery by the middle of next year .
“ It ’s going to take a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus to get the job done , ” said former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley , now senior economic adviser at Stanford Group Co. in Washington .
The central bank has signaled it will “ make sure that the fiscal stimulus package , which is going to be a big one , is fully supported ” and “ in effect financed by the Fed . ”
“ We are running out of the traditional ammunition that is used in a recession , ” Obama said at a news conference yesterday .
While the Fed is going to have “ more tools available to it , it is critical that the other branches of government step up , ” he said .
“ The only meaningful limitation right now is their capacity to be creative , ” said David Resler , chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. , New York .
“ The Fed is telling us there is just about nothing off the table . ”
“ The availability of Fed credit might deter private credit , ” said Vincent Reinhart , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and former director of the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Fed Board .
“ The lender of last resort becomes the lender of only resort . ”
“ Quantitative easing American style is what they ’re giving us , ” said Allen Sinai , chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc. , New York .
“ The Japanese style was to buy government maturities .
The U.S. style is directly buying agency securities , buying mortgage - backed securities and lending money right into the private sector . ”
October 17 , 2008
Lucy Herschel and Hannah Wolfe report on how police met antiwar dissent with batons and horses at the last presidential debate in New York .
WHILE BARACK Obama and John McCain were getting makeup touch - ups for their Wednesday night debate at Hofstra University , in Hempstead , N.Y. , police outside made sure that the voices of antiwar veterans would n't be heard .
Officers of the Nassau County Police Department reacted with reckless violence to a protest organized by Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) outside the debate site .
Among several people injured in the assault , former Army Sgt. Nick Morgan was knocked unconscious and his cheekbone broken when he was trampled by a police horse .
" We were there to force the issue that the leaders of this nation are not listening to or are not caring about veterans , " said IVAW member Matthis Chiroux , who was among several veterans and activists arrested .
" And they could n't have done a better job of proving us right .
They stomped my friend Nick 's face into Jell - o .
I put this on both candidates , on the major press and on the Nassau County police . "
The IVAW had sent a request to the debate moderator that they be allowed to ask their own questions of the candidates at the Hofstra event , but this was ignored -- and so the third and final presidential debate passed without an antiwar voice being represented .
Nassau County police injured several people in their assault on antiwar protests outside the presidential debate
That night , IVAW organized a nonviolent demonstration to request entry into the debate .
Marching in uniform and in formation , IVAW members led several hundred activists to an intersection in front of the Hofstra campus gates -- where they were confronted by an army of mounted police and riot cops .
Ten IVAW members were arrested , apparently for no more than insisting on their right to be heard .
Mounted police then pushed the crowd back onto the sidewalk , recklessly pulling their horses around and at times backing them into the crowd .
The police continued to drive protesters back , pinning the crowd up against a fence .
Riot cops reached past the IVAW members at the front of the crowd , grabbing protesters behind them and dragging them into the street .
A mounted cop leapt with his horse onto the sidewalk and trampled protesters , including Morgan .
Chiroux said the police took Morgan aside and bandaged him , but then placed him in a truck with other arrestees to go to processing and detention .
" He was incoherent , he could n't even say his name , " Chiroux said .
" He had blood running down his face .
We kept telling the police he needed immediate medical attention .
One officer said , with a smirk , ' Get him to say it .
He has to say it . '
I said , ' He can't even talk ! '
The officer said , ' Tough luck . '
Finally , we said , ' Nick , you have to say I need to go to the hospital . '
We got him to say it , and they took him in . "
CHIROUX SAID that while they were detained , he and his fellow IVAW members were verbally harassed by police .
" They called us traitors , cowards , idiots , " he said .
Three women IVAW members who had been arrested were handcuffed to a bench , and " the male officers kept coming closer to them , verbally sexually harassing them , " Chiroux said .
" One kept holding up Marlisa 's ID to her face and saying , ' Wow , you look like you came out of a Barbie magazine . ' "
Morgan was brought back from the hospital , still incoherent and in great pain .
He was left chained to a bench for five hours without further medical attention , Chiroux said .
IVAW members repeatedly asked officers for their names ( they were n't wearing badges ) or to contact lawyers -- they were refused on all counts .
When most of the IVAW members were finally released at 2:30 a.m. ( according to reports , one vet remained in custody as this report was written ) , they went , still in uniform , to a nearby diner -- where the same group of cops who had detained them were eating .
Chiroux went up to them and asked again for their names .
One officer " got up in my face , " he said , " screaming and waving his finger at me and saying , ' I 'm gonna kick your ass if you keep asking that . ' "
The IVAW members say they wanted to ask Barack Obama if he would support soldiers who refuse to serve in Iraq , since in the past , he had called the Iraq war illegal .
They also wanted to question John McCain about his votes to cut veterans benefits .
" Neither of the candidates have shown real support for soldiers and veterans , " said Jason Lemieux , a former sergeant in the Marine Corps and a member of IVAW who served three tours in Iraq .
" We came here to try and get serious questions answered -- questions that we , as veterans of the Iraq war , have a right to ask -- but instead we were arrested .
We believe that the time has come to end this war and bring our troops home , and we will be pushing for that no matter what happens in this election . "
IVAW members thanked activists for coming to support the march and for enduring the police violence .
" For many of our members , this was their first protest , " said Hannah Fleury of the Campus Antiwar Network , which mobilized chapters from as far away as Boston for this protest .
" Now that we see what we 're up against , we 're going to fight even harder on our campuses to end the war , and to support the veterans . "
The New York Civil Liberties Union is asking for an immediate investigation into the use of horses at the demonstration .
" It is shocking that someone who served his country would be treated so disgracefully by the Nassau County Police Department , " Tara Keenan - Thomson , director of the group 's Nassau County chapter , said in a press release .
As Chiroux said , " Both candidates claim they support veterans .
And this is how we got supported last night : by being pushed back , trampled and arrested .
" We demonstrated to the country and the world that democracy is not dead in the United States - - that the people in the U.S. still ultimately hold the power .
They can try to force our voices to be silent , to block us out of the media , but we wo n't let these people shut us down . "

British pupils ' lead the western world at maths ' - but Borat 's glorious nation of Kazakhstan puts us to shame
Children in comedy character Borat 's nation of Kazakhstan performed better than English children at maths
Primary school pupils lead the western world in maths skills , according to a new survey .
Our ten - year - olds have outstripped their peers in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand as well as the rest of Europe , including Germany , Italy , the Netherlands and Sweden .
But the news from the international comparison of 425,000 youngsters was not all good .
English children have been passed in their turn by youngsters from Kazakhstan , the former Soviet Republic portrayed as a nation of barely - civilised simpletons by Sacha Baron Cohen 's comic creation Borat .
Experts said a traditional curriculum and a belief in the importance of maths and science were behind Kazakhstan 's success .
Though poverty is widespread in the oil - producing country , it has an emerging middle class keen on rigorous academic education .
The improvement among English
children follows the introduction of a daily numeracy lesson in primary schools , which put renewed emphasis on times tables and arithmetic .
The survey , known as Timms ( Trends in International Maths and Science Study ) , is held every four years .
Our ten - year - olds were 17th of 26 countries in 1995 but seventh of 36 last year , while 14 - year - olds were seventh of 49 - up from 25th of 41 in 1995 .
Among ten - year - olds England was decisively outperformed only by countries on the Pacific Rim , including Japan and South Korea .
The result contrasts sharply with two similar studies last year which showed Britain plummeting down the world rankings .
Schools Minister Jim Knight said the findings of Timms were unambiguous .
' Our teenagers are leading Europe , ' he said .
' We can be really proud of our position in maths and science . '
But Shadow Children 's Secretary Michael
Gove said : ' It hardly gives confidence that we will compete in hard subjects that count when countries with all Kazakhstan 's disadvantages are outstripping ours ' .
' I'm happy to have - have met you ' : Borat may have broken English , but his nation 's skills at maths are near the top of the chart
Education expert Professor Alan Smithers warned : ' We have been here before .
We did well in maths in a different international survey in 2000 .
' When the dust had settled , it became clear this was because of a low response rate and an over - representation of leading schools including independent schools .
' We do n't know yet whether this year 's results are the start of a welcome trend or just another blip . '
The Buckingham University professor pointed out that many countries who usually do well in surveys were absent this time , including Finland , Canada and Belgium .
In science , England 's ten - year - olds slipped from fifth place in the 2003 survey to seventh last year .
Fourteen - year - olds rose two places , but their level of knowledge was no better .
The survey , co-ordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement , highlighted weaknesses in some aspects of maths in England , particularly algebra and number computation .
There was also evidence that schools do not stretch the brightest children .
Improvements were mainly among ' middle attainers ' .
Worryingly , the study found a sharp decline in children 's attitudes to both maths and science .
They were less likely than in the past to enjoy the subjects , amid claims that teachers spend too much time drilling them for tests .

United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) , the largest coalition of peace organizations ( over 1,400 of them ) in the United States , held a national assembly in Chicago December 12 - 14 , and drafted documents establishing the movement ’s agenda for the coming year .
Proposals to work for the prosecution of high officials guilty of war crimes , including the crime of launching an aggressive war , were approved and written into all three of UFPJ ’s key documents , which are revised from year to year , including the Unity Statement , the Strategic Framework , and the Program Document .
The last of these lists projects the coalition will organize around and actually work to move forward in the coming months .
UFPJ also established a strong position in favor of complete withdrawal from Afghanistan , and laid plans to work toward resolving economic crises by shifting public resources from the military and wars to human needs .
As part of this project , UFPJ delegates voted for a plan to organize a massive demonstration in New York City on April 4 , the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. ’s 1967 speech against the Vietnam War at Riverside Church .
This plan was approved instead of a competing proposal for a protest in Washington , D.C. , on March 21st , the Saturday closest to the sixth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq .
Delegates to the conference strategized new goals and potential coalitions in an environment changed by elections and economic turmoil .
Making connections between the economy and the financial cost of war was a major focus .
Another was working to push Congress , not only to make that shift in resources , but to end wars and refuse escalations on a timeline and in ways superior to the recent withdrawal agreement or the apparent plans of the incoming Obama administration .
At the same time , the peace movement will be looking for ways to build on the better of the sometimes contradictory commitments made by the new president , including his promises to end the war in Iraq and to end the “ tyranny of oil . ”
A lot of thinking went into consideration of the many people who actively supported Obama ’s election but have not yet actively supported peace , and how to work with them to advance changes we can all believe in .
The finished products of UFPJ ’s document drafting deliberations will be posted at www.unitedforpeace.org

Telephone Diplomacy Obama Reaches Out to European and World Leaders
Barack Obama has called Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown , but not the Kremlin .
On Thursday he began getting in touch with world leaders to search for joint solutions to the global financial crisis .
Liberal poster boy Tim Robbins , partner of movie star Susan Sarandon , caused a ruckus at a Manhattan polling center this morning when he learned his name was removed from the voting rolls .
Robbins , an actor and director , reportedly started screaming when a poll worker asked him to move over to make more room for other voters .
Police were called in and Robbins ended up going to a Manhattan courthouse to get proof he is a registered voter .
He then returned to the YMCA on 14th Street to cast a ballot .
“ He was real upset and obnoxious , ” a polling clerk at the YMCA told The Post after the incident .
The clerk quoted Robbins as saying , “ I ’m a voter and I have a right to be here . ”

It has evaded lovers for centuries , but in February we learned that the elusive and semi-mythical G spot had been captured on ultrasound for the first time .
Emmanuele Jannini at the University of L’Aquila in Italy discovered clear anatomical differences between women who claim to have vaginal orgasms – triggered by stimulation of the front vaginal wall without any simultaneous stimulation of the clitoris – and those that do n’t .
Apparently , the key is that women who orgasm during penetrative sex have a thicker area of tissue in the region between the vagina and urethra , meaning a simple scan could separate out the …

STIMULUS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY — TOGETHER AT LAST ….
Glenn Hubbard thinks the housing market is close to its natural bottom , and in order to keep it from overshooting it ’s time for the government to step in and start offering below - market mortgage rates .
Brad DeLong agrees :
All in all , I approve of the plan : having Fannie and Freddie buy up mortgages at market prices and refinance them at 4.5 % could do a lot of good for the country and make a fortune for the government .
I ’m agnostic on how close we are to a housing bottom .
My guess is that we still have a ways to go , but since it takes a while for a program like this to take effect , maybe now is the time to get started .
But if we ’re going to do some social engineering with mortgage loans , why not go whole hog ?
An outfit called Architecture 2030 , founded by Edward Mazria , suggests that we offer homeowners not just low - interest loans , but a sliding scale of low - interest loans that ’s conditioned on renovating their homes to increase energy efficiency .
Their proposed scale is on the right .
The nickel explanation is below :
Mazria walked me through a hypothetical example that highlighted the huge incentives the plan could unleash .
Say you ’re a homeowner with a $ 272,000 mortgage at 5.55 % , paying about $ 1550 a month .
You decide you want your mortgage rate to drop to 3 % .
In order to qualify for the reduction , you have to improve the energy efficiency of your home 75 % below code , and it ’s going to cost you a pretty penny : about $ 40,000 .
Existing tax credits would take care of about $ 10,000 of that cost .
The rest would get tacked on to your existing mortgage , bringing it up to $ 302,000 .
But , at 3 % , you ’d be paying only about $ 1280 — saving almost $ 300 a month on the mortgage alone , plus another $ 150 in reduced energy costs .
The value of your home rises , you have more disposable income , you ’ve given work to someone to do the upgrades for you — and s/he ’s now paying federal taxes , and you ’ve reduced your carbon footprint .
The Architecture 2030 folks claim that their program ( which has a component for commercial buildings as well ) would cost a mere $ 170 billion over two years , and in return would create over 8 million new jobs , jump start a new $ 1.6 trillion renovation market , save consumers a boatload of money , and reduce CO2 emission by about half a billion tons .
What ’s not to like ?
To be honest , I ’m not sure .
There ’s something a little too free - lunchish about this plan , and I figure there has to be a catch somewhere .
I invite everyone reading this to try and figure out what it is .
But if the sums really add up the way they say they do , it seems worth considering , no ?
About 200 people braved the bitter cold yesterday to gather outside Boston City Hall to urge President - elect Barack Obama to strongly support equal rights for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people .
The demonstrators oppose the federal Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage as union between a man and a woman ; they also object to the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy within the armed forces .
They called for passage of federal laws that would ban hate crimes and discrimination against employees because of their sexuality .
The rally was organized by Join the Impact MA , a group that formed shortly after the presidential election .
" We are calling attention , before the inauguration , to President Obama to [ fulfill ] the promises he made during the campaign , " said Jonathan Brett , director of the group .
Demonstrators carried signs bearing slogans such as " Obama Don't DOMA " and cheered for the speakers , who included US Representative Barney Frank , Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston , and Mayor E. Denise Simmons of Cambridge .
Frank , who is gay , said progress had been made toward equal rights , but people should n't be complacent .
" We can no longer tolerate people who tolerate intolerance , " he said .
He said the most effective way to be heard is to reach out to Congress and write letters to the president .
" I hope this rally inspires everyone here to write or call their representatives and senators , " he said .
Approaching the podium after Frank 's remarks , Menino looked back at Frank and quipped , " Everything that he said I agree with . "
The crowd laughed and cheered .
Menino said Massachusetts residents are " very fortunate " because elected officials have pushed for equal rights for gays .
He said the movement was strong , judging from the number of people willing to come out in the 16 - degree weather .
Simmons , who is a lesbian , echoed Frank and Menino 's messages .
" We have to lock arms and make those calls , write those letters , " she said .
Paul McMahon and Ralph Hodgdon were in the crowd , holding a sign that read , " 53 years together , 4 years married . "
" We have been activists from the beginning , " said Hodgdon , 74 .
Their sign featured a collage of photos documenting their life together .
They attended the rally to support the legalization of marriage and to push for action in Washington .
Not every gay person wants to get married , but it should be an option , said McMahon , 76 .
He said not being able to get married " is the highest form of discrimination .
There is nothing criminal about getting married . "
Thirty states have banned same - sex marriage .
Massachusetts is one of two states in which it is legal .
Opponents say that marriage should be allowed only between a man and woman .
They argue , among other things , that children are worse off when raised by same - sex parents .
The group marched past the State House and the rally ended at Old West Church .
As the march proceeded , people began to join in and at the church about 500 people showed their support , according to organizers .
" Obama said , ' Change . '
Now it 's time to act on that , " said Brett .

Here 's # 594 from my list of things that do n't make sense about Christianity .
God judges us not by our character and deeds in life but solely by whether or not we worshiped him strongly enough .
Now think about what that says about your god .
He 's more concerned with you being a fanboi than with how you lived your life .
I started losing my faith after a classmate asked the teacher what happened to non-Catholics after they died .
The answer was simple " they go to hell . "
The fact that they might have been good people who devoted their lives to helping others did n't score any points with bible - god .
Meanwhile wretched liars , fakes , and phonies will get into heaven by virtue of worshiping him .
Think about it :
At rock bottom , bible - god just wants you to worship him .
He does n't care what kind of person you were .
You know what this means do n't you ?
It means that bible - god 's heaven is the de facto hell because all the slimy bible - thumping televangelists will be there .
And most of the good people will be in hell .
If either place actually existed , I 'd take hell .
Up until recently , economies around the globe were on a fairly steady upward trajectory , a growth that put pricing pressure on some of the raw materials needed for both production and infrastructure .
That pricing pressure has , in some cases , led to a bit of a black market where the materials are forcibly recycled through various forms of theft .
Copper is one of these materials , and a variety of anecdotal news reports suggest that theft of copper from various places it 's in use has been an ongoing nuisance in the US .
Now , the FBI has performed an analysis of the situation that suggests copper theft actually poses a serious risk to the national infrastructure .
Copper 's electrical properties and relatively modest price have made it a mainstay of wiring , and it has also been used for applications such as plumbing and roofing .
As copper was even cheaper in the past , there 's quite a lot of it out there already .
A recent run-up in copper prices — the FBI says they rose 500 percent from 2001 to 2008 — has made all of that installed copper appealing to thieves .
There are three problems highlighted by the report .
The first is that a lot of the essential infrastructure that contains copper , ranging from pipes to electrical switching stations , are located where they 're unlikely to be monitored .
As such , it makes for a relatively tempting , low - risk target for theft .
A second issue is that this infrastructure has an importance that far outweighs its price .
The report describes an incident where thieves stripped a live transformer ( okay , so not all these thefts are low - risk ) of its copper , which probably yielded them a couple hundred dollars worth of profits .
For that money , nearly 4,000 people were left without power , and the utility rang up costs of about a half - million dollars .
In another case , the theft of copper in irrigation equipment apparently wiped out the crops it was supposed to be watering , causing $ 10 million in damages .
Other examples cited by the FBI involve basic public safety , as air traffic control and tornado warning systems have gone down due to the theft of copper wiring .
The economic meltdown has caused the price of copper to plummet since September , but the FBI report does n't offer much comfort in that regard .
It describes a number of rings of copper thieves that have been following house foreclosure announcements , and stripping the copper out of the abandoned houses .
This is nowhere near as serious an issue as the thefts that disable major infrastructure , but it certainly is n't helping anyone .
The third problem identified by the report is that these groups that engage in copper theft tend to be local , diffuse , and often ad - hoc .
Past arrests have identified both local criminal gangs and random groups of drug users involved in the thefts .
Recycling copper and other scrap metal is a legitimate business , so the thieves have many potential outlets .
All of this combines to make stopping the thefts a task for which there wo n't be a single magic bullet that works .
The report highlights how some states are getting tougher with their licensing and monitoring of scrap metal dealers , but it suggests that the key factor is that the actual thieves are rarely caught , and their crimes are often prosecuted as misdemeanors when they are .
The implication appears to be that copper theft will be an ongoing risk to the infrastructure until that changes .
Our managing editor suggested another partial solution : fiber to the premises would be immune to this theft .
You ’re a doctor .
You need to bring in $ 3,000 apiece for your most common procedure .
But Medicare and Medicaid — which pay for about half your patients — have just told you they ’re only going to pay you one - third of what they ’re billed .
What do you do ?
You do n’t need to be a CPA to know the answer is to start billing everyone $ 4,500 for your procedure .
The half of your patients who pay full price thus pay $ 1,500 extra , covering the $ 1,500 shortfall for each Medicare / Medicaid - covered procedure .
Now the tricky question :
If someone who ’s NOT on Medicaid or Medicare visits your medical office to have this procedure done , and promptly pays his or her $ 4,500 in full , how much has he or she paid you , this year ?
And the answer is : $ 6,000 .
Those who are not on Medicare or Medicaid are known as “ taxpayers . ”
Where do you think Medicare / Medicaid got the $ 1,500 to pay for the welfare patient ?
The taxpayer pays $ 4,500 for his or her own procedure , and then an extra $ 1,500 in taxes to fund someone else’s .
For all those who have written in insisting that we need government to pay our medical bills because they ’re so high , let ’s keep this simple :
Medical bills are really high because the government promises to pay most of them , the same way government - backed “ college loans ” have driven up the cost of college , by allowing colleges to charge you whatever you can afford plus whatever the government will loan .
Perhaps it ’s still technically a minority of Americans who are currently “ covered ” by Medicare and Medicaid .
But since the old and the poor ( the latter often skimping on health maintenance and prevention ) use the most medicine and medical care , the majority of medical COSTS are covered and “ paid for ” by these two socialist programs .
Some say as much as two thirds .
If we switched over to “ cash only ” medicine tomorrow — no government or even private insurance payments allowed — what do you suppose would happen to medical costs ?
Remember , the doctor who ’s been accustomed to billing $ 4,500 for a procedure really only gets $ 1,500 from Medicare / Medicaid , a scheme that ’s already jacked up YOUR cost by 50 percent .
Of that $ 1,500 , another $ 500 ( and that may be understated ) goes to pay doctors ’ non-medical office staff who negotiate bills and payments with the private and government “ insurance ” firms .
So the doc who “ billed ” $ 4,500 expected to get about half that .
The rest is only “ in there ” to buy off this unholy private - public “ insurance ” bureaucracy .
If he could fire all those non-medical “ billing ” people in his office , and if the doctor could again assume that most patients might pay the full amount billed on a timely basis , in cash , he or she could drop many posted charges from $ 4,500 to $ 2,000 overnight .
And what if that still did n’t produce enough business ?
Could our M.D. somehow manage to drop that price again , to $ 1,500 , advertising “ Lowest rates in town ” ?
In a true free market , he ’d have to .
Streamline his costs of “ regulatory compliance , ” and he could probably do even better .
Not only that , in a “ cash ” environment , conversations might be heard in the examining room which are virtually unknown today .
Conversations starting with :
“ There are three ways we can handle this problem .
The middle course will cost $ 500 and probably not do much good , which means you ’ll just have to come back for the $ 5,000 ‘ third - choice ’ procedure , anyway .
But first we may want to try something real simple that ’ll take a few weeks but will only cost you fifty bucks … ”
Or : “ There are three medicines I can give you for this .
The first two were recently patented and would cost you $ 500 a month and the salesgal who comes by to promote them has great knockers and wears short skirts and gives me all kinds of free notepads and ballpoint pens .
On the other hand , there ’s an old generic drug that ’ll probably do just as well or better for five bucks a month .
Want to try that first ? ”
Doctors long ago fell out of the habit of discussing things this way .
It sounds “ unprofessional . ”
But it ’s no more “ unprofessional ” than a roofer telling you about something he can try to repair your chimney flashing before you go to the expense of replacing your entire roof .
The difference is that roofers know you ’re likely to contact someone else — someone who wo n’t make them wait a month for “ an appointment ” because the number of practitioners in that profession are n’t as artificially limited by the state licensing agencies — if they get too arrogant and do n’t tell you all your options .
As medicine has gotten better , some treatments have been introduced which are just plain more expensive .
But a true free market always works to reduce such costs .
Compare the inflation - adjusted price of a color TV today to one in 1963 .
Government , on the other hand , pays on a “ cost - plus ” basis .
Far from creating pressure to make things cheaper , this creates an incentive to jack prices up , which is why taxpayers pay 20 bucks when a candy - striper brings a Medicare patient two aspirin in the hospital .
If government had undertaken to start buying us “ free ” color TVs in 1963 , from only “ licensed ” suppliers , they ’d still be clunky 300 - pound “ console ” models and they ’d now cost $ 12,000 apiece .
No , from regulation designed to limit entry into the field ( reducing price competition ) , to licensing , to socialist government “ insurance ” schemes , it ’s primarily government meddling that has made a nightmare of our medical costs .
So now we ’re prepared to believe the politicians when they tell us the solution is not a return to the free , unregulated , pre-1916 market in medicine , but rather … more government meddling , by the same people who have been busy “ fixing ” the banking industry since 1913 ?
And to those who say , “ That ’s unthinkable !
Snake oil and charlatans !
We want regulation !
It makes us feel safe ! ” —
First , licensing and regulation are protection rackets .
They keep supply down and prices up .
If regulation guarantees our safety , why ca n’t we sue the regulators when the doctors they “ regulate ” screw up ?
But second , answer me this , just once : America was supposed to be made up of 13 — now 50 — sovereign states , little greenhouses free to try all different ways of doing things .
I ’d gladly move to the one state — one out of 50 Ê– where medical liberty is restored , providing it also imposed no state income tax , no helmet or seatbelt or anti-smoking or “ endangered species ” or “ global warming ” or rural “ speed limit ” laws , that it “ allowed ” incandescent lightbulbs and full - sized rifle magazines and full - sized toilet tanks and encouraged the private ownership of machine guns .
( I just described all of America in 1912 , a place where our grandparents seemed pretty happy , only without the racism that CREATED the Wars on Guns and Drugs . )
Which state is that ?
If there are a couple million of us who want to try it another way , why ca n’t we have just one state to call our own ?
We ’re even willing to settle in the most inhospitable , God -forsaken desert you ’ve got .
If you liked all the taxes and regulations back in California or Illinois or New York or wherever you came from , why did you come here , determined to try and make this state just like the one you fled ?
Do you know the meaning of the word “ hubris ” ?
Has it never occurred to you the miners and ranchers who were already living in Nevada might have set things up just right for conditions here , and that you might want to check with them before you blithely insist on changing things in America ’s last endangered refuge of freedom to be just like that decaying , jobless hellhole you ran away from ?

Bob Dylan , " Blowin ' In The Wind "
What 's going on in Gaza right now is so incredibly tragic and unjust , not to mention unbelievably brutal and barbaric .
But I 'm not here to discuss how it is we came to this horrific situation .
No , that has been written about much more eloquently by others , people such as Avi Shlaim , an Oxford professor of international relations and an Israeli himself .
I 'd strongly recommend that everyone read his recent piece " How Israel brought Gaza to the brink of humanitarian catastrophe " .
It 's a definite must - read for anyone wanting to really understand this conflict and the whole long , sordid tale of Israel 's brutal treatment of the Palestinian people .
A sample :
" The Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the June 1967 war had very little to do with security and everything to do with territorial expansionism .
The aim was to establish Greater Israel through permanent political , economic and military control over the Palestinian territories .
And the result has been one of the most prolonged and brutal military occupations of modern times . "
To further understand the terrible reality of this occupation I 'd highly recommend that everyone also read Jennifer Loewenstein 's recent piece , " If Hamas Did Not Exist : Israel Has No Intention of Granting a Palestinian State " .
So , no , I 'm not here to write about the historical causes that led to the rise of Hamas , or Israel 's shameful treatment of the Palestinian people over the past 60 years , or the especially cruel treatment the people of Gaza have been forced to endure over the past three years .
Nor am I here to discuss the American media 's apparent indifference to the suffering of the Palestinian people and its blind unthinking support for Israel , no matter how horrific that country 's actions may be .
What I am here to talk about , however , is how over the past 8 long years America 's Middle East policy , under the wretched leadership of George W. Bush , has become so completely indefensible and morally bankrupt .
Furthermore , I 'd also like to express my - and most of the world 's - deep hope for a significant change in American policy once Barack Obama comes to power later this month .
It Certainly Can't Get Any Worse
American policy has always been unequivocally pro-Israel , with a callous and shocking disregard for the fate of the Palestinian people , but the fact is no American administration before this one has ever taken such an extremely one - sided position .
Not Nixon , not Reagan , not Bush The Elder , and definitely not Clinton , no one has ever taken such an immoral , unprincipled , black and white approach to the whole Middle East Conflict before .
I mean , seriously , the Bush Administration 's position is about as fair and balanced as Dick Cheney is lovable ... or as George W. Bush is eloquent ... or as Donald Rumsfeld is humble .
In other words , it 's about as fair and balanced as FOX News .
From the moment Bush took power in 2001 , right on up until the present , Israel has been free to do pretty much whatever it pleases , including a ) breaking whatever international laws it so chooses ; b ) using as much disproportionate and brutal force as it so desires ; and c ) dishing out whatever forms of collective punishment it so sees fit - all in an attempt to break the Palestinians ' will by putting them through as much suffering and humiliation as possible .
And , through it all , America has sat back and watched , only speaking out in order to declare the Israelis " victims of terror " who have done only that which was needed in order to protect themselves .
Reality ( of who 's actually terrorizing who ) be damned .
No matter how crushing the Palestinians ' oppression , Israel has constantly had America 's one hundred percent backing ... and $ 3 billion in aid each year .
Like Victims of Terror Everywhere
It 's always funny to see the oppressors claiming to be the victims , especially when they 're the ones with ALL the power and military might .
You know , like those poor Russians in Chechnya , those horribly downtrodden Chinese in Tibet , and those tragically oppressed whites in South Africa during the apartheid years .
And let 's not forget those poor Germans who suffered so many dreadful attacks from so many terrifying terrorist groups ( resistance fighters , partisans , rebels , what have you ) all across Europe during WWII .
Seriously , is anyone so simple - minded and gullible as to see Israel as the victim of anything ?
Even the mindless pro-Israel propagandists must stop themselves every once and a while and laugh at how ridiculous their message has become .
Complete Loss of Credibility
Much has been made of how the invasion of Iraq , the continuing cancer that is known as the Guantanamo Bay gulag , and the Bush Regime 's open use of torture , among other things , have all led to a massive growth in anti-American sentiment throughout the Middle East , and elsewhere .
But the truth is that Bush 's black and white approach to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict has had as much to do with America 's lack of standing in the Arab and Muslim world as anything else .
The illegal land grab that is the Wall running through Palestine , cutting the West Bank in half ; the open - air prison camp that is the Gaza Strip ; the ten thousand Palestinians being held in other Israeli prisons ; the continuing enlargement and expansion of the illegal settlements on Palestinian land in the West Bank ; the collective punishment that 's dished out in all its varied forms ( such as the demolishment of hundreds of homes each year and the daily harassment that takes place at the numerous checkpoints throughout the West Bank ) ; and now the massive destruction and mass slaughter going on in the Gaza Strip .
None of this has been condemned in any way over the past 8 years by Washington .
In fact , to hear the Bush Regime explain it , the Palestinians should be thankful to live under such kind , benevolent rulers .
From Warsaw To Gaza : Troublemaking Terrorists Terrorizing
And , really , like those involved in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising before them , how dare these terrorists from Gaza rise up against their oppressors ?
Ca n't they just accept their fate and stop causing so much trouble ?
Ca n't they just forget all this crap about human dignity , self respect , self defense , etc . ?
Ca n't they just give up the whole resistance thing and be a bit more like the Welsh ?
A Monster of Their Own Making ...
Exactly As Intended
But , to be serious , I 'm not here to defend Hamas and their fundamentalist streak of Islam ; however , the truth is that severe and long - term oppression almost always leads to the radicalization of those being oppressed ... and few people on earth have suffered such prolonged and horrific oppression and loss of dignity as the people of Gaza .
When you come right down to it , for all intents and purposes Hamas was created by Israel .
As I 've said for years now , the classic strategy that Israel has so clearly followed over the past decade or more has been one of divide and rule .
Nothing suits the hardliners in Israel more than the growth of Hamas .
Pragmatic leaders such as those in Fatah simply can not be demonized in the same way as the radicalized Islamists of Hamas .
And , again , let me stress that I 'm no fan of Hamas , but Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections fair and square and no true believer in democracy can simply turn around and call them " terrorists " as some sort of excuse to ignore those results .
No matter how much anyone , myself included , might despise fundamentalists of any stripe , the fact is they won the elections and they are the elected representatives of the Palestinian people .
Israel itself has elected terrorists such as Menachem Begin to power , not to mention war criminals such as Ariel Sharon .
And fanatical racist parties that call for the expulsion of all Palestinians from Palestine have joined governing coalitions in the country over the years .
But never do you hear anything from America about shunning Israel over any of this .
The hypocrisy is beyond belief .
Current Slaughter
As for the lead up to the current killing spree going on in Gaza - you know , the one where hundreds of civilians have been killed so far , including close to 250 children - I 'll let Avi Shlaim , the Oxford professor , take it from here :
" The figures speak for themselves .
In the three years after the withdrawal from Gaza , 11 Israelis were killed by rocket fire .
On the other hand , in 2005 - 2007 alone , the IDF [ Israeli Defense Force ] killed 1,290 Palestinians in Gaza , including 222 children . "
" Whatever the numbers , killing civilians is wrong .
This rule applies to Israel as much as it does to Hamas , but Israel 's entire record is one of unbridled and unremitting brutality towards the inhabitants of Gaza .
Israel also maintained the blockade of Gaza after the ceasefire came into force which , in the view of the Hamas leaders , amounted to a violation of the agreement .
During the ceasefire , Israel prevented any exports from leaving the strip in clear violation of a 2005 accord , leading to a sharp drop in employment opportunities .
Officially , 49.1 % of the population is unemployed .
At the same time , Israel restricted drastically the number of trucks carrying food , fuel , cooking - gas canisters , spare parts for water and sanitation plants , and medical supplies to Gaza .
It is difficult to see how starving and freezing the civilians of Gaza could protect the people on the Israeli side of the border .
But even if it did , it would still be immoral , a form of collective punishment that is strictly forbidden by international humanitarian law . "
As for the tactics , Shlaim continues :
" Far from taking care to spare civilians , Israel is guilty of indiscriminate bombing and of a three - year - old blockade that has brought the inhabitants of Gaza , now 1.5 million , to the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe . "
So , blockaded and embargoed , shunned , humiliated and starved , with their children killed in the hundreds , the Palestinians of Gaza fight back by firing a few primitive rockets into Israel ... and , according to Bush , it 's all their own fault .
If only they could be more civilized like the Israelis then there would n't be any problem at all .
Ah , the subtle nuance .
Waiting For The Hope - And - Change Guy To Give Us Some Real Hope And Change
Much has been made of the timing of this attack on Gaza , with Israel striking now to crush the Prison Camp Revolt before their cheerleaders in the White House leave office on January 20th .
I just hope that , once he finally comes to power , Obama , despite all of his black and white pro-Israel rhetoric during the election campaign , will take a very different approach .
If not an outright fair and balanced approach to the conflict , at the very least a more traditional , less blatant pro-Israeli position , one which at least encompasses a few shades of grey .
And , so , there you have it , as the destruction of Gaza and the radicalization of a once secular and progressive people continues , Bush cheers it all on and the world waits hopefully for a more fair approach by America under Obama .
My personal hope would be for the rest of the world to stand up for the Palestinians , but the reality is that Israel simply laughs off criticism from all others .
Only America , with its billions of dollars in handouts to Israel each year and its continued support at the U.N. , has any real leverage in trying and bring about some true justice to the situation .
Let 's just hope Obama 's fear of the pro-Israel lobby wo n't stop him from doing the right thing .
After all , there 's really no other place on earth where America still so openly backs such flagrant oppression and horrific crimes against humanity .
The days of America backing the likes of Saddam Hussein in Iraq , Augusto Pinochet in Chile , and all those other fascist regimes throughout Latin America , Africa and Asia ( " our fascists " ) are long gone .
So why continue supporting the appalling oppression of the Palestinian people in their own land ?
Come on Obama , you can do the right thing !
Yes you can !
What Can You Do ?
As for all of us , I say that until this brutal occupation ends we all heed Naomi Klein 's call for an economic boycott of Israel ( The Guardian , Saturday , 10 January , 2009 : " Enough .
It 's time for a boycott " ) , like the one that helped bring down the similarly evil apartheid regime in South Africa .
And do n't let anyone try to label such a boycott as " anti-Semitic " .
Like Naomi Klein , Avi Shlaim , Jennifer Loewenstein , Noam Chomsky and many of my own personal friends , tens of thousands of other justice - seeking Jews out there are as sickened by this oppression as everyone else .
It simply has to end .

Here comes the second post in the article series " Vim Plugins You Should Know About " .
This time I am going to introduce you to a plugin called " repeat.vim " .
Repeat.vim fixes an important functionality problem in the surround .vim plugin that I wrote about last week .
The problem with surround .vim lies in the repeat command " . " ( dot ) .
If you had applied a surrounding and wanted to repeat it with the " . " command , it would n't work .
This plugin fixes this problem .
So basically , whenever you install surround.vim , you also want to install repeat.vim with it .
There is one catch , though .
It does not repeat visual or " ys " commands .
Luckily , the " ys " commands can be often be substituted with " cs " commands .
For example , if you wanted to do several " ysw " " ( wrap a word in quotes ) , you may type " csw " " and then use " . " commands to repeat .
The only way to repeat visual commands is to record a macro .
Here is an example usage of the repeat.vim script .
Suppose you had typed a sentence and you wanted to wrap all the words in quotes :
< strong >|</ strong > foo bar baz quux muux woox ( < strong > | </ strong > is cursor )
Type csw " :
< strong >|</ strong >" foo " bar baz quux muux woox
Now press W .
" foo " < strong > | </ strong >" bar " baz quux muux woox
W moved to the next word and .
repeated the wrapping command .
Now do the same 4 more times , and you have the whole line wrapped :
" foo " " bar " " baz " " quux " " muux " " woox "
How to install repeat.vim ?
1. Download repeat.vim to ~/.vim / plugin ( on Unix / Linux ) , or ~\vimfiles \plugin ( Windows ) .
2. Restart Vim or source repeat.vim with " : so ~/.vim/plugin/repeat.vim " on Unix or " : so ~/vimfiles/plugin/repeat.vim " on Windows ) .
Have Fun !
Have fun with surround.vim + repeat.vim .
I 'll write about another life - changing plugin the next time .
( This is a story I found that had been typed up MANY years ago by someone named “ Toby ” .
It was tucked away , along with some very old photos , with with my mother - in - laws belongings that had been boxed up and stored in our attic for years now .
She was a nurse in the U.S. Navy stationed in Honolulu ( the U.S. Naval Hospital at Aiea Heights , Territory of Hawaii ) and Maui 1944 - 46 .
This is a sliver of history ; a glimpse back . )
HISTORY OF U.S.S. SOLACE – by “ Toby ”
The Story of a Great White Ship
The largest Navy this world has ever seen has a fond and somewhat grateful nickname for its most famous hospital ship , the U.S.S. SOLACE .
Every bluejacket knows her as the “ Great White Ship ” with the raked masts and the raked stack … … and even the marine “ Leathernecks ” and the army “ Dog - faces ” can pick her out on the horizon and unmistakably recognize her .
A war correspondent that had followed every major action in the Pacific was so impressed with the omnipresence of this “ Great White Ship ” that he dubbed her with the sub - title of the “ Work - horse of the Pacific ” , another added glory that she has rightfully earned as her record will reveal .
The SOLACE was built in 1927 as the S.S. Iroquois for the Clyde Mallory Steamship Company , and until 1940 she ran as a passenger liner between Atlantic Coast and Caribbean ports .
She is 410 feet long , has a gross tonnage of 6209 and a displacement tonnage of 8650 .
She has twin - screw turbine propulsion and a shaft - horsepower of 8500 , with a cruising range of 7,000 miles and a speed of 18 knots .
In 1940 she was purchased by the Navy for a reported sum of about $ 1,100,000 and converted into a hospital chip at the Atlantic Basin Iron Works , Brooklyn , New York at a cost of approximately $ 3,500,000 .
After a shake - down cruise , the SOLACE , fully equipped as a modern hospital with a complete staff of physicians , dentists , nurses and hospital corpsmen , proceeded via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor and took its place with the Fleet on October 27 , 1941 .
Captain Benjamin Perlman , USN , was the Commanding Officer and Captain Harold L. Jensen ( MC ) USN was the Senior Medical officer .
Its reputation as the “ Great White Ship ” was destined to have an early foundation .
On that fateful December 7 , 1941 , when the Japanese invited the scorn of the civilized world by their treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor , the SOLACE set a noteworthy precedent for Naval Medicine by handling efficiently and expeditiously a large number of casualties from the stricken battleships .
This work was quickly recognized by Admiral Chester Nimitz , and he presented the ship with a letter of citation .
At a later date in Portland , Oregon , while the vessel was undergoing repairs , a Navy Unit Commendation was authorized by the Secretary of the Navy and presented to the SOLACE at a ceremony held on board September 11 , 1945 .
The commendation reads as follows :
The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in commending the UNITED STATES NAVY HOSPITAL SHIP SOLACE for service as follows :
For extremely meritorious service during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Territory of Hawaii , on December 7 , 1941 .
Alert and prompt in preparing for any emergency after approximately twenty Japanese planes appeared , enroute to attack Pacific Fleet ships and shore installations , the USS SOLACE immediately secured all watertight doors and hatches and instituted measures for the effective handling of casualties .
Rescue parties in motor launches and boats were quickly dispatched to the USS ARIZONA and other stricken ships ; they braved flames and explosions to rescue the burned and injured from the decks and the blazing water alongside ; they unhesitatingly risked their lives during repeated trips under the same perilous conditions , each time returning to the SOLACE with boats fully laden with injured and dying .
Working to the point of exhaustion , the entire staff , doctors , nurses and corpsmen , rendered valiant and self - sacrificing service throughout this emergency , thereby sustaining and enhancing the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service .
All personnel attached to and serving on board the USS SOLACE on December 7 , 1941 , are hereby authorized to wear the NAVY UNIT COMMENDATION ribbon .
/s/ James Forrestal
Secretary of the Navy
Captain M. J. Aston ( MC ) USN relieved Captain Jensen as the Senior Medical Officer on December 23 , 1941 .
For a considerable period of time the SOLACE was the only hospital ship operating in the Pacific was theatre ….. and she bore the heavy burden with distinction .
In early March of 1942 , she was ordered to the South Pacific and proceeded to Samoa .
The University of Pennsylania Medical Unit reported about in May 1942 , and they were among the first groups of Reserve Medical Officers to be sent to sea duty as medical units .
The SOLACE serviced the Fleet at Pago - Pago , Tongatabu , Efate , and Noumea , including numerous casualties from the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Solomons campaign ( particularly Guadalcanal ) and other actions .
In addition to serving as a station hospital ship , several trips were made in evacuating casualties to New Zealand and Australia .
In February 1943 , Commander C.L. Waters USN , relieved Captain Perlman as the Commanding Officer .
In early August 1943 , Captain John T. Bennett ( MC ) USN relieved Captain Aston as the Senior Medical Officer .
The “ Work - horse of the Pacific ” left the South Pacific theater in the latter part of October 1943 , and proceeded cia Pearl Harbor to San Francisco … … bringing back a load of wounded heroes that had formed the Nation ’s front - line - of - defense .
After three days in port , the ship departed again for the South Pacific , and on the ninth day out received the first orders ever given to a U.S.
Navy hospital ship to enter a combat region for evacuation of fresh casualties .
This was the beginning of many historic trips and a new pate in the annals of “ Navy Doctors at War ” .
Action at places like Apamama Atoll , Tarawa , Roi-Namur ( Kwajalein ) and Eniwetok of the Marshall Islands , all bring to mind a picture of a lonely , white , un-armed hospital ship darting in and out amongst the beaches and Transport areas on her tender mission of mercy .
The bulk of the patients evacuated from these action areas were transported to Pearl Harbor hospitals .
From the latter part of March 1944 , to the end of May 1944 , the SOLACE evacuated patients from Milne Bay ( New Guinea ) to Southwest Pacific base hospitals and served as the station hospital for the Seventh Fleet at Manus Atoll in the Admiralty group of islands .
Commander Edward B. Peterson USN , was destined to take command of the vessel for the subsequent , and perhaps most violent , engagements of the war .
The “ Work - horse of the Pacific ” proceeded to the beach - head at Saipan and in June and July evacuated 1335 casualties to base hospitals in the Solomons .
In July and August 1944 , over a thousand patients were evacuated from the Battle of Guam to base hospitals at Kwajelein and Pearl Harbor .
These duties at Saipan and Guam were to serve as object lessons in the dangers that a hospital ship is exposed to from air attack while serving in a Transport area … … and in the later and more vicious operations at Iwo Jima and Okinawa , the lessons learned were taken to good advantage .
The subsequent operations at Anguar and Peleliu of the Palau group of islands involved the treatment and evacuation of over a thousand casualties .
These patients were largely marine and army personnel and were evacuated to Manus and Noumea .
Then came a very busy buy somewhat unexciting 3 - month assignment for the personnel of the “ Work - horse of the Pacific ” that was , by this time , thoroughly accustomed to being “ in the thick of things ” .
This involved servicing the Third and Fifth Fleets and shore establishments at Ulithi Atoll with medical and dental care .
During this period many hundreds of casualties from our fast Carrier Task Forces were received and treated .
All of the materiel and personnel facilities of the SOLACE were made available freely and generously to the over - worked Fleet … … and although everybody worked magnanimously , the load was far beyond capacity and hardly an hour went by that did n’t bring in another boat - full of patients from the ships anchored nearby .
The next set of orders had again cast the SOLACE in her most familiar role ; that of “ going right in there ” with the marines .
This was the bloody Iwo Jima campaign and the “ Great White Ship ” was evacuating casualties on the fourth day after the initial landing .
The entire operation was a sever test for this type of vessel .
Iwo Jima has no well - protected harbor and the weather in February is very unfavorable .
Rough seas and heavy weather plus the thought that the Japanese were not complying with the Geneva agreement ( of rendering immunity to hospital ships ) made this the most difficult task that the SOLACE had ever handled .
However , in spite of the handicaps , a record of over 400 patients were embarked in one day and three evacuation trips were made to base hospitals at Guam and Saipan .
A total of almost two thousand patients were handled during the Iwo Jima campaign .
Life did n’t become any easier or pleasant on the SOLACE for the next and last major campaign with concentration at Kerama Retto and Okinawa Shima .
Here the Japanese threw their most lethal and final punch ; the Kamikaze ( divine wind ) suicide air attack .
Whereas , in the past , most of the casualties came from marines establishing beach - heads , this action brought a high predominance of injured sailors from incapacitated ships … … and here more burn cases were seen than at any other time since Pearl Harbor .
One still , moonlit night off the Okinawa beach - head , a stealthy Jap[ anese ] raider darted out of the sky to make a clearly defined and un-mistakable “ run ” on the well - illuminated SOLACE .
The bomb just missed its mark but the incident was a harbinger of “ things to come ” .
Shortly thereafter , in the same general vicinity , the hospital ship , USS COMFORT , was attacked and severely damaged by a Kamikaze attack .
This was uncivilized warfare ( as wars go ) and for a short time it was necessary for the SOLACE to blackout at night .
Contrary to the Geneva agreement , the SOLACE found it necessary to sail without the normal illumination of her mercy crosses so clearly painted on her sides and stack …. and for the first time in history it was deemed necessary to protect a hospital ship with a Destroyer escort .
Captain W.W. Hall ( MC ) USN is deserving of special mention in performing an excellent job as Senior Medical Officer though - out the history - making Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns .
He has since been relieved by Captain Edward S. Lowe ( MC ) USN , present Senior Medical Officer .
The following men served as Chiefs - of - Surgery and Chiefs - of - Medicine in chronological order :
Chief - of - Surgery
Condr . G.A. Eckert ( MC ) USNR
Comdr . L.K. Fergusen ( MC ) USNR
Comdr .

Over four thousand casualties were evacuated in seven trips from the Okinawa theatre .
Frequently all personnel attached to the ship functioned on a 24 - hour basis … … catching a wink of sleep only after sheer exhaustion .
1800 units of fresh , whole - blood , 1200 units of plasma , 136,000 sulfa tablets and 2 ½ billion units of penicillin were administered during the Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations .
Throughout the Pacific war the “ Great White Ship ” evacuated and treated more fresh battle casualties than any other hospital ship ….. and the mortality rate was lower than would generally be expected at a modern hospital in the United States .
She was admitted and treated in the vicinity of 25,000 patients and about 70 % of these were battle casualties .
The old , “ Work - horse of the Pacific ” has sailed over 170,000 miles without a major and adequate yard overhaul .
To ALL HANDS who have so generously given their best as servants to the SOLACE on her many errands of mercy , a “ GRATEFUL SALUTE … … and a JOB WELL DONE ” .
( I happened on to this story today while going through a very old box of photos that belonged to my mother - in - law who has now been deceased for about ten years .
She was a nurse serving in the U.S. Navy , and was stationed at Mare Island , CA ( 1942 - 44 ) , the U.S. Naval Hospital at Aiea Heights ( Territory of Hawaii ) and Maui from 1944 - 46 .
She spent some time serving on the Navy medical ship U.S.S. SOLACE as well as at the Naval Hospital at Pearl Harbor .

The NBA will use leather basketballs in its developmental league next season , temporarily ending its attempts to reintroduce a composite ball at the NBA level , a league official has confirmed .
" We are committed to leather for the foreseeable future , " said league spokesman Tim Frank .
" We just realized leather is what our guys wanted . "
That means Spalding will remain one of two companies manufacturing a leather basketball .
Molten also produces a ball for FIBA that is made of a different type of leather than the NBA ball .
Most college and high school conferences , as well as some foreign and international leagues , use balls made of synthetic material because they 're less expensive to produce and provide more consistency from ball to ball .
The NBA introduced a composite ball at the start of the 2006 - 07 season , but after complaints from players that the balls became slick from perspiration and left tiny cuts on their fingertips , the league returned to leather in January 2007 .
The league hoped to develop a composite ball that met its players ' approval , and to that end , according to sources , experimented with three different types of composite balls in the
D - League last season .
It also formed a committee of top NBA players to test the new versions and offer their input , something that was not done the first time .
The production cost for Spalding , the company that makes the league 's official ball , was one reason the league looked to switch to a composite material .
The plan now is to develop a two - paneled ball , rather than the current eight - panel model .
The two - panel design was used on the composite ball and did not raise any complaints .
Spalding is supposedly hoping that the feature can be used as a marketing tool .
The D League will begin next season using an eight - paneled leather ball and then switch to a two - paneled version sometime around midseason , Frank said .
Senior writer Ric Bucher covers the NBA for ESPN The Magazine .
Mr. Karzai has also opposed the forceful eradication of poppy crops , something that did not appear to be sanctioned by the new NATO mandate .
Mr. Karzai has argued that other measures , including crop substitution and public education programs , along with foreign aid that provides jobs , are the most effective ways of cutting opium production without the violence likely to be provoked by crop eradication .
But American commanders have concluded that gaining the upper hand in the fight against the resurgent Taliban will require depriving the insurgents of income from the drug trade , which the top American commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David D. McKiernan , estimated at a Washington briefing last week to be a minimum of $ 100 million .
Despite the misgivings among some NATO allies , the American push for a NATO mandate that includes attacks on drug networks fueling the insurgency has been backed by the Afghan government , which reiterated the sentiment at the Budapest meeting .
The need for more aggressive action against the drug lords has also been pressed by the United Nations drug agency .
In its August report , authored by its executive director , Antonio Maria Costa of Italy , it noted the “ inextricable link between drugs and conflict , ” and without referring to or sanctioning military action , said that something needed to be done .
Beyond that , the American commanders have been supported by Britain , whose 8,000 troops in Afghanistan are second only in numbers , among NATO nations , to the 33,000 American troops .
British support is particularly significant , since most of the British troops are concentrated in Helmand Province in the southwest , the heartland of the opium trade and one of the most intensive battlefields of the insurgency .
United Nations figures estimate that Helmand alone accounts for more than 50 percent of the country ’s opium production .
According to the recent United Nations survey , 98 percent of Afghanistan ’s opium comes from seven provinces in the southwest , with no opium at all produced in half of the country ’s 34 provinces .
The bulk of the NATO troops operating in the southwest come from the United States , Britain , Canada and Denmark , and it is those nations that are likely to be most affected by the new NATO mandate .
Together with the United States , Britain and Canada have already taken the heaviest casualties among the NATO nations fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda , with NATO troops who have died in the seven - year war now approaching 1,000 , including more than 600 Americans .

You may be stuck in a cycle of breaking up and making up with your significant other .
But you have finally decided to end it for good .
You can take some steps to make sure that this time is the last time , like firmly stating your intentions to your significant other , and making sure you cease communicating and seeing each other for a while .
You can also keep busy with new friends , fun activities , and interesting new hobbies that will help keep your mind off your old relationship .
If you have left this person before , you may worry you lack the resolve to stay away .
Remember : Healthy relationships do not stop and restart over and over again .
Sometimes it ’s better to get off the roller coaster ride once and for all .
Let 's assume that the powers in Washington -- the Bush team now , the Obama team soon -- deem GM too big to let fail .
If so , it 's also too big to be entrusted to the same people who have led it to its current , perilous state , and who are too tied to the past to create a different future .
Giving GM a blank check -- which the company and the United Auto Workers union badly want , and which Washington will be tempted to grant -- would be an enormous mistake .
The company would just burn through the money and come back for more .
Even more jobs would be wiped out in the end .

BLAUBEUREN , Germany ( Reuters ) - German billionaire Adolf Merckle has committed suicide , in despair over the huge losses suffered by his business empire during the financial crisis , his family said on Tuesday .
The media - shy billionaire , whose family controls some of Germany ’s best - known companies , was hit by a train on Monday evening , local officials said .
“ The desperate situation of his companies caused by the financial crisis , the uncertainties of the last few weeks and his powerlessness to act , have broken the passionate family entrepreneur and he took his own life , ” a family statement said .
State prosecutors from the southern city of Ulm said Merckle , 74 , left work on Monday and died after being hit by a train near the town of Blaubeuren .
He left behind a suicide note to his family , they added .
There was no sign of anyone else being involved , they said .
In 2008 Merckle was ranked as the world ’s 94th - richest person and Germany ’s fifth - wealthiest by Forbes magazine .
On Tuesday pale blood stains still dotted the snow along the railway track where he died .
The area looked deserted apart from a police car nearby .
German billionaire Adolf Merckle , pictured in this undated handout photo , has killed himself , his family said on January 6 , 2009 .
" The desperate situation of his companies caused by the financial crisis , the uncertainties of the last few weeks and his powerlessness to act , have broken the passionate family entrepreneur and he took his own life , " a family statement said .
Prosecutors in the southern German town of Ulm , near Merckle 's home , said the 74 - year - old died when a train struck him late on Monday .
There was no sign anyone else was involved , they said .
Merckle was ranked as the world 's 94th richest person in 2008 according to Forbes magazine and his family controls a number of German companies including cement maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug company Ratiopharm , but its empire was rocked last year by wrong - way bets made on shares in carmaker Volkswagen .
REUTERS / Merckle / Handout
Merckle , a father of four , inherited the basis of his fortune from his Bohemian grandfather , but went on to build up the chemical wholesale company into Germany ’s largest drugs wholesaler .
The passionate skiier and mountain climber assembled a business conglomerate with about 100,000 employees and 30 billion euros ( $ 40.45 billion ) in annual sales .
His family controls a number of German companies including cement maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug company Ratiopharm .
But the empire was rocked last year by wrong - way bets made on shares in Volkswagen after a surprise stakeholding announcement from Porsche sent the VW share price rocketing as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions .
Banking sources had told Reuters the family lost hundreds of millions of euros on investments , with about 400 million euros lost on Volkswagen shares alone .
Since then the family has been in talks for weeks with banks to renegotiate loans .
Banking sources said on Tuesday his death was not expected to affect loan agreements with the family .
Shares in HeidelbergCement fell as much as 12.5 percent following the news of Merckle ’s death and ended the day down 6.2 percent at 31.25 euros .
“ Some investors are afraid that there will be no one to lead negotiations during this sensitive situation for the company , ” one trader in Frankfurt said .
Psychologists and other mental health experts have said suicide rates could creep up as a result of the financial crisis .
Last month Frenchman Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet , 65 , a co-founder of money manager Access International , was found dead in a New York office building , reportedly distraught over losing up to $ 1.4 billion in client money to Bernard Madoff ’s alleged fraud .
He slit his wrists with box cutters .

Home > CIA Sculpture Continues to Baffle Cryptographers CIA Sculpture Continues to Baffle Cryptographers
Source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos
For more than 15 years , amateur and professional code - breakers have been baffled by Kryptos , a sculpture at the CIA ’s headquarters in Langley , VA , that features a nearly 12 - foot - tall , copper scroll inscribed with four long , coded passages .
The coded passages remained unsolved for eight years , until a CIA analyst cracked the first three in 1999 .
But the fourth passage is still a mystery .
Interest in solving the final part of the puzzle has soared after the publisher of Dan Brown ’s bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code posted a game on www.thedavincicode.com, which states that numerous encrypted messages on the book ’s dust cover hint at the subject of Brown ’s next novel .
The clues , which were not recognized until the game was posted , include a set of geographic coordinates that roughly locate the sculpture .
Brown himself has recently hinted that the Kryptos sculpture might play a role in his upcoming novel The Solomon Key .
Deciphering the Passages
Sculptor Jim Sanborn claims to be the only man alive who knows the solution to the final passage .
When Kryptos was installed in 1990 , Sanborn was required to hand a sealed envelope containing its solution to then CIA Director William Webster .
But Sanborn now says that the letter withheld information critical to solving the puzzle .
Sanborn has confirmed the accuracy of the solutions to the first three passages , which contain deliberate misspellings , letters carved slightly higher than others on the same line , and other irregularities that may themselves be clues to solving the fourth passage and possibly for locating something buried .
The first deciphered passage reads : “ Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the nuance of iglusion [ sic ] . ”
The second passage , which is followed by geographical coordinates , suggests a location elsewhere on the grounds of CIA headquarters and reads , in part :
“ It was totally invisible .
How ’s that possible ?
They used the Earth ’s magnetic field .
The information was gathered and transmitted underguund [ sic ] to an unknown location .
Does Langley know about this ?
They should : it ’s buried out there somewhere . ”
The third passage is based on a diary entry made by archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922 , on the day that he discovered the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun .
It reads :
“ With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left - hand corner .
And then , widening the hole a little , I inserted the candle and peered in .
The hot air escaping from the chamber caused the flame to flicker , but presently details of the room within emerged from the mist .
Can you see anything ? ”
Experts say that the fourth passage is written in a more complex code than the first three , one designed to mask patterns of recurring letters that code - breakers typically look for .
There are no breaks in the 97 - character sequence of the final passage , which begins with an initial question mark .
Considering the Entire Sculpture
Sanborn , who has had no training in cryptography , says that he collaborated with a prominent fiction writer in composing the text to be encoded , and then worked with a retired CIA encryption official for four months to create the code .
He insists that the code can be solved and says that when he placed the sculpture at Langley , in the thick of the world ’s best code - breakers , he thought it would take only months for them to solve Kryptos .
Part of the difficulty in solving the puzzle may be its location , in the center of a high - security compound to which few people have access .
Another difficulty may be the failure to consider Kryptos in its entirety .
The inscribed scroll is only part of the sculpture , which is intended as an interpretation of how information has been accrued throughout the ages .
In fact , Sanborn teases enthusiasts by saying that one clue , the most obvious key to the sculpture , is sitting in plain view but has been overlooked so far .
The sculpture actually begins with two red granite and copperplate constructions that flank the walkway leading to the entrance of the headquarters building , that appear as pages jutting from the earth and are inscribed with International Morse Code and ancient ciphers that spell out phrases such as “ virtually invisible ” and “ it is your position . ”
There is also a navigational compass carved into one of the rocks , with its needle pulled off due north by a lodestone ( a naturally magnetized rock ) that Sanborn placed nearby .
Then , in the courtyard of the headquarters , is a calm , reflective pool that lies between two layered slabs of granite and tall grasses .
Directly across from this is the centerpiece , the copperplate screen carved with thousands of three - inch letters and symbols .
The scroll is supported by a piece of petrified wood , symbolizing the source materials on which language has been recorded throughout the ages .
It is then surrounded by a bubbling pool of water , which symbolizes the dissemination of information to unknown destinations .
On its left is a cryptographic table for enciphering and deciphering code called the Vigenere Method , after 16th - century French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenere .
The Vigenere Method involves substituting letters while shifting from one alphabet order to another with each letter of the key , and was used to encode one of the four enigmatic messages on the right of the scroll , which are each written in a different code .
Another passage uses the cryptographic method of transposing letters , or changing their position within the message .
Sanborn says that even when the final passage has been decoded , people will discover that what he wrote is only part of a larger puzzle .
Solvers
The first person to publicly announce solving the first three sections , in 1999 , was Jim Gillogly , a computer scientist from southern California .
After Gillogly 's announcement , the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein had also solved the same sections in 1998 , using pencil and paper techniques , though at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community , and no public announcement was made .
The NSA also claimed at that time that they had solvers , but would not reveal names or dates until 2000 , when it was learned that an NSA team led by Ken Miller , along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals , had solved parts 1 – 3 in late 1992 .
All of these early attempts to solve Kryptos presumed that K2 ended with WESTIDBYROWS , but in 2006 , Sanborn announced that he had made an error in part 2 , which changed the last part of the plaintext from WESTIDBYROWS to WESTXLAYERTW

Al Qaeda hit by Black Death fear as medieval plague kills 40 terrorists at training camp
Al Qaeda terrorists have been left fearing the Black Death plague after it wiped out at least 40 insurgents at an Algerian training camp , it was reported today .
The horror disease , which killed 25 million people in medieval Europe , is understood to have been found in a militant ’s body dumped at a roadside .
Terror group AQLIM ( al Qaeda in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb ) was forced to turn its shelter in the Yakouren forests into mass graves and flee , it has been claimed .
Hideout : Terrorists in Ouzou , Algeria , above , have been forced to flee the plague
Now al Qaeda chiefs are said to fear the plague has been passed into other cells - and possibly Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .
Many insurgents may choose to surrender for treatment rather than die a horrible death .
‘ This is the deadliest weapon yet in the war against terror , ’ a security source told The Sun :
‘ Most of the terrorists do not have the basic medical supplies needed to treat the disease .
‘ It spreads quickly and kills within hours .
This will be really worrying al - Qaeda . ’
Medieval terror : The Black Death killed 25 million people in Europe in the 1300s
The new plague epidemic is said to have begun in AQLIM ’s cave hideouts of in Tizi Ouzou province , 90 miles east of the capital Algiers .
AQLIM is the largest and most powerful al Qaeda group outside the Middle East and trains Muslim fighters to kill British and American troops .
Its boss Abdelmalek Droudkal claims to command around 1,000 insurgents and masterminded the bombing the UN headquarters in Algiers in 2007 , killing 41 .
Black Death comes in various forms and was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history when it struck in the 1340s killing 75 million people across North Africa , Asia and Europe .
Bubonic
Plague is spread by bites from infected rat fleas .
Symptoms include painful boils in the groin , neck and armpits .
Quick - spreading :
The plague virus , above , is easily caught and kills within hours
In Pneumonic Plague , airborn bacteria spread like flu .
Without medication it can be deadly .
Although plague is virtually unheard of in developed countries , the World Health Organisation reports several thousand cases a year .
These occur mainly in southern Asia , southern Africa and central America .
Between 1989 and 2003 there were more than 38,000 cases , which caused 2,845 deaths in 25 countries .

The upcoming episode of the video game Grand Theft Auto IV looks to be a wild one .
GTA IV , which was released in April for the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 , focused on former Eastern European soldier Niko Bellic and his escalating life of crime in the boroughs of Liberty City .
This new episode , available Feb. 17 via download exclusively for those who own the Xbox 360 version ( no price yet ) , stars Johnny Klebitz , a member of Liberty City biker gang The Lost .
" Johnny is a very different character than Niko , with a very different background , " says Dan Houser , vice president of creative development for Rockstar Games .
" I can't go into too much detail on the story , because we try not to give away too much plot before the game is released .
But I can say that the story will show you a different side of Liberty City . "
The episode , titled The Lost and Damned , requires players to have the full version of the Mature - rated GTA IV ( ages 17 and older ) and an Xbox Live membership to download .
It 's likely to carry an M rating , too .
( Parents can use the Xbox 360's parental controls to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content . )
GTA IV is the top video game this year ; nearly two - thirds of the 5 million copies sold have been for Xbox 360 , according to The NPD Group .
In the original game , Niko crossed paths with The Lost several times .
This time , Niko has only a bit part , Houser says .
" The story is not directly impacted by decisions you took in the main game , " he says .
But " tons of details and mysteries from the main story get explained , so it will add a lot of color to the main story . "
' Damned ' will offer hours of gameplay , not just extras Rockstar Games has been fine - tuning its explorable 3 - D virtual worlds since launching its first " sandbox " game with Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 .
The new game will let you download more sandbox time .
" We feel like we 've only scratched the surface in terms of the depth and detail in " GTA IV 's mythical Liberty City , says Houser .
Previous games have used downloads to add " new stages , weapons and costumes , " says GamePro Media features editor Dave Rudden , " but GTA IV 's content will reportedly add hours of gameplay . "
Rudden hopes the episode costs $ 15 or less , but Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter expects a $ 20 price and says Rockstar could sell 2 million to 3 million downloads .
" I see episodic content as a natural progression of the quality of downloadable content . "

( CNN ) -- Japanese automaker Toyota warned Monday it will post its first operating loss in almost 60 years .
Toyota president Katsuaki Watanabe announces the company 's forecast in Nagoya , central Japan .
A slump in sales and a surge in the value of the yen have wreaked havoc on its balance sheet , with the world 's second biggest car maker revealing that its net revenues have dropped by 6.3 percent compared to a year ago .
In a statement , Toyota said it cut its group operating forecast to a loss of up to ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.7 billion ) for the year to end - March , after shocking financial markets last month by slashing its group operating profit forecast by ¥ 1 trillion to ¥600 billion .
The car maker recorded an operating profit of ¥ 2.27 trillion last year .
Watch more about Toyota 's losses »
This would be Toyota 's first operating loss since 1950 , Toyota spokesman Steve Curtis said .
Despite the likely operating loss , Toyota expects to post a $ 557 million net profit for the fiscal year .
Automakers around the world are facing their toughest challenge in recent memory , caught in a sharp reversal of demand as the financial crisis deepens .
Last week , fellow Japanese car manufacturer Honda slashed its earnings forecast for 2008 , citing " no prospect for recovery " in the midst of the global recession and slumping worldwide sales
And in the United States , the Bush administration agreed a $ 13 billion bailout for two of its ailing " big three " automakers -- GM and Chrysler .
Japanese exports have been hit hard as the yen has been rising in value sending the country 's trade deficit shooting up to $ 2.5 billion in November , according to the Japanese government .
Exports fell 26 percent on a month - over - month basis .
Toyota 's president Katsuaki Watanabe said he expected group sales to slump to 8.96 million vehicles for 2008 , down four percent from a year earlier .
He said the company was freezing expansion plans , suspending executive bonuses and reviewing its dividend payout .
" The company is facing an unprecedented crisis where it cannot avoid posting an operating deficit in this term , " Watanabe told a news conference .
" The markets are changing every week and even every day .
Unfortunately we cannot forecast our business performance for the next year at this point , " he said .
According to Britain 's Financial Times newspaper , Toyota plans to reduce contract workers in Japan from 9,200 in the first quarter of this year to about 3,000 in the same period next year , a cut equivalent to 20 per cent of its production workforce in the country .
The company has temporarily shut much of its big - truck production in the U.S. and has said it would probably delay the opening of a plant in the state of Mississippi that was scheduled to start building Prius hybrids in 2010 .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - For years , Bob Clegg ’s insurance company paid out some $ 3,000 a month for doctor visits , drugs and medical devices to treat the health problems caused by his obesity .
Pedestrians walk across the street near Times Square in New York in this August 28 2007 file photo .
About two - thirds of American adults are overweight or obese , putting them at an increased risk for diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , osteoarthritis , stroke , gallbladder disease , sleep apnea and respiratory problems and even some cancers .
The direct and indirect costs of obesity is $ 117 billion each year , according to a 2000 report by the U.S. Surgeon General .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson / Files
In September 2007 , when his weight peaked at 380 pounds ( 172 kg ) , he had gastric bypass surgery , and now his health issues -- joint pain , sleep apnea and esophageal problems -- have vanished , and so have the medical bills .
But even though the surgery -- in which the stomach is made smaller and part of the intestine is bypassed -- has saved his insurance company money , Clegg , who now weighs 240 pounds ( 108 kg ) , had to pay the $ 20,000 cost out of his own pocket .
“ It was n’t until the doctor said my sleep apnea was at a point where we seriously had to consider a tracheotomy that we talked about gastric bypass , ” said Clegg , 54 .
“ The irony is that insurance would pay for the tracheotomy , but not the surgery . ”
Clegg ’s experience highlights the difficulties facing the United States as it confronts an epidemic of obesity , and the problems for President Barack Obama as he sets about extending health insurance to more Americans at a time of runaway costs .
While his experience is typical , unlike most other people , Clegg was in a position to make some changes .
As a member of New Hampshire ’s senate , he took what he knew about obesity and the cost of treating related chronic illnesses to the state capitol , where he introduced a bill in January 2008 requiring insurers to offer surgery as a treatment option , just as the state ’s Medicaid program for the poor does .
While other states -- some of which do n’t cover any obesity treatment -- are studying New Hampshire ’s approach , experts say economics will increasingly drive policy at a time of burgeoning budget deficits .
EPIDEMIC COSTS
About two - thirds of American adults are overweight or obese , putting them at an increased risk for diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , osteoarthritis , stroke , gallbladder disease , sleep apnea and respiratory problems and even some cancers .
The direct and indirect costs of obesity is $ 117 billion each year , according to a 2000 report by the U.S. Surgeon General .
Christine Ferguson , associate professor at George Washington University School of Public Health and the director of STOP Obesity Alliance , said the stigma surrounding obesity and belief that it is not a disease are keeping the government from addressing the crisis .
“ At the root of this is that people still have a real problem thinking about obesity as anything other than a willpower issue , ” said Ferguson .
“ It is still perfectly acceptable to think about excluding treatment . ”
Ferguson , who has held high level healthcare posts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , acknowledged the difficulty in changing the way government thinks about spending on obesity .
“ If I have to balance my budget at the end of each year , I have a choice between investing money in children who have mental retardation , or children with developmental disabilities ... or investing in people who have obesity , choosing obesity is a very hard case to make , ” she said .
This is even though insurers would recover the costs of bariatric surgery within two to four years , according to Pierre - Yves Cremieux , a researcher with the economic consulting firm Analysis Group .
Cremieux led a study that showed the operation helps patients ’ health and ultimately leads to cost savings .
The study was paid for by Johnson & Johnson , which makes bariatric surgery instruments .

OBESITY BIAS
Ronald Williams , the chairman and chief executive of health insurer Aetna , said most large employers that it sells policies to have at least one plan that covers bariatric surgery .
But , he said , he ’s more focused on prevention .
“ The bigger end of the story is , How do we help people not become obese to begin with ? ” he said .
“ If they are suffering the complications from being overweight or obese , how can we help them manage those conditions ? ”
Clegg blamed difficultly in pushing his bill through partly on society ’s bias against the obese .
The bill finally passed in June , six months before he left the senate in December .
Other states have had similar difficulties , including Utah , where Jeff Haaga has lobbied the state to require insurers to provide greater coverage there .
“ If we could only get our lawmakers to understand , like they did in New Hampshire , ” said Haaga , who at 360 pounds is classified as morbidly obese .
“ Insurers are covering people who are morbidly obese one way or the other , whether it ’s surgery or just keeping us alive with medication . ”
In Mississippi , rated the nation ’s fattest state for the third consecutive year , a bill that would have banned restaurants from serving obese customers died almost immediately after it was introduced in February .
The Trust for America ’s Health , a nonprofit group that focuses on disease prevention , reported that adult obesity rates rose in 37 states in the past year , while no state saw a decrease .
In its 2008 report : ‘F as in Fat : How Obesity Policies are Failing in America ’ , the Trust said Mississippi has per capita medical costs that are among the highest in the nation .
It also has a Medicaid policy that specifically excludes coverage for bariatric surgery .
For Clegg , the former New Hampshire lawmaker , Mississippi ’s obesity problems are clearly linked to its refusal to pay for bariatric surgery under its Medicaid program .
“ If Mississippi is that ignorant and would rather pay for diabetic medicine every month and watch people have heart attacks at a cost of $ 40,000 ... but wont spend $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 ( for the surgery ) , well maybe that ’s why Mississippi has a problem , ” he said .
It was sadly inevitable in these last desperate days of the presidential campaign that Hollywood would become the GOP ’s bitter target for its support of Obama Barack ( lumped in with terrorists and socialists ) .
Voters in at least 10 swing states are receiving hundreds of thousands of nasty and often misleading automated telephone calls from John McCain ’s campaign , and a portion are bashing Obama for putting “ Hollywood above America ” .
This , on the same weekend tha Sarah Palin went on Saturday Night Live .
A spokesman for the McCain campaign defended the Hollywood - themed robocall as “ based on hardened facts that American voters should consider . ”
Here ’s what it said : “ On the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis , Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers , but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fund - raiser . ”
That was Sept. 16th , when Obama attended a cocktail reception that night in Beverly Hills that featured celebrities like Barbra Streisand and Leonardo DiCaprio , after a 20 - minute briefing by economic advisers .
But Obama ’s schedule that day also showed that he was briefed by staff members twice more and spoke with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
But the robocalls do n’t point out that McCain was campaigning in Ohio that same day .
Nor that the GOP candidate also has been fundraising in Beverly Hills among the Hollywood celebs .
On August 25th , McCain attended a 1,200 - donor blowout at the Beverly Hills Hilton ballroom which included Stephen Baldwin , Pat Boone , Wilford Brimley , Dean Cain , Jon Cryer , Robert Duvall , Angie Harmon , Patricia Heaton , Lorenzo Lamas , Craig T. Nelson , Gail O’Grady , Jason Sehorn , Gary Sinise , and Jon Voight .
“ I would like to thank so many brave and courageous people who are here that happen to be in the business of Hollywood who are risking their entire futures and careers , ” McCain told the fundraiser .
What a crock since all those actors are high - profile TV or film stars .
I wonder how they feel about McCain denigrating a candidate ’s Hollywood support .
Because it demeans them as well .
My my EA , how you have impressed .
Having read the comments on the news that EA will soon be bringing a EA SPORTS complex to Home , it seems many of you are at least intrigued , myself included .
Now though , they have my full attention .
A video of EA Senior Producer Robert Burnett showing off the complex has appeared on the PlayStation Blog , which shows off the entire space , including three mini-games .
Home users will be able to play poker , race go - karts against one another and even participate in a golfing mini-game .
Now these are pretty simple you say , well yes , yes they are .
How about a ‘ light progression system ’ though ?
Perhaps the ability to earn winnings that you can spend to upgrade your go - carts or progress to more advanced poker tables ?
EA , I am a little bit impressed .
They are bringing leaderboards ( the absence of which from the Red Bull space has bemused many ) , up - to 8 - player go - karting , multiple poker tables with varying difficulty , winnings to be spent within the complex on wearable prizes and stuff for you Home apartment .
This is the sort of thing we want in Home , something we want to go to and spend time in , more than once .

Even if you ’re not a sports fan , you will probably find something in there to be entertained with when the space launches around March .
The question of how to ensure that one type family is the inverse of another comes up once in a while .

If you 're the kind of destitute scientist who drinks Franzia but has a couple of high - powered titanium electrodes lying around , you 're in luck , because a short blast of electricity can vastly improve your swill .

Scientists and oenologists ( did you know there 's a word for wine dorks ?
Other than wino ? ) have discovered that they can rapidly age and thus round out the flavor of cheap , gross wine by using powerful electrodes .
This technique is mostly being applied to raw , young wines , but it very much improves the flavor and " mouthfeel " of cheap and dirty wines as well .
Wine is pumped through a pipe running between two titanium electrodes , which increases the reactions between alcohols and acids .
Those reactions produce esters , which contribute to fruitiness and flavor .
They also found that too much electricity can create gross new flavors from new aldehydes , rendering it worse than it began , but a few super snobs have testified that the artificial aging really does work .
The efforts were begun in China by chemist Xin An Zeng , and now a number of Chinese wineries are investigating the possibilities .
Personally , I 've been waiting for electrified wine for years .

It 's no surprise that some people get attached to their various social networking profiles , but would you sue if the social network took down your profile ?
That 's exactly what one woman is doing , as seen in a lawsuit filed last week and brought to our attention by Eric Goldman .
The complaint lays out the details , but a quick summary is that the woman was shocked ( shocked ! ) to find out that some of the celebrity profiles on MySpace are not , in fact , run by the actual celebrities .
So she set up a profile that would " verify " celebrities , and allow those verified celebrities to place her logo on their MySpace page .
She claims that one of the fake celebrities complained to MySpace and they took down her profile .
Now , you might think that since its MySpace 's site , they can take down whatever profile they want -- but not according to this woman , who mentions the " mental anguish " caused by this over and over again .
While it may be a bogus reason for MySpace to have taken down her page , it 's not clear what legal grounds she has to stand on .
There are some other complaints in the filing , including the fact that MySpace allowed fake celebrities to sign up ( and the lawsuit demands that MySpace be forced to take these fake profiles down ) and that she had asked MySpace ( via a cold call ) to support her efforts -- and then was offended when MySpace " stole " her idea and had created their own " celebrities " site ( of course providing no evidence that the idea was " stolen " ) .
She also complains that she tried to take her complaint to the arbitration firm listed in MySpace 's terms of service only to discover that the firm no longer did work for MySpace , so she claims that MySpace committed unfair business practices by including the arbitration clause in its terms without living up to it .
The best line in the filing may be after MySpace took down the woman 's second attempt at this " celebrity verifying " profile :
It 's not clear what 's illegal about making someone angry , but these days , you never know ...
Anyway , the full legal complaint is below ( click through for those reading this via RSS ) :

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has chosen Jerry Lewis to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian award to be given during the Oscar ceremony in February , 2009 .
The award " is given to an individual in the motion picture industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry , " says the academy .
Controversy is building around the selection due to Lewis ' repeated anti-gay slurs on television , including ones he made during his annual Muscular Dystrophy association telethon , and as recently as last October , on Australian TV , the latter shortly after an apology for his insults .
Many are in agreement that Lewis has done amazing things for those in need , but due to the recent passing of Prop 8 , his recent slurs , and the fact that this is a humanitarian award , a call for the academy to change its choice has been made .

Thanks for this guest post from our friends over at Unite The Fight .
Someone asked me about the path that lead me to Clojure .
On the off chance that he's not the only one curious , I thought I 'd post the answer here .
Sometime after college I started hunting for the " best language " , not with any formal definition but as a personal quest for what I liked the best .
A primary criteria was something I called " expressiveness " .
I do n't know if I can define that accurately , but it has something to do with being able to provide APIs that concisely model whatever specific domain you 're dealing with .
A common example is how much easier it is to work with text in perl ( because of strongly integrated regex support ) than it is in C .
My " best language " before Clojure was Ruby , because of its clean object system and iterators , but I had n't experienced any functional or immutable languages yet .
I had heard a lot about how amazing LISP was , but I did n't get it .
I could n't figure out why anyone liked LISP 's annoying syntax , or why anyone ( who was n't deeply into Artificial Intellegence ) would want to write programs that write programs .
So one big turning point was reading " On Lisp " by Paul Graham ( free download ) .
By the time I was done with that book , I was convinced that any " best language " had to support macros .
So I tried to use Common Lisp , but just could n't make it " stick " .
I had learned plenty of other languages , and usually enjoyed the process , but Common Lisp 's lack of libraries really drove me nuts .
I could do network , file or text stuff in 4 or 5 lines of ruby that took a page of code in Common Lisp .
So I shelved Common Lisp for a while .
I do a lot of C++ and JavaScript at work , and was learning to really like JavaScript -- clean syntax , closures , direct support for hash - maps and regex , a builtin " gui " system .
So it was easy for Yegge to lure me into trying JavaScript on the JVM , especially with the promise of optional static typing , which I was pretty sure I wanted .
Around the same time I learned about Project Euler , and thought it would be a great way to get used to using JavaScript for general purpose programming rather than just browser stuff .
I did the first five PE problems in JavaScript before giving up .
It was terrible .
Not only was there no static typing yet , but things that had been minor annoyances in the browser now seemed to be giant obstacles to solving the problem at hand .
Re-reading some of Yegge 's cheerleading brought me to the conclusion that he 's actually endorsing some private language based roughly on JavaScript .
None of the other languages that Google lets him use are as malleable , and Rhino lets him code up whatever new features he wants in Java and morph the language to his will .
This is great for him , I 'm sure , but was lousy for me .
I had n't used Java in any capacity for years , but now thanks to Yegge I had it installed and ready to go .
This made me more willing to try Scala .
I do n't remember how I heard about it , but I picked it up to work on the rest of the PE problems , and this is when I started to learn about immutability .
Scala encourages the use of immutable locals , and has a few immutable collections .
I expended a lot of energy bending my problem - solving thought processes to this new context .
Scala also has lazy streams , which was another big hurdle .
Both of these were challenging to learn , but once I got it , they were very rewarding tools to have at my fingertips .
Project Euler was my primary teaching tool , forcing me to learn new concepts a little at a time .
The folks on the IRC channel helped me when I got stuck , though in exchange , I frequently had to endure condescension from some of them .
So this was going along okay , until I thought I had enough Scala under my belt to take a crack at a tricky little API I 'd had on my mind .
I 'd been wanting a way of picking data out of HTML documents , something with the expressive power of XPath , but that embedded cleanly in the host language .
I wanted to be able to provide new functions , filters , etc. ( have you tried to work with dates in XPath and XSLT ?? ) , and for the return values to be host language data structures , not more XML documents .
I 'd actually built a beastly little project using xlstproc and ruby , but that 's another story altogether .
Anyway , I began sculpting this API in Scala .
I spent a day or two experimenting with syntax , the right combinations of traits , implicits , etc. to create the kind of XPath - like expressions I wanted .
I finally got the beginnings of something that I thought would work , and compiled a minimal test .
Well , tried to compile it , but the types were n't quite right .
I then spent the another day or two trying to get the type declarations correct enough to even compile , and finally gave up in frustration .
I 'm sure it would have been possible to make it work , but I wanted to spend my time solving actual problems , not solving problems the compiler was making up for me .
Maybe I did n't want static typing after all .
This is when I started learning Clojure .
Paul Graham had convinced me I wanted a LISP .
Yegge 's hype about JavaScript had prepared me for the JVM .
Scala had introduced me to immutability and lazy streams .
Clojure let me use the best properties of each of these , so it was a very natural fit right from the beginning .
I 've since learned more -- how to use more immutable collections , software transaction memory , etc. , and the discussion group and IRC channel have always been friendly and encouraging .
That 's how I got to where I am .
I do n't think I 'd recommend the JavaScript or Scala tangents to anyone else , but " On Lisp " may still be worth reading , at least until Programming Clojure comes out .
Since bailing on Scala , I 've done another 25 or so Project Euler problems in Clojure , and had so much fun I even went back and did the first 14 all over again .
I also took another stab at XPath - inspired document querying , resulting in a zip - filter lib that I 'll write about some other time .
Clojure 's definitely closer to the " best language " than any other I 've tried .
If you have n't tried it yet , you should !
Obama , the military and the threat of dictatorship
23 December 2008
With his choice of Admiral Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence , President - elect Barack Obama has now named three recently retired four - star military officers to serve in his cabinet .
This unprecedented representation of the senior officer corps within the incoming Democratic administration is indicative of a growth in the political power of the US military that poses a serious threat to basic democratic rights .
As head of the US military ’s Pacific command in 1999 - 2000 , Blair was distinguished by his efforts to solidarize the Pentagon with the military of Indonesia as it carried out butchery in East Timor , effectively vetoing the half - hearted human rights concerns voiced by the Clinton administration .
Before tapping Blair , Obama named former Marine Gen. James Jones as his national security adviser and former Army chief of staff Gen. Erik Shinseki as secretary of veterans affairs .
It is also reported that the incoming administration may ask retired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden to stay on as director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
The Washington Post last Saturday described this concentration of former senior officers in the administration as “ an unusual trend for a Democratic administration and one that has surprised both political camps . ”
The appointments follow the announcement that Robert Gates , Bush ’s defense secretary , will stay on at the Pentagon , where multiple “ transition teams ” are at work to assure that continuity is maintained in America ’s ongoing wars of aggression and that the immense power of the military remains unchecked .
Earlier this month Obama spelled out his subservience to the Pentagon by declaring , “ To ensure prosperity here at home and peace abroad , we all share the belief we have to maintain the strongest military on the planet . ”
To that end , he has pledged to increase the size of US ground forces by 100,000 soldiers and Marines and made it clear that there will be no significant cuts to a military budget that is gobbling up some $ 850 billion annually under conditions of soaring deficits and an intensifying financial crisis .
There is no doubt a significant element of political calculation in Obama ’s decision to surround himself with military brass and assure that he is seen as “ supporting our troops . ”
There is , after all , the bitter experience of the last Democratic administration .
Bill Clinton ’s first term was nearly shipwrecked by his confrontation with the uniformed command over his proposal to scrap the ban on gays in the military .
For the remainder of his presidency , he was treated with open or barely concealed contempt by much of the officer corps .
The threat of an even uglier confrontation under Obama is very real given the disastrous effects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on the military and reports of a growing delusional sentiment within the officer corps that the failures of the US operations in these countries were the result of a “ stab in the back ” delivered by the civilian authorities , the media and the American people themselves .
But there is a more fundamental process underlying both Clinton ’s experience and Obama ’s bowing before the military today .
It is the immense growth in the power of the “ military industrial complex ” against which President Dwight Eisenhower warned nearly half a century ago — a power which grew uninterruptedly during the whole of the Cold War .
During the last seven years of the so - called “ global war on terrorism , ” this expansion of power — together with the rise in military funding — has only escalated , accompanied by increasingly sinister features bound up with US imperialism ’s growing reliance on militarism as a means of offsetting the decline in its global economic position .
The military chiefs of the Pentagon ’s regional commands — CENTCOM , PACOM , SOUTHCOM and the new AFRICOM — have largely supplanted ambassadors and civilian officials as the representatives of US interests and power around the globe .
Meanwhile , in prosecuting two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the military command has been tasked with running colonial - style administrations with virtually unfettered power over entire populations .
Finally , with the creation of military tribunals and military prisons , such as the one in Guantánamo , the military has usurped tasks that historically have been assigned to civilian courts operating under the rules of the US Constitution .
These momentous changes have taken place even as the military , and particularly its officer corps , has grown increasingly separate and estranged from the civilian world and become ever more dominated by Republican politics in general and evangelical Christian beliefs in particular .
A “ professional ” and “ volunteer ” force , it is more insulated from the popular pressures felt by armies made up of draftees and “ citizen soldiers ” of earlier generations .
The Washington Post Sunday published an extraordinarily blunt opinion piece by a former assistant secretary of state in the Bush administration , Thomas Schweich , on the increasing dominance of the American state by its military apparatus .
“ Our Constitution is at risk , ” wrote Schweich .
He warned that the elevation of an unprecedented number of former senior officers into Obama ’s cabinet could “ complete the silent military coup d’etat that has been steadily gaining ground below the radar screen of most Americans and the media . ”
Schweich , who served as an ambassador for counter - narcotics in Afghanistan and then oversaw international law enforcement affairs at the State Department , wrote that he “ saw firsthand the quiet , de facto military takeover of much of the US government , ” which in Iraq and Afghanistan , he said , “ was , in theory , justified by the exigencies of war . ”
He stressed that what began abroad is coming home .
“ Now the Pentagon has drawn up plans to deploy 20,000 US soldiers inside our borders by 2011 , ostensibly to help state and local officials respond to terrorist attacks or other catastrophes . ”
This mission , he warned , “ could easily spill over from emergency counter - terrorism work into border - patrol efforts , intelligence gathering and law enforcement operations . ”
A report that appeared in a magazine published by the US Army War College last month , just weeks after the election , indicates that the Pentagon is preparing its own “ transition , ” a process that is being driven not by Obama ’s vague promises of “ change ” but by what the military command sees as a historic crisis of the existing order that could require the use of armed force to quell social struggles at home .
Entitled “ Known Unknowns : Unconventional ‘ Strategic Shocks ’ in Defense Strategy Development , ” the monograph was produced by Nathan Freier , a recently retired Army lieutenant colonel who is a professor at the college , the Army ’s main training institute for prospective senior officers .
According to the magazine , he “ continues to provide expert advice to key actors in the security and defense policymaking and analysis communities . ”
One of the key contingencies for which Freier insists the US military must prepare is a “ violent , strategic dislocation inside the United States , ” which could be provoked by “ unforeseen economic collapse ” or “ loss of functioning political and legal order . ”
He writes : “ To the extent events like this involve organized violence against local , state , and national authorities and exceed the capacity of the former two to restore public order and protect vulnerable populations , DoD [ Department of Defense ] would be required to fill the gap . ”
Freier continues : “ Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order …
An American government and defense establishment lulled into complacency by a long - secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly divest some or most external security commitments in order to address rapidly expanding human insecurity at home . ”
In other words , a sharp intensification of the unfolding capitalist crisis accompanied by an eruption of class struggle and the threat of social revolution in the US itself could force the Pentagon to call back its expeditionary armies from Iraq and Afghanistan for use against American workers .
Given such conditions , he adds : “ DoD might be forced by circumstances to put its broad resources at the disposal of civil authorities to contain and reverse violent threats to domestic tranquility .
Under the most extreme circumstances , this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States .
Further , DoD would be , by necessity , an essential enabling hub for the continuity of political authority in a multi-state or nationwide civil conflict or disturbance . ”
This peculiar phrase — “ an essential enabling hub for continuity of authority ” — is a euphemism for military dictatorship .
He concludes this section of the article by noting , “ DoD is already challenged by stabilization abroad .
Imagine the challenges associated with doing so on a massive scale at home . ”
The point is well taken .
Having failed to quell resistance and restore order in Iraq and Afghanistan , what would be the prospect of the military succeeding in an occupation of the US itself ?
That these questions are being asked by the Pentagon ’s strategic planners should be taken with deadly seriousness .
Those commanding the armed forces of the US capitalist state foresee the present crisis creating conditions for revolution and are preparing accordingly .

An analyst with ties to the telecom industry called Google Inc. a bandwidth hog in a report released this week .
Scott Cleland , president of Precursor LLC. , a research firm bankrolled by telecom heavyweights like AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. , released a report on Thursday saying that Google uses 21 times more bandwidth than it pays for .
The study ( download PDF ) estimates that Google accounted for 16.5 % of all U.S. consumer Internet traffic this year ; that number is predicted to jump to 25 % in 2009 and 37 % in 2010 .
" Internet connections could be more affordable for everyone , if Google paid its fair share of the Internet 's cost , " wrote Cleland in the report .
" It is ironic that Google , the largest user of Internet capacity pays the least relatively to fund the Internet 's cost ; it is even more ironic that the company poised to profit more than any other from more broadband deployment , expects the American taxpayer to pick up its skyrocketing bandwidth tab . "
Google , however , is n't taking the criticism lying down .
Posting a response on the Google Public Policy Blog , Richard Whitt , Google 's Washington Telecom and Media Counsel , noted that since Cleland is paid by the phone and cable companies , he 's not exactly a neutral party .
" Not surprisingly , in his zeal to score points in the Net neutrality debate , he made significant methodological and factual errors that undermine his report 's conclusions , " wrote Whitt , calling Cleland 's cost estimates " overblown . "
" First and foremost , there 's a huge difference between your own home broadband connection , and the Internet as a whole .
It 's the consumers voluntarily choosing to use our applications who are actually using their own broadband bandwidth -- not Google .
To say that Google somehow ' uses ' consumers ' home broadband connections shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Internet actually works . "
Net neutrality has been a scorching hot button issue for months now .
Google , Microsoft Corp. and other major Internet site operators have joined with small Web site owners to oppose broadband providers like AT&T Inc. and Verizon that want to offer faster network performance to companies that pay more .
The issue has been dubbed " Net neutrality " by those who oppose a two - tier system of access and pricing .
Google co-founder and president Sergey Brin even met with U.S. lawmakers last summer to press for legislation that would prevent Internet access providers from charging Web sites more for faster content delivery .
It 's also well known that Cleland has no qualms about taking shots at Google .
Whitt went so far as to refer to the analyst 's report as " payola punditry . "
" We do n't fault Mr. Cleland for trying to do his job , " wrote Whitt .
" But it 's unfortunate that the phone and cable companies funding his work would rather launch poorly researched broadsides than help solve consumers ' problems . "

GE Has Cash , Seeks Startups
January 26th , 2009 by Jennifer Kho
It may be a bad time to seek funding , but some cleantech investors see it as a good time to get a deal .
At the Clean - Tech Investor Summit in Indian Wells , Calif. , last week , Kevin Walsh , managing director of renewable energy for GE Energy Financial Services , said GE is taking advantage of the economic environment to snag good deals and is also looking at smart - grid and energy - efficiency opportunities .
“ We ’re being opportunistic , ” he said .
“ You ’ll see more deals on the venture side in the next few months . ”
GE Equity and GE Energy Financial Services last week announced they had invested in TPI Composites , which makeslight - weight wind - turbine blades .
Other investors in the $ 20 million round include Landmark Growth Capital Partners , NGP Energy Technology Partners and the Angeleno Group .
Even though industry groups say venture - capital funding has fallen off , a number of other startups also have closed rounds this rounds , including GoodGuide , Ze- Gen , SolFocus , ZeaChem and Sentilla .
While investors are definitely being cautious , they are also looking for the right places to put their money .
Andy Katell , senior vice president of communications at GE Energy Financial Services , told me this TPI funding signals — among other thing — that GE has capital to invest .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama said his administration will offer a hand of friendship to the Muslim world but will hunt down terrorist organizations that kill innocent civilians .
President Obama has taken an early interest in the Middle East peace process .
" My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy , " Obama said in an interview with Al - Arabiya , the Dubai - based satellite television network .
" We sometimes make mistakes .
We have not been perfect . "
During his run for the White House , Obama pledged to improve ties with the Muslim world , draw down U.S. troops in Iraq and close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The president also has pledged to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital in the first 100 days of his administration .
No location has been announced .
Obama said the United States will go after terrorist groups that kill innocent civilians but will do so while respecting the rule of law .
The president said that difference makes America great .
The Obama administration also has taken an early interest in the Middle East peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians , with the president naming former Sen.
George Mitchell as his special envoy to the region .
Mitchell is scheduled to arrive in the Mideast on Tuesday to shore up a fragile cease - fire between Israel and Gaza 's Hamas leadership .
" I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away , " Obama told Hisham Melhem , Al - Arabiya 's Washington bureau chief .
Watch Obama reach out to Muslims »
A tentative cease - fire between Israel and Hamas - ruled Gaza began last week after a three - week military operation by Israeli troops in the Palestinian territory .
" Ultimately , we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what 's best for them .
They 're going to have to make some decisions , " Obama said .
" But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people .
And that instead it 's time to return to the negotiating table . "
Obama said the United States will start by listening , not dictating , and then a response will be formulated after consultations with all the major parties involved .
iReport.com : What should Obama do first ?
Obama 's interview was seen widely in Pakistan and has received a generally positive response from analysts there .
Islamabad author and journalist Imtiaz Gul told CNN : " It 's a good sign of an attempt to reconcile with the Muslim world , to say America wants to reach out to them and not to consider them as an enemy . "
Analyst Zaid Hamid said that Obama has yet to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world .
Hamid said the real litmus test for the Muslim world is what Obama does with the crisis in Gaza .

When Alverroes ( Ibn Rashd ) composed his philosophical works , some of which being rebuttals to Avicenna ’s ( Ibn Sina ) theories on the “ universal mind ” , neither polymath ever imagined that their works would become the foundation for European secularism .
Nor did they imagine that this young race of “ barbarians ” would use the theory to undermine the societies each man had hoped to reform , or that their social theories would morph into a new pseudo - religious ideology championed by later - day secular saints like Sam Harris and Bill Maher .

The theories of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rashd were far ahead of their time and fell upon the deaf ears of a world more concerned with the complexities of commerce than the mysteries of the self .
Born largely from Quranic concepts of the nature of the Nafs ( soul or self ) , their philosophical inquiries , lead directly to the world ’s first psychiatric hospitals , clinical treatments of mental illness , and the scientific method itself .
But once these ideas became readily available to those few Europeans learned enough to read , it took on a new form - like the ax whose wielder realized its power and transformed the tool into a weapon .
Through their works and those of other Muslim scholars , Europeans were able to reintroduce themselves to ancient Greek philosophy ( some Muslim scholars classified Socrates as a prophet of his age ) and catch up to the intellectual development of the rest of the world .

But most importantly they ’d forged a new weapon against the tyranny of the church .
However , the scholars who devised these works never found themselves at odds with the “ church ” ( or rather the mosque ) because there was no church authority with which to contend , much less a contention between science and religion .
In fact , they themselves were respected religious scholars and judges .
It could be said that the only true opposition they faced was from the state that often saw fit to employ such minds when formulating strategy or predicting the maneuvers of its rivals , but vehemently opposed the culture of logical inquiry their teachings elicited .
In that juxtaposition a link emerges : The State .
In Europe the “ church ” was the state and its dogma the ideology of the state .
As the ideas of these foreign scholars took hold , – ideas born from a doctrine that undermined the chief tenets of Christian dogma – Europe ’s new scientists ran into direct opposition with the state in the form of the “ church ” .
Secular thought would continue to gain ground within the state , leading first to divisions of power between secular and religious entities , then to reformation church movements spearheaded by European polymaths .
These African and Arab scholars who had accidentally penned Europe ’s educational corpus , heavily influenced this new breed of European scholars , like St. Thomas Aquinas .
But these ideals would n’t take hold immediately , for the new secularism was wresting power from the church and placing it firmly in the hands of the crown .
What originally could be perceived as the decentralization of power , was in reality the fragmenting of power into disparate highly centralized hands .
As the economies of Europe transitioned from agricultural fiefs to moneyed trade centers , a new ideology began to emerge to supplant the church .
The church was no more tyrannical than this new system , it was simply unable to adapt to the challenges of the new epoch .
Now instead of Papas in big white hats pushing hidden agendas under the “ guidance ” of a distant and invisible God , Europe had Princes in big white palaces pushing hidden agendas under the guidance of nebulous and intangible forces ; state interests and the market .
The old clown in a new suit would not be fully recognized , even until our present day .
But this new structure would provide the state with a more adaptive and morally flexible premise from which to rule , and give rise to the nation - state .
Soon the efficiency of the nation - state would out compete the empire structure the world over ( the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the institution of Kamal Ataturk ’s reforms heralded the global triumph of nationalism ) .
The state then became ‘ Father ’ or ‘ Jalal ’ ( Majesty / Power ) , the market the ‘ Holy Spirit ’ or ‘ Jamal ’ ( Beauty / Beneficence ) , and propaganda the ‘ Word ’ become flesh .
Ultimately the same crimes that compelled Europe to oppose the church would continue long after its demise as a state entity , and even take on a new more horrifying scale through the efficiency of science .
The lessons of Avicenna , Averroes , and company were not fully understood in either society , with few exceptions , it would seem .
Their primary goal was to free people from any lifestyle that did n’t emulate the natural state of the human being , so they believed the human form to be the most complete manifestation of the divine .
Instead the modern world has endured the abuses of state and church forces that in their collusion , made a play of being at odds with one another .
Numerous examples of this can be observed .
While market forces set the trans - Atlantic slave trade in motion , its justification rested heavily on church sanction .
The emerging doctrine justifying Europe ’s aggressive and inhumane activities would come to be known as the “ White man ’s burden ” ; a belief that caste the state and the church as co-joined partners in a joint venture to civilize and / or Christianize the rest of the world .
Strong contenders to this doctrine were the ideologies of the almost purely secular free - market aspirations of northern Europe .
These too would prove just as effective at securing gains for the state and just as nightmarish in their ability to terrorize and destroy foreign populations .
No greater example can be found than the efforts of King Leopold II in the Congo .
When first laying out his colonial aspirations , the ideology Leopold espoused was purely secular .
So great were the abuses imposed by his endeavor that even the church rebuked Leopold , contending that he should only “ kill the people for the ‘ crimes ’ they commit . ”
While church forces seemed unwilling to endorse amputating the limbs of children and forcing women to carry the heads of their dead husbands , the emerging secular states of Europe felt all too obliged to implement these methods in their own colonial holdings ; of this , Haiti is a towering example .
When King Leopold created his own private colony the population of the Congo was approximately 20 million , when at last international outcry forced him to cede control to Belgium proper , 11 million tortured and broken souls remained , divided in ways that they had never before known .
Then with the emergence of the industrial era the state would completely subvert the church , claiming dominance for its own trinity and empowering state sponsored scientists as the new clergy .
This move was born purely of logical necessity : the church , though captivating , is largely stagnant and barely able to compete with the inspirational nature of the new possibilities science could offer .
Furthermore , the church had always served to bring people together , even if only to be ruled , but the new scientific trends were able to bring the world together while simultaneously driving societies apart by isolating the individual in convenience .
Enter Nationalism , a modern secular philosophy that would forge a reality where nation - states decimate entire populations of people with but an utterance of the Word , preaching the doctrine of securing State interests through the right guidance of Market Forces .
This new ideology would centralize power , subvert dissent , and captivate the minds of its adherents far more effectively than religion ever has , and simultaneously gather resources both domestically and abroad more efficiently than the empire structure ever could .
The clergy would be replaced by the greater scientific community , as scientists now entered the religious sphere to engage in Christian style apologetics against the vanguard who first employed the method .
Magic
Thinking would be replaced by doublethink , and the ritual of prayer with the pledge of allegiance to the state .
The original Pledge of Allegiance , having been penned by a Christian socialist Francis Bellamy without the words “ under God ” , would prove a tremendous success in the effort to attribute the state structure the all - transcendent nature normally attributed to Godhood .
But even this would be surpassed by the movements of Mao in China and Stalin in Russia .
Both states would preside over the destruction of their respective cultures and internal massacres of a scale never before seen ; 10 million in China ’s “ Great Leap Forward ” and 20 million throughout Russia ’s reign of terror .
In the face of unprecedented foreign and domestic violence , disintegrating social structures , and sociopathic state behavior a new wave of later - day secular preachers have emerge .
Men like Sam Harris who masterfully craft their words to attribute every act of violence in the world to religious zeal , then quietly ignoring those zealous secular movements who prove just as violent and fanatical .
Anyone who watched Bill Maher ’s Religulous may have found his epilogue most interesting .
He issued words of encouragement to “ sane ” secularly minded people to “ overcome our timidity ” and “ do something ” to stop the rising tide of fanaticism .
Then behind it all played a running collage of nuclear blasts and other apocalyptic results of secular endeavors along side scenes of the recalcitrant victims ; implying “ they ” are the source of the problem .
His sermo
n left many questions unanswered like , “ What exactly does he propose we do about this dangerous and unwanted population of insane and degenerate people ? ”
The style and tone of his message was reminiscent of Mao ’s message just before he began torturing Buddhist priests in an effort to “ reform ” them from their faith .
But underneath all of this echo the words of Averroes , haunting our collective conscious from the grave .
His lessons were at once a lesson and a warning .
Having been among the first to clinically treat mental illness and seeing the state as an extension of the individual , he knew well what a purely logical mind would lead to , sociopathy .
Inevitably the state , like a sociopath , would reach all decisions as the aggregate of several cost - benefit analyses , wherein citizenry is one among many assets to be weighed .
This is not to say that all secular states behave this way , in fact none currently act purely in this fashion .
There are still lingering vestiges of the old moral codes peppering their decisions .
But these mores are rapidly deteriorating and every state , it seems , is in a race to achieve this pure secular ideal .
Again the echoes stir , and now the ancient teachings are as poignant as the day they were inked on pages which sat long untouched , crumbling beneath the weight of age and the apathy for age this new world enjoins .
The center collapses and society falls in upon itself , each aspect in his own capacity blames the others for his own fall , and those who blame the self for its own fall are silenced .
But truly , secularists should not be unnerved by all of this .
A pure logician would see ethics and morality as a hindrance to logical deduction , based entirely in unobservable abstractions of the human imagination .
Ultimately the secularist should care little weather people “ believe ” or not , this is no more than a variable to consider when formulating strategy to deal with such people .
Religious fundamentalism maybe on the rise but this should be of no more concern than our changing climate .
Each observable phenomenon has its cause and inevitable effect on the greater reality ; so then the logician should work only to exploit the opportunities arising from these occurrences while checking their adverse consequences .
This can be illustrated in the need for fire to survive , but the knowledge that all fire burns .
A fool would become angry at the fire should it burn him .
The logician would take steps to ensure she is never burned .
Ultimately logicians should be detached .
Thoughts of right and wrong are irrelevant consequences of differing perspectives , and all that matters are the goals and objectives they have set out to achieve .
If nothing else , the beliefs of people would be seen as a set of rules that make a population more predictable .
When one sees “ secularists ” arguing passionately against believing people or condemning the behavior of fanatics , it ’s difficult to determine whether they are arguing for logic , or simply a belief in the “ good news and tidings ” of our times .
Whatever their true motives , one thing is certain .
Whether through secularism or religion , humanity has achieved the same result and not much has changed , save the rhetoric .

The last working day of the Bulgarian Parliament for 2008 has surprisingly continued for only half an hour .
The Speaker Georgi Pirinski explained the MPs could start enjoying their holiday as they have completed the discussing and voting on all the drafts included in the Friday 's agenda .
The opposition however said all of the representatives of the ruling parties got afraid of meeting the farmers , the students and the eco-activists who are to gather in front of the building of Parliament for protest actions .
Voting on the law for the political parties was postponed and will be held at the beginning of the new 2009 year .

I 'm a bit of a fan of the medical TV series House .
The brilliant main doctor , Gregory House , himself disabled as a result of a misdiagnosis , is typically very keen on the idea that the complicated disorders he investigates cannot be treated successfully unless they are diagnosed accurately .
Other characters often urge that the situation is desperate and Something Must be Tried , but House backs himself to diagnose accurately , except as an absolute last resort when time runs out .
Often in the show , the need to try something dominates and many treatments are tried based on misdiagnosis .
Such treatments often make things worse - either by actively harming the patient or by preventing accurate diagnosis .
Let me take these in turn .
I do not doubt for a moment that there have been bad loans made in the past that have to large losses , rendering many financial institutions undercapitalised or insolvent .
But the error is to think that this is a matter of history , that if only we could get banks to not be silly in their lending practices now they would all be fine except for the burden of these past losses , so that capital injections can save them .
I have argued many times before that I consider this a serious error of diagnosis .
In my view the correct diagnosis is that much of the financial sector will not generate sufficient profits in the future to pay off loans taken out in the past ( it is n't just that they made bad loans , it is that they themselves are poor risks qua borrowers ) and that other parts will not generate profits at all .
If I am correct , then unless there is significant restructuring of the sector ( some is going on , but not nearly enough yet ) then future losses will wipe out the governments ' capital injections .
Institutions with future profitability crises cannot be saved by capital injections except insofar as these are used to buy time for restructuring .
I know I have said this before many times , but I do not believe that many opinion formers have understood the point up to now .
I certainly believe that governments should face much more challenge on this issue - on what basis does our government believe that the UK 's government - dependent financial institutions will , without significant restructuring , be in a position to honour their debts ?
If they wo n't ever be able to honour their debts without significant restructuring , why are we giving them vast sums of money so that they can lose it all in ongoing unviable businesses ?
Indeed , worse than that , why is our government urging these institutions to engage in ever more unprofitable business at the expense of potentially - profitable competitors ?
( For remember , when you subsidize a loss - making company in a competitive environment , you do n't simply lose money - you also risk bankrupting rivals that ought to be taking over the business of the failed firm and thereby increasing their profits . )
Second misdiagnosis : regulation .
We see this diagnosis all around .
There are lots of personal criticisms of the FSA or of Mervyn King or Alan Greenspan , as if somehow all the world 's financial regulators and central banks , quite by chance , happened to be incompetent at the same time .
I see criticisms of the boards of banks , as if they were all morally culpable or personally incompetent .
One thinks : " Is n't that an amazing coincidence , that we get all these negligent on incompetent people turning up at the same time in such senior positions ? "
This is so self - evidently silly , it 's astonishing that the angle gets any airtime at all .
A marginally less silly , but still badly flawed angle is the claim that financial regulation was too light touch ( some say that " light touch became soft touch " ) .
But this remains a claim about implementation , not strategy .
The contention is that the regulatory approach was broadly correct ; it just was n't done very well in practice .
No .
A crisis on this scale , as widespread as this , is not to be diagnosed in terms of a bit of an error here , not quite tough enough there , rather incompetent at this , somewhat negligent at that .
Surely it must be manifest to any disinterested observer that there was something wrong with the strategy , not the implementation of that strategy .
As I have urged before , my view is that the whole regulatory approach of the past twenty years has been badly flawed .
It is clear now ( some of us complained earlier , but I think none of us thought matters would turn out this badly ) how foolishly hubristic regulation has been .
The strategy has been to try to replace , almost throughout the system , personal responsibility for assessing the risks we take on when we buy financial products and the value that they have to us - to replace this personal responsibility ( caveat emptor ! ) with regulatory badging , particularly through financial regulators but also through ratings agencies .
We have taken the view that appointed " experts " were the people to understand how sound companies were or what were the pros and cons of new products we had n't seen before .
But that strategy was flawed .
Much political and journalistic comment is along the lines that it just was n't done well enough - that , somehow , if we 'd only paid FSA staff rather more or had more of them or got them to think about this or that issue more then all would have been well .
Do we really believe that ?
Of course , with the benefit of hindsight we can always see detailed mistakes made in the past .
But was it merely a matter of detail ?
Surely it must be obvious that this is to look at the surface - it 's chasing the symptoms , not properly diagnosing the disorder !
If we misdiagnose here - if we set up grander , more invasive , more " tough love " regulators and regulations in the future - that will make the next such crisis worse .
For no regulator can hope to understand the value of every new financial innovation , or anticipate the unanticipatable implications of new and complex processes .
Redoubling our efforts to make regulatory badging work as a strategy - driving caveat emptor out even more - will be the piling of hubris upon nemesis .
Misdiagnosis could well harm the patient more , not make her better .
Accurate diagnosis permits a cure of that disease .
Of course one day we will become sick with something else , and we all die in the end .
sic transit gloria mundi .
But let 's diagnose today 's disorder correctly and deal with tomorrow 's problem tomorrow .
If Buddha , Mohammed , and Jesus Christ joined hands and strolled down Westheimer turning automobiles into unicorns while singing " Blasphemous Rumors " I do n't think it would get as much coverage as that infernal karaoke machine at George Bush Intercontinental Airport ( including right here at Hair Balls ) .
And so , to commemorate this latest attempt to put Houston on the cultural map , here are some memorable karaoke scenes from the movies .
5. Duets ( 2000 )
I just returned from a meeting with Paul Krugman , Alan Greenspan , and the ghost of John Maynard Keynes , and they all assured me America 's current economic crisis is divine retribution for resurrecting Huey Lewis ' career .
4. The Cable Guy ( 1996 )
There was a time , not so long ago , when it seemed like Jim Carrey could do no wrong .
Then he teamed up with the Comedy Doombringer , Matthew Broderick .
The line from that moment to The Number 23 is a surprisingly short and straight one .
3 . When Harry Met Sally ( 1989 )
You remember the 80s , that magical decade when Meg Ryan was n't box - office poison , the Sharper Image was still solvent , and karaoke was still a novelty and not the omnipresent source of annoyance that makes it nigh impossible to have a quiet drink anywhere in the entire fucking country .
At least the pertinent part of the scene is the beginning , so you can stop the proceedings before Billy Crystal 's whining gets out of hand .
2. My Best Friend 's Wedding ( 1997 )
Making it impossible to root for either of the female characters -- one a conniving man -thief the other a credulous ditz -- makes this movie 's not - so subtle pro-homosexual agenda that much clearer .
The fact that this scene does n't hold a candle to Rupert Everett 's rendition of " I Say a Little Prayer " is no coincidence .
1. Lost in Translation ( 2003 )
Aside from the opening derriere in the windowsill shot , Bill Murray revisiting his old ' Nick the Lounge Singer ' character from SNL might be the best part of the movie .
Because for one shining moment , we do n't have to endure Scarlett Johansson attempting to act .

( Recasts with layoff order , adds background )
SAN FRANCISCO , Dec 19 ( Reuters ) - California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal emergency on Friday to call lawmakers into another special session to tackle the state ’s weakening finances , and separately ordered state officials to prepare to furlough and lay off employees to cut costs .
His two actions mark a dramatic escalation in the budget battle waged in recent weeks in Sacramento , the capital of the most populous U.S. state and world ’s eighth - largest economy , as its revenues fall harder and faster than expected .
California ’s state government now faces a $ 40 billion budget shortfall over its current and next fiscal years and is on track to run out of cash in February .
California ’s Democrat - led legislature concluded its prior special session on Thursday by approving an $ 18 billion budget package , but Schwarzenegger , a Republican , said he would veto it because he wants lawmakers to both address the state ’s budget gap and ease regulations to speed construction projects to help stimulate the state ’s economy .
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass said the Democrats ’ package would have provided for $ 3 billion in revenues for transportation projects , accelerated $ 3 billion in bonds for transportation projects and made it easier for hospital construction and expansion projects to move forward .
The dispute over which approach would better boost California ’s ailing economy , underscored by its 8.4 percent unemployment rate last month , comes on the heels of a decision on Wednesday by the state ’s Pooled Money Investment Board to halt $ 3.8 billion in loans for public works .
The state government needs funds from the Pooled Money Investment Board to pay for vital services .
The board ’s action affects almost 2,000 projects , including highways , schools , levees , housing and parks .
The legislature now has 45 days to pass and send a bill or bills addressing the state budget to Schwarzenegger .
In the meantime , the state ’s Department of Personnel Administration will under Schwarzenegger ’s executive order adopt a plan that would go into effect in February to furlough state employees and supervisors for two days per month .
The order also calls for state agencies and departments to initiate layoffs and other “ program efficiency measures ” to post savings of up to 10 percent in the state ’s general fund .
“ Every California family and business has been forced to cut back during these difficult economic times and state government cannot be exempt from similar belt tightening , ” a statement from Schwarzenegger office said .
Assembly Majority Leader Alberto Torrico and two other top Democratic lawmakers issued a statement that said Schwarzenegger ’s order “ adds insult to injury for the state ’s economy ” and chided him for failing to win over either Democrats or Republican lawmakers to his budget plan .
“ The governor has shown he ca n’t negotiate with Republicans , he does n’t negotiate with Democrats , and now he ’s refusing to negotiate with employees , ” their statement said .
“ It ’s the same lack of leadership that has kept him from coming up with a single vote for any budget solution .
And now that lack of leadership has resulted in his making a scapegoat of employees who are not the source of the problem . ”

Five US Blackwater guards in Iraq charged with manslaughter David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email This US : Blackwater used grenades on unarmed Iraqis ; Lawyer says Blackwater guards ' beyond innocent '
Five guards with the US security firm Blackwater who were accused of gunning down 17 Iraqis in 2007 were charged with manslaughter , attempted manslaughter and weapons violations , the Justice Department said Monday .
" The indictment charges five Blackwater security guards with voluntary manslaughter , attempt to commit manslaughter for the shooting in Baghdad , Iraq , " said Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rowan .
" In addition , we can report that a sixth guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for the same shooting , " Rowan said .
" Blackwater Worldwide security guards opened machine gun fire on innocent , surrendering Iraqis and launched a grenade into a girls ' school during a gruesome Baghdad shooting last year , prosecutors said Monday in announcing manslaughter charges against five guards , " the Associated Press reports .
The accused face up to 10 years in jail if convicted on the manslaughter charge , seven if found guilty of attempted manslaughter , and 30 for the weapons violations charge , said Jeff Taylor , Attorney for the District of Columbia .
The defendants , all under age 30 , worked as independent contractors for Blackwater Worldwide , which provided security services for diplomats and other officials in Iraq .
" While there were dangers in Baghdad in September 2007 , there were also ordinary people going about their lives , performing mundane , daily tasks , " said Rowan .
" For the safety of these people , as well as US government personnel and their own colleagues , security guards were obligated to refrain from firing powerful weapons , " he said .
According to the 35 - count indictment , the indicted men opened fire with automatic weapons on unarmed civilians in a square in Baghdad on September 16 last year , killing and wounding several dozen Iraqis .
" Today 's indictment and guilty plea should serve as a reminder that those who engage in illegal attacks on civilians in times of conflict or peace will be held accountable , " said Rowan .
The accused turned themselves in , in the southwestern state of Utah , where they are due to appear in court later Monday , the officials said .
Defense attorneys for the guards told reporters that their clients intend to please not guilty .
One of the attorneys said of his client , " He is beyond innocent . "
Blackwater has consistently maintained that its men were fired upon by insurgents and were simply returning fire .
CNN speculates that the defense may have sought the Utah venue with the thought that a conservative state would be more sympathetic to the defendants .
However , the judge might yet order the case moved to Washington , DC , where the indictment was issued .

Besides uncovering tunnels and bunkers in Gaza , Operation Cast Lead is also exposing a rift between a large part of the Israeli people and some of the leading mainstream media personalities .
On the third day of the war , a citizen started a petition on a free petition - hosting website , in which she accused Channel 2's main anchorwoman , Yonit Levy , of being “ anti- Zionist ” and expressing empathy with the enemy .
The petition 's goal was to reach 10,000 signatures but less than two weeks after it was launched , it had reached 34,000 and was still growing rapidly ( the petition 's owner decided to disable further signatures because , she said , it had gotten out of control ) .
Dana Weiss ( L ) , Oshrat Kotler
Flash 90 , Moshe Shai/ PR
The Ma'ariv / NRG website reported that Levy also faced severe criticism from within the ranks of Channel 2's News Corporation .
Her critics accused her of weakening national morale by conducting empathetic interviews with Gazan Arabs and asking them about the civilian casualties there .
This criticism , combined with the web petition , reportedly caused Levy to react emotionally and led to a teary - eyed incident after the evening newscast on January 6 .
Angry viewers also filed complaints with Channel 2's ombudsman .
“ I watched the 8 o'clock news presented by Miss Yonit Levy , ” one of them wrote , “ and at the end of the newscast she said the following sentence : ' It 's hard to convince the world that the war is justified when we have one person dead and the Palestinian nation has 350 dead . ' ”
The letter went on : “ As a father to a combat soldier in the Armored Corps , how am I supposed to send him into battle when I hear such sentences from the aforementioned lady and I conclude from their content that this war is unjustified ?
How can I send my son to battle when the Nation of Israel 's television announces with pomp that students are holding a demonstration against the war ? ”
Channel 2 enjoys the highest ratings among Israel 's TV channels and its 8:00 p.m. newscast maintains a clear lead over competitors Channel 10 and Channel 1 .
Maa'riv / NRG reported that the public protests against Levy 's perceived injection of her dovish views “ has been discussed in internal conversations and Levy has been asked to be aware of what she says – but no one will admit this publicly . ”
“ We are not from the United Nations , ” the evening newscast 's chief editor , Guy Sudri , said .
“ We are Israelis and we are all patriots . ”
The Ma'ariv / NRG reporter notes that “ Yonit Levy is not the only anchorwoman whose words can be interpreted , at least by some of the viewers , as empathy for the other side .
In interviews conducted in the last days , one could also view Channel 10's anchorwomen Miki Haimovich and Oshrat Kotler sensitively asking interviewees from Gaza about their personal security and that of their children . ”
The report said further that “ Dana Weiss , of Channel 2 news , was also not sparing in her show of concern for the other side in the interviews she held in the nightly edition she hosts , and the facial expression , which so worried the talkback writers with regard to Levy , exuded clear sorrow and pain . ”
Another top female news personality , Ilana Dayan , defended Levy in an interview with Keren Noibach on Voice of Israel radio .
“ I know Yonit and I know that she is having a difficult time facing this assault , ” she said .
Columnist Ariana Melamed hinted in Ynet that Levy was being attacked because of her sex : “ In numerous items of research and surveys , it turns out that viewers want their news presented by men , preferably with silvery hair and an authoritative voice .
It creates trust .
Young women are generally believed less , ” Melamed claimed .
Channel 10's Kotler employed militant feminist rhetoric when she came out against the possibility of war in Gaza in January of 2008 .
Kotler used her television platform as presenter of Channel 10's evening newscast to call for negotiations with Hamas “ before we sacrifice hundreds of victims on the altar of Israeli masculinity . ”

Now hair 's a funny thing , this man is 80 !
Ron Williamson at 80 : Only the beard is greying
When strangers mistake him for a man 30 years younger , Ron Williamson does n't turn a hair .
He explains that he is in fact 80 - but his luxuriant dark - brown mane refuses to show any sign of age .
The secret of his follicular success , he claims , is two fold - good genes and a healthy blob of his favourite hair cream .
' I have used Brylcreem all my life , ' said Mr Williamson , a former social worker , at his home in Harrogate , North Yorkshire .
' I even used my dad 's when I was tiny .
I have kept the same hairstyle more or less through the years .
' There were a couple of times I tried to change it .
In the days of mods and rockers I attempted to slick it back , but within hours it popped up again .
' Most people assume I am younger than I am because my hair is still dark .
They say I am in my 50s or 60s , but I think they are just being kind .
' My beard is greying now , but that only started three or four years ago . '
Images of Mr Williamson throughout his life show him with the same full head of dark hair .
Mr Williamson , a father of four and grandfather of nine , said : ' I honestly do n't know what the secret is , but I think it 's good genes .
' My father and grandfather both had a full head of hair in their late years .
Four years ago I had treatment for prostate cancer which included chemotherapy .
I lost all my body hair but not the hair on my head , which was strange . '
Mr Williamson , who has been married to Maureen for 34 years .
He is a keen walker and last year fulfilled an ambition by travelling south to complete the entire Thames Path , covering almost 200 miles over 16 days without aid or back - up .
Mr Williamson at three with flowing locks and tamed into a quiff at 17
It is estimated that four in five men in their 80s suffer from some degree of baldness .
Keith Hobbs , clinical director of the Battersea Scalp and Hair Clinic , said : ' He is certainly doing pretty well to have a full head of hair and not be looking grey .
It 's pretty rare for someone his age , but it seems like both his parents gave him very good genes .
' As for keeping his head hair during chemotherapy , the amount of loss depends on the drug used , the dose , and the person 's individual reaction to it .
' Sometimes the hair loss is so slight as to be hardly noticeable . '
The carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo flies higher than most other aircraft ( Image : Virgin Galactic )
Climate science could become an unexpected beneficiary of civilian spaceflight thanks to a deal between Virgin Galactic and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Virgin Galactic is developing a high - altitude plane called WhiteKnightTwo that will carry a passenger rocket , SpaceShipTwo , to a height of about 50,000 feet ( 15 kilometres ) .
At that altitude , the rocket will separate from the plane and fire , taking its crew to the edge of space .
Smaller versions of the vehicles won the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize for private spaceflight in 2004 .

Now , NOAA has struck a deal with Virgin Galactic under which WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo will be equipped with sensors and monitoring systems that will measure carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas levels as the two craft fly through the atmosphere .
The deal was announced on Tuesday at the International Astronautical Congress in Glasgow , UK .
The craft are especially useful for NOAA because they fly at altitudes that are understudied – most aircraft fly below 50,000 feet .
The Concorde used to fly supersonically in the rarefied air at 56,000 feet ( 17 km ) – way above jumbo jets at 40,000 feet ( 12 km ) – but it has been retired .
“ The last plane still running that has any capability at those heights is the [ English Electric ] Canberra bomber , dating from 1949 .
But there are very few of them left , ” says Virgin Galactic chief Will Whitehorn .
Test flights
Outwardly , the Virgin planes will need no modifications to take in air for NOAA ’s analyses .
That ’s because engineers had already built in the capability to use the special tubes that run the external air to the planes ’ speed sensors .
“ We had hoped we might get this kind of scientific work in the design phase , ” says Whitehorn .
In this initial deal , NOAA sensors will be carried on the 200 or so flights planned to test and certify the WhiteKnight Two prototype .
After these test runs , NOAA and Virgin will later decide whether the idea is worth taking forward into the era of commercial spaceflight , where NOAA equipment could sit alongside paying passengers .
Right now , the 140 passengers that have paid $ 200,000 upfront for Virgin suborbital flights are undergoing tests in a centrifuge to see if their bodies can safely cope with the acceleration they will experience .
Two passengers have so far failed these tests and will not be flying , says Whitehorn .

Protesting health workers in Harare , December 3 .
The protest was attacked by riot cops .

By the National Co-Ordinating Committee , International Socialist Organisation Zimbabwe
December 2 , 2008 --
The situation in Zimbabwe has reached unprecedented levels of crisis .
As we have been saying for the last few years , such a crisis was climaxing and with a number of possibilities arising .
First and most likely was the likelihood of the bourgeois elite politicians in [ President Robert Mugabe's ] Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) uniting together in an elitist government of national unity in which ZANU - PF would be the senior partner around a Western - and capitalist - supported neoliberal economic agenda .
The MDC 's popularity would be used to pacify the urban working people from rising up .
The strong possibilities of this happening has been shown with the MDC 's willingeness to accept the crumbs offered by the ZANU - PF and endorsed by the regional Southern African Development Community in which Mugabe would remain with virtually all his executive presidential powers with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai acting as a prop .
Indeed the cynicism of the whole plot was shown in that as the MDC signed Constitutional Amendment 19 with ZANU - PF , Mugabe was appointing Gideon Gono for another five years as governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe -- the same Gono who has been the central figure in the ZANU - PF's and the ruling class ' neoliberal onslaught against working people for the last five years .
He is the virtual de facto prime minister of Zimbabwe , unelected and unaccountable to the people , accoutable only to his equally unelected and illegitmate masters .
However , we also argued that if the elites did not quickly resolve their differences through an elitist government of national unity and if the country did not descend into a failed state like Somalia , there was a real possibility of uprisings from below led by the working class , but critically involving a united front of labour and radical civic groups and social movements , and militant rank and file activists from the MDC .
We have consistently called for the urgent formation of such a united front to lead united mass action , centrally demanding a people - driven and anti-neoliberal constitution .
In the last few weeks the tensions and fights between the elites in the ZANU - PF and the MDC over the share - out of power and the continuation of sanctions , and the economic crisis has accelerated the crisis and brought greater political disllusionament among the ordinary people , leading to an increasing wave of discontent in the last few weeks , with strikes and protests by teachers , nurses , doctors , members of the National Constitutional Assembly ( NCA ) , women and students .
And most decisively in the last few days , riots by lower ranks of the army in Harare beating up cash vendors sent by Gono , as well as shops selling in foreign currency .
Yesterday they ran in the city centre singing and followed by scores of people denouncing Gono and the government .
The situation is now extremely delicate ahead of the protests called for December 3 by civic groups led by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions and also involving he Zimbabwe Social Forum and the National Constitutional Assembly .
The International Socialist Organisation ( ISOZ ) is centrally involved in the demonstrations through the Zimbabwe Social Forum ( ZSF ) , where many of its leading cadres are playing a critical role .
We welcome the demonstrations as the first sign of united front mass action that we have been calling for as the alternative to the elitist political parties ' negotiated settlement .
Please find below the statement issued by the chairperson of the ZSF , Munyaradzi Gwisai , who is also the general co-ordinator of ISOZ , calling for local , regional and international mobilisation and support for the mass action tomorrow on December 3 , 2008 .
We shall continually update comrades on developments whilst we call for your support on what could be a decisive day of action .
The resolution among the leadership of the ZCTU , ZSF and NCA is that we are going all - out no matter what the dictatorship throws at us and we are confident that hundreds will turn up for the demonstration .
No to Dictactorship !
Viva Socialism !
Zimbabwe Social Forum : December 3 day of action to say ` No to poverty , oppression and dictatorship !'
December 2 , 2008 -- Following the Zimbabwe Social Forum held in Harare on October 11 2008 and the Southern Africa Social Forum of October 18 in Swaziland , it was resolved that the only way to resolve the unprecedented economic and political crisis in Zimbabwe is united direct mass action .
It was noted that whilst the ordinary people were suffering and dying , elites in politics and business were wallowing in luxury .
Yet it is their system of neoliberal capitalism that has caused the crisis in the first place .
It was resolved that half - baked elitist political settlements centred around imperialist - inspired neoliberal economic policies , as in the non-inclusive SADC - Mbeki talks and already being implemented by the unelected de facto prime minister of Zimbabwe , Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono , who has been imposed on the people of Zimbabwe for a further five years , would only perpetuate the suffering of the people and the rule of his illegitimate and unelected masters in the ZANU - PF regime .
We cannot and we will not accept the same Gono who financed the destruction of our houses in Operation Murambatsvina and stole millions of US dollars meant for drugs and support of those with AIDS / HIV to buy judges , army and police chiefs and politicians Prados and Plasma TVs .
[ The social forums agreed ] that the only way forward to resolve the Zimbabwean crisis were immediate fresh democratic elections held under a new people - driven constitution that also guarantees the bread and butter issues of the working people and subordinates the private profit and wealth of the few to the human and social needs of the many .
To that end it was resolved to mobilise for all - out united mass action on December 3 by the Zimbabwe Social Forum ( ZSF ) together with the actions called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) demanding the removal of bank cash limits and the National Constitutional Assembly ( NCA ) rejecting the elitist constitutional process agreed by the politicians , and instead demand a people - driven constitution .
In addition are those demands already stated in the People 's Charter including :
Removal of all limits on cash withdrawals in banks -- it 's our money !
Gono must go now !
Abolish all forex shops -- pay workers tax - free minimum living wages in forex !
Declare the cholera outbreak a national disaster -- clean water for the people and full compensation for those who have died of cholera !
[ According to the UN , Zimbabwe 's ``unprecedented cholera outbreak '' has claimed 565 lives from the 12,546 recorded cases since August , and ``is worsening and is becoming difficult to contain as it spreads from cities ' ' . ]
Free antiretroviral drugs and support care -- open our hospitals and pay nurses and doctors living wages .
We want free quality health care for all !
Open our schools , colleges and universities now –- pay teachers and lecturers living wages –- abolish all fees in forex .
We want free quality education for all !
Affordable quality state subsidised public transport for all !
Living pensions for the disabled and elderly and free aids for them like wheelchairs and crutches , and an end to the stigmatisation and discrimination against the disabled .
No to harassment of informal and cross border traders -- passports are our right !
Full , affordable and quality state subsidised social services : water , electricity , refuse collection ; housing , sewerage facilities -- no to privatisation of social utilities .
Full democracy now :
No to the elitist givernment of nationalal unity and the Kariba draft constitution which keep the losers of the March 2008 elections in power !
We demand free and fair elections under a deople - driven constitution !
Already thousands have been protesting and striking in the last few weeks -- from nurses , doctors , women , students , the NCA and , in the last few days , riots by underpaid and starving junior members of the armed forces .
The hour has now arrived in Zimbabwe !
None but ourselves shall free ourselves !

Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions leaders arrested
Dear Friends ,
December 3 , 2008 -- Wellington Chibebe ( ZCTU secretary general ) and Lovemore Matombo( ZCTU president ) have managed to hand the ZCTU petition to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor .

When markets fall , a young stock trader 's thoughts turn to water purification tablets and meat gel .
Here 's a snip from a feature in New York Magazine about freaked - out workers on Wall Street who gazed into the abyss with a closer view than the rest of us , and made survival plans :
In his book Wealth , War , published last year , former Morgan Stanley chief global strategist Barton Biggs advised people to prepare for the possibility of a total breakdown of civil society .
A senior analyst whose reports are read at hedge funds all over the city wrote just before Christmas that some of his clients are " so bearish they 've purchased firearms and safes and are stocking their pantries with soups and canned foods . "
This fear is very much reflected in the market–prices of corporate bonds have been so beaten down at various points that they suggest a higher default rate than during the Great Depression .
Meanwhile , while the overall gold market has fluctuated , the premium for quarter - ounce gold coins–meaning the difference between the price for gold you can hold in your hand and that for " paper gold , " such as exchange - traded funds–rose to an all - time high of 20 percent .
" Gold is transportable , it 's 100 percent liquid , and it 's perfectly divisible in the context of ounces , bars , or coins , " says the head of a California research firm who keeps a supply of it , along with food , water , and guns , on hand .
" And most important , there 's no counterparty " – i.e. , it 's an investment beholden to no one , and perhaps one of the few assets that will retain value if the financial system collapses .
While it may look like these Wall Streeters are betting on such a collapse , their embrace of survivalism is an outgrowth of their professional habits of mind :
Having observed the economy 's shaky high - wire act from their ringside seats , they are trying to manage their risk and " hedge " against a potential fall .
" It 's like insurance , " says an investor who has stockpiled MREs and a hand - cranked radio .
" And by the time you need it , it 's way too late . "
Leave it for others to weep for the collapse of the social order .
These guys would prefer to be in a high - speed boat or ex-military vehicle , heading off toward their fully provisioned compounds in pursuit of the ultimate goal : to win the chaos .
What 's Making Hedge - Funders Paranoid ( NY Mag )

Here is what an MRE ( Meal Ready to Eat ) looks like when you are ready to eat it .
The Flickr user who shot and uploaded this , Adam Henning , says " This is Chicken with Salsa , one of the better ( yes , I said better ) MREs that they Army makes . "
Just a short list is staggering .
Who put that bogus “ uranium from Africa ” into the crucial prewar State of the Union address after the C.I.A. removed it from previous Bush speeches ?
How high up were the authorities who ordered and condoned torture and then let the “ rotten apples ” at the bottom of the military heap take the fall ?
Who orchestrated the Pentagon ’s elaborate P.R. efforts to cover up Pat Tillman ’s death by “ friendly fire ” in Afghanistan ?
And , for extra credit , whatever did happen to Bush ’s records from the Texas Air National Guard ?
The biggest question hovering over all this history , however , concerns the future more than the past .
If we get bogged down in adjudicating every Bush White House wrong , how will we have the energy , time or focus to deal with the all - hands - on - deck crises that this administration ’s malfeasance and ineptitude have bequeathed us ?
The president - elect himself struck this note last spring .
“ If crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , ” Barack Obama said .
“ I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt , because I think we ’ve got too many problems we ’ve got to solve . ”
Henry Waxman , the California congressman who has been our most tireless inquisitor into Bush scandals , essentially agreed when I spoke to him last week .
Though he remains outraged about both the chicanery used to sell the Iraq war and the administration ’s overall abuse of power , he adds : “ I do n’t see Congress pursuing it .
We ’ve got to move on to other issues . ”
He would rather see any prosecutions augmented by an independent investigation that fills in the historical record .
“ We need to depoliticize it , ” he says .
“ If a Democratic Congress or administration pursues it , it will be seen as partisan . ”

We could certainly do worse than another 9/11 Commission .
Among those Americans still enraged about the Bush years , there are also calls for truth and reconciliation commissions , war crimes trials and , in a petition movement on Obama ’s transition Web site , a special prosecutor in the Patrick Fitzgerald mode .
One of the sharpest appointments yet made by the incoming president may support decisive action : Dawn Johnsen , a law professor and former Clinton administration official who last week was chosen to run the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice .
This is the same office where the Bush apparatchik John Yoo produced his infamous memos justifying torture .
Johnsen is a fierce critic of such constitutional abuses .
In articles for Slate last year , she wondered “ where is the outrage , the public outcry ” over a government that has acted lawlessly and that “ does not respect the legal and moral bounds of human decency . ”
She asked , “ How do we save our country ’s honor , and our own ? ”
The last is not a rhetorical question .
While our new president indeed must move on and address the urgent crises that cannot wait , Bush administration malfeasance can’t be merely forgotten or finessed .
A new Justice Department must enforce the law ; Congress must press outstanding subpoenas to smoke out potential criminal activity ; every legal effort must be made to stop what seems like a wholesale effort by the outgoing White House to withhold , hide and possibly destroy huge chunks of its electronic and paper trail .
As Johnsen wrote last March , we must also “ resist Bush administration efforts to hide evidence of its wrongdoing through demands for retroactive immunity , assertions of state privilege , and implausible claims that openness will empower terrorists . ”

As John McCain prepares to stump for Sen. Saxby Chambliss today , ahead of the US Senate runoff in Georgia , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released an ad that uses McCain ’s past criticism of Chambliss against him .
The infamous ad that Chambliss ran against then Sen . Max Cleland in 2002 , question the triple amputee , Vietnam War hero ’s patriotism by linking him to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden .
Here is the original ad :
Advertisements
Back when John McCain was still a maverick he denounced the ad , “ I ’d never seen anything like that ad .
Putting pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden next to the picture of a man who left three limbs on the battlefield — it ’s worse than disgraceful .
It ’s reprehensible . ”
It is this denouncement that has found its way into a Democratic ad for Jim Martin .
So far , Obama has declined to head to Georgia to campaign for Martin ahead of the December 2 runoff , he has kept all of his Georgia field offices , left most of his paid staff on the ground there , and sent an additional 100 field operatives to the state to help the Democrat .
However , McCain ’s stumping for Chambliss in a state that the Republican won might make it necessary for Obama to campaign for the Democrat in the state .
The runoff is necessary because Chambliss won the election earlier this month , but he finished tenths of a percent below the state mandated fifty percent threshold .
I am going to guess that Obama probably will show up in the state sometime before the runoff .
From a strategic point of view , it is still too early to deploy the president elect there .
I would try to have Obama endorse Martin in an ad the week before the election , and have him in the state in the final few days of the campaign .
Sony ’s Bishop : Blu-ray Sales Are Encouraging
David Bishop
By : Erik Gruenwedel | Posted : 04 Dec 2008
With the holiday season an integral part of home entertainment ’s fourth quarter packaged media sales , Home Media Magazine asked studio executives about Black Friday and how the traditional day - after Thanksgiving discount sales day impacted Blu-ray sales and whether it was a catalyst for year - end results and into 2009 .
This week we interviewed David Bishop , president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment .
HM : Black Friday appeared to be positive for Blu-ray hardware and software , in addition to DVD .
How was it for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment ?
Bishop :
It was good for Blu-ray .
Hancock sold nearly 300,000 units through six days of release and a lot of that was on the Black Friday weekend .
We were really encouraged with what we saw .
Additionally , the numbers we are getting from our partners on the hardware side , both from PlayStation and Sony Electronics are very encouraging .
A lot of key retailers actually sold out of Blu-ray players , which is a sign that it is one of the four or five hot consumer electronics items in the marketplace .
Besides us , all of the studios have not only mentioned Blu-ray and DVD in their main ads , but they are also calling ads specific to Blu-ray .
That will go a long way toward driving consumer acceptance .
HM : What is SPHE doing to capitalize on the momentum ?
Bishop : I ’m not going to give you details but January is going to be a critical time period because Blu-ray hardware has sold so well .
We anticipate January from a Blu-ray perspective on software to be very strong .
HM : The floor price for BD players through the holidays is around $ 200 .
Is that enough to persuade budget - conscious shoppers to commit fully to the format ?
Bishop :
As is evidenced by the sell - off of Blu-ray players over Black Friday weekend , I would say we hit the sweet spot regarding price .
Some stores were sold out by 9:30 a.m.
Clearly , it is a top gift item .
There will be more price - point - oriented promotions throughout December and that momentum will continue .
HM : Is SPHE planning any major “ fifth - quarter ” releases on DVD or Blu-ray ?
Are you releasing first - quarter 2009 BD titles aimed at taking advantage of new Blu-ray player owners ?
Bishop :
We are finding that titles that bleed into the PlayStation 3 demographic [ i.e. video game enthusiasts ] are doing exceedingly well across the industry .
We put Pineapple Express in the market to capitalize on that phenomenon .
We will also have Nick & Norah ’s Infinite Playlist with Michael Cera , and the direct - to - video animated sequel Open Season 2 .
Then we ’ll start to roll out some key Academy Award - winning catalog titles as well .
It is also traditionally a good month because you get people back into stores with gift cards .
HM : Are you optimistic about year - end sellthrough revenue industry - wide for standard DVD ?
It was off just slightly at mid-year ; do you expect a surge this month to at least equal 2007 ?
Bishop :
We would be foolish to expect the standard - DVD numbers to come to 2007 levels .
There are the obvious economic situations that are keeping people out of stores , and depending on the chain it can range from 5 % down to 20 % down in foot traffic .
That is obviously going to have an effect on the business .
But that being said , the positive in all this is the momentum we are getting from Blu-ray .
It is continuing to grow and 200 % to 300 % year - over - year , and the ratio of Blu-ray and DVD sales continues to rise .
That calls for optimism .
For anyone who said that people would just go to digital and skip Blu-ray that has certainly been proven not to be true .
Even if you took Blu-ray separately as a revenue stream , it is probably 20 times larger than digital revenue .
HM : Will Blu-ray maintain its premium pricing or will it dissolve into commodity pricing ?
Bishop : Certainly on the new - release side there is no reason to change pricing .
New - release pricing has held on DVD for a while , albeit heavily discounted at retailers .
But we are not likely to change that for Blu-ray .
HM : Will SPHE increase the number of titles available digitally ( streaming and download ) in 2009 ?
Bishop :
We ’ve been pretty aggressive already with availability of titles .
The key going forward is learning the best marketing technique to maximize that revenue stream .
HM : Streaming was considered the heir apparent to packaged media .
Now it appears to have hit a wall .
Is that true ?
Bishop : I would n’t say it has stopped .
It is definitely growing quite nicely from a percentage standpoint .
It is certainly incremental growth at best .
As we said years ago when it was being compared to the music industry , which is ridiculous , people watch movies on their HDTV and 5.1 sound systems .
So until you are able to deliver high - quality content to the TV , then it is always going to be a subset or a niche market to packaged media .
HM : Both Netflix and Blockbuster have launched ambitious streaming services through standalone and third - party boxes , yet streaming revenue remains incremental .
Has the format caught on yet with average consumers ?
Or is it destined to largely remain with cable VOD ?
Bishop : I think it helps their value propositions to the consumer .
We want to get as many touch points to the consumer as possible .
So we support the growth of that through whatever means possible .
So do I think it is going to be a meaningful way people watch movies ?
Not today .
I think it is good for Netflix and Blockbuster when they are selling their subscription services and they have this additional value .
But people are going to be paying Netflix primarily to get movies on DVD or Blu-ray .
HM : What are your 2009 projections for packaged media ?
Looking into the crystal ball , what do you see ?
Bishop :
Well , it is a bit cloudy right now .
But again , I come back to the growth of Blu-ray and I think we are in for a nice ride upward .
The upside on all this depends on what happens at retail .
All things being equal , it should be another 150 % growth rate for Blu-ray .
By and large we can count on that piece of the business because there is going to be a level of enthusiasm about the format that people will recognize as a value and go out and purchase .
The unknown is what happens at the store - traffic level .
A big percentage of our business is driven off of impulse sales .
So , if people are n’t in stores then we could potentially take a hit .
But I think the enthusiasm over Blu-ray technology will help us even in the worse - case scenario .

Google Penalty Myths
One of the issues I discuss regularly with clients are elusive Google “ penalties ” .
More often than not , good - willed webmasters and small business owners undertake SEO techniques that are not only frowned upon by Google , but easily detectable and and even easier to counteract .
However , these techniques do not usually bring about “ penalties ” .
Penalty : a punishment levied by a search engine , normally in response to techniques which violate the ToS , which leaves the punished site ranking below the point at which it would rank were those techniques simply countered and ignored .
Is your site suffering a penalty ?
It is far too easy to attribute your site ’s poor rankings to a penalty when , more often than not , another more straight - forward answer is available .
First , penalties normally impact webmasters who undertake egregious steps to optimize their site : comment spam , forum spam , guestbooks , poor cloaking , etc .
Even then , most of the time these links are simply devalued .
Secondly , penalties are normally only diagnosable when all other ranking factors appear in order .
Is your site as old , have as many links , or as quality content as your competitors ?
Finally , penalties normally impact sites in obvious ways .
Did your site drop from the index altogether ( ban ) ?
Did all of your rankings drop in a uniform manner ( # penalties ) ?
Or were several keywords impacted and drops greater than 500 +?
Unless some mix of the above list are true , chances you are not suffering a penalty .
A couple of issues are more likely at play – resulting in an inability to rank or even lost rankings .
New algorithm updates or increased spidering of your site and its backlinks may have tripped a “ filter ” that more closely analyzed and APPROPRIATELY valued your links .
Many webmasters are shocked to learn that the techniques they have used for years to artificially inflate their rankings are no longer effective .
When Google fixes these exploits causing your rankings to drop , you are not suffering a penalty , you are simply no longer receiving credit for links that Google now believes to be unworthy .

Websites disappear ( especially older ones which may have been providing you a lot of PageRank pass - thru ) , other sites begin to implement No- Follow , blogs , comments and press - releases get auto - pruned .
Because the quality of the link matters so much , you could track your back links and believe your site to be growing in Link Popularity , but actually be losing your most important links .

This month two team of scientists managed to transform sugar , gained from agricultural waste , into a wide range of different chemicals , including jet fuel , diesel and gasoline .
The discovery was made by a research team composed of Randy Cortright , a chemical engineer , and his associates at Virent Energy Systems of Madison , Wisc. , and scientists headed by James Dumesic of the University of Wisconsin at Madison , a chemical engineer supported by the National Science Foundation .
The teams stated that now sugars and carbohydrates can be used to create many different products which would be used in pharmaceutical and chemical industries .
The core of the whole transformation from sugars into chemicals is a process called aqueous phase reforming , which was developed by Dumesic and Cortright .
Industrial communities pay a lot of attention to different methods of producing green gasoline , like aqueous phase reforming .
This is because such approaches generate a product that can be used within an existing infrastructure and what is most important is that it can be produced from plants grown in marginal soils , such as switchgrass .
Despite the fact that researchers still require some time to refine the process , the whole idea that gasoline and other important chemicals can be made from renewable plants has sparked interest in various industries .
Thanks to BioForming , the process developed by Virent , the company can now concentrate on commercialization and competitiveness in the United States .
" The early support of NSF helped lay the groundwork for our technical , and subsequent industrial , successes .
Our scientists now have years of expertise with our BioForming process and are rapidly moving the technology to commercial scale .
We are quickly working to put our renewable , green gasoline and other hydrocarbon biofuels in fuel tanks all over the world , " said Cortright , who also holds the position of chief technology officer at Virent Energy Systems .
" The technology developed by Virent is extremely promising , and has been refined over the last six years .
The aqueous phase reforming process used by both research is an innovative approach that may yield an important , positive impact on the energy demands of the U.S. and worldwide , " stated Rose Wesson , the NSF program officer who administered Virent 's grant .

Pics of San Franciscans Rallying Behind Israel 's Massacre Of Gazans by scary
Saturday Jan 10th , 2009 3:14 PM
As the number of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza passes 800 and the US and Red Cross accuse Israel of targeting aid convoys and engaging in other war crimes , some in San Francisco still choose to rally behind Israel .
The following photos are a pictures of Gaza and pictures of a pro-Israel counter - protest to a rally for Gaza on Saturday January 10th 2009 .
You might think that this crowd does n't represent the views of many Americans and that could be correct but both the US House and Senate voted with no opposition to a resolution backing Israel just yesterday and the bills were sponsored by several of our local representatives .
This is across the street for a rally for Gaza organized by ANSWER that drew several thousand .
Does it mean excusing the more than 300 children killed so far in the Gaza offensive ?
Does it mean excusing the destruction of thousands of homes and leaving over a million people without access to clean water or electricity for several weeks ?
The pro-war crowd always point out how Israel is similar to the US and there is a lot of truth to that .
The US has engaged in similar war crimes in Iraq in places like Fallujah where a whole city was surrounded and bombed for weeks on end .
The terror caused by Israel to the people of Gaza , the West Bank and Lebanon is on a scale that far exceeds that caused by the Palestinian rockets that have killed just a handful of people in the last few years .
During last year 's ceasefire almost no rockets were fired into Israel by Hamas but Israel kept up its assasinations of Hamas leaders and a blockade of Gaza that prevented food and medicine from getting to the Palestinian people .
Israel repeats over and over again that it left Gaza , but it forces Egypt to keep that border shutdown and attacks any boats that try to get into Gaza by sea even if the boats are clearly just carrying humanitarian supplies ( or trying to get Palestinians out so they can go to school abroad or get medical care ) .
Nationalism is one of the roots of Israel 's tendency for extreme violence and provides the moral excuse that allows many supporters of Israel to ignore Palestinian deaths or blame the victims for their own deaths
Bombing the most densely populated place on earth hurts civilians more than militants and as the elected government many of those killed listed as " noncivilians " are those doing basic governmental jobs like delivering mail and collecting trash .
Hamas will likely come out of this tragedy as the main winner since it is clear that Abbas and the PA are not willing to take a strong stand against Israel anymore even when Palestinians are dying by the hundreds .
This is force that is now killing Gazans and what do they have to fight back with ?
Rockets that are no much more than large bottle rockets .
It is likely that more people died in Israel due to accidents shooting off fireworks last year than died because of Hamas rockets .
At what point will those who support Israel start to question Israel 's actions .
Will it take 1000 Palestinians dead , 10,000 dead , 100,000 dead ?
When does one 's common humanity trump nationalism ?
if rocket fire in 2007 was the problem , why this massacre after a long lull in the rocket fire ?
See http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10123.shtml for info about rocket fire numbers in recent years
The rally for Israel pictured above was across the street from a large Palestine demonstration

Thanks to Martin at http://www.blogicandreason.blogspot.com/ for reformulating an argument of mine that I 've given in the past .
I 'll use his reformulation :
Now for the story :
The university professor challenged his students with this question : Did God create everything that exists ? "
A student bravely replied , " Yes , he did ! "
" God created everything ? " the professor asked .
" Yes , Sir , " the student replied .
The professor answered , " If God created everything , then God created evil ; since evil exists and , according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil . "
The student became quiet before such an answer .
The professor , quite pleased with himself , boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth .
Another student raised his hand and said , " Can I ask you a question professor ? "
The student stood up and asked , " Professor , does cold exist ? "
" What kind of question is this ?
Of course it exists .
Have you never been cold ? "
The students snickered at the young man 's question .
The young man replied , " In fact , Sir , cold does not exist .
According to the laws of physics , what we consider cold is , in reality , the absence of heat .
Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy , and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy .
Absolute zero ( - 460° F ) is the total absence of heat ; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature .
Cold does not exist .
We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat . "
The student continued , " Professor , does darkness exist ? "
The professor responded , " Of course it does . "
The student replied , " Once again you are wrong sir , darkness does not exist either .
Darkness is in reality the absence of light .
Light we can study , but not darkness .
In fact we can use Newton 's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color .
You can not measure darkness .
A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it .
How can you know how dark a certain space is ?
You measure the amount of light present .
Is n't this correct ?
Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present . "
Finally the young man asked the professor , " Sir , does evil exist ? "
Now uncertain , the professor responded , " Of course as I have already said .
We see it every day .
It is in the daily example of man ’s inhumanity to man
It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world These manifestations are nothing else but evil . "
To this the student replied , " Evil does not exist , Sir , or at least it does not exist unto itself .
Evil is simply the absence of God .
It is just like darkness and cold , a word that man has created to describe the absence of God .
God did not create evil .
Evil is not like faith , or love that exists just as result of what happens when man does not have God 's love present in his heart .
It 's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light . "
The professor sat down .
The young man 's name ---
Albert Einstein
You know that one ?
Good .
Time to deconstruct it .
Let 's get started .
First - this story is an urban legend .
It never happened :
http://www.snopes.com/religion/einstein.asp
Second - Einstein was a Pantheist , not a theist .
Practically an atheist in disguise .
" I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings . "
Upon being asked if he believed in God by
Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue , New York ,
April 24 , 1921 , Einstein : The Life and Times , Ronald W. Clark , Page 502 .
" It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
- Albert Einstein in Albert Einstein : The Human Side
Third -
The college professor is put forth as an arrogant , dogmatic man who treats science like a religion and views questions from students as a challenge to his worldview .
The student is put forth as a polite , honest , skeptic .
Again , the reality is that the roles are reversed : while a scientist can be dogmatic and a theist can be skeptical , science itself is skeptical , and religion itself is dogmatic .
The emotional immaturity of the professor is a projection of the emotions found in the sort of theist who would actually be inspired by this tripe .
Fourth - Cold is not ' the absence of heat ' anymore than " heat is the absence of cold ' .
Both ' hot ' and ' cold ' are human references to the motion of atomic particles - " hot " and " cold " are not opposites ( is 45 degrees the opposite of - 45 degrees ? ) or the lack of one another , they are both subjective evaluations of the same thing - movement .
Movement exists .
Fifth - This Thomistic - Augustinian semantic farce does n't solve the problem of evil .
Since an " evil " act requires human intent , a cognition , it 's clearly ridiculous to call " evil " a non entity for this reason alone , but there is yet a stronger reason : as long as a theist holds that ' evil exists ' , it is a fallacy of basic metaphysics to argue that it ' exists ' devoid of any ontology !
To exist is to exist as something .
Ergo , if ' evil ' exists is must exist as something , not nothing .
Sixth - " Evil is simply the absence of God " ? -
What passage does the theist cite here ?
This contradicts passages that affirm that ' god ' is the omnipotent creator .
It also directly contradict : Isa 45:7 - I form the light , and create darkness : I make peace , and create evil : I the LORD do all these [ things ] .
Note : some respond by stating that later versions of this passage change the word ' evil ' to something else , such as causing disaster .
However , to purposely cause disaster is to act in an evil manner , so this ' solution ' just moves the problem one step back .
In addition , Rook Hawkins points out that a christian trying to defend this claim through redefinition has a lot of redacting to do :
” Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and evil come ? ”
( Lam. 3:38 ) .

Seventh : ' God ' is defined in the bible as omnipresent , ergo there can be no ' absence of god ' as per the negative trait applied to ' god ' .
( See my essay on " Omni traits ' for passages in the bible that affirm omnipresence . )
**************************************************
Now , let 's revisualize the above dialogue rationally .
Where major editing is done , the justification is given in ( parentheses ) .
Dialogue with a young theist ( longer version )
A philosophy professor challenged his students with a form of the Euthyphro dilema : Did ' God ' create everything that exists ? "
A student replied , " Yes , he did ! "
( The ' bravely ' part is removed : civil disagreement is the very point of philosophy courses , no bravery is required for dissent !
Civil dissent is rewarded !
Agreement is the death of philosophy , disagreement is its life 's blood . )
" God created everything ? " the professor asked .
" Yes , " the student replied .
( The ' sir ' part is removed : no college student in the 21st century addresses a college professor as ' sir ' - which demonstrates that whoever it was that made up the original story never went to college .
In addition , the use of ' sir ' is just a pretense of ' respect ' - it comes off as passive aggressive anger more than anything else . )
The professor answered , " Well then , here 's a logical puzzle for you :
If God created everything , then God created evil ;
Therefore , according to the principal that ' our works define who we are ' , ' God ' is evil . "
The student became silently enraged over his worldview being ' attacked ' .
He began to project out his feelings of inadequecy as smugness coming from the professor .
The student then said : " Can I ask you a question professor ? "
" Of course , " replied the professor .
That 's the point of philosophical discourse .
( The writer of the original story clearly has little experience with a real college classroom .
The whole point of a philosophy or theology course is to foster discussion . )
Student :
Is there such thing as heat ? "
Professor : Yes , the professor replies .
Student : " Is there such a thing as cold ? "
Professor : " Yes , there 's cold too . "
Student : " No , there is n't "
The professor does n't grin or frown or react with any emotion other than curiosity .
After all , he 's heard bad arguments like this for more years than the student has been alive .
( The desire to see the professors ' smug smile wiped off his face ' is just another projection of the feelings of inadequecy found in theists who are n't able to argue their own points well ... )
The student continues .
You can have lots of heat , even more heat , super - heat , mega - heat , white heat , a little heat or no heat but we do n't have anything called ' cold ' .
We can hit 458 degrees below zero , which is no heat , but we can't go any further after that .
There is no such thing as cold , otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 .
You see , sir , cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat .
We can not measure cold .
Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy .
Cold is not the opposite of heat , just the absence of it "
Professor : ( Nodding his head in dismay , and working out how many times he 's heard this bad logic by now .
100 times ? ) .
Do you remember the section in your workbook on semantic fallacies ?
Student : ( gives a confused look a dog might make )
Professor :
Let me give you a quick review .
Both ' heat ' and ' cold ' are subjective terms ...
They are what the philosopher John Locke properly called " secondary qualities " .
The secondary qualities refer to how we humans experience a very real phenomena : the movement of atomic particles .
The terms ' heat ' and ' cold ' refer to an interaction between human nervous systems and various speeds of atomic particles in their environment .
So what we ' really ' have is temperature .... the terms ' heat ' and " cold ' are merely subjective terms we use to denote our relative experience of temperature .
So your entire argument is specious .
You have not ' proven ' that ' cold ' does not exist , or that ' cold ' somehow exists without any ontological status , what you have done is shown that ' cold ' is a subjective term .
Take away the subjective concept , and the ' thing in itself ' , the temperature we are denoting as ' cold ' , still exists .
Removing the term we use to reference the phenomena does not eradicate the phenomena .
Student : ( a bit stunned ) " Uh ... Ok ....
Well , is there such a thing as darkness , professor ? "
Professor :
You are still employing the same logical fallacy .
Just with a different set of of secondary qualities .
Student : " So you say there is such a thing as darkness ? "
Professor : " What I am telling you is that you are repeating the very same error .
" Darkness " exists as a secondary quality .
Student : " You 're wrong again .
Darkness is not something , it is the absence of something .
You can have low light , normal light , bright light , flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness , is n't it ?
That 's the meaning we use to define the word .
In reality , Darkness is n't .
If it were , you would be able to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it .
Can you give me a jar of darkness , professor ?
Professor : Sure , right after you give me a jar of light .
Seriously , " light and dark ' are subjective terms we use to describe how we humans measure measure photons visually .
The photons actually exist , the terms ' light ' and ' dark ' are just subjective evaluations , relative terms ... having to do , again , with an interaction between our nervous systems and another phenomenon of nature - this time , photons .
So again , doing away with a subjective term does not eradicate the actual phenomena itself - the photons .
Nothing actually changes .
If we humans tend to call 'x number of photons ' ' dark ' ( while cats refer to it as ' bright enough for me " those number of photons we denote as ' dark ' exist , and they continue to exist even if we do away with the term ' dark . '
Do you get it now ?
Student : ( gives a look not unlike a 3 year old trying to work out quantum physics )
Professor : I see your still struggling with the fallacy hidden in your argument .
But let 's continue , perhaps you 'll see it .
Student :
Well , you are working on the premise of duality , the christian explains .
Professor : Actually , I 've debunked that claim two times now .
But carry on .
Student : " Well , you assume , for example , that there is a good God and a bad God .
You are viewing the concept of God as something finite , something we can measure .
Professor : Be careful .
If you want to place your god beyond the grasps of reason , logic , and science and make him ' unmeasurable ' , then you are left with nothing but a mystery of your own devising .
So if you use this special plead your god beyond reason to solve the problem , you can't call your god moral either .
You can't call ' him ' anything .
You can't say anything else about something that you yourself have defined as beyond reason other than that the term you 've created is incoherent .
So your solution is akin to treating dandruf by decapitation .
Student : ( Gulps .
Continues on , oblivious to what was just said )
Sir , science cannot even explain a thought .
It uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen , much less fully understood them .
Professor :
You just said that science cannot explain a thought .
I 'm not even sure what you mean by that .
I think what you mean to say is this : there remains many mysteries in neuroscience .
Would you agree ?
Student : Yes .
Professor :
And , along the same line of thought , we accept that there are things like thoughts , or electricity or magnetism even though we have never seen them ?
Student : Yes !
Professor : Recall the section in your textbook concerning fallacies of false presumption .
Turn to the entry on ' Category error ' .
You 'll recall that a category error occurs when an inappropriate measure is used in regards to an entity , such as asking someone what the color of a sound is ...
Asking someone to ' see ' magnetism directly ( and not just its effects ) commits such an error .
However , there is yet another error in your argument : your assumption that empircism or even science is based on ' real time observation ' alone .
This is false .
Sight is not the sole means of knowing the world , nor is science merely the study of whatever we are currently looking at .
We can use other senses to detect phenomena .
And we can also examine their effects upon the world .
Furthermore , you are importing yet another erroneous presumption into the discussion : you are conflating the fact that science is incomplete with the implication that a lack of an answer from naturalism automatically means that your theistic assertion is correct .
So you 'll also want to review the section on ' arguing form ignorance . '
Do you have more to say ?
Student : ( The student , continues , mainly unfazed , due to the protection his shield of ignorance affords him . ) ....
Um ....... to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing .
Death is not the opposite of life , merely the absence of it "
Professor :
You are really in love with this secondary quality fallacy , are n't you ?
You are again confusing a secondary quality with the phenomena in of itself .
" Death " and " life " are subjective terms we use to describe a more fundamental phenomena - biology .
The phenomena in question , however , does exist .
Biological forms in various states exist .
Doing away with the subjective term does not eradicate the existence of death .
Nonplussed , the young man continues : " Is there such a thing as immorality ? "
Professor : ( Reaches for an asprin in his desk )
You 're not going to again confuse a secondary quality for an atttribute , are you ?
Please ... what can I do to help you see this problem ?
Student : ( Continues on , fueled by ideology and oblivious to reality )
You see , immorality is merely the absence of morality .
Is there such thing as injustice ?
No . Injustice is the absence of justice .
Is there such a thing as evil ? "
The christian pauses .
" Is n't evil the absence of good ? "
Professor :
So , if someone murders your mother tonight , nothing happened ?
There was just an absence of morality in your house ?
Wait , I forgot ... she 's not dead ... she 's just experiencing an absence of life , right ?
Student : Uh .....
Professor :
You 're beginning to see that something is missing in your argument , are n't you ?
Here 's what you 're missing .
You are confusing a secondary quality ... a subjective term that we can use to describe a phenomena , for the phenomena itself .
Perhaps you heard me mention this before ?
( The class erupts in laughter , the professor motions for them to stop laughing . )
' Immorality ' is a descrptive term for a behavior .
The terms are secondary , but the behaviors exist .
So if you remove the secondary qualities , you do nothing to eradicate the real behavior that the terms only exist to describe in the first place .
So by saying that ' immorality ' is a lack of morality , you are not removing immoral intentions and behaviors , or the problem of immoral intentions and behaviors from existence , you are just removing the secondary attribute , the subjective term .
And notice how dishonest your argument is on yet another level ... in that it speaks of morality and immorality devoid of behavior , but ' evil ' exists as a behavior , evil is an intent to do harm and an act commited with such an intent .
By the way , are you really trying to imply that immorality or evil are merely subjective qualities ?
Student : Gulp !
( Reeling from the psychological blows to his corrupt worldview .... )
Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes , professor ? "
The professor soothes his aching forehead , and prepares for the 1 millionth time that he will be subjected to the ' can you see the wind ' argument .
Professor :
What an interesting turn this conversation has taken .
Can I advise you to read Brofenbrenner 's suggestion against arguing over subjects over which you are uninformed ?
It 's in your textbook .
Page 1 .
Student : " Professor , since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on - going endeavor , are you not teaching your opinion , sir ?
Are you now not a scientist , but a priest ?
Professor : Interesting indirect comment on the priesthood .
But let 's leave that aside ...
We do observe the process of evolution at work , for the process works at this very moment .
As for the implication in your argument that one must ' be there ' to observe a process at it occurs , surely you realize that we can infer the process through examining the evidence that these processes leave behind ?
In a sense , we are there when we observe artifacts .
Consider for example the science of astronomy .
How do we know about super novas ?
Because we can observe diferrent supernovas in different stages of super nova , by observing their ' artifacts ' in the night sky .
The same stands for any historical science .
Your mistake here is that you think science is merely ' real - time - observation ' .
This is a strawman of science .
By your logic trees can't grow - after all , who 's actually witnessed a tree growing ?
Science is both direct and indirect observation ... it also allows for inference .
If , for the sake of consistency you were asked to follow your own rule , you 'd have to concede that we have no evidence tree growth , or mountain formation - after all , I 've never actually seen a seed grow into a tree , I 've only seen it in stages .
Student : " But professor !
You stated that science is the study of observed phenomena .
Professor : No , this is a strawman of what science is ...
Science is more than just real time observation , we also observe artifacts and make inferences .
But continue ....
Student : ( Responds to this as a goat might respond to a book on calculus ) May I give you an example of what I mean ? "
Professor : Certainly .
Student : " Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen air , oxygen , molecules , atoms , the professor 's brain ? "
The class breaks out in laughter .
The christian points towards professor , " Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor 's brain ... felt the professor 's brain , touched or smelt the professor 's brain ? "
" No one appears to have done so " , The christian shakes his head sadly .
" It appears no one here has had any sensory perception of the professor 's brain whatsoever .
Well , according to the rules of empirical , stable , demonstrable protocol , science , I declare that the professor has no brain ! "
( So much for the student 's pretense of respect , clearly his goal is to ridicule ) .
Professor :
You mean , according to your strawman view of science .
I am glad that you are here in my class so that I can help you better understand what you criticize .
Science is not merely ' looking ' at things .
Science is empirical , but also rational .
We can make inferences from evidence of things that we do see , back to phenonema that we might not be able to directly see .
Such as a functioning brain .
And one inference I can make from observing your behaviors here today is that you 've wasted the money you 've spent on your logic textbook so far this year .
I strongly advise , for your own sake , that you crack open that book today , and start reading .
From page 1 .
Whether you 're a consultant , contractor , hobbiest or student , if you 're a programmer ( or designer , or author , or ... ) then you have projects .
If you 're a programmer with a website , then you 've probably spent a few hours recreating boilerplate code for niftily displaying and organizing your projects .
But no more .
Kevin Fricovsky and I both had been thinking about a better way to display our personal projects , and that has begun to take form in django - portfolio .
It is a pluggable and reusable app for displaying , grouping and organizing personal projects , and over the past several weeks it has begun to gain substance ( Kevin 's GitHub repository is the official repo , but for the time being my fork is a bit further along ) .
The first functional example -- as well as a few screenshots -- is right here , powering my projects section ( and you can even see my project page for django - portfolio displayed using django - portfolio ) .
Features
Group projects by categories ( one to many ) .
Assign tags to projects ( many to many ) .
View list of projects grouped by either category or tag .
Assign 0 + files and images per project .
Example project using jQuery to click through all images ( example here ) .
Optional pull quotes ( example here ) .
Simple , resuable , still malleable for your input and changes .
Future Ideas
Integration with repositories .
Build zip / tar of repository on demand .
Pull the project 's README and render it for project detail page .
Management command to resize all images .
( I 'm just using an automator script for this currently ... not great but workable . )
Let Kevin or I know any ideas you have , or just fork the repository .
Happy New Year 2009

Alexei Cherepanov Died During Russian Hockey Game ( Photos )
Alexei Cherepanov 1989-2008
, 19 , was a former first - round draft pick for the New York Rangers in 2007 .
The talented young man died on Monday night in Russia while playing a hockey game with team Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League .
The Russian was drafted 17th overall by the Rangers in 2007 but was playing for the Avangard Omsk at the time of his death .
According to Russian reports , Cherepanov collapsed during a KHL game against team Chekhov Vityaz following an accidental collision with teammate Jaromir Jagr while making a line change in the third period .
He made it to the bench before collapsing and was rushed to an intensive care unit .
The ambulance that is normally at all games had already departed and had to be called back , taking approximately 15 - 20 minutes to get him to a hospital .
He died from commotio cordis , a sudden disturbance of heart rhythm .
It occurs as a result of a blunt , non-penetrating blow to the chest region - a very rare event that requires immediate defibrillation and cardioactive drugs .
The Russian right winger , nicknamed the Siberian Express , was in his second season with Avangard .
Cherepanov surpassed the Russian league rookie goal scoring record by March of 2007 .
Cherepanov had one year remaining on his contract with Omsk before he would have been able to play for the NHL .
On October 3 , 2008 Alexei tied the Avangard Omsk goal scoring streak record with goals in 6 consecutive games .
Glen Sather , New York Rangers President and General Manager gave this statement : " We are extremely saddened by the tragic passing of Alexei .
On behalf of the New York Rangers organization , I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his family .
Alexei was an intelligent , energetic young man , with tremendous talent and an extremely bright future . "

Obama to Bush : I Can Release Your Records .
Do n't Like It ? Sue .
On his first day in office , President Obama put former president Bush on notice .
His administration just released an executive order that will make it difficult for Bush to shield his White House records -- and those of former Vice President Dick Cheney - - from public scrutiny by invoking the doctrine of executive privilege .
... " [ Obama ] 's putting former presidents on notice that if you want to continue a claim of executive privilege that [ Obama ] does n't think is well - placed , you 're going to have to go to court , " says Anne Weismann , the chief counsel for Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington ( CREW ) .
This order ends the practice of having others besides the President assert executive privilege for records after an administration ends .
Now , only the President will have that power , limiting its potential for abuse .
And the order also requires the Attorney General and the White House Counsel to review claims of executive privilege about covered records to make sure those claims are fully warranted by the Constitution .
Obama 's executive order not only revokes " Bush 's infamous Executive Order 13233 , which gave current and former presidents and vice presidents , along with their heirs , unprecedented authority to block the disclosure of White House records , " but also redefines executive privilege with a much more rigorous standard :
Effectively , that gives Obama the right to tell Bush to shove it if the new administration does n't agree with the Bush administration 's assessment that something should be protected by executive privilege , leaving the erstwhile White House crooks with the singular option of suing to prevent the release of the archives .
Heh .
Nowis some change I can believe in .
[ H/ T to Shaker Vicster . ]
I wanted so much for so many years to believe in what I mistakenly thought was “ right ” about our system of government .
I tried most of my adult life to work within the system , giving my time and efforts to Libertarian and other pro-freedom causes , even the Libertarian Party for a time .
My efforts were wasted and the supposed “ Party of Principle ” in 2008 , both ran a racist warmonger for office in Kentucky and even had the nerve to nominate a vile statist lout for president .
The boorish fool had mouthed the words , mumbled the empty platitudes , and ended up making freedom loving people that supported his presidential bid , look like total schmucks .
I once mistakenly believed anarchists to be likened to hermits at best , living their lives in caves or other dwellings “ off the grid ” , totally withdrawn from society .
My public “ education ” had purposely made me to be thoroughly ignorant of the actual truth that people cooperate for their mutual benefit in all matters .
All they require is non-interference from Big Brother and the desire to better their lives .
I was blind to the great abilities of the anarco - capitalist to create , absent the heavy hand of the state , the goods and services that we all enjoy and need .
The fine teachings of Browne , Rand , Rockwell , Von Mises , and numerous others brought me up to speed .
My blindness led me also to once believe that the U.S. Constitution and those sworn to uphold it , would protect my life , my property , and my rights .
The constitution was set aside when it became inconvenient to those who enjoy power over others , and outright ignored when those openly hostile to freedom and liberty could not otherwise deliver their ills upon the masses .
The police , bureaucrats , political hacks , and a host of other statist jerks had literally abdicated their duty .
Yes , I have many reasons for giving up on the state as anything other than a needless hindrance upon my life .
I have only to read a newspaper , view a favorite website or listen to freetalklive .com to have more reasons to add to my long list of transgressions against my fellow human beings that they have committed .
I do not need nor will ever grow to love government as an alternative to the free society .

After calling Monday night ’s RNC opening ceremonies on account of shame , it was obvious that John McCain was about to drop off the Bush - Cheney team at the next intersection with an open sewer grate .
Last night , in accepting the Republican nomination for president , McCain jettisoned , by calling for the end to “ partisan rancor . ”
That means everyone .
After all , if McCain can be big enough to look past recent American political ugliness , he canexpect nothing less of his political opponents .
After all , the Hapless Warrior is n’t really a Republican , he ’s just a patriot .
But not just any patriot .
McCain does n’t just love his country , last night he proclaimed he ’s in love with the USA .
Psychosexual overtones be damned , this leader is n’t afraid to express his attraction to majestic purple mountains and fruited plains .
If you do n’t like it , you ’re just part of that tax - loving America - comes - second crowd .
So get with it , the old man says “ no rancor ! ” and he means it .
It would be downright unpatriotic to mull over the failed policies and unmitigated sleaze that have accelerated the decline of the land John McCain loves more than anyone who would n’t vote for him .
He walked the walker last night .
He owned up to slight Republican difficulties in between his live reading of his autobiography that filled in those blank spots left after three days of RNC bio vids of McCain .
He told us that some Republicans had succumbed to corruption but promised “ change is coming . ”
Well that ’s a relief !
How , you might ask , will McCain facilitate this change ?
By extending his hand to former enemies .
He has already proven that he can do this .
Why else would so many Bush insiders ( who hatcheted him in the 2000 R primaries ) either be working for him or pipelining strategy to him ?
Karl Rove , Ken Mehlman , and ad and media strategists Mark McKinnon , Russ Schriefer , Stuart Stevens and Fred Davis have all greased up McCain ’s campaign with their fingerprints .
And let ’s not forget Bush ’s 2004 attack dog , Steve Schmidt , who is now chained to the front seat of the Straight Talk Express .
Talk about forgiving and forgetting !
This McCain is a saint and a patriot !
This means the hucksters , who crammed George W. Bush down our throats as a compassionate conservative whose foreign policy would be humble and who would never engage in nation building , are back .
This time they ’re telling us that their candidate is the miracle cure for the ethical , fiscal and spiritual plague they visited upon us in the evil - as - he - is - incompetent George W. Bush and his soulless ghoul of a vice - president , Dick Cheney .
So the question is rather simple , America — are we really going to let these fuckers piss in our faces again ?
Are we really going to let them sell us this Keating Five alum as a reformer , this impatient hothead as a warm credit - sharer , this ultra - hawk as the only viable hope for peace ?
Maybe .
This is after all America , where anything can happen .
After Sarah Palin ’s high octane yet empty - caloried speech Wednesday , it ’s likely a large audience tuned in last night to see what all the excitement was about .
By that point , the excitement was about 24 hours ago and not soon to return .
Thursday ’s RNC offered a night of endless drivel from several Gluttonous Old Party luminaries , including :
Former Fatherland Security Commandante Tom Rigid , who actually uttered the phrase “ over 230 plus years ago . ”
He was bound to appear sometime around when the GOP reeled out their favorite nostalgic propaganda tool : 9/11 highlights .
Sen . Linseed Graham , McCain ’s buttboy de camp , declared victory is on the way in Iraq , just as the R ’s crack AV team projected a shot of a very large military cemetery behind him .
Nice touch !
Former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs provided a treat for the evangelicals by babbling in tongues .
And Cindy McCain , who believes in throwing an occasional pearl into the poor box , provided the easiest of acts for her hubby to follow .
After one more video salute to remind us that he served in the military , McCain came out and gave the speech that would not end .
Ever .
I guess he figured that since he was incapable of delivering a barn burner , he would instead mention every piece of straw in the hayloft .
Things grew pretty hazy for the next couple of hours but when McCain began to speak reluctantly of his POW past , for the 1800th time since January , you knew that he was close to wrapping this thing up so he could get back to his family and a good , home - cooked American meal .
It was n’t too long before he was yammering “ Stand up , stand up , stand up , and fight ! ”
This caused several members of the Texas delegation to nearly kill one another , but mostly instigated a large uproar of appreciative clapping , hooting and howling .
Then McCain , the guy who is supposed be ready for anything , did n’t notice that the crowd interrupted him and so he plodded ahead with his Rockne rhetoric even though his frail voice was all but drowned out by the roused reactionary rabble .
He kept reading the script during an inaudibly clumsy crescendo to his boilerplate special of a speech .
McCain ’s Bambi-meets - the - teleprompter routine provided a silly counterpoint to his jingoistic surety .
I have n’t witnessed such a moment in American politics since GHW Bush ’s final campaign rally in Houston in 1992 when someone mistakenly cued the marching band that then broke into Twist & Shout , which was what Poppy was forced to do during the last few lines of his swan song .
The night was as genuine as the fake “ home - made ” signs that pockmarked the convention .
( OK , either they were fake or every Republican just happened to buy the same watercolor markers that they then used to create remarkably uniform printing and messages . )
The proceedings wound down with one last forced march of the spouses and kids onto a stage that was quickly becoming a de facto set for the Family Feud .
Survey says : Hopelessly contrived !
Balloons and confetti dropped .
Music of incomparable dildocity blared and then it was over .
Sarah Palin was rushed off to isolation lest anyone ask her anything improper about her background , qualifications or knowledge of the world she wants to rule .
McCain , up well past his bedtime , headed off for some much needed rest so that he can resume his deranged social studies teacher act today .
And we are left to fret over whether or not this duo , with the help of the con artists who brought us George W. Bush , have in fact proven that we will get fooled again

Antique Plutonium
Manhattan Project - era plutonium is found in a glass jug during Hanford Site cleanup
One of the oldest known samples of plutonium has been dug up from a waste trench in Hanford , Wash . , near the now - decommissioned nuclear production site along the Columbia River .
During the process of figuring out the plutonium 's origin and history , a new technique emerged that may help nuclear scientists identify the age and source of trafficked nuclear material .
The sample hails from one of the first attempts to produce weapons - grade plutonium during the Manhattan Project era , says Jon M. Schwantes , a nuclear chemist at the nearby Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .
Cleanup workers found the half - gram sample of weapons - grade plutonium - 239 in a glass jug located in a rusty safe dug up during the Hanford site 's environmental rehabilitation .
The workers handed over the sample to Schwantes and his team of researchers , who then used ratios of nuclear isotopes to date the plutonium to approximately 1944 , plus or minus a few years ( Anal .
Chem. , DOI : 10.1021/ac802286a ) .
Anal .
Chem ANTIQUE CACHE
An early sample of plutonium was found in a jug inside a safe during a cleanup at the Hanford site .
The oldest sample of purified plutonium is housed at the Smithsonian Institution , in Washington , D.C.
It was made in the early 1940s by Glenn Seaborg and Art Wahl at the University of California , Berkeley .
To make weapons - grade plutonium , nuclear scientists convert uranium to Pu-239 in a nuclear reactor , using a " slow burn " process that prevents too much accumulation of unusable isotopes of plutonium .
Then they chemically separate the Pu-239 from the rest of the nuclear waste .
Techniques for extracting Pu-239 have evolved over the years , but one of the first strategies involved lanthanum fluoride , which was also found in the jug along with the plutonium .
" That was one of the first clues that we were dealing with really old plutonium , " Schwantes says , because the use of lanthanum fluoride was discontinued by the 1950s .
Because every nuclear reactor creates a fingerprint ratio of nuclear isotopes , Schwantes can pinpoint the plutonium 's production to a nuclear reactor in Oak Ridge , Tenn .
He says the plutonium sample was transported to Hanford , destined for experiments to optimize the separation of weapons - grade plutonium before the Hanford reactor 's plutonium production was up to speed .
This means that the plutonium sample originates from before the first nuclear weapons test and before Fat Man , the plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki , Schwantes notes .
After spelunking through historical documents , Schwantes and his team believe the jug was stored in the safe at Hanford , but after a radioactivity leak , both jug and safe were thrown into the waste trench , only to be discovered 60 years later .
This is " a solid piece of nuclear archaeology , " says Maria Wallenius , who works in nuclear forensics at the European Commission 's Institute for Transuranium Elements , in Karlsruhe , Germany .
During the study of the lanthanum fluoride found in the jug with the Pu-239 , Schwantes and coworkers developed a new and " ingenious " way of dating radioactive sodium produced from radioactive fluoride to provide historical information about the sample , Wallenius says .
She notes that this new technique could be useful in forensic investigations to identify the source and age of trafficked nuclear material .
CLEARWATER , Florida ( Reuters ) - Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin told Florida ’s voters on Monday to expect “ rough ” campaigning as she seeks to halt a slide in opinion polls in a state that could make or break Sen.
John McCain ’s White House bid .
Strategists say the Alaska governor must rally Republican loyalists into a get - out - the - vote offensive in a two - day swing over more than 800 miles in the state that George W. Bush won in 2000 and 2004 but where Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has taken the lead .
“ There is a feeling now that we are beginning to see among Republicans that McCain ca n’t win , ” said David Johnson , a Republican strategist and pollster who worked on Bob Dole ’s 1988 presidential campaign .
“ A lot of the base is dissatisfied with Sen. McCain , ” he said of party activists who helped Bush win in 2000 and 2004 .
Winning Florida ’s 27 electoral votes is vital to McCain ’s chances of capturing the 270 needed to win the November 4 presidential election .
With the pressure on , Palin is targeting Obama ’s judgment and character in speeches that include the unsubstantiated charge that the Illinois senator has close ties to Bill Ayers , a former member of the 1960s - era militant Weather Underground
The group was involved in bombings in the 1960s , when Obama was 8 years old .
Obama met him in the 1990s when first starting his political career in Chicago and the two served on a board together .
Obama has said he knows Ayers only slightly and has denounced his actions with the Weather Underground .
“ I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America , ” Palin said of Obama at a rally of 5,000 supporters in Florida ’s heavily Republican city of Clearwater .
Critics say that line is especially pointed because of its potential subtext .
Obama would be the first black president and his background , including part of a childhood spent in Indonesia , is different from that of most Americans .

Palin seemed to acknowledge that the race was entering a new , harsher phase .
“ You are going to have to hang onto your hats because from now until election day it may get kind of rough , ” the 44 - year - old self - described “ hockey mom ” said .
Jamie Miller , a former regional political director of the state ’s Republican Party , said Florida is a “ must - win ” state for McCain .
“ Florida represents such as diverse population that when Florida starts going down , you start losing some of these other swing states , and then the path gets really hard . ”
‘ MAKE ME WANT TO CRY ’
Palin was feted like a rock star by the crowd of Republican loyalists , many of whom wore the red , white and blue colors of the American flag and held placards reading “ Palin Power , ” “ Go Sarah ” and “ Florida 4 Sarah . ”
“ Man , some of your signs just make me want to cry .
Thank you so much , ” Palin said .
Jacqueline Brown , a Democrat and evangelical Christian who said she was in her 50s , likened Palin ’s rally to watching rock ’n ’roll legend Elvis Presley .
“ I saw Elvis and I thought I was going to die .
Sarah is next to seeing Elvis , ” she said .
But doubts lingered for 55 - year - old Allie McDonnell .
“ She should say more about why McCain has lobbyists on his campaign .
And I ’m also afraid that he ’ll keep the war going .
A lot of our boys and brothers have died . ”
Four new polls last week gave Obama , who had trailed in Florida for weeks , an edge in the Sunshine State .
The change in part reflects growing concern over the deepening economic crisis , which plays to Obama ’s perceived strengths and has seen him gain in national opinion polls .
Palin plans to visit many of the same areas where Bush in 2004 solidified his support , such as north and southwest Florida .
In addition to Clearwater , she held a rally in Fort Myers on Monday .
On Tuesday , she heads to Jacksonville and then cuts across the northwestern Panhandle for an event in Pensacola .
“ The Palin visit is an indicator of where McCain needs to do well .
He needs to do well in the Tampa Bay region .
He needs to do well in the Panhandle region and he needs to do well in southwest Florida , ” said Miller .
“ And he needs to try and limit losses probably from the Orlando area down to Miami , ” he added .
( Moscow , December 2 , 2008 ) -
The health of a former Guantanamo detainee has declined alarmingly in a Russian detention facility , and he should be given immediate access to an independent medical examination and appropriate treatment , Human Rights Watch said today .
The former Guantanamo detainee , Rasul Kudaev , has been held for more than three years in pretrial detention in Nalchik , a city in southern Russia , accused of participating in an October 2005 armed uprising against the local government .
He was severely tortured in custody .
Human Rights
Watch urged that Kudaev 's lawyer be present during any medical examination .
" Rasul Kudaev has not been convicted of any crime , but prison authorities are putting his life at risk by letting his health collapse , " said Carroll Bogert , associate director of Human Rights Watch .
" The Russian government must get him decent medical treatment immediately . "
Kudaev is one of seven Russian citizens whom the US government sent back from Guantanamo to Russia in 2004 despite their fears of being tortured and ill - treated back home .
Human Rights
Watch detailed their harassment and mistreatment by Russian authorities in a 2007 report " The Stamp of Guantanamo " .
It is a violation of the Convention against Torture , as well as other US and international laws , to involuntarily return people to a country where they are in danger of being tortured .
The Nalchik uprising reportedly resulted in more than 140 deaths , including 35 law enforcement officers , 15 bystanders , and at least 92 of those involved .
According to photographs , medical records , court documents , and the testimony of lawyers and family members , Kudaev was repeatedly beaten in custody in an effort to compel him to confess to involvement in the uprising .
Kudaev began to suffer liver problems while in detention at Guantanamo Bay and was receiving outpatient treatment for liver disease in October 2005 when the Nalchik uprising occurred .
His mother told Human Rights
Watch that although she brought him medication , he has not regularly received it .
In May , Kudaev 's condition worsened and his lawyer petitioned for a medical exam and treatment .
Prison authorities issued medical conclusions stating that Kudaev was healthy , but began treating Kudaev without informing his lawyer .
The treatment stopped at the end of June .
Kudaev 's condition has deteriorated markedly over the last several weeks .
Kudaev 's mother and his lawyer told Human Rights Watch that Kudaev is currently suffering liver failure exacerbated by poor conditions , including inedible food , in detention .
The skin on the right side of his back has hardened , the whites of his eyes are deep yellow , and he has trouble walking due to pain .
In mid-November , Kudaev and his lawyer requested a medical examination .
Prison authorities agreed to the exam but refused to allow it to be conducted by an independent doctor .
They pledged to release all the medical records and photos taken during the medical examination , yet they barred Kudaev 's lawyer from being present at his client 's medical exam .
The exam has not yet been scheduled .
One of the defendants in the Nalchik case , Valeri Bolov , died in February 2008 of cirrhosis of the liver , which was never treated in prison .
He was released to his relatives from pretrial detention when he was already dying .
The detention facility authorities should immediately improve detention conditions for Kudaev , ensuring that he receives urgent medical assistance and has unrestricted access to legal counsel , Human Rights Watch said .
" Kudaev 's case shows how vulnerable former detainees from Guantanamo are to abusive treatment back home , " said Bogert .
" As US President - elect Barack Obama considers how to close Guantanamo Bay , the experience of people like Rasul Kudaev should be taken into account - and never repeated . "
The U.S. Army is deploying the same kind of " math and missiles " unit that defeated roadside bombs in Iraq , to Afghanistan .
For the last two years , " Task Force Odin " has used of manned and UAV aerial reconnaissance aircraft , along with pattern analysis and data mining , to find IEDs ( roadside bombs ) , and the people who plant them in Iraq .
Task Force Odin was reported in the media mainly as aircraft and UAVs watching the roads for signs of IEDs , and UAVs , while helicopters and gunships opened fire on terrorists trying to set up roadside bombs .
Explosions and dead bodies are more of mass media staple than massive use of math , no matter how critical the number crunching was to the undertaking .
Task Force Odin is really about two very different technologies .
On the one hand there was the effort to provide Internet like access to live video feeds from aircraft and UAVs .
The U.S. Air Force and SOCOM ( Special Operations Command ) have been particularly keen on this , and has shared the technology with the other services , and friendly nations .
The less publicized effort was Constant Hawk .
This was a U.S. Army image analysis system that 's basically just another pattern analysis system .
However , it 's been a very successful system when it comes to finding newly planted IEDs .
Last year , the U.S. Army named Constant Hawk one of the top ten inventions of the year .
The army does this to give some of the more obscure , yet very valuable , developments some well deserved recognition .
Pattern analysis is one of the fundamental tools Operations Research ( OR ) practitioners have been using since World War II ( when the newly developed field of OR got its first big workout ) .
Pattern analysis is widely used on Wall Street , by engineers , law enforcement , marketing specialists , and now , the military .
Constant Hawk uses a special video camera system to observe a locality and find useful patterns of behavior .
Some of the Constant Hawk systems are mounted on light ( C - 12s , mainly ) aircraft , others are mounted on ground structures .
Special software compares photos from different times .
When changes are noted , they are checked more closely , which has resulted in the early detection of thousands of roadside bombs and terrorist ambushes .
This has largely eliminated roadside bomb attacks on supply convoys , which travel the same routes all the time .
But those routes are also watched by Constant Hawk .
No matter what the enemy does , the Hawk will notice .
Eventually , the Hawk , and several other efforts , morphed into Task Force Odin .
The Task Force Odin led to the death of over 3,000 terrorists caught in the act of setting up roadside bombs , or lying in wait to set them off and attack their victims with gunfire .
Hundreds more terrorists were captured , and many thousands of roadside bombs were avoided or destroyed before they could go off .
All this geeekery works , and the troops like tools of this sort mainly because the systems retain photos of areas they have patrolled , and allows them to retrieve photos of a particular place on a particular day .
Often , the troops returning from , or going out on a patrol , can use the pattern analysis skills we all have , to spot something suspicious , or potentially so .
A related math tool is predictive analysis .
This has been widely used in Iraq to determine who the bombers are , where they are , and where they are most likely to place their bombs next .
This has enabled the geeks - with - guns ( the Army OR specialists ) to offer regular " weather reports " about expected IED activity .
The troops take these reports very seriously , especially by those who run the hundreds of daily convoys that move people and supplies around Iraq .
If your route is predicted to be " hot " , you pay extra attention that day , and often spot IEDs that , as predicted , were there .
Usually , the predictions are used to send the engineers and EOD ( Explosive Ordnance Disposal ) teams out to scout and clean the route .
It 's the feedback from these guys that has brought the geeks their reputation .
If the geeks , and their tools ( computers , aerial images , and math ) , say there is something bad out there , they are generally right .
For the geeks , it 's all pretty obvious .
Given enough data , you can predict all sorts of things , or just about anything , really .
But to many people , including most reporters , it 's all still magic .
Task Force
Odin is the latest name for an effort that has been going on for over four years , and traces its origins back to World War II , and the invention of Operations Research in the decade before that .
Afghanistan is different from Iraq , in terms of geography and the psychology of the enemy .
But this does n't matter to the math machine .
It analyzes , it understands , and it tells you what the bad guys are up to and where they are .
I finally had the chance to play the demo for LucasArts ' newest game Fracture , and after The Force Unleashed , I was in the mood to be pleasantly surprised .
Luckily , the demo delivers .
It lets you play with many guns very quickly , the controls are tight , and the gameplay gimmicks are fun .
You get a sand box , and then you get to fight some dudes , and then the demo is over .
I wish more demos were like this : show me what you got , and do n't overstay your welcome !
The problem is that the gameplay gimmick — deforming the land up and down with your main weapon and your grenades — does n't seem like it can support an entire game .
Its also obvious , at least in the demo , exactly when you need to use it ; hopefully the main game does n't beat you over the head with things quite so much .
Still , it 's great to sink the land under your enemies and then attack from an elevated position .
The weapon and land - distortion effects are all great , especially the gun that sends a round under ground , and explodes when you tell it to , sending things above flying in every direction .
Your weapons turn the world into putty , and it 's fun to see just how far you can send something into the air with a few well - placed explosions .
If anything , I can see this game being an absolute blast in multiplayer , but the single - player game could very easily become tiresome if they do n't have strong level design ; much of Fracture seems like a better concept than mechanics solid enough to build an entire $ 60 release around .
File this one under cautious optimism .

US President - elect Barack Obama is still working on the make - up of his cabinet .
A far more important decision - for his daughters at least - will be choosing the puppy that accompanies the new First Family to the White House .
Mr Obama made the promise of a new pet to Malia , 10 and Sasha , seven , in an election victory speech broadcast to millions around the world , suggesting it is one campaign pledge that will be kept .
" I love you both so much , and you have earned the new puppy that 's coming with us to the White House , " he told his daughters .
Now what everyone wants to know is , what kind of pooch will be the next to join a long and illustrious line of White House pets ?
Asked that question in his first news conference since being elected , Mr Obama said there were two priorities : to have a " hypoallergenic " breed that sheds less hair , because daughter Malia has allergies , and to have a rescue dog .
The problem , he said , was that lots of rescue dogs are " mutts like me " - a reference to his mixed ethnic background - rather than specific breeds .
" Whether we 're going to be able to balance those two things , I think , is a pressing issue on the Obama household , " he said .
Hypoallergenic options could include a labradoodle - a cross between a Labrador and a poodle - a schnoodle ( schnauzer and poodle ) , or a cockapoo ( cocker spaniel and poodle ) .
He is white with some golden highlights , as if he went to the hairdresser , a really happy smile , sweet but not hyper - I think he is going to make a perfect First Dog
Tamar Geller
Celebrity dog trainer Malia , however , is rumoured to favour a goldendoodle - a poodle crossed with a golden retriever .
In an American Kennel Club survey of 42,000 people this summer , a pedigree poodle came out as the top choice for a new First Dog.
But Tamar Geller , a California - based celebrity dog " life coach " who trained Oprah Winfrey 's puppies , says she is confident the Obamas will take a rescue dog .
She says staff at her shelter programme , Another Chance For Love , are already in talks with people in the Obama camp about a goldendoodle that needs a home .
" He is a gorgeous dog , " she told the BBC News website .
" He is white with some golden highlights , as if he went to the hairdresser , a really happy smile , sweet but not hyper .
" I think he is going to make a perfect First Dog but we will see - the family has to make the decision . "
The priority , she says , is that the pet the Obamas pick is comfortable with children and impeccably behaved at all times , particularly with visitors .
" Can you imagine the dog jumping on Putin , or lifting his leg and peeing on the curtains , or nipping at Gordon Brown ? " she says .
" We do n't want that to happen , so the dog has to be very well mannered .
" We need to make sure that the dog is not afraid of loud noises because he may hear loud arguments in the Oval Office , and he must n't be afraid of people with beards and turbans and so on because he is going to meet a lot of foreign dignitaries . "
Leigh Siegfried , of the Opportunity Barks dog training school , based just outside the capital , agrees that sociability is a must .
The reporter bitten on the finger by George W Bush 's dog Barney this week would probably agree .
Film star
Whether pedigree or mutt , the new First Puppy will have to take over certain duties from Barney and his companion Miss Beazley , both Scottish terriers .

They are regularly photographed travelling with the Bush family , playing on the White House lawn and meeting and greeting visitors - including royalty .
Barney has his own website and the hairy pair have also starred in the annual White House Christmas video .
Last year 's included a cameo by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , at one time mocked as " Bush 's poodle " .
If times get tough for Mr Obama on the political front , the First Puppy might also bear in mind the quote attributed to President Harry S Truman : " If you want a friend in Washington , get a dog . "
Bill Clinton 's chocolate Labrador , Buddy , probably lived up to his name when he joined the household in 1997 at the height of the Monica Lewinsky affair .
And Mr Clinton once told reporters that the dog would curl up and sleep with him when wife Hillary was away .
Buddy may have lived up to his name when Bill Clinton was in the doghouse Some previous presidential pets have been more exotic .
Herbert Hoover ( or his son , at least ) owned two alligators that were sometimes allowed to roam round the White House .
George Washington was devoted to his war horse , called Nelson , and Martin Van Buren had two tiger cubs .
According to the White House website , Thomas Jefferson kept a mockingbird , Calvin Coolidge had a pet raccoon called Rebecca and Benjamin Harrison owned a goat called His Whiskers that pulled his grandchildren round the White House lawn in a cart .
The sons of Theodore Roosevelt took their pony up in a White House lift to visit their sick brother in bed and Caroline Kennedy also had a pony , called Macaroni , that she rode across the grounds .
In fact , only a handful of US presidents so far have not had a pet .
Maverick or Lipstick ?
Once the Obamas have chosen their puppy , the next challenge for the 44th First Family will be picking a suitable name .
Ronald and Nancy Reagan named their dogs Lucky and Rex Some internet First Pet - watchers are already bandying about such monikers as Lipstick or Palin , if it is a pit bull terrier , or perhaps Maverick if the Obamas opt for an older rescue dog .
Recent presidents have tended to go for straightforward dog names .
Lyndon Johnson called his beagles Him and Her , Jimmy Carter 's pooch was called Grits and Ronald Reagan named his dogs Lucky and Rex .
George W Bush 's springer spaniel - born in the White House while his father had the top job - was dubbed Spot .
Mr Clinton said he had named Buddy after his great - uncle Henry Oren " Buddy " Grisham , who had died earlier that year .
In the end , whatever name the Obamas plump for , Ms Geller says , she just wants to see a crossbreed rather than a commercially - bred pedigree pup as top dog .
" It would be really great to get a goldendoodle in the White House .
It would be another first . "

Ok , not really , but it 's cool to see some of my old sketches take on a life of their own .
This one sort of got some attention earlier this year , and now it 's come around and made the rounds and wound up getting a mention on one of the few blogs I actually read ( Phil Plait 's Bad Astronomy site ) .
I are amused . :D
ETA : It looks like PZ Myers has decided he likes my illustration too !
Very cool !
Now I 'm curious what other odd places this has shown up ...

An experimental drug that mimics the effects of the hormone melatonin can reset the body ’s circadian rhythms , bringing relief to jet - lagged travelers and night - shift workers , researchers reported Monday .
In a study of 450 people who were subjected to simulated jet lag in a sleep laboratory , a team from Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston found that the drug restored near normal sleep the first night it was used .
There were no aftereffects from the drug , minimal side effects , and people who took it performed normally the next day , said Dr. Elizabeth B. Klerman , one of the co-authors of the study published online in the journal Lancet .
And unlike conventional sleeping aids such as Ambien or Lunesta , she added , the new drug , called tasimelteon , has no potential for addiction or abuse .

The main limitations of the study were the relatively small size and the researchers ’ inability to measure performance and mood after the drug was used , experts said .
The study was designed and funded by Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Rockville , Md. , which developed tasimelteon , and all of the researchers reported receiving funds from Vanda or other pharmaceutical companies .
“ This is a very promising first step , ” said Dr. Jay Udani , who runs the integrative medicine program at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and who was not involved in the study .
But the research “ does not prove that it works for jet lag or shift workers , ” he added .
“ That needs controlled studies in the field . ”
The body ’s sleep - wake cycle is controlled by melatonin , which is produced by the pineal gland in response to patterns of light and darkness .
Higher concentrations of melatonin in the blood are associated with greater sleepiness .

Some research has shown that administering melatonin can adjust sleep cycles in travelers and workers , but the results have been mixed .
Because melatonin can’t be patented , drug companies have been interested in developing melatonin mimics , such as tasimelteon , which can be patented .
In the first part of the study , 39 patients ’ normal sleep habits were monitored for three nights in the laboratory before they were sent to bed five hours early .
They were then given one of four different doses of tasimelteon or a placebo 30 minutes before bedtime .

Researchers monitored their sleep efficiency -- the percentage of time in bed they actually slept -- and the amount of time required for them to fall asleep .
Although all the subjects benefited from the drug , those receiving the highest dose had a sleep efficiency of 89 % the first night , virtually the same as the 90 % efficiency before the trail started .
Those receiving a placebo had an efficiency of 71 % .
Patients taking the highest doses slept for an average of about 428 minutes , compared with 430 minutes before the trial and 324 minutes for those taking a placebo .
It took an average of seven minutes for them to go to sleep , compared with 11 minutes before the trial and 22 minutes for those receiving a placebo .
Blood analysis showed that the melatonin cycle of those receiving the drug was altered to match the new conditions .

“ They would be expected to sleep better because their internal clock is on the right time , ” Klerman said .

Ok , so i am still kind of giddy from how awesome it was to meet Shepard Fairey and his studio pretty much blew my mind .
To see what type of space other creatives work in is one thing … but to feel like you walked into a gallery filled with history and inspiration and visual food for thought in every detail , well that just floored me .
I really need a larger space to spread out and fill the walls ~ how can you NOT be creative surrounded with all of that ?
For now , i share my wall of inspiration with you as NOTCOT.org , my portable digital version … you will enjoy exploring Shepard Fairey ’s studio through the pics on the next page , and since there is so much in the details , i left the high res version for you to click through to .
And for the record , he was one of the kindest , humblest , down to earth folks i’ve met in a while .
It was great to see that he still has so much passion for what he does , and gets down right giddy when talking about his new projects ( and politics ) .
Also above is a new print that he is releasing on Thursday at noon , Duality of Humanity 3 - if you want one , these things disappear within minutes .
BOSTON , Nov. 18 ( UPI ) --
Nearly half of all U.S. primary care physicians want to stop practicing or reduce their patient loads , a survey of primary care physicians indicates .
The survey of 11,950 primary care physicians by the Physicians ' Foundation found 78 percent of primary care physicians say they believe there is an existing shortage of primary care doctors in the United States .

Forty - nine percent -- of the more than 150,000 practicing doctors -- say during the next three years they plan to reduce the number of patients they see or stop practicing entirely .
The reported reasons for the widespread frustration among doctors include : increased time spent dealing with non-clinical paperwork , difficulty receiving reimbursement from insurance companies and burdensome government regulations .
" Tens of thousands of primary care doctors face the same problems as millions of ordinary citizens : frustrations in dealing with HMOs and government red tape , " Sandra Johnson , board member of the Physicians ' Foundation , said in a statement .
" The thing we heard over and over again from the physicians was that they 're unhappy they can't spend more time with their patients , which is why they went into primary care in the first place . "
The survey , by Merritt , Hawkins & Associates , has a margin of error of 1 percentage point .

A toy box that lets you poke it from the inside is the perfect holiday gift for your loved one .
This is especially the case if your work takes you away on long periods of travel .
Bandai's Tuttiki Bako ( literally , ' the poking box ' ) features a type of touch interface where you can ' tease and harass the digital characters ' on - screen with your own finger .
According to the manufacturer , the box gives off a realistic sensation each time you touch a character , and you can see your own finger in the shadow - hand - style display .
Apparently , this wonderful sounding feat is accomplished through motion sensors embedded inside the box .
We do n't know if the screen will replicate other things that may be placed inside , like , say , a pencil or a q-tip .
This technology is visually reminiscent ( but far from the same ) as that of Microsoft 's LucidTouch , which allows you to manipulate the front and back of touchscreen devices .
That one also produces transparent finger shadows to touch things on - screen , but instead , uses a camera to read movement .
Among the various things you can poke in the Poking Box toy are a panda , a face , and a tiny stick - like device .
It also works as a bed clock , so you can always have it right next you in case you need to check the time in the middle of the night .
The Poking Box is available in Japan , for about $ 30 , and should be a great gift for all .
Bush asks GOP not to ' sell its soul ' in order to save itself David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday January 11 , 2009
Print This Email This As President Bush prepares to leave office , he had some words of caution for the Republican Party .
The outgoing president said his party should not " sell its soul " on key issues like a strong military and low taxes in order to save itself from a perceived doom .
" Parties go through cycles , " Bush said .
" There have been times in our history when the Democrats felt like there was no future for them .
I 'm optimistic about it . "
He added that the GOP needs new leaders and that Republicans should be " open- minded " as they struggle to remake the party .
" It 's very important for our party not to narrow its focus , not to become so inward looking that we drive people away from a philosophy that is compassionate and decent , " Bush said .
" There should n't be a litmus test as to whether or not you should be a Republican . "
But even some top GOP strategists believe the party must sell new ideas to begin a revival of its former influence .
Haley Barbour , a political - turnaround artist who masterminded the 1994 Republican revolution , said there may be a temptation after a major loss to " purify our party , " but that the real focus should be on " figuring out how to multiply . "
As with any rehab process , the first step for a Republican comeback , Barbour said , is to " come clean and admit we did a lot of things wrong . "
" Now is our chance when we 're out of power to build back up from the bottom , to have a participatory , inclusive process for letting people get involved in our party , " Barbour said .

When quantum mechanics first introduced the idea of probability wave functions , a lot of physicists were like Âwhat ?
I donÂt even know what that is .
Â
Then when it was explained that this basically implied a certain amount of indefinable and inscrutable uncertainty on the atomic level , most were still confused , but some started to get pissed off .
One of these some was Einstein , a religious man , who proclaimed quantum theory bunk on the grounds that -- ÂGod does not play dice .
Â Bohr , being better acquainted with GodÂs gambling habits , offered the following advice -- ÂDonÂt tell God what to do with his dice .
Â
Two large dice then crashed down from the heavens , killing Einstein and proving GodÂs existence once and for all .
The people rejoiced .
Â Yeah he does , ass !
That Âs exactly what IÂm saying !Â

The Comeback :
What We Would Have Said :
Keith Moon , of The Who , is one of the greatest drummers and rock stars to ever grace a stage .
His unique style of drumming like a goddamned madman and insisting that the drums be treated as a lead instrument paved the way for 32 - piece , revolving drum sets everywhere .
Further , his habit of utterly trashing hotel rooms , throwing TV sets out of windows , and blowing up toilets got him personally banned from no less than three major hotel chains and basically started the trend .
He was a tortured , bizarre little man who hit his women , forced enough drugs through his system to mildly discomfort Keith Richards , and made some of the best noises in the history of rock .
IÂd tell you who Jimmy Page is , but that kind of gives away the comeback , so IÂll act like you Âve lived under a rock for forty years and have no idea .
One night , Robert Plant , John Entwhistle , Page and Moon were partying together at MoonÂs house .
We can safely presume both were high out of their minds , and at this point in the night had wearied of driving cars into pools full of groupies .
Plant took the edge off by telling Moon all about his concept for a new rock band of tight - jeaned , open - shirted , long - haired men singing ten minute songs in falsetto about goblins raiding Middle Earth .
Shaking off the effects of the horse sedatives heÂd just taken rectally , Moon pulled himself out of the haze long enough to analogize -- Â  That idea will go over like a lead zeppelin .
Â The entire Led Zeppelin discography , not to mention the fact that more people associate Jimmy Page with the hard - rockinÂ  lifestyle than even know who the hell Keith Moon was .
Â Is that girlÂs pubic hair on fire ?
Seriously , Keith , what the hell is going on man ?
IÂ m really worried about you .
Also , you Âve got some food on your face .

The 24 hour news cycle affects everyone differently , and horribly .
A television reporter in Hong Kong has resigned after he was caught committing self - love on the top tier of a double decker bus .
Former Asia Television journo Chiu Yu Kit admitted to the act in court , but explained that he was merely trying to " ease his stress " when an off - duty cop caught sight of him standing up on a seat facing the window and taking in the local color while taking care of himself .
A judge put Kit on a one year good behavior bond and suggested that he take up exercise or socialize with other people to relax .
But , as everyone in the media knows , spending time with other media people only makes things worse !
Look what happened to Lou Dobbs !
The article also notes that , last month , " a ' lonely and disturbed ' Hong Kong man became stuck and had to be freed by emergency services after attempting to have sex with a park bench . "
Things are tough all over .

Major breakthroughs in science have historically been the province of individuals , not institutes .
Galileo and Copernicus , Edison and Einstein , toiling away in lonely labs or pondering the cosmos in private studies .
But in recent decades — especially since the Soviet success in launching the Sputnik satellite in 1957 — the trend has been to create massive institutions that foster more collaboration and garner big chunks of funding .
And it is harder now to achieve scientific greatness .
A study of Nobel Prize winners in 2005 found that the accumulation of knowledge over time has forced great minds to toil longer before they can make breakthroughs .
The age at which thinkers produce significant innovations increased about six years during the 20th century .
Do n't count the individual genius out just yet , however .
A balance between individual and institutional approaches is the best idea , according to a new theory by a Duke University engineer Adrian Bejan , who thinks institutions benefit most from the co-existence of large groups that self - organize naturally and lone scientists coming up with brilliant new ideas .
" The history of scientific achievement is marked by solitary investigators , from Archimedes to Newton to Darwin , " Bejan points out in the December issue of the International Journal of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics .
" Solitary thinkers have flourished throughout history because it is natural — science is good for the mind of the thinker and for the well - being of society .
Even though the trend is toward the creation of large research groups , the individual will always flourish . "
Yet the very notion of individual genius is somewhat overrated , as even some of the geniuses will attest .
Sir Isaac Newton , for example , said that if he had achieved anything with his work , such as his laws of motion and gravity , it was " by standing on the shoulders of giants . "
Soviet pressure
The course of modern research changed abruptly after Oct. 4 , 1957 , when the former Soviet Union became the first nation in space by launching Sputnik , Bejan said .
That fueled a dramatic increase in U.S. funding of large research groups within institutions already known for their research , he says .
This model was adopted by smaller institutions , which also began forming larger groups to attract funding .
However , individual big thinkers did n't disappear .
Bejan argues they continued to thrive .
He thinks his " constructal theory , " which he began describing in 1996 , might explain why .
The theory states that so - called flow systems evolve to balance and minimize imperfections , reducing friction or other forms of resistance , so that the least amount of useful energy is lost .
Examples in nature include rivers and streams that make up a delta or the intricate airways of the lungs .
In research done by humans , Bejan sees two main flows : those of ideas in the form of scientific findings , and those of support , measured by tangible factors such as funding and lab space .
" Successful research groups are those that grow and evolve on their own over time , " he says .
" For example , an individual comes up with a good idea , gets funding , and new group begins to form around that good idea .
This creates a framework where many smaller groups contribute to the whole . "
Solitary confinement
Extremes are not conducive to productive science , Bejan thinks .
" If an institution is made up only of solitary researchers , it would have many ideas but little support , " he said .
" On the other hand , a group that is large for the sake of size would have a lot of support , but would comparatively have fewer ideas per investigator . "
This problem was epitomized by the old Soviet - style research , where the government decreed the goal and scope of research and populated its monolithic structures with like - minded scientists , Bejan said .
There is no inherent conflict between research empires and the individual , but rather a balance that serves the greater good , as Bejan puts it .
And so , institutional administrators should go easy on the individual who shows signs of greatness .
" I would argue that those administrators who coerce their colleagues into large groups solely to attract more funding , to beef up their curriculum vitae or to generate more papers , are acting against the self - organizing nature of the institution and its research , " Bejan said .
" Complete coalescence into large groups does not happen and will not happen . "
Bejan 's thinking , it should be noted , is supported by funding from the National Science Foundation .
The next Einstein ?
Some might argue that the nature of genius is such that it can't be quashed , regardless .
Those who use their minds to great ends are known to work at it .
A 35 - year study in 2006 , which looked at mathematically gifted children to see what they ended up doing with their lives , revealed the ingredients of a great and productive mind : cognitive abilities , educational opportunities , interest , and plain old hard work .
Not everyone who starts out smart ends up brilliant .
So when will the next Einstein emerge ?
That 's a question even an Einstein can't answer .
But it 's worth noting that two centuries separated Einstein from Newton , considered by many his greatest intellectual rival .
That means the next Einstein might be a baby now , or perhaps is yet to be born .
This article is from the LiveScience Water Cooler :
What people are talking about in the world of science and beyond .
At the end of an ugly , fractious week in Parliament , we may pronounce the death of a gentlemen 's agreement , which served as an informal guarantee of British freedom , of the balance between the interests of government and the people as well as the maintenance of procedure .
You can read its obituary in the small print of the bills published after the Queen 's Speech , in the judgement from the European Court of Human Rights on the retention of DNA of more than 800,000 innocent people and in the behaviour of those involved in the Green affair - the police , the Leader of the House , Home Secretary and Mr Speaker Martin who presides like a plump Lewis Carroll absurdity , blush and bluster his only response to the corpse that lies before him .
The arrest of Damian Green would have broken every convention in the book , if indeed there were a book .
Aside from the use of nine counter - terror police and the astonishing lack of a warrant - actions which , until now , were more associated with Kazakhstan than Britain - it is worth remembering two other facts : the House of Commons internet server containing all MPs ' emails was plundered by the police without permission or qualm ; second , as Geoffrey Robertson QC pointed out in a letter to the Times , the law they used could mean that anyone - public watchdog , policy expert , editor , journalist or MP - who willingly receives a leak from a civil servant could suffer the maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
Part of the gentlemen 's agreement was that you did not dig up ancient laws to hound your political opponents or prevent scrutiny .
You respected the role of opposition MPs however pestilential their activities and you did not use the guillotine to stifle debate in the House of Commons .
It seems odd now , but there was a kind of accord which meant the government and opposition tried to fashion laws which were honest , clear and workable and which , despite political differences , were never against the interests of the people .
A close look at the Coroners and Justice Bill , published with the Queen 's Speech , will tell you that the government has been up to its old trick of using the cover of reform to push a surveillance agenda , in this case to ' remove barriers to effective data sharing to support improved public services and the fight against crime and terrorism ' .
What that means , as Jill Kirby , director of the Centre for Policy Studies , wrote is that : ' Under the guise of strengthening the powers of the Information Commissioner , the bill will in fact reduce parliamentary scrutiny , providing ministers with a " fast - track " procedure for sharing personal data . '
Civil servants will be crawling through our personal information like an infestation of cockroaches that can never be exterminated .
The same sleight of hand is in the draft Immigration Bill ; lawyers at Liberty spotted a clause that meant the police would be able to demand an ID card from those who had entered the UK - not just foreigners who are now being issued with cards , but anyone who had been abroad , even on holiday .
Whether this was a jeu d'esprit to test our vigilance or simply underhand , Jacqui Smith was forced to say that it was not her intention that police should soon be demanding people 's papers .
But how long can we go on accepting this woman 's word about what she did or did n't intend , did or did n't know ?
It was a pity that she did not present the plan to build a vast state database to record and store the information from every phone call , email and internet connection .
This unbelievable measure , with an estimated cost of £ 12bn , has been postponed , presumably until the next terror outrage or the government finds some money .
Even without this proposal , I 've rarely seen such unanimity in the press as to the character and motives of the Home Secretary , her department and the police .
Columnists and editorials in the Daily Mail , Independent , Sun , News of the World , Mail on Sunday , Financial Times , Daily Telegraph , Sunday Times and our sister paper , the Guardian , have lost all reservation about using the term ' police state ' .
Most of us spend our time these days with our heads stuck in our screens or worrying about the economy , but out there , real and important changes are taking place .
There is a new world where economic disaster is matched by the collapse of standards that were all part of the gentlemen 's agreement ; tolerance , respect , fairness and shared values are being vanquished by the police and by bullying , oppressive officialdom .
You see evidence in ID cards issued to foreigners , the banning notices handed to football fans in Manchester who had caused no trouble whatsoever , but were detained and forcibly bussed back to Stoke - on - Trent without seeing their match , and also in the Metropolitan Police 's Form 696 , which requires venues and club managers in London ' to report to the police the names , addresses , aliases and telephone numbers of performers ' .
More worryingly , Form 696 , which was promoted by Sir Ian Blair , demands the venue define ' the ethnicity of their audience ' .
Where are Jack Straw and Peter Hain , those famous campaigners against racism ?
Where is Harriet Harman , once a legal officer for the National Council for Civil Liberties ?
Well , slippery Jack was posing as another character from Alice in Wonderland at the state opening of Parliament and later that day , Harriet squirmed on Newsnight while trying to avoid backing the Speaker .
The Damian Green affair highlights serious worries about the police .
How far did they deceive the Commons officials about the warrant ?
What precisely did they say to Jill Pay , the hapless Serjeant at Arms ?
And - crucially - were ministers involved in the arrest ?
We need to know the answers ; delays to the inquiry promised by Harman are unacceptable .
At the heart of this matter is the politicisation of the police .
Are they too willing to do the government 's bidding ?
Was Boris Johnson , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority , guilty of unacceptable interference , as a former senior policeman , Andy Hayman , alleges ?
My feeling is that the arrest of Green and seizing of material may trump any concerns about mayoral protocol , but Hayman is right to talk about the importance of having an independent police force .
If Lord Mandelson 's sinuous body language and sublime containment are anything to go by , next year may bring a general election that will decide how we are governed and whether the slide into a truly frightening police - database state will continue .
The Conservatives shows signs of understanding the scope of the problem - Dominic Grieve ( shadow Home Secretary and Attorney General ) , Edward Garnier ( shadow Minister for Justice ) , Damian Green ( immigration ) and David Davis have raised the alarm very effectively , but there is still a feeling that the shots of other frontbenchers , notably Cameron , Osborne and Gove , are not quite reaching the boundary .
With all the support in the press , the Tories now need to show the moral and intellectual leadership to restore good government and decide how to replace the gentlemen 's agreement .
After the past 10 days , many must be convinced of the need for a Bill of Rights ( but not responsibilities ! ) with entrenched privacy laws .
I am for a written constitution too , but that issue is for another time .
Whether we have an election or not , it is clear that we will have to fight tooth and nail to preserve our free society in 2009 .
The cross-party Convention on Modern Liberty , called for 28 February 2009 , will be the start of something that no politician - even Jacqui Smith - will be able to ignore .
It 's one of those " man bites dog " moments .
The Federal Trade Commission is suing Sony's ( NYSE : SNE ) music arm for violating online privacy laws for children .
Sony Music apparently accepted website registrations from children under 13 , without notifying their parents for consent .
How Sony went about collecting and using the registrant data is n't clear , but Reuters is reporting that Sony is settling with the FTC for $ 1 million .
Sony Music will also hire a Web compliance officer and begin screening its registrations .
The four major labels -- Sony , Vivendi's Universal , EMI , and Warner Music Group ( NYSE : WMG ) -- have become popular pushpin dolls for music fans , after the industry sued countless Internet users for illegally swapping MP3 files .
One would think that a company that has thrived on one end of policing cyberspace crime would be smart enough not to commit it on the other .
Sony also should know better since its PS3 gaming console thrives through online connectivity with minors .
As a music label , Sony 's viral marketing ways should be well aware of the precautions that social networking sites like News Corp .'s ( NYSE : NWS ) MySpace and even Google 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG )
YouTube will go to keep toddlers and preteens away from registering .
The FTC can be vicious .
Just see how it 's still gnawing on the leg of Whole Foods Market ( NASDAQ : WFMI ) , long after it has integrated the purchase of rival organic grocer Wild Oats .
Sony certainly does n't want any of that .
It was an oversight .
It was a simple yet unbelievably stupid oversight .
Then again , when you 're a music company coping with year after year of declining CD sales , it 's hard to look forward when you can't even keep up with your past .
SHANGHAI , Nov. 16 ( UPI ) -- Second - seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia beat Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets Sunday to win the season - ending Masters Cup final at Shanghai .
The scores of the season - ending tournament were 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 , with Djokovic recording four service breaks to only one by the fourth - seeded Davydenko .

The 6 - foot - 3 Djokovic raced to a 5 - 0 lead in the first set and never looked back .
" There 's been so much going on for Serbian tennis lately that it 's just incredible to describe how could we do it in such a small period of the time , " Djokovic said .
" It 's a great achievement for me .
I 'm very , very happy . "
Djokovic earned $ 1.24 million , while his Russian opponent settled for $ 615,000 at the exclusive $ 4.45 million event .
The Australian Open winner in January finished the season with a 64 - 17 record , and also captured a bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Beijing last summer .

You may recall , just about a year ago , there was suddenly a bunch of news over the possibility of Canada introducing its own version of the US 's Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
To the surprise of both the entertainment industry ( who helped craft the law ) and the politicians who were pushing it , the opposition to this law was incredibly successful in getting its message out .
Starting with calls on various blogs and Facebook groups , kicked off by law professor Michael Geist , the issue became a big one throughout the media .
The politicians who promised the entertainment industry that they would pass this law tried to delay the introduction , assuming that the opposition , while loud , was thin and would fade away .
They were wrong .
The issue continued to get attention , and when the law was finally introduced , the opposition , across the board , was widespread and strong .
It was n't just a fringe issue among " internet activists . "
It was something that people from all over the economy saw as a fundamental issue worth fighting for .
But why ?
For years , copyright ( and wider intellectual property ) law has been considered to be sort of inside baseball , something that only lawyers and the entertainment industry cared about .
But that 's been changing .
There are a variety of reasons for why this happened and why copyright is considered a key issue for so many people in so many parts of the economy .
Michael Geist has now put together a film that tries to examine that question .
After first discussing how the issue became such a big deal , Geist interviews a number of Canadian copyfighters to get a sense ofcopyright is an issue worth fighting about :
Not surprisingly , Geist has also made the movie available in a variety of different formats so people can do what they want with it , including remixing or re-editing it .
There 's the full version ( seen above ) , an annotated version , a version for subtitling , or you can download the full movie via BitTorrent at either Mininova or Vuze .
Unless , of course , you live somewhere where they claim that BitTorrent is evil and must be blocked .

Other than the hot , hot days of summer , Christmas is my favorite time of year .
I love Christmas lights and decorating a tree and shopping for presents .
I love celebrating Advent in a greenery - draped church and singing carols as the Christmas lights glow bright around us .
And most definitely , I love Christmas Eve services , when we gather around a Nativity to celebrate Jesus ' birth .
Yet , even though I love Christmas and all its decorating splendor , I 'm convinced Christmas displays should not appear in government - owned spaces .
Nativities and other Christian symbols of Christmas do n't belong in state capitols , in courthouses , in city parks .
More accurately , it is because I am a Christian that I am convinced the government should not be celebrating Jesus ' birth .
Somewhere in the country every year , though , conflicts flame about the presence of Christian - specific decorations in government spaces .
Washington state is among the latest to enter the fray , with atheist and Christian groups duking it out over decorating the Capitol building .
Some claim that government organizations should be free to include Nativities in their Christmas displays , while others argue that doing so violates the Constitution 's First Amendment .
The battles have in places become so fierce that some on the right -- such as the Liberty Counsel and Fox television commentator Bill O'Reilly -- have declared that there 's a " War on Christmas , " claiming that secularists are trying to destroy " the reason for the season . "
Not only do I believe the Prince of Peace would reject any militaristic language about " war " over his birth , I 'm also convinced that Christians should not engage in crusades about Christmas decorations in the public square .
For while O'Reilly and gang blame the Christmas war on secularists , it 's important to remember that many Christians are also strong proponents of the separation of church and state , and believe that the government has no business endorsing Christianity , either explicitly or implicitly .
Yet by placing Nativities in capitol buildings and city parks , the government is advocating for Christianity to the exclusion of other faiths embraced by its citizens .
The reasons for my own beliefs are complicated , wrapped as they are in my church denomination 's history of persecution by church - states , where refusing to worship as a Catholic or Lutheran sometimes meant punishment and death .
The martyrdom of Anabaptists in Europe led them to believe wholly in the need for separation between church and state entities , and they carried this conviction with them as they fled the persecution of one church - state , and then others .
I grew up hearing this history of martyrdom , and learned -- almost by osmosis , it seemed -- that the U.S. Constitution ensured that which the Mennonites held dear : that the church and the state would remain separate .
Of course , there are many who believe the First Amendment has been misconstrued , and that government displays of religious symbols do n't violate the church / state separation .
And the U.S. Supreme Court decided in the 1980s that government bodies could place Christian symbols alongside other secular holiday exhibits , so that Frosty the Snowman can stand beside a Nativity , or Rudolph beside a menorah .
But I wonder why such government displays are even necessary .
Putting aside arguments about the First Amendment and church / state separation , do Christians really need baby Jesus on the courthouse steps to remind them of his birth ?
If the answer is yes , then perhaps that says more about their faith ( or faithlessness ) than it does about Christmas decorations or the Constitution .
And if people want Nativities in government spaces to remind non-Christians about " the reason for the season , " that seems like evangelism , an act in which the government should play no role .
After all , if Christians were a minority faith -- as my Mennonite ancestors were in Europe several centuries ago -- I imagine they would not wish to be evangelized by those in the majority , be they Muslims or Jews or Hare Krishnas .
Purposefully , our Constitution means we 'll never have to face that threat .
Mostly , though , I long to keep the sacred just that : sacred .
The focus of every Christian should on the real manger , rather than on whether Nativities should appear in the public square , pressed up next to Santa and the elves .
To believe and act otherwise -- that we need to fight some presumed war on Christmas by putting Christian displays in government spaces -- cheapens what should be the central focus of a Christian 's adoration : the birth of a savior .

An attorney at one of the city ’s most prestigious law firms – who had a secret passion for S&M – was shot to death by a rival for the affections of a brilliant Ivy League stunner who moonlights as a dominatrix , police sources said yesterday .
After fatally shooting Anthony Ottaviano , musclebound madman David Krieg kidnapped the white - shoe lawyer ’s girlfriend , Edythe Maa , a Long Island native who goes by the name Jade Vixen in fetish circles .
Krieg , 42 , who was obsessed with Maa , held cops at bay for nine hours before shooting himself in the head with the same gun he used to kill Ottaviano .
“ It ’s a terrible tragedy , ” said Jack Baughman , a partner at Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , where Ottaviano worked .
“ He was a really nice guy .
He was a hard worker .
He was conscientious .
He was careful . ”
Ottaviano and Maa partied together at kinky New York City fetish parties , sometimes with him wearing lipstick , a garter belt , stockings and high heels .
His secret leather - loving lifestyle – seen on photos posted on fetish Web sites – turned out to be his downfall .
The violence began when Ottaviano , 40 , and his girlfriend returned to her Philadelphia home after a cozy dinner , police sources said .
Krieg , a former client of Maa ’s who had been stalking her for months , was waiting for them in a parking lot near her home , police said .
The tattooed lunatic shot Ottaviano and then forced Maa into his car .
Krieg drove around with the petite dominatrix – who specializes in tickle torture , nipple play and “ sissy slut training ” – for hours .
Maa , who dropped out of a Ph.D. engineering program at the University of Pennsylvania , convinced him to let her go , and he dropped her off at his relatives ’ house in West Chester , Pa. , shortly after 4 a.m. on Monday , police said .
She immediately called cops , who began a search for Krieg ’s car .
Investigators found him quickly and forced him to pull over in a restaurant parking lot .
As Krieg held the gun to his head , cops tried unsuccessfully to talk him out of killing himself .
Hours earlier , Krieg ’s panicked parents had called cops , saying they believed he was going to commit suicide , said West Chester Police Chief Scott Bohn .
At that time , police searched his house and found his gun missing – and no sign of Krieg , an avid bodybuilder who has an ex-wife and a child .
Friends of Ottaviano were stunned by the loss of the fun-loving lawyer .
“ It ’s a dark day .
We lost a good person , ” Donn Winn , a lifelong friend , told the Philadelphia Inquirer .
Winn , who works as a New York state trooper , told the paper his pal grew up in Tonawanda , near Buffalo .
Winn said Ottaviano told him two weeks ago that Krieg was stalking Maa .
Ottaviano encouraged her to get a restraining order , but she never did , Winn said .
He added that Ottaviano was close to his father and brother , and still kept in close contact with a large group of pals from their hometown , going back to grade school .
A spokeswoman for the victim ’s firm said that he went to New York Law School , where he served on the law review , and graduated in 1997 .
Two years ago , he lost his mother to cancer .
“ He drove up to Buffalo every weekend for two years to be with her , ” Winn said .
“ That ’s the kind of person he was . ”
Quite a different person from Krieg , it appears .
Krieg ’s expletive - filled MySpace page is filled with kinky photos of the beefy freak being dominated by a slew of sexy bondage gals – including one in which he is on his knees straddled by a riding - crop - wielding woman he called Isabella .
On his last login , he listed his mood as “ devious ” and wrote , “ David is pissed off ! ”
And his fixation on Jade Vixen – Maa – is well documented .
“ Jade Vixen – she ’s the greatest fetish model since Betty Page , ” he gushed in a MySpace video .
“ Jade ’s real name is Edythe Maa , from Long Island New York ( still has family there ) , ” he wrote in another online rant , giving a cellphone number and her address .
His corseted crush , Maa , appears to have quite a devoted following .
“ Umm have I told you that I ’d die to work with you ? ” one fetish photog cooed on her Web site .
Maa boasts that she possesses “ an extensive wardrobe of fetish apparel – leather , latex , custom corsets , extreme high heels . ”
The SUNY Stony Brook alum – who has a bachelor ’s in chemistry – said she loves posing in clothes , and has a 5 - foot - 4 frame with incredible 32D - 22 - 32 measurements .
Her clients include men , women and transgender folk , she wrote .
But even though she ’s OK with a laundry list of kinky activities – like forced feminization , medical play and genital torture – she does balk at some activities .
Things like age play , nudity , face - sitting , “ intimate activity of any sort ” and anything that hurts animals are strictly off limits .
When reached at his Long Island home , Maa ’s father said that she was doing well .
“ She ’s OK , but she ’s not home , ” he said .
He said that she was not in a hospital .
When asked what his daughter did for a living , he said , “ Sorry , ” and shut the door .
A neighbor of Maa said , “ I knew she went to a lot of fetish parties .
I ’ve seen him [ Krieg ] come in all the time . ”
The neighbor , Cara Diamond , said Maa had lived with her sister .
But two months ago , Diamond saw Krieg help the sister move out .
“ They ’re both really , really smart , ” Diamond said of Maa and her sister .
“ They ’re like geniuses . ”

In June 2005 , a balding , slightly overweight , perpetually T - shirt - clad 26 - year - old computer consultant named Dan Kaminsky decided to get in shape .
He began by scanning the Internet for workout tips and read that five minutes of sprinting was the equivalent of a half - hour jog .
This seemed like a great shortcut — an elegant exercise hack — so he bought some running shoes at the nearest Niketown .
That same afternoon , he laced up his new kicks and burst out the front door of his Seattle apartment building for his first five - minute workout .
He took a few strides , slipped on a concrete ramp and crashed to the sidewalk , shattering his left elbow .
He spent the next few weeks stuck at home in a Percocet - tinged haze .
Before the injury , he 'd spent his days testing the inner workings of software programs .
Tech companies hired him to root out security holes before hackers could find them .
Kaminsky did it well .
He had a knack for breaking things — bones and software alike .
But now , laid up in bed , he could n't think clearly .
His mind drifted .
Running had n't worked out so well .
Should he buy a stationary bike ?
Maybe one of those recumbent jobs would be best .
He thought about partying in Las Vegas ... mmm , martinis ... and recalled a trick he 'd figured out for getting free Wi-Fi at Starbucks .
As his arm healed , the details of that Starbucks hack kept nagging at him .
He remembered that he had gotten into Starbucks ' locked network using the domain name system , or DNS .
When someone types google .com into a browser , DNS has a list of exactly where Google 's servers are and directs the traffic to them .
It 's like directory assistance for the Internet .
At Starbucks , the port for the low - bandwidth DNS connection — port 53 — was left open to route customers to the Pay for Starbucks Wi -Fi Web page .
So , rather than pay , Kaminsky used port 53 to access the open DNS connection and get online .
It was free but super - slow , and his friends mocked him mercilessly .
To Kaminsky that was an irresistible challenge .
After weeks of studying the minutiae of DNS and refining his hack , he was finally able to stream a 12 - second animated video of Darth Vader dancing a jig with Michael Flatley .
( The clip paired the Lord of the Sith with the Lord of the Dance . )
That was more than a year ago , but it still made him smile .
DNS was the unglamorous underbelly of the Internet , but it had amazing powers .
Kaminsky felt drawn to the obscure , often - ignored protocol all over again .
Maybe the painkillers loosened something in his mind , because as Kaminsky began to think more deeply about DNS he became convinced that something was n't right .
He could n't quite figure it out , but the feeling stuck with him even after he stopped taking the pain pills .
He returned to work full time and bought a recumbent stationary bike .
He got hired to test the security of Windows Vista before it was released , repeatedly punching holes in it for Microsoft .
Still , in the back of his mind , he was sure that the entire DNS system was vulnerable to attack .
Then last January , on a drizzly Sunday afternoon , he flopped down on his bed , flipped open his laptop , and started playing games with DNS .
He used a software program called Scapy to fire random queries at the system .
He liked to see how it would respond and decided to ask for the location of a series of nonexistent Web pages at a Fortune 500 company .
Then he tried to trick his DNS server in San Diego into thinking that he knew the location of the bogus pages .
Suddenly it worked .
The server accepted one of the fake pages as real .
But so what ?
He could now supply fake information for a page nobody would ever visit .
Then he realized that the server was willing to accept more information from him .
Since he had supplied data about one of the company 's Web pages , it believed that he was an authoritative source for general information about the company 's domain .
The server did n't know that the Web page did n't exist — it was listening to Kaminsky now , as if it had been hypnotized .
When DNS was created in 1983 , it was designed to be helpful and trusting — it 's directory assistance , after all .
It was a time before hacker conventions and Internet banking .
Plus , there were only a few hundred servers to keep track of .
Today , the humble protocol stores the location of a billion Web addresses and routes every piece of Internet traffic in the world .
Security specialists have been revamping and strengthening DNS for more than two decades .
But buried beneath all this tinkering , Kaminsky had just discovered a vestige of that original helpful and trusting program .
He was now face - to - face with the behemoth 's almost childlike core , and it was perfectly content to accept any information he wanted to supply about the location of the Fortune 500 company 's servers .
Paul Vixie organized experts from around the world to address the DNS security flaw .
Photo : John Keatley Kaminsky froze .
This was far more serious than anything he could have imagined .
It was the ultimate hack .
He was looking at an error coded into the heart of the Internet 's infrastructure .
This was not a security hole in Windows or a software bug in a Cisco router .
This would allow him to reassign any Web address , reroute anyone 's email , take over banking sites , or simply scramble the entire global system .
The question was : Should he try it ?
The vulnerability gave him the power to transfer millions out of bank accounts worldwide .
He lived in a barren one - bedroom apartment and owned almost nothing .
He rented the bed he was lying on as well as the couch and table in the living room .
The walls were bare .
His refrigerator generally contained little more than a few forgotten slices of processed cheese and a couple of Rockstar energy drinks .
Maybe it was time to upgrade his lifestyle .
Or , for the sheer geeky joy of it , he could reroute all of .com into his laptop , the digital equivalent of channeling the Mississippi into a bathtub .
It was a moment hackers around the world dream of — a tool that could give them unimaginable power .
But maybe it was best simply to close his laptop and forget it .
He could pretend he had n't just stumbled over a skeleton key to the Net .
Life would certainly be less complicated .
If he stole money , he 'd risk prison .
If he told the world , he'd be the messenger of doom , potentially triggering a collapse of Web - based commerce .
But who was he kidding ?
He was just some guy .
The problem had been coded into Internet architecture in 1983 .
It was 2008 .
Somebody must have fixed it by now .
He typed a quick series of commands and pressed enter .
When he tried to access the Fortune 500 company 's Web site , he was redirected to an address he himself had specified .
" Oh shit , " he mumbled .
" I just broke the Internet . "
Paul Vixie , one of the creators of the most widely used DNS software , stepped out of a conference in San Jose .
A curious email had just popped up on his laptop .
A guy named Kaminsky said he'd found a serious flaw in DNS and wanted to talk .
He sent along his phone number .
Vixie had been working with DNS since the 1980s and had helped solve some serious problems over the years .
He was president of the Internet Systems Consortium , a nonprofit that distributed BIND 9 , his DNS software .
At 44 , he was considered the godfather of DNS .
If there was a fundamental error in DNS , he probably would have fixed it long ago .
But to be on the safe side , Vixie decided to call Kaminsky .
He picked up immediately and within minutes had outlined the flaw .
A series of emotions swept over Vixie .
What he was hearing should n't be possible , and yet everything the kid said was logical .
By the end of the third minute , Vixie realized that Kaminsky had uncovered something that the best minds in computer science had overlooked .
This affected not just BIND 9 but almost all DNS software .
Vixie felt a deep flush of embarrassment , followed by a sense of pure panic .
" The first thing I want to say to you , " Vixie told Kaminsky , trying to contain the flood of feeling , " is never , ever repeat what you just told me over a cell phone . "
Vixie knew how easy it was to eavesdrop on a cell signal , and he had heard enough to know that he was facing a problem of global significance .
If the information were intercepted by the wrong people , the wired world could be held ransom .
Hackers could wreak havoc .
Billions of dollars were at stake , and Vixie was n't going to take any risks .
From that moment on , they would talk only on landlines , in person , or via heavily encrypted email .
If the information in an email were accidentally copied onto a hard drive , that hard drive would have to be completely erased , Vixie said .
Secrecy was critical .
They had to find a solution before the problem became public .
Andreas Gustafsson knew something was seriously wrong .
Vixie had emailed the 43 - year - old DNS researcher in Espoo , Finland , asking to talk at 7 pm on a hardwired line .
No cell phones .
Gustafsson hurried into the freezing March evening — his only landline was the fax in his office a brisk mile walk away .
When he arrived , he saw that the machine did n't have a handset .
Luckily , he had an analog phone lying around .
He plugged it in , and soon it let off an old - fashioned metallic ring .
Gustafsson had n't spoken to Vixie in years , but Vixie began the conversation by reading aloud a series of numbers — a code that would later allow him to authenticate Gustafsson 's emails and prove that he was communicating with the right person .
Gustafsson responded with his own authenticating code .
With that out of the way , Vixie got to his point :
Find a flight to Seattle now .
Wouter Wijngaards got a call as well , and the message was the same .
The Dutch open source programmer took the train to the airport in Amsterdam , got on a 10 - hour flight to Seattle , and arrived at the Silver Cloud Inn in Redmond , Washington , on March 29 .
He had traveled all the way from Europe , and he did n't even know why .
Like Gustafsson , he had simply been told to show up in Building Nine on the Microsoft campus at 10 am on March 31 .
In the lobby of the Silver Cloud , Wijngaards met Florian Weimer , a German DNS researcher he knew .
Weimer was talking with Chad Dougherty , the DNS point man from Carnegie Mellon 's Software Engineering Institute .
Wijngaards joined the conversation — they were trying to figure out where to have dinner .
Nobody talked about why some of the world 's leading DNS experts happened to bump into one another near the front desk of this generic US hotel .
Vixie had sworn each of them to secrecy .
They simply went out for Vietnamese food and avoided saying anything about DNS .
The next morning , Kaminsky strode to the front of the conference room at Microsoft headquarters before Vixie could introduce him or even welcome the assembled heavy hitters .
The 16 people in the room represented Cisco Systems , Microsoft , and the most important designers of modern DNS software .
Vixie was prepared to say a few words , but Kaminsky assumed that everyone was there to hear what he had to say .
After all , he 'd earned the spotlight .
He had n't sold the discovery to the Russian mob .
He had n't used it to take over banks .
He had n't destroyed the Internet .
He was actually losing money on the whole thing :
As a freelance computer consultant , he had taken time off work to save the world .
In return , he deserved to bask in the glory of discovery .
Maybe his name would be heralded around the world .
Kaminsky started by laying out the timeline .
He had discovered a devastating flaw in DNS and would explain the details in a moment .
But first he wanted the group to know that they did n't have much time .
On August 6 , he was going to a hacker convention in Las Vegas , where he would stand before the world and unveil his amazing discovery .
If there was a solution , they 'd better figure it out by then .
But did Kaminsky have the goods ?
DNS attacks were nothing new and were considered difficult to execute .
The most practical attack — widely known as cache poisoning — required a hacker to submit data to a DNS server at the exact moment that it updated its records .
If he succeeded , he could change the records .
But , like sperm swimming toward an egg , whichever packet got there first — legitimate or malicious — locked everything else out .
If the attacker lost the race , he would have to wait until the server updated again , a moment that might not come for days .
And even if he timed it just right , the server required a 16 - bit ID number .
The hacker had a 1 - in - 65,536 chance of guessing it correctly .
It could take years to successfully compromise just one domain .
The experts watched as Kaminsky opened his laptop and connected the overhead projector .
He had created a " weaponized " version of his attack on this vulnerability to demonstrate its power .
A mass of data flashed onscreen and told the story .
In less than 10 seconds , Kaminsky had compromised a server running BIND 9 , Vixie 's DNS routing software , which controls 80 percent of Internet traffic .
It was undeniable proof that Kaminsky had the power to take down large swaths of the Internet .
The tension in the room rose as Kaminsky kept talking .
The flaw jeopardized more than just the integrity of Web sites .
It would allow an attacker to channel email as well .
A hacker could redirect almost anyone 's correspondence , from a single user 's to everything coming and going between multinational corporations .
He could quietly copy it before sending it along to its original destination .
The victims would never know they had been compromised .
This had serious implications .
Since many " forgot my password " buttons on banking sites rely on email to verify identity , an attacker could press the button , intercept the email , and change the password to anything he wanted .
He would then have total access to that bank account .
" We 're hosed , " Wijngaards thought .
It got worse .
Most Internet commerce transactions are encrypted .
The encryption is provided by companies like VeriSign .
Online vendors visit the VeriSign site and buy the encryption ; customers can then be confident that their transactions are secure .
But not anymore .
Kaminsky 's exploit would allow an attacker to redirect VeriSign 's Web traffic to an exact functioning replica of the VeriSign site .
The hacker could then offer his own encryption , which , of course , he could unlock later .
Unsuspecting vendors would install the encryption and think themselves safe and ready for business .
A cornerstone of secure Internet communication was in danger of being destroyed .
David Ulevitch smiled despite himself .
The founder of OpenDNS , a company that operates DNS servers worldwide , was witnessing a tour de force — the geek equivalent of Michael Phelps winning his eighth gold medal .
As far as Ulevitch was concerned , there had never been a vulnerability of this magnitude that was so easy to use .
" This is an amazingly catastrophic attack , " he marveled with a mix of grave concern and giddy awe .
It was a difficult flight back to San Francisco for Sandy Wilbourn , vice president of engineering for Nominum , a company hired by broadband providers to supply 150 million customers with DNS service .
What he heard in Redmond was overwhelming — a 9 out of 10 on the scale of disasters .
He might have given it a 10 , but it was likely to keep getting worse .
He was going to give this one some room to grow .
One of Wilbourn 's immediate concerns was that about 40 percent of the country 's broadband Internet ran through his servers .
If word of the vulnerability leaked , hackers could quickly compromise those servers .
In his Redwood City , California , office , he isolated a hard drive so no one else in the company could access it .
Then he called in his three top engineers , shut the door , and told them that what he was about to say could n't be shared with anyone — not at home , not at the company .
Even their interoffice email would have to be encrypted from now on .
Their task :
Make a change to the basic functioning of Nominum 's DNS servers .
They and their customers would have to do it without the usual testing or feedback from outside the group .
The implementation — the day the alteration went live to millions of people — would be its first real - world test .
It was a daunting task , but everyone who had been in Redmond had agreed to do the same thing .
They would do it secretly , and then , all together on July 8 , they would release their patches .
If hackers did n't know there was a gaping DNS security hole before , they would know then .
They just would n't know exactly what it was .
Nominum and the other DNS software vendors would have to persuade their customers —
Internet service providers from regional players such as Cablevision to giants like Comcast — to upgrade fast .
It would be a race to get servers patched before hackers figured it out .
Though the Redmond group had agreed to act in concert , the patch — called the source port randomization solution — did n't satisfy everyone .
It was only a short - term fix , turning what had been a 1 - in - 65,536 chance of success into a 1 - in - 4 billion shot .
Still , a hacker could use an automated system to flood a server with an endless stream of guesses .
With a high - speed connection , a week of nonstop attacking would likely succeed .
Observant network operators would see the spike in traffic and could easily block it .
But , if overlooked , the attack could still work .
The patch only papered over the fundamental flaw that Kaminsky had exposed .
On July 8 , Nominum , Microsoft , Cisco , Sun Microsystems , Ubuntu , and Red Hat , among many others , released source port randomization patches .
Wilbourn called it the largest multivendor patch in the history of the Internet .
The ISPs and broadband carriers like Verizon and Comcast that had been asked to install it wanted to know what the problem was .
Wilbourn told them it was extremely important that they deploy the patch , but the reason would remain a secret until Kaminsky delivered his talk in Las Vegas .
Even as Kaminsky was giving interviews about the urgency of patching to media outlets from the Los Angeles Times to CNET , the computer security industry rebelled .
" Those of us ... who have to advise management cannot tell our executives ' trust Dan , ' " wrote one network administrator on a security mailing list .
On one blog , an anonymous poster wrote this to Kaminsky : " You ask people not to speculate so your talk is n't blown but then you whore out minor details to every newspaper / magazine / publishing house so your name can go all over Google and gain five minutes of fame ?
This is why people hate you and wish you would work at McDonald 's instead . "
With a backlash building , Kaminsky decided to reach out to a few influential security experts in hopes of winning them over .
He set up a conference call with Rich Mogull , founder of Securosis , a well - respected security firm ; researcher Dino Dai Zovi ; and Thomas Ptacek , a detractor who would later accuse Vixie and Kaminsky of forming a cabal .
The call occurred July 9 .
Kaminsky agreed to reveal the vulnerability if Mogull , Dai Zovi , and Ptacek would keep it secret until the Vegas talk August 6 .
They agreed , and Kaminsky 's presentation laid it out for them .
The security experts were stunned .
Mogull wrote , " This is absolutely one of the most exceptional research projects I 've seen . "
And in a blog post Ptacek wrote , " Dan 's got the goods .
It 's really f'ing good . "
And then , on July 21 , a complete description of the exploit appeared on the Web site of Ptacek 's company .
He claimed it was an accident but acknowledged that he had prepared a description of the hack so he could release it concurrently with Kaminsky .
By the time he removed it , the description had traversed the Web .
The DNS community had kept the secret for months .
The computer security community could n't keep it 12 days .
About a week later , an AT&T server in Texas was infiltrated using the Kaminsky method .
The attacker took over google.com — when AT&T Internet subscribers in the Austin area tried to navigate to Google , they were redirected to a Google look - alike that covertly clicked ads .
Whoever was behind the attack probably profited from the resulting increase in ad revenue .
Every day counted now .
While Kaminsky , Vixie , and the others pleaded with network operators to install the patch , it 's likely that other hacks occurred .
But the beauty of the Kaminsky attack , as it was now known , was that it left little trace .
A good hacker could reroute email , reset passwords , and transfer money out of accounts quickly .
Banks were unlikely to announce the intrusions — online theft is bad PR .
Better to just cover the victims ' losses .
On August 6 , hundreds of people crammed into a conference room at Caesars Palace to hear Kaminsky speak .
The seats filled up quickly , leaving a scrum of spectators standing shoulder to shoulder in the back .
A group of security experts had mockingly nominated Kaminsky for the Most Overhyped Bug award , and many wanted to know the truth :
Was the massive patching effort justified , or was Kaminsky just an arrogant , media - hungry braggart ?
While his grandmother handed out homemade Swedish lace cookies , Kaminsky took the stage wearing a black T - shirt featuring an image of Pac - Man at a dinner table .
He tried for modesty .
" Who am I ? " he asked rhetorically .
" Some guy .
I do code . "
The self - deprecation did n't suit him .
He had the swagger of a rock star and adopted the tone of a misunderstood genius .
After detailing the scope of the DNS problem , he stood defiantly in front of a bullet point summary of the attack and said , " People called BS on me .
This is my reply . "
By this time , hundreds of millions of Internet users were protected .
The bomb had been defused .
The problem was , there was little agreement on what the long - term solution should be .
Most discussion centered around the concept of authenticating every bit of DNS traffic .
It would mean that every computer in the world — from iPhones to corporate server arrays — would have to carry DNS authentication software .
The root server could guarantee that it was communicating with the real .com name server , and .com would receive cryptological assurance that it was dealing with , say , the real Google .
An impostor packet would n't be able to authenticate itself , putting an end to DNS attacks .
The procedure is called DNSSEC and has high - profile proponents , including Vixie and the US government .
But implementing a massive and complicated protocol like DNSSEC is n't easy .
Vixie has actually been trying to persuade people for years , and even he has n't succeeded .
Either way , the point might turn out to be moot .
Kaminsky ended his Las Vegas talk by hinting that even darker security problems lay ahead .
It was the type of grandstanding that has made him a polarizing figure in the computer security community .
" There is no saving the Internet , " he said .
" There is postponing the inevitable for a little longer . "
Then he sauntered off the stage and ate one of his grandma 's cookies .

Quote : The Day I Discovered That HCI Wants Me Dead
- by Tamara
The one time I called 911 was on a prowler who had chased my ex-roomie into our apartment the previous day .
She was so scared she would n't leave the apartment til I got home from work , so I borrowed her cell phone , figuring to troll the neighborhood looking for this guy on my way home and call the heat on him .
No joy ( as fighter pilots put it ) .
I pulled into our driveway upon arriving home , and as I was parking the car he appeared from around the corner of the building .
No problem ; I just called the local precinct direct ( NOT the overburdened 911 system , mainly because I knew half - a- dozen officers that worked out of that precinct ) and informed them of the Creepy Roommate Chaser in my parking lot .
Deciding I 'd rather wait in my apartment only five or ten steps from the car , I loosened the velcro on my purse 's gun compartment , grabbed my jumbo - sized canister of “ dog & bear grade ” OC ( pepper spray ) and stepped out .
He charged me and grabbed my arm , squeezing hard enough to leave bruises .
I hosed his face with what felt like half the can of OC , holding the nozzle of the can perhaps a foot from his nose .
He collapsed , screaming , and I bolted for the steps .
I saw that some genius had left the building 's outward - opening security door propped open with a cinderblock , and so I looked over my shoulder to make sure he was still lying there .
He was n't ; he was right behind me .
I pounded up the stairs and into the building , tossing the OC can into the bushes on the fly and scrabbling for my Glock 23 in my purse .
Hitting my ( thank God , unlocked ! ) apartment door with a shoulder on the run , I burst in and saw my roomie standing there in the bedroom doorway ; eyes bugged out and mouth agape .
I kicked the door shut behind me , trying to buy time , but my attacker was so close behind me that it bounced off his head with a * thunk * and flew open again .
By this time I had the gun out and turned with it in both hands , trying to raise the gun as close to my line of sight as possible , like I ’d been trained .
I remember a freaky - calm corner of my brain chanting “ frontsightfrontsightfron … ” when my assailant almost ran onto the muzzle .
I remember that I was taking up slack on the trigger , when he tried to backpedal at the sight of the gun and fell on his butt .
I tried to tell him to hold it and wait for the police , but I could n't get the words out .
Incidentally , my roomie says that I was screaming louder than her ; not words , just a shriek .
Truthfully , I do n't distinctly remember any sounds at all , except for him hitting the floor ; I thought for an instant I 'd shot him .
He scrabbled backwards out the door and jumped back out of the building .
I got to the outer door in time to see him turn the corner at the end of the driveway and run off .
It was then that I noticed that a ) I was in tears , and b ) I had piddled myself .
Some twenty minutes later the police showed up ; not entirely their fault as I apparently had not made it clear that I was out in the parking lot with this guy .
They thought that I had spotted him through a window from inside , and so they had tried a stealthy approach to see if they could avoid spooking him .
Both officers were occasional drinking buddies of mine and were sincerely concerned , upset , & apologetic .
They never caught the guy .
I still carry a gun ...
Observations in the Aftermath :
This all happened in about maybe the space of 10 seconds ; from exiting the car to the perp fleeing .
It was maybe fifteen feet from my car to the stairs , I ran up four concrete steps , and my apartment door was immediately inside the security door on the right ( against exterior wall ) .
I took two or three steps into the living room and turned with drawn gun .
His proximity to me was such that I firmly believe that if the slamming door had not slowed him by a half step , he may have been inside the arc of my pistol ’s muzzle as I turned , and things might not have had such a favorable outcome .
Certain parts of this series of events are etched in my mind in amazing detail and drawn - out slow motion , while others are gone .
There ’s no audio track to my memories of the incident after his initial scream from the OC spray , except for the thump from the door and the thump from his fall .
I distinctly remember commencing to pull the trigger just as his arms windmilled and he fell backwards with no more than a foot between the pistol and his chest , and for a moment I thought I 'd shot him until he started scrambling backwards .
When he did that , I for some reason ( there was no conscious decision that I remember ) removed my finger from the trigger and tried to tell him to stop where he was .
I have no doubt that if he had stood up or moved towards me in any way , then I would have shot him .
For whatever reason , though , I could n't do it to a person who was scrabbling desperately backwards on his behind and who then dove / rolled sideways out the door .
To this day I am thankful I did n't have to kill him , but I sometimes lose sleep wondering if other , later victims may not have been as lucky .
I 'm sorry for the stream of consciousness type stuff .
I 'm still not real coherent on this topic .
I polished this from a couple of previous posts I made here some time ago and just stumbled across it again on my hard drive .
I want to submit it somewhere it 'll do some good .
I think it 's good food for thought for any woman living in the city , and could have some effect if placed someplace where it was n't just " preaching to the choir " , so to speak .

So you see , if guns could be magically ' disappeared ' somehow , the only person in this instance that would have been affected would have been me .
My creepy attacker apparently did n't feel he needed one ; he had size and strength on his side .
That 's why my very personal opinion is that gun control sucks .

Security researchers say they 've developed a way to partially crack the Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) encryption standard used to protect data on many wireless networks .
The attack , described as the first practical attack on WPA , will be discussed at the PacSec conference in Tokyo next week .
There , researcher Erik Tews will show how he was able to crack WPA encryption , in order to read data being sent from a router to a laptop computer .
The attack could also be used to send bogus information to a client connected to the router .
To do this , Tews and his co-researcher Martin Beck found a way to break the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP ) key , used by WPA , in a relatively short amount of time : 12 to 15 minutes , according to Dragos Ruiu , the PacSec conference 's organizer .
They have not , however , managed to crack the encryption keys used to secure data that goes from the PC to the router in this particular attack
Security experts had known that TKIP could be cracked using what 's known as a dictionary attack .
Using massive computational resources , the attacker essentially cracks the encryption by making an extremely large number of educated guesses as to what key is being used to secure the wireless data .
The work of Tews and Beck does not involve a dictionary attack , however .
To pull off their trick , the researchers first discovered a way to trick a WPA router into sending them large amounts of data .
This makes cracking the key easier , but this technique is also combined with a " mathematical breakthrough , " that lets them crack WPA much more quickly than any previous attempt , Ruiu said .
Tews is planning to publish the cryptographic work in an academic journal in the coming months , Ruiu said .
Some of the code used in the attack was quietly added to the Aircrack - ng Wi-Fi encryption hacking tool two weeks ago , he added .
WPA is widely used on today 's Wi-Fi networks and is considered a better alternative to the original WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ) standard , which was developed in the late 1990s .
Soon after the development of WEP , however , hackers found a way to break its encryption and it is now considered insecure by most security professionals .
Store chain T.J. Maxx was in the process of upgrading from WEP to WPA encryption when it experienced one of the most widely publicized data breaches in U.S. history , in which hundreds of millions of credit card numbers were stolen over a two - year period .
A new wireless standard known as WPA2 is considered safe from the attack developed by Tews and Beck , but many WPA2 routers also support WPA .
" Everybody has been saying , ' Go to WPA because WEP is broken , ' " Ruiu said .
" This is a break in WPA . "
If WPA is significantly compromised , it would be a big blow for enterprise customers who have been increasingly adopting it , said Sri Sundaralingam , vice president of product management with wireless network security vendor AirTight Networks .
Although customers can adopt Wi -Fi technology such as WPA2 or virtual private network software that will protect them from this attack , there are still may devices that connect to the network using WPA , or even the thoroughly cracked WEP standard , he said .
Ruiu expects a lot more WPA research to follow this work .
" Its just the starting point , " he said .
" Erik and Martin have just opened the box on a whole new hacker playground . "
This typographic series started as exploration while playing with the settings and glass materials within the applications ' Arnold renderer and ' Cinema 4D ' .
The results are mesmerizing , the idea of ' dispersion ' comes from the familiar example of a rainbow .
As recession fears cause the nation to embrace greater state control of the economy and unimaginable federal deficits , one searches in vain for debate worthy of the moment .
Where there should be an historic clash of ideas , there is only blind resignation and an amorphous queasiness that we are simply sweeping the slouching beast under the rug .
With faith in the free markets now taking a back seat to fear and expediency , nearly the entire political spectrum agrees that the federal government must spend whatever amount is necessary to stabilize the housing market , bail out financial firms , liquefy the credit markets , create jobs and make the recession as shallow and brief as possible .
The few who maintain free - market views have been largely marginalized .
Taking the theories of economist John Maynard Keynes as gospel , our most highly respected contemporary economists imagine a complex world in which economics at the personal , corporate and municipal levels are governed by laws far different from those in effect at the national level .
Individuals , companies or cities with heavy debt and shrinking revenues instinctively know that they must reduce spending , tighten their belts , pay down debt and live within their means .
But it is axiomatic in Keynesianism that national governments can create and sustain economic activity by injecting printed money into the financial system .
In their view , absent the stimuli of the New Deal and World War II , the Depression would never have ended .
On a gut level , we have a hard time with this concept .
There is a vague sense of smoke and mirrors , of something being magically created out of nothing .
But economics , we are told , is complicated .

There are a couple of discussions of poverty going on right now , here and on the “ Austrianecon ” list - serve , which gives me a convenient opening for the following .
I ’ve been re-reading Jane Jacobs ’s second book , The Economy of Cities ( 1969 ) , while working on a short piece for a Festschrift in her honor .
FYI I ’m writing about the virtue of inefficient cities , paying close attention to the chapter 3 , “ The valuable inefficiencies and impracticalities of cities . ”
Although less known and influential than her first book , The Death and Life of Great American Cities ( 1961 ) , EC is devoted to developing her economic ideas and is full of great insights , such as the following from that chapter :
To seek ‘ causes ’ of poverty …is an intellectual dead end because poverty has no causes .
Only prosperity has causes .
Analogically , heat is a result of active processes ; it has causes .
But cold is not the result of any process ; it is only the absence of heat .
Just so , the great cold of poverty and economic stagnation is merely the absence of economic development .
It can be overcome only if the relevant economic processes are in motion .
What Jacobs has in mind here is the underlying condition of poverty , not temporary impoverishment that ’s due to episodes of unemployment , which may indeed be traced to particular causes .
And the “ relevant economic processes ” she ’s referring to are those that for her drive dynamic , entrepreneurial development , i.e. , urbanization , diversity of land uses and tastes , and high population density all in the context of free trade .
( If you want more on the mechanism , which she clearly explains as spontaneously emergent , I could post something later but it would be best just to read this book , or , if you ’re in a hurry , the amazing first chapter .
I ca n’t find an ungated version online but you can read a bit of it here . )
Anyway , I do n’t know if Mises or Hayek or Rothbard ever put it quite this way .
But Jacobs ’s observation implies that an effective “ war on poverty ” ( remember , she ’s writing during the height of Johnson ’s Great Society ) would really just be the by - product of establishing the enabling conditions for economic development , rather the outcome of a redistributive state .
***
As many of you are aware , for centuries , poverty was the default condition for humankind , and as recently as 1959 the rate of measured poverty among families in the United States was over 20 % ( before which I do n’t think there are recorded data ) and has fluctuated around 10 % since 1968 despite the boatloads of money thrown at the problem especially since the early 1970s .
Taking the longer view , although reliable statistics on poverty naturally do n’t exist , Henry Hazlitt ’s The Conquest of Poverty ( also downloadable from the Mises Institute ) chronicles the incidence of famine in Europe : “ thirty - one major famines from ancient times down to I960 . ”
It ’s been quite some time , probably not since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution ( circa 1760 ) , that there has been any famine in the West that has not been the result of war or genocide .

This US appears to ignore findings of British court on detainee 's torture LONDON -- The announcement Dec. 1 that Barack Obama had retained Bush Defense Secretary Robert Gates was intended to demonstrate the President - elects desire for a big - tent administration that transcended partisan politics .
Gates had voiced his desire to close the Pentagon 's notorious Guantánamo Bay prison almost as soon as he took over from Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006 , and this and his subsequent stewardship of the Iraq War earned him a place as a trustworthy figure who might bridge the Bush and Obama divide .
However , a declaration the defense secretary made in a Washington , D.C. District Court filing Dec. 12 during the habeas review of Guantánamo prisoner Binyam Mohamed might make some rethink the trustworthy label .
Mohamed s lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , says that unless Gates retracts his statement , he could find himself accused of perjury .
Mohamed has said that after being seized in Pakistan in April 2002 and held for three months , he was rendered by the CIA to Morocco , where he was tortured for 18 months .
His claims of torture were upheld by the British High Court in a review this summer ( PDF ) , which took place after Mohameds lawyers sued the British government for alleged complicity in their clients rendition and torture .
Both the British government and the British High Court accepted that Mohamed has put forward a prima facie case of torture ,  Stafford Smith said .
The court established that Mohamed was unlawfully rendered from Pakistan to Morocco by the United States authorities ,  his lawyers said , and was subject to unlawful incommunicado detention and torture during his interrogation there by or on behalf of the United States authorities . 
The court also established that Mr. Mohamed was unlawfully rendered by the United States authorities from Morocco to Afghanistan ,  where he was detained unlawfully and incommunicado and was tortured or subject to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment by or on behalf of the United States authorities in the  Dark Prison . -- a secret CIA facility near Kabul .
At the end of this ordeal , Mohamed said he made a number of false confessions about his involvement with al - Qaeda and a plot to detonate a radioactive " dirty bomb " in New York as a direct result of his torture in Morocco and at the hands of CIA agents in Afghanistan .
The Bush administration has never provided any explanation for Mohameds whereabouts from July 2002 to May 2004 .
In June , the U.S. Supreme Court granted Guantánamo prisoners habeas corpus rights .
Mohamed s case was reviewed by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington D.C. District Court .
Sullivan set a deadline of Oct. 6 for the government to produce exculpatory evidence relating to the case ( in other words , any evidence that tended to disprove the governments claims ) .
When the time arrived , however , the Justice Department dropped the claim about the dirty bomb plot .
At a Oct. 30 hearing , Sullivan said ,  That raises a question as to whether or not the allegations were ever true . 
Sullivan continued to press the government for exculpatory evidence .
Although the dirty bomb plot claim had been dropped , he ordered the Justice Department to disclose any exculpatory evidence relating to the charge .
In order to determine the reliability of Mohameds statements , he said he wanted to know how the interrogation sessions were conducted .
Sullivan also ordered the Justice Department to secure an affidavit from Gates .
The defense secretary swore under penalty of perjury that all exculpatory evidence in Mohameds case -- including evidence relating to the alleged dirty bomb plot -- had been provided to Mohameds lawyers .
 It is the practice of the United States Government , in preparing factual returns in the Guantánamo Bay detainee habeas cases , to provide petitioners all evidence encountered in the development of the factual return that tends to materially undermine information presented in the return to support the petitioners classification as an enemy combatant ,  Gates said in his declaration .
 Consistent with this practice , on August 12 , 2008 , the attorneys preparing the factual return in this case provided Petitioner with evidence encountered in the development of his return that meets this standard ,  Gates added .
He also explained that following Sullivans ruling , all exculpatory evidence reasonably available to the government relating to the withdrawn allegations  about the dirty bomb plot had been provided on a rolling basis . 
He added that 42 documents provided by the British government had also been handed over .
 As a result ,  he wrote ,  the United States Government has turned over all reasonably available evidence that suggests Binyam Mohamed should not be designated as an enemy combatant . 
In a letter sent to the Justice Department on Monday Dec. 15 ( which has been seen by The Raw Story ) , Stafford Smith said he was trying to evaluate whether the defense secretary had deliberately perjured himself , or had been misled .
 I will say that I am extremely disappointed in the declaration that was filed on behalf of Secretary Gates on Friday ,  Stafford Smith wrote , adding ,  There is no question but that it is false . 
He said he could n't conclude whether I would categorize Mr. Gates  statement as outright perjury , or as a misguided consequence of his reliance on an erroneous definition of the legal terms . "
 The vast majority of material ( almost the entirety of the substantive evidence ) submitted against Mr. Mohamed consists of statements attributed to him ,  and therefore " would qualify as exculpatory  under Sullivans order , " he said .
Stafford Smith says it 's apparent that a wealth of material has not yet been turned over .
 Without going into anything that is classified , the Government has at no point in this case even acknowledged that Mr. Mohamed was rendered by the U.S. to Morocco on July 21 , 2002 , or that he was held there for 18 months , or that he was abused there , " he wrote .
" Nor has the government breathed a word about the five months he subsequently spent being abused and tortured in the Dark Prison in Kabul . 
Stafford Smith said his only interest was to secure justice for his client .
 Both my interest , and that of my co-counsel in the habeas and the military commissions litigation , is to represent our client in the best traditions of US justice ,  he wrote .
 It pains me to have to say that the government continues to ignore its own obligations , and is risking sanctions . 
 Nothing has changed , " Stafford Smith told RAW STORY last week .
" Unless Robert Gates revises his opinions , his declaration will demonstrate that he has been drawn into the defense not of the nation , but of some of the worst excesses of the current administration , involving extraordinary rendition  and torture , and shameless attempts to cover up all evidence of wrongdoing . 
Gates could not be reached for comment .

The US presidential elections are mere weeks away and everyone is abuzz with election fever .
So now , as the States prepares to elect their latest president , it seems a good time to look at some previous hopefuls – hopefuls that you will be damned glad never won the race !
So , here are the 5 worst presidential candidates who ( thankfully ) lost .
If you can think of others you would add to the list , be sure to tell us in the comments .
5 Strom Thurmond 1948
At the Democratic National Convention of 1948 , delegates officially adopted a pro-civil rights platform for the first time , which was quickly embraced by President Harry Truman .
Some Democrats , however , did not like this at all , and the delegations from a number of Southern states marched out of the convention to have their own .
This breakaway party called themselves the “ States ’ Rights Democrats ” or the “ Dixiecrats , ” and they nominated then - Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for the presidency .
Running under the slogan , “ Segregation Forever , ” Thurmond hoped to keep the federal government from ever interfering with the Jim Crow laws that his party valued so much .
Even though their message did not play well throughout most of the United States , the Dixiecrats managed to win the electoral votes of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and South Carolina .
Thurmond ’s third - place finish might seem impressive by today ’s standards , but in reality his loss allowed Democrats to reject segregationists and to support the Civil Rights Movement – which two decades later finally succeeded .
4 Henry Wallace 1948
Strom Thurmond was n’t the only Democrat who felt betrayed by the party platform in 1948 .
Henry Wallace was the former Vice - President who had served under Franklin Roosevelt , but was replaced by Harry Truman in the Election of 1944 .
Wallace ’s main beef with the party , however , had nothing to do with segregation ( which he opposed ) , and everything to do with the Soviet Union ( which he supported ) .
In his first term as president , Harry Truman called for an aggressive stance against Communism and , in particular , the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin .
Former Vice - President Wallace , however , did not like this part of the Democratic platform .
So in response , he decided to run for the presidency as the Progressive Party candidate – which had a platform emphasizing trust in Stalin and giving American Communists a voice in government .
In fact , Wallace ’s Soviet - friendly stances were extreme enough that even many socialists refused to support him .
On election day , the Progressive Party failed to win a single state or electoral vote , which further pushed American Communists into obscurity .
Wallace retired from politics after his loss , and in time grew to regret his opposition to the policies of Harry Truman and the Democratic Party .
3 Horace Greeley 1872
In 1872 , Horace Greeley was a newspaper publisher and former one - term congressman from New York .
He had also been an ardent abolitionist and a founding - father of the Republican Party .
But after the Civil War , he grew to despise the presidency of Republican Ulysses S. Grant – who favored the continuation of Southern Reconstruction .
Greeley thought that the South had been punished hard enough , and called for a withdrawal of Union forces from the former Confederacy .
When Grant was up for re-election in 1872 , Greeley ran for , and subsequently won , the nomination of the “ Liberal Republican Party ” .
Surprisingly , the Democratic Party loved his platform of ending Reconstruction so much that they decided to nominate him too .
The American people , however , were not quite as enthusiastic about Greeley , and on election day he suffered an embarrassing loss to Grant , only winning a handful of former slave states .
But even if he had won , Greeley would have never made it to the presidency , since a month after the election he went crazy and died a few days later .
2 John C. Breckenridge 1860
Despite having dominated politics throughout the 1850s , the Democratic Party of 1860 was in serious trouble .
Over the issue of slavery , the Party was split in two .
One faction , the “ Northern Democrats ” under Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois , was more moderate and supported the rights of people in their own jurisdictions to decide whether slavery should be legal or not .
The other group that emerged was the “ Southern Democrats , ” which supported government protection of slavery as a property right .
They nominated incumbent Vice - President John C. Breckenridge , a politician from Kentucky , for the presidency .
Running on his hard - line pro-slavery platform , he became the favorite candidate of the American South .
But the splitting of the Democratic Party allowed for another candidate – former Congressman Abraham Lincoln of Illinois – to dominate in the North , which was at the time the most populous and held the most electoral votes .
Lincoln thus managed to win the presidency against both Democrats , as well as third - party candidate John Bell .
After Breckenridge lost the election , the Civil War began and he soon joined the Confederacy .
1 Aaron Burr 1800
The Presidential election of 1800 may be one of the most bizarre in American history .
Incumbent President John Adams , a Federalist , was running for re-election .
His challenger happened to be his own vice - president , Thomas Jefferson , who represented the Democratic - Republican Party .
Adams was unpopular and indeed handily lost the election to Jefferson .
But in those days the Constitution still had a few kinks in it , and one of those kinks was the rule that each presidential elector must vote twice , for two different individuals , and the runner - up would become vice - president .
So Jefferson ’s 73 electors each cast one vote for him , and one vote for his vice - presidential candidate Aaron Burr .
This resulted in an electoral tie between Jefferson and Burr , and as a result the Federalist - controlled House of Representatives had to choose between the two men .
Jefferson was not popular with the federalists , and they attempted to elect Burr .
For a while there was no consensus , with Jefferson a few votes short of being elected .
But eventually , former Secretary of the Treasury , Federalist Alexander Hamilton gave his support to Jefferson , thus handing him the presidency , while the Vice - Presidency went to Burr .
Mr. Burr apparently did n’t like this very much .
A few years later he challenged Hamilton to a duel , which he won handily by killing him .
But this is not the scariest aspect of Aaron Burr .
After killing the popular Hamilton , he was widely despised throughout the United States .
So what did Aaron Burr do ?
He devised a conspiracy against United States which involved aiding Britain in regaining some of it ’s former territories lost in the Revolutionary War .
Additionally , he hoped to acquire the land west of the Mississippi to form his own personal empire , which he would use to antagonize the United States .
Unfortunately for him , and luckily for the existence of America , Burr was caught and charged with treason .
Even though he was acquitted , Burr was hated more than ever and spent the majority of his remaining life in exile .
Makes you kind of glad that this man did n’t become president , does n’t it ?
+ John C. Calhoun 1824
Calhoun is best remembered as a vice - president , but in the early stages of the 1824 election , he was a candidate for the presidency – thereby earning himself a bonus place on this list !
Calhoun served as vice - president under two presidents and undermined both of them .
Calhoun led the pro-slavery faction in the Senate in the 1830s and 1840s , opposing both abolitionism and attempts to limit the expansion of slavery into the western territories .
He was also a major advocate of the Fugitive Slave Law , which enforced the co-operation of free states in returning escaping slaves .
Furthermore , Calhoun felt that having a separate , distinct Indian culture within the borders of the United States would create problems in such areas as land usage , interracial relationships , and trade .
His beliefs that Indians were inferior steered Calhoun to support a policy of the removal of the Indians in the eastern United States .
Many of Calhoun ’s policy ideas were implemented during his tenure as Secretary of War and Vice - President .
He believed that government interference in the lives of Indians was essential because the Indians were too ignorant and uncivilized to be allowed to make their own decisions and live as they chose .
During the Civil War , the Confederate government honored Calhoun on a one - cent postage stamp , which was printed but never officially released .

“ Exterminate all the Brutes ” : Gaza 2009 *
Noam Chomsky
chomsky.info , January 19 , 2009 ( revised June 6 , 2009 )
On Saturday December 27 , 2008 , the latest US - Israeli attack on helpless Palestinians was launched .
The attack had been meticulously planned , for over 6 months according to the Israeli press .
The planning had two components : military and propaganda .
It was based on the lessons of Israel ’s 2006 invasion of Lebanon , which was considered to be poorly planned and badly advertised .
We may , therefore , be fairly confident that most of what has been done and said was pre-planned and intended .
That surely includes the timing of the assault : shortly before noon , when children were returning from school and crowds were milling in the streets of densely populated Gaza City .
It took only a few minutes to kill over 200 people and wound 700 , an auspicious opening to the mass slaughter of defenseless civilians trapped in a tiny cage with nowhere to flee .
1
The attack specifically targeted the closing ceremony of a police academy , killing dozens of policemen .
The international law division of the Israeli army ( IDF , Israeli Defense Forces ) had criticized the plans for months , but under army pressure , its director , Col. Pnina Sharvit - Baruch , gave the department ’s approval .
“ Also under pressure , ” Ha’aretz reports , “ Sharvit - Baruch and the division also legitimized the attack on Hamas government buildings and the relaxing of the rules of engagement , resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties . ”
The international law division adopts “ permissive positions ” so as “ to remain relevant and influential , ” the article continues .
Sharvit - Baruch then joined the Law Faculty at Tel Aviv University , over protests by the director of the university ’s human rights center and other faculty .
The legal division ’s decision was based on the army ’s categorization of the police “ as a resistance force in the event of an Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip , ” Hebrew University Law professor Yuval Shany observed , adding that the principle scarcely “ differentiates them from [ Israeli ] reservists or even from 16 - year - olds who will be drafted in two years ” – hence takes much of Israel ’s population to be legitimate targets of terror .
To take a different analogy , the IDF rules of engagement justify the terrorist attack on police cadets in Lahore in March 2009 , killing at least 8 , rightly condemned as “ barbaric ” ; Pakistani elite forces could , however , respond in this case , killing or capturing the terrorists , an option not available to Gazans .
The narrow scope of the IDF concept of “ protected civilian ” is explained further by a senior figure in its international law division :
“ The people who go into a house despite a warning do not have to be taken into account in terms of injury to civilians , because they are voluntary human shields .
From the legal point of view , I do not have to show consideration for them .
In the case of people who return to their home in order to protect it , they are taking part in the fighting . ”
2
In his retrospective analysis entitled “ Parsing Gains of Gaza War , ” New York Times correspondent Ethan Bronner cited the first day ’s achievement as one of the most significant of the war ’s gains .
Israel calculated that it would be advantageous to appear to “ go crazy , ” causing vastly disproportionate terror , a doctrine that traces back to the 1950s .
“ The Palestinians in Gaza got the message on the first day , ” Bronner wrote , “ when Israeli warplanes struck numerous targets simultaneously in the middle of a Saturday morning .
Some 200 were killed instantly , shocking Hamas and indeed all of Gaza . ”
The tactic of “ going crazy ” appears to have been successful , Bronner concluded : there are “ limited indications that the people of Gaza felt such pain from this war that they will seek to rein in Hamas , ” the elected government .
Inflicting pain on civilians for political ends is another long - standing doctrine of state terror , in fact its guiding principle .
I do not , incidentally , recall the Times retrospective “ Parsing Gains of Chechnya War , ” though the gains were great .
3
The meticulous planning also presumably included the termination of the assault .
It ended just before the inauguration , thus minimizing the ( remote ) threat that President Obama might have to say some words critical of these vicious US - supported crimes .
Two weeks after the Sabbath opening of the assault , with much of Gaza already pounded to rubble and the death toll approaching 1000 , the UN Agency UNRWA , on which most Gazans depend for survival , announced that the Israeli military refused to allow aid shipments to Gaza , saying that the crossings were closed for the Sabbath .
4
To honor the holy day , Palestinians at the edge of survival must be denied food and medicine , while hundreds can be slaughtered on the Sabbath by US jet bombers and helicopters .
The rigorous observance of the Sabbath in this dual fashion attracted little if any notice .
That makes sense .
In the annals of US - Israeli criminality , such cruelty and cynicism scarcely merit more than a footnote .
They are too familiar .
To cite one relevant parallel , in June 1982 the US - backed Israeli invasion of Lebanon opened with the bombing of the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila , later to become famous as the site of terrible massacres supervised by the IDF .
The bombing hit the local hospital – the Gaza hospital — and killed over 200 people , according to the eyewitness account of an American Middle East academic specialist .
The massacre was the opening act in an invasion that slaughtered some 15 - 20,000 people and destroyed much of southern Lebanon and Beirut , proceeding with crucial US military and diplomatic support .
That included vetoes of Security Council resolutions seeking to halt the criminal aggression that was undertaken , as scarcely concealed , to defend Israel from the threat of peaceful political settlement , contrary to useful fabrications about Israelis suffering under intense rocketing , a fantasy of apologists .
5
All of this is normal , and quite frankly discussed by high Israeli officials .
Thirty years ago Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur observed that since 1948 , “ we have been fighting against a population that lives in villages and cities . ”
As Israel ’s most prominent military analyst , Zeev Schiff , summarized his remarks , “ the Israeli Army has always struck civilian populations , purposely and consciously … the Army , he said , has never distinguished civilian [ from military ] targets … [ but ] purposely attacked civilian targets . ”
The reasons were explained by the distinguished statesman Abba Eban : “ there was a rational prospect , ultimately fulfilled , that affected populations would exert pressure for the cessation of hostilities . ”
The effect , as Eban well understood , would be to allow Israel to implement , undisturbed , its programs of illegal expansion and harsh repression .
Eban was commenting on a review of Labor government attacks against civilians by Prime Minister Begin , presenting a picture , Eban said , “ of an Israel wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name . ”
Eban did not contest the facts that Begin reviewed , but criticized him for stating them publicly .
Nor did it concern Eban , or his admirers , that his advocacy of massive state terror is also reminiscent of regimes he would not dare to mention by name .
6
Eban ’s justification for state terror is regarded as persuasive by respected authorities .
As the current US - Israel assault raged , Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Israel ’s tactics in the current attack , as in its invasion of Lebanon in 2006 , are based on the sound principle of “ trying to `educate ’ Hamas , by inflicting a heavy death toll on Hamas militants and heavy pain on the Gaza population . ”
That makes sense on pragmatic grounds , as it did in Lebanon , where “ the only long - term source of deterrence was to exact enough pain on the civilians — the families and employers of the militants — to restrain Hezbollah in the future . ”
And by similar logic , bin Laden ’s effort to “ educate ” Americans on 9/11 was highly praiseworthy , as were the Nazi attacks on Lidice and Oradour , Putin ’s destruction of Grozny , and other notable educational exercises .
7
New York Times correspondent Stephen Erlanger reports that Israeli human rights groups are “ troubled by Israel ’s strikes on buildings they believe should be classified as civilian , like the parliament , police stations and the presidential palace ” – and , we may add , villages , homes , densely populated refugee camps , water and sewage systems , hospitals , schools and universities , mosques , UN relief facilities , ambulances , and indeed anything that might relieve the pain of the unworthy victims .
A senior Israeli intelligence officer explained that the IDF attacked “ both aspects of Hamas — its resistance or military wing and its dawa , or social wing , ” the latter a euphemism for the civilian society .
“ He argued that Hamas was all of a piece , ” Erlanger continues , “ and in a war , its instruments of political and social control were as legitimate a target as its rocket caches . ”
Erlanger and his editors add no comment about the open advocacy , and practice , of massive terrorism targeting civilians , though correspondents and columnists signal their tolerance or even explicit advocacy of such crimes , as noted .
But keeping to the norm , Erlanger does not fail to stress that unlike US - Israeli actions , Hamas rocketing is “ an obvious violation of the principle of discrimination and fits the classic definition of terrorism . ”
8
Like others familiar with the region , Middle East specialist Fawwaz Gerges observes that “ What Israeli officials and their American allies do not appreciate is that Hamas is not merely an armed militia but a social movement with a large popular base that is deeply entrenched in society . ”
Hence when they carry out their plans to destroy Hamas ’s “ social wing , ” they are aiming to destroy Palestinian society .
9
Gerges may be too generous .
It is highly unlikely that Israeli and American officials – or the media and other commentators – do not appreciate these facts .
Rather , they implicitly adopt the traditional perspective of those who virtually monopolize the means of violence : our mailed fist can crush any opposition , and if our furious assault has a heavy civilian toll , that ’s all to the good : perhaps the remnants will be properly educated .
IDF officers clearly understand that they are crushing the civilian society .
Ethan Bronner quotes an Israeli Colonel who says that he and his men are not much “ impressed with the Hamas fighters . ”
“ They are villagers with guns , ” said a gunner on an armored personnel carrier .
They resemble the victims of the murderous IDF “ iron fist ” operations in occupied southern Lebanon in 1985 , directed by Shimon Peres , one of the great terrorist commanders of the era of Reagan ’s “ War on Terror . ”
During these operations , Israeli commanders and strategic analysts explained that the victims were “ terrorist villagers , ” difficult to eradicate because “ these terrorists operate with the support of most of the local population . ”
An Israeli commander complained that “ the terrorist …has many eyes here , because he lives here , ” while the military correspondent of the Jerusalem Post described the problems Israeli forces faced in combating the “ terrorist mercenary , ” “ fanatics , all of whom are sufficiently dedicated to their causes to go on running the risk of being killed while operating against the IDF , ” which must “ maintain order and security ” in occupied southern Lebanon despite “ the price the inhabitants will have to pay . ”
The problem has been familiar to Americans in South Vietnam , Russians in Afghanistan , Germans in occupied Europe , and others who find themselves righteously implementing the Gur - Eban - Friedman doctrine .10
Gerges believes that US - Israeli state terror will fail : Hamas , he writes , “ cannot be wiped out without massacring half a million Palestinians .
If Israel succeeds in killing Hamas ’s senior leaders , a new generation , more radical than the present , will swiftly replace them .
Hamas is a fact of life .
It is not going away , and it will not raise the white flag regardless of how many casualties it suffers . ”
Perhaps , but there is often a tendency to underestimate the efficacy of violence .
It is particularly odd that such a belief should be held in the United States .
Why are we here ?
Hamas is regularly described as “ Iranian - backed Hamas , which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel . ”
One will be hard put to find something like “ democratically elected Hamas , which has long been calling for a two - state settlement in accord with the international consensus ” — blocked for over 30 years by the US and Israel .
All true , but not a useful contribution to the Party Line , hence dispensable .
Such details as those mentioned earlier , though minor in context , nevertheless teach us something about ourselves and our clients .
So do others .
To mention another one , as the latest US - Israeli assault on Gaza began , a small boat , the Dignity , was on its way from Cyprus to Gaza .
The doctors and human rights activists aboard intended to violate Israel ’s criminal blockade and to bring medical supplies to the trapped population .
The ship was intercepted in international waters by Israeli naval vessels , which rammed it severely , almost sinking it , though it managed to limp to Lebanon .
Israel issued the routine lies , refuted by the journalists and passengers aboard , including CNN correspondent Karl Penhaul and former US representative and Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney .11
That is a serious crime — much worse , for example , than hijacking boats off the coast of Somalia .
It passed with little notice .
The tacit acceptance of such crimes reflects the understanding that Gaza is occupied territory , and that Israel is entitled to maintain its siege , and is even authorized by the guardians of international order to carry out crimes on the high seas to implement its programs of punishing the civilian population for disobedience to its commands – under pretexts to which we return , almost universally accepted but clearly untenable .
The lack of attention again makes sense .
For decades , Israel had been hijacking boats in international waters between Cyprus and Lebanon , killing or kidnapping passengers , sometimes bringing them to prisons in Israel , including secret prison / torture chambers , to hold as hostages for many years .
12
Since the practices are routine , why treat the new crime with more than a yawn ?
Cyprus and Lebanon reacted quite differently , but who are they in the scheme of things ?
Who cares , for example , if the editors of Lebanon ’s Daily Star , generally pro-Western , write that “ Some 1.5 million people in Gaza are being subjected to the murderous ministrations of one of the world ’s most technologically advanced but morally regressive military machines .
It is often suggested that the Palestinians have become to the Arab world what the Jews were to pre-World War II Europe , and there is some truth to this interpretation .
How sickeningly appropriate , then , that just as Europeans and North Americans looked the other way when the Nazis were perpetrating the Holocaust , the Arabs are finding a way to do nothing as the Israelis slaughter Palestinian children .
” 13 Perhaps the most shameful of the Arab regimes is the brutal Egyptian dictatorship , the beneficiary of the most US military aid , apart from Israel .
According to Lebanese scholar Amal Saad - Ghorayeb , Israel still “ routinely abducts Lebanese civilians from the Lebanese side of the Blue Line [ the international border ] , most recently in December 2008 . ”
And of course “ Israeli planes violate Lebanese airspace on a daily basis in violation of UN Resolution 1701 . ”
That too has been happening for a long time .
In condemning Israel ’s double standards after its invasion of Lebanon in 2006 , Israeli strategic analyst Zeev Maoz wrote that “ Israel has violated Lebanese airspace by carrying out aerial reconnaissance missions virtually every day since its withdrawal from Southern Lebanon six years ago .
True , these aerial overflights did not cause any Lebanese casualties , but a border violation is a border violation .
Here too , Israel does not hold a higher moral ground . ”
And in general , there is no basis for the “ wall - to - wall consensus in Israel that the war against the Hezbollah in Lebanon is a just and moral war , ” a consensus “ based on selective and short - term memory , on an introvert world view , and on double standards .
This is not a just war , the use of force is excessive and indiscriminate , and its ultimate aim is extortion . ” 14
Maoz also reminds his Israeli readers that overflights with sonic booms to terrorize Lebanese are the least of Israeli crimes in Lebanon , even apart from its five invasions since 1978 : “ On July 28 , 1988 Israeli Special Forces abducted Sheikh Obeid , and on May 21 , 1994 Israel abducted Mustafa Dirani , who was responsible for capturing the Israeli pilot Ron Arad [ when he was bombing Lebanon in 1986 ] .
Israel held these and 20 other Lebanese who were captured under undisclosed circumstances in prison for prolonged periods without trial .
They were held as human `bargaining chips . ’
Apparently , abduction of Israelis for the purpose of prisoners ’ exchange is morally reprehensible , and militarily punishable when it is the Hezbollah who does the abducting , but not if Israel is doing the very same thing . ”
And on a far grander scale and over many years .
Israel ’s regular practices are significant even apart from what they reveal about Israeli criminality and Western support for it .
As Maoz indicates , these practices underscore the utter hypocrisy of the standard claim that Israel had the right to invade Lebanon once again in 2006 when soldiers were captured at the border , the first cross - border action by Hezbollah in the six years since Israel ’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon , which it occupied in violation of Security Council orders going back 22 years , while during these six years after withdrawal Israel violated the border almost daily with impunity , and silence here .
The hypocrisy is , again , routine .
Thus Thomas Friedman , while instructing us on how the lesser breeds are to be “ educated ” by terrorist violence , writes that Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon in 2006 , once again destroying much of southern Lebanon and Beirut while killing another 1000 civilians , was a just act of self - defense , responding to Hezbollah ’s crime of “ launching an unprovoked war across the U.N. - recognized Israel - Lebanon border , after Israel had unilaterally withdrawn from Lebanon . ”
Similarly , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair John Kerry , speaking at the Brookings Institution , laments “ the failure of Israel ’s unilateral disengagements from Southern Lebanon and Gaza to bring peace ” ( we return to its “ disengagement ” from Gaza ) .
Putting aside the deceit , by the same logic , terrorist attacks against Israelis that are far more destructive and murderous than any that have taken place would be fully justified in response to Israel ’s criminal practices in Lebanon and on the high seas , which vastly exceed Hezbollah ’s crime of capturing two soldiers at the border .
The veteran Middle East specialist of the New York Times surely knows about these crimes , at least if he reads his own newspaper : for example , the 18th paragraph of a story on prisoner exchange which observes , casually , that 37 of the Arab prisoners “ had been seized recently by the Israeli Navy as they tried to make their way from Cyprus to Tripoli , ” north of Beirut .15
Of course all such conclusions about appropriate actions against the rich and powerful are based on a fundamental flaw :
This is us , and that is them .
This crucial principle , deeply embedded in Western culture , suffices to undermine even the most precise analogy and the most impeccable reasoning .
The new crimes that the US and Israel were committing in Gaza as 2009 opened do not fit easily into any standard category – except for the category of familiarity ; I have just mentioned several examples , and will return to others .
Literally , the crimes fall under the official US government definition of “ terrorism , ” but that designation does not capture their enormity .
They cannot be called “ aggression , ” because they are being conducted in occupied territory , as the US tacitly concedes , and as serious scholarship recognizes .
In their comprehensive history of Israeli settlement in the occupied territories , Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar point out that after Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in August 2005 , the ruined territory was not released “ for even a single day from Israel ’s military grip or from the price of the occupation that the inhabitants pay every day …
Israel left behind scorched earth , devastated services , and people with neither a present nor a future .
The settlements were destroyed in an ungenerous move by an unenlightened occupier , which in fact continues to control the territory and kill and harass its inhabitants by means of its formidable military might ” 16 – which can be exercised with extreme savagery , thanks to firm US support and participation .
The US - Israeli assault on Gaza escalated in January 2006 , a few months after the formal withdrawal , when Palestinians committed a truly heinous crime : they voted “ the wrong way ” in a free election .
Like others , Palestinians learned that one does not disobey with impunity the commands of the master , who never cease to orate about his “ yearning for democracy ” without eliciting ridicule from the educated classes , another impressive achievement .
Since the terms “ aggression ” and “ terrorism ” are inadequate , some new term is needed for the sadistic and cowardly torture of people caged with no possibility of escape , while they are being pounded to dust by the most sophisticated products of US military technology – used in violation of international and even US law , but for self - declared outlaw states that is just another minor technicality .
Also a minor technicality is the fact that on December 31 , while terrorized Gazans were desperately seeking shelter from the ruthless assault , Washington hired a German merchant ship to transport from Greece to Israel 3000 tons of unidentified “ ammunition . ”
The new shipment “ follows the hiring of a commercial ship to carry a much larger consignment of ordnance in December from the United States to Israel ahead of air strikes in the Gaza Strip , ” Reuters reported .
“ Israel ’s intervention in the Gaza Strip has been fueled largely by U.S. supplied weapons paid for with U.S. tax dollars , ” said a briefing by the New America Foundation , which monitors the arms trade .
The new shipment was hampered by the decision of the Greek government to bar the use of any port in Greece “ for the supplying of the Israeli army . ”
All of this is separate from the more than $ 21 billion in U.S. military aid provided by the Bush administration to Israel , almost all grants .
Obama intends to ensure that the largesse extends far into the future , whatever circumstances might be down the road .
He calls for “ sending up to $ 30 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel over the next 10 years , ” foreign policy analyst Stephen Zunes reports , a 25 % increase over the Bush administration , and “ a bonanza for U.S. arms manufacturers , who contribute to candidates “ several times what the `pro - Israel ’ PACs contribute , ” and tirelessly “ promote massive arms transfers to the Middle East and elsewhere . ”
Greece ’s response to US - backed Israeli crimes is rather different from the craven performance of the leaders of most of Europe .
The distinction reveals that Washington may have been quite realistic in regarding Greece as part of the Near East , not Europe , until 1974 .
Perhaps Greece is just too civilized to be part of Europe .
For anyone who might find the timing of the new arms deliveries to Israel curious , the Pentagon has an answer : the shipment would arrive too late to escalate the Gaza attack , and the military equipment , whatever it may be , is to be pre-positioned in Israel for eventual use by the US military .
That is quite plausible .
One of the many services that Israel performs for its patron is to provide it with a valuable military base at the periphery of the world ’s major energy resources .
It can therefore serve as a forward base for US aggression – or to use the technical terms , to “ defend the Gulf ” and “ ensure stability . ”
17
The huge flow of arms to Israel serves many subsidiary purposes .
Middle East policy analyst Mouin Rabbani observes that Israel can test newly developed weapons systems against defenseless targets .
This is of value to Israel and the US “ twice over , in fact , because less effective versions of these same weapons systems are subsequently sold at hugely inflated prices to Arab states , which effectively subsidizes the U.S. weapons industry and U.S. military grants to Israel .
” 18 These are additional functions of Israel in the US - dominated Middle East system , and among the reasons why Israel is so favored by the state authorities , along with a wide range of US high - tech corporations , and of course military industry and intelligence .
Israel apart , the US is by far the world ’s major arms supplier .
The recent New America Foundation report concludes that “ U.S. arms and military training played a role in 20 of the world ’s 27 major wars in 2007 , ” earning the US $ 23 billion in receipts , increasing to $ 32 billion in 2008 .
Small wonder that among the numerous UN resolutions that the US opposed in the December 2008 UN session was one calling for regulation of the arms trade .
In 2006 , the US was alone in voting against the treaty , but in November 2008 it was joined by a partner : Zimbabwe.19
There were other notable votes at the December UN session .
A resolution on “ the right of the Palestinian people to self - determination ” was adopted by 173 to 5 ( US , Israel , Pacific island dependencies ; the US and Israel added evasive pretexts ) .
The vote reaffirms US - Israeli rejectionism , in international isolation .
Similarly a resolution on “ universal freedom of travel and the vital importance of family reunification ” was adopted over the opposition of the US , Israel , and Pacific dependencies , presumably with Palestinians in mind : Israel bars entry to Palestinians from the occupied territories who wish to join their Israeli spouses .
In voting against the right to development the US lost Israel but gained Ukraine .
In voting against the “ right to food , ” the US was alone , a particular striking fact in the face of the enormous global food crisis , dwarfing the financial crisis that threatens western economies .
It is easy to understand why the UN voting record is consistently unreported and dispatched deep into the memory hole by the media and conformist intellectuals .
It would not be wise to reveal to the public what the record implies about their elected representatives .
One of the heroic volunteers in Gaza , Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert , described the scene of horror as an “ All out war against the civilian population of Gaza . ”
He estimated that half the casualties are women and children .
Gilbert reports that he had scarcely seen a military casualty among the 100s of bodies .
That is not too surprising .
Hamas “ made a point of fighting at a distance — or not at all , ” Ethan Bronner reports while “ parsing the gains ” of the US - Israeli assault .
So Hamas ’s manpower remains intact , and it was mostly civilians who suffered pain : a positive outcome , according to widely - held doctrine .
20
These estimates were confirmed by UN humanitarian chief John Holmes , who informed reporters that it is “ a fair presumption ” that most of the civilians killed were women and children in a humanitarian crisis that is “ worsening day by day as the violence continues . ”
But we could be comforted by the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , the leading dove in the ongoing electoral campaign , who assured the world that there is no “ humanitarian crisis ” in Gaza , thanks to Israeli benevolence .
21
Like others who care about human beings and their fate , Gilbert and Holmes pleaded for a ceasefire .
But not yet .
“ At the United Nations , the United States prevented the Security Council from issuing a formal statement on Saturday night calling for an immediate ceasefire , ” the New York Times mentioned in passing .
The official reason was that “ there was no indication Hamas would abide by any agreement . ”
In the annals of justifications for slaughter , this pretext must rank among the more cynical .
That of course was Bush and Rice , soon to be displaced by Obama , who compassionately repeated that “ if missiles were falling where my two daughters sleep , I would do everything in order to stop that . ”
He was referring to Israeli children , not the many hundreds being torn to shreds in Gaza by US arms .
Beyond that Obama maintained his silence .
22
A few days later , on January 8 , the Security Council passed a resolution calling for a “ durable ceasefire . ”
The vote was 14 - 0 , US abstaining .
Israel and US hawks were angered that the US did not veto the resolution , as usual .
The abstention , however , sufficed to give Israel at least a yellow light to escalate the violence , as it did right up to virtually the moment of the inauguration , as had been predicted .
As the ceasefire ( theoretically ) went into effect , the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights released its figures for the final day of the assault : 54 Palestinians killed including 43 unarmed civilians , 17 of them children , while the IDF continued to bombard civilian homes and UN schools .
The death toll , they estimated , mounted to 1,184 , including 844 civilians , 281 of them children .
The IDF continued to use incendiary bombs across the Gaza Strip , and to destroy houses and agricultural land , forcing civilians to flee their homes .
A few hours later , Reuters reported more than 1,300 killed .
The staff of the Al Mezan Center , which carefully monitors casualties and destruction , visited areas that had previously been inaccessible because of incessant heavy bombardment .
They discovered dozens of civilian corpses decomposing under the rubble of destroyed houses or removed by Israeli bulldozers .
Entire urban blocks had disappeared .
23
The figures for killed and wounded are surely an underestimate .
And it is unlikely that there will be any serious investigation of these atrocities , despite calls for an inquiry into war crimes by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , and the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem .
Crimes of official enemies are subjected to rigorous investigation , but our own are systematically ignored .
General practice , again , and understandable on the part of the masters , who rigorously adhere to a variant of the “ too big to fail ” insurance policy granted to major financial institutions by Washington , which provides them with great competitive advantages in a form of protectionism that is protected from the term .
The US is just “ too big to hold to account , ” whether by judicial inquiry , boycott and sanctions , or other means .
The January 8 Security Council Resolution called for stopping the flow of arms into Gaza .
The US and Israel ( Rice - Livni ) soon reached an agreement on measures to ensure this result , concentrating on Iranian arms .
There is no need to stop smuggling of US arms into Israel , because there is no smuggling : the huge flow of arms is quite public , even when not reported , as in the case of the arms shipment announced as the slaughter in Gaza was proceeding .
It was later learned that shortly after the end of its military attack on Gaza , Israel apparently also bombed Sudan , killing dozens of people , also sinking a ship in the Red Sea .
The targets were suspected to be arms shipments intended for Gaza , so there was no reaction .
An Iranian effort to impede the flow of US arms to the aggressor would have been regarded as a horrendous terrorist atrocity , which might well have led to nuclear war .24
The Resolution also called for “ ensur[ing ] the sustained re-opening of the crossing points on the basis of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access between the Palestinian Authority and Israel ” ; that Agreement determined that crossings to Gaza would be operated on a continuous basis and that Israel would also allow the crossing of goods and people between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
The Rice - Livni agreement had nothing to say about this aspect of the Security Council Resolution .
The US and Israel had abandoned the 2005 Agreement as part of their punishment of Palestinians for voting the wrong way in the January 2006 election .
Rice ’s press conference after the 2009 Rice - Livni agreement emphasized Washington ’s continuing efforts to undermine the results of the one free election in the Arab world : “ There is much that can be done , ” she said , “ to bring Gaza out of the dark of Hamas ’s reign and into the light of the very good governance the Palestinian Authority can bring ” – at least , that it can bring as long as it remains a loyal client , rife with corruption and willing to carry out harsh repression , but obedient .25
Returning from a visit to the Arab world , Fawwaz Gerges strongly affirmed what others on the scene had reported .
The effect of the US - Israeli offensive in Gaza has been to infuriate the populations and to arouse bitter hatred of the aggressors and their collaborators .
“ Suffice it to say that the so - called moderate Arab states [ that is , those that take their orders from Washington ] are on the defensive , and that the resistance front led by Iran and Syria is the main beneficiary .
Once again , Israel and the Bush administration have handed the Iranian leadership a sweet victory . ”
Furthermore , “ Hamas will likely emerge as a more powerful political force than before and will likely top Fatah , the ruling apparatus of President Mahmoud Abbas ’s Palestinian Authority , ” Washington ’s current favorite .
That conclusion was reinforced by a poll by the independent Jerusalem Media and Communications Center , which found that support for Hamas in the West Bank rose from 19 % the preceding April to 29 % after the Gaza attack , while support for Fatah dropped from 34 % to 30 % .
Far from weakening militant Islamist groups and their sponsors , the Center concluded , “ the war weakened and undermined to a very large extent the moderates — not only in Palestine but also in the region . ”
53 % of West Bank Palestinians felt that Hamas had won the war , as compared with 10 % who saw it as an Israeli victory .
26
It is worth bearing in mind that the Arab world was not scrupulously protected from the only regular live TV coverage of what was happening in Gaza , namely the “ calm and balanced analysis of the chaos and destruction ” provided by the outstanding correspondents of al - Jazeera , offering “ a stark alternative to terrestrial channels , ” as reported by the London Financial Times .
In the 105 countries lacking our efficient modalities of self - censorship , people could see what was happening hourly , and the impact is said to be very great .
In the US , the New York Times reports , “ the near - total blackout …is no doubt related to the sharp criticism Al Jazeera received from the United States government during the initial stages of the war in Iraq for its coverage of the American invasion . ”
Cheney and Rumsfeld objected , so , obviously , the independent media could only obey .
27
There is much sober debate about what the attackers hoped to achieve .
Some of objectives are commonly discussed , among them , restoring what is called “ the deterrent capacity ” that Israel lost as a result of its failures in Lebanon in 2006 – that is , the capacity to terrorize any potential opponent into submission .
There are , however , more fundamental objectives that tend be ignored , though they seem fairly obvious when we take a look at recent history .
Israel abandoned Gaza in September 2005 .
Rational Israeli hardliners , like Ariel Sharon , the patron saint of the settlers movement , understood that it was senseless to subsidize a few thousand illegal Israeli settlers in the ruins of Gaza , protected by a large part of the IDF while they used much of the land and scarce resources .
It made more sense to turn all of Gaza into the world ’s largest prison and to transfer settlers to the West Bank , much more valuable territory , where Israel is quite explicit about its intentions , in word and more importantly in deed .
One goal is to annex the arable land , water supplies , and pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that lie within the separation wall , irrelevantly declared illegal by the World Court .
That includes a vastly expanded Jerusalem , in violation of Security Council orders that go back 40 years , also irrelevant .
Israel has also been taking over the Jordan Valley , about one - third of the West Bank .
What remains is therefore imprisoned , and , furthermore , broken into fragments by salients of Jewish settlement that trisect the territory : one to the east of Greater Jerusalem through the town of Ma’aleh Adumim , developed through the Clinton years to split the West Bank ; and two to the north , through the towns of Ariel and Kedumim .
What remains to Palestinians is segregated by hundreds of mostly arbitrary checkpoints .
The checkpoints have no relation to security of Israel , nor does the wall , 28 and if intended to safeguard settlers , they are flatly illegal , as the World Court ruled definitively .
In reality , their major goal is to harass the Palestinian population and to fortify what Israeli peace activist Jeff Halper calls the “ matrix of control , ” designed to make life unbearable for the “ drugged roaches scurrying around in a bottle ” who seek to remain in their homes and land .
All of that is fair enough , because they are “ like grasshoppers compared to us ” so that their heads can be “ smashed against the boulders and walls . ”
The terminology is from the highest Israeli political and military leaders , in this case the revered “ princes . ”
And similar attitudes , even if more discretely expressed , shape policies .
29
The racist rhetoric of political and military leaders is mild as compared to the preaching of rabbinical authorities .
They are not marginal figures .
On the contrary , they are highly influential in the army and in the settler movement , which Zertal and Eldar describe for good reason as the “ lords of the land , ” with enormous impact on policy .
One of the memorable photographs from the Gaza war showed three orthodox Jews in traditional black garb with the caption “ Israelis , like these men , have come to hills near Gaza to watch their forces pound the Palestinian enclave in an attempt to stop Hamas rocket attacks ” ( an attempt to which we return .
The story describes how Israelis , orthodox and secular , come to the hilltops that have “ become the war ’s peanut gallery , … some with lunches and portable radios tuned to the latest reports of the battle raging in front of them , [ some ] to egg on friends and family members in the fight , [ some ] shouting ` Bravo , Bravo ! , ” as they watch the exploding bombs hardly able to contain their glee , some with their binoculars and lawn chairs .
criticizing the Israeli attackers for hitting the wrong targets , much like fans at sporting events who criticize the coach .30
Soldiers fighting in northern Gaza were afforded an “ inspirational ” visit from two leading rabbis , who explained to them that there are no “ innocents ” in Gaza , so everyone there is a legitimate target , quoting a famous passage from Psalms calling on the Lord to seize the infants of Israel ’s oppressors and dash them against the rocks .
The rabbis were breaking no new ground .
A year earlier , the former chief Sephardic rabbi wrote to Prime Minister Olmert , informing him that all civilians in Gaza are collectively guilty for rocket attacks , so that there is “ absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during a potential massive military offensive on Gaza aimed at stopping the rocket launchings , ” as the Jerusalem Post reported his ruling .
His son , chief rabbi of Safed , elaborated : “ If they do n’t stop after we kill 100 , then we must kill a thousand , and if they do not stop after 1,000 then we must kill 10,000 .
If they still do n’t stop we must kill 100,000 , even a million .
Whatever it takes to make them stop . ”
31
Similar views are expressed by prominent American intellectuals .
When Israel invaded Lebanon in 2006 , Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz explained in the liberal online journal Huffington Post that all Lebanese are legitimate targets of Israeli violence .
Lebanon ’s citizens are “ paying the price ” for supporting “ terrorism ” – that is , for supporting resistance to Israel ’s invasion .
Accordingly , the vast majority of Lebanese civilians are no more immune to attack than Austrians who supported the Nazis .
The fatwa of the Sephardic rabbi applies to them .
In a video on the Jerusalem Post website , Dershowitz went on to ridicule talk of excessive kill ratios of Palestinians to Israelis : they should be increased to 1000 to one , he said , or even 1000 to zero , meaning that the brutes should be completely exterminated .
Of course , he is referring to “ terrorists , ” a broad category that includes the victims of Israeli power , since “ Israel never targets civilians , ” he emphatically declared .
It follows that Palestinians , Lebanese , Tunisians , in fact anyone who gets in the way of the ruthless armies of the Holy State is a terrorist , or an accidental victim of their just crimes .
32
It is not easy to find historical counterparts to these performances .
It is perhaps of some interest that they elicit virtually no censure and are thus apparently considered entirely appropriate in the reigning intellectual and moral culture – when they are produced on “ our side , ” that is .
From the mouths of official enemies such words would elicit righteous outrage and calls for massive preemptive violence to punish the villains .
The claim that “ our side ” never targets civilians is familiar doctrine in violent states .
And there is some truth to it .
Powerful states , like the United States , do not generally try to kill particular civilians .
Rather , they carry out murderous actions that they and their educated classes know will slaughter many civilians , but without specific intent to kill particular ones .
In law , the routine practices might fall under the category of depraved indifference , but that is not an adequate designation for standard imperial practice and doctrine .
It is more similar to walking down a street knowing that we might kill ants , but without intent to do so , because they rank so low that it just does n’t matter .
Thus Clinton ’s bombing of the main pharmaceutical plant in a poor African country ( Sudan ) might be expected to lead to the deaths of tens of thousands of people , as it apparently did .
But since we did not aim at particular ones , there is no guilt , Western moralists assure us .
And the same holds in much more extreme cases , which are all too easy to enumerate .
The same is true when Israel carries out actions that it knows will kill the “ grasshoppers ” and “ drugged roaches ” who happen to infest the lands it “ liberates . ”
There is no good term for this form of moral depravity , arguably worse than deliberate slaughter , and all too familiar .
In the former Palestine , the rightful owners ( by divine decree , according to the “ lords of the land ” ) may decide to grant the drugged roaches a few scattered parcels .
Not by right , however : “ I believed , and to this day still believe , in our people ’s eternal and historic right to this entire land , ” Prime Minister Olmert informed a joint session of Congress in May 2006 to rousing applause .
At the same time he announced his “ convergence ” program for taking over what is valuable in the West Bank , as outlined earlier , leaving the Palestinians to rot in isolated cantons .
He was not specific about the borders of the “ entire land , ” but then , the Zionist enterprise never has been , for good reasons : permanent expansion is an important internal dynamic .
If Olmert was still faithful to his origins in Likud , he might have meant both sides of the Jordan , including the current state of Jordan , at least valuable parts of it , though the 1999 Likud Charter – the program of current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu – is ambiguous .
It declares that “ the Jordan Valley and the territories that dominate it shall be under Israeli sovereignty . ”
What “ dominates ” the Jordan Valley is not defined , but it certainly includes everything to the West of the Jordan , the former Palestine , to remain under Israeli sovereignty .
Within that territory there can never be a Palestinian state and settlement must be unconstrained , the Charter declares , since “ Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel . ”
For Olmert and his Likud successor , our people ’s “ eternal and historic right to this entire land ” contrasts dramatically with the lack of any right of self - determination for the temporary visitors , the Palestinians .
As noted earlier , the lack of any such right was reiterated by Israel and its patron in Washington in December 2008 , in their usual isolation and accompanied by the usual resounding silence .
33
The plans that Olmert sketched in 2006 were later abandoned as not sufficiently extreme .
But what replaces the convergence program , and the actions that proceed daily to implement it , are approximately the same in general conception .
In 2008 , West Bank settlement construction rose by 60 % , according to a report by Peace Now , which monitors settlement .
Housing starts in West Bank settlements rose by 46 % over the previous year , while they declined in Tel Aviv by 29 % and in Jerusalem by 14 % .
Peace
Now reported further that some 6000 new units had been approved with 58,000 waiting approval : “ If all the plans are realized , ” the report said , “ the number of settlers in the territories will be doubled . ”
There are many ways to expand the settlement project without eliciting protest from the paymasters in Washington , for example , setting up an “ outpost ” that is later linked to the national electricity and water grids and over time slowly becomes a settlement or a town .
Or simply by expanding the “ rings of land ” around a settlement for alleged security reasons , seizing Palestinian lands , all processes that continue .
34
These devices , which have roots in the pre-state period , trace back to the earliest days of the occupation , when the basic idea was formulated poetically by Defense Minister Moshe Dayan , who was in charge of the occupied territories : “ the situation today resembles the complex relationship between a Bedouin man and the girl he kidnaps against his will …
You Palestinians , as a nation , do n’t want us today , but we ’ll change your attitude by forcing our presence on you . ”
You will “ live like dogs , and whoever will leave , will leave , ” while we take what we want .
35
That these programs are criminal has never been in doubt .
Immediately after the 1967 war , the Israeli government was informed by its highest legal authority , Teodor Meron , that “ civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention , ” the foundation of international humanitarian law .
Israel ’s Justice Minister concurred .
Dayan conceded that “ Settling Israelis in occupied territories contravenes , as is known , international conventions , but there is nothing essentially new in that , ” so the issue can be dismissed .
The World Court unanimously endorsed Meron ’s conclusion in 2004 , and the Israeli High Court technically agreed while disagreeing in practice , in its usual style .
36
In the West Bank , Israel can pursue its criminal programs with US support and no disturbance , thanks to its effective military control and by now the cooperation of the collaborationist Palestinian security forces armed and trained by the US and allied dictatorships .
It can also carry out regular assassinations and other crimes , while settlers rampage under IDF protection .
But while the West Bank has been effectively subdued by terror , there is still resistance in the other half of Palestine , the Gaza Strip .
That too must be quelled for the US - Israeli programs of annexation and destruction of Palestine to proceed undisturbed .
Hence the invasion of Gaza .
The timing of the invasion was widely assumed to be influenced by the coming Israeli election .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak of the centrist Labor Party , who was lagging badly in the polls , gained one parliamentary seat for every 40 Arabs killed in the early days of the slaughter , Israeli commentator Ran HaCohen calculated .37
That changed , however .
The Israeli far right gained substantially from the invasion , though as the crimes passed beyond what the carefully honed Israeli propaganda campaign was able to suppress , even confirmed supporters of the invasion became concerned about the way the outside world was perceiving Israel ’s just war .
The highly regarded political scientist and historian Shlomo Avineri offered an analysis of these “ critical differences of opinion ” between Israel and outsiders .
Among the causes , he explained , were “ the harsh images — a consequence of the firepower Israel used , as magnified by the media — as well as disinformation and , undoubtedly , plain old hatred of Israel . ”
But he discerned a deeper reason : “ the name given to the operation , which greatly affects the way in which it will be perceived .
Israelis associate the Hebrew for Cast Lead , as the operation was called , with a line written by poet Haim Nahman Bialik that is part of a Hanukkah song typically sung by cute little children .
The fact that the operation began around Hanukkah sharpened that association .
Abroad , however , it was seen differently .
In English , not to mention German , Cast Lead has a whole other association .
Lead is cast into bullets , bombs and mortar shells .
When the world reported on Cast Lead it sounded militaristic , brutal and aggressive ; it was associated with death and destruction rather than spinning dreidels .
Even before the first shot was fired or the first speech explaining Israel ’s case was made , the operation had already acquired an image of belligerence , ” a terrible failure of Israeli hasbara .
Perhaps it should have been called something more gentle , Avineri felt , “ like the Gates of Gaza , which also has a historical ring to it .
” 38
Other war supporters warned that the carnage is “ Destroying [ Israel ’s ] soul and its image .
Destroying it on world television screens , in the living rooms of the international community and most importantly , in Obama ’s America ” ( Ari Shavit ) .
Shavit was particularly concerned about Israel ’s “ shelling a United Nations facility …on the day when the UN secretary general is visiting Jerusalem , ” an act that is “ beyond lunacy , ” he felt .39
Adding a few details , the “ facility ” was the UN compound in Gaza City , which contained the UNRWA warehouse .
The shelling destroyed “ hundreds of tons of emergency food and medicines set for distribution today to shelters , hospitals and feeding centres , ” according to UNRWA director John Ging .
Military strikes at the same time destroyed two floors of the al - Quds hospital , setting it ablaze , and also a second warehouse run by the Palestinian Red Crescent society .
The hospital in the densely - populated Tal - Hawa neighbourhood was destroyed by Israeli tanks “ after hundreds of frightened Gazans had taken shelter inside as Israeli ground forces pushed into the neighbourhood , ” Al - Jazeera reported .
There was nothing left to salvage inside the smoldering ruins of the hospital .
“ They shelled the building , the hospital building , ” paramedic Ahmad Al - Haz told AP .
“ It caught fire .
We tried to evacuate the sick people and the injured and the people who were there .
Firefighters arrived and put out the fire , which burst into flames again and they put it out again and it came back for the third time . ”
It was suspected that the blaze might have been set by white phosphorus , also suspected in numerous other fires and serious burn injuries .
40
The suspicions were confirmed by Amnesty International after the cessation of the intense bombardment made inquiry possible .
Israel had sensibly barred all journalists , even Israeli , while its crimes were proceeding in full fury .
Israel ’s use of white phosphorus against Gaza civilians is “ clear and undeniable , ” AI reported , condemning its repeated use in densely populated civilian areas as “ a war crime . ”
AI investigators found white phosphorus edges scattered around residential buildings , still burning , “ further endangering the residents and their property , ” particularly children “ drawn to the detritus of war and often unaware of the danger . ”
Primary targets , they report , were the UNRWA compound , where the Israeli “ white phosphorus landed next to some fuel trucks and caused a large fire which destroyed tons of humanitarian aid ” after Israeli authorities “ had given assurance that no further strikes would be launched on the compound . ”
On the same day , “ a white phosphorus shell landed in the al - Quds hospital in Gaza City also causing a fire which forced hospital staff to evacuate the patients …
White phosphorus landing on skin can burn deep through muscle and into the bone , continuing to burn unless deprived of oxygen . ”
Whether purposely intended or beyond depraved indifference , such crimes are inevitable when the weapon is used in attacks on civilians .
41
The white phosphorus shells were US - made , AI reported .
In a report reviewing use of weapons in Gaza , AI concluded that Israel used US - supplied weapons in “ serious violations of international humanitarian law , ” and called on “ the U.N. Security Council to impose an immediate and comprehensive arms embargo on the Jewish state . ” 42 Though conscious US complicity is hardly in doubt , it is excluded from the call for punishment by the analogue of the “ too big to fail ” doctrine .
It is , however , a mistake to concentrate too much on Israel ’s severe violations of jus in bello , the laws designed to bar wartime practices that are too savage .
The invasion itself is a far more serious crime .
And if Israel had inflicted horrendous damage by bows and arrows , it would still be a criminal act of extreme depravity .
It is also a mistake to focus attention on specific targets .
The campaign was far more ambitious in scope .
Its goal was “ the destruction of all means of life , ” officials warned .
A large part of the agricultural land was destroyed , some perhaps permanently , along with poultry , livestock , greenhouses , orchards , creating a major food crisis , the World Food Program reported .
The IDF also targeted the Ministry of Agriculture and “ the offices of the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees in Zaitoun — which provides cheap food for the poor – ransacked and vandalised by soldiers who left abusive graffiti . ”
Large areas were flattened by bulldozers .
Beyond “ the physical damage done by Israeli bulldozers , bombing and shelling , land has been contaminated by munitions , including white phosphorus , burst sewerage pipes , animal carcasses and even asbestos used in roofing .
In many places , the damage is extreme .
In Jabal al - Rayas , once a thriving farming community , every building has been knocked down , and even the cattle killed and left to lie rotting in the fields . ”
Leaders of Gaza ’s business community , generally apolitical , “ say that much of the 3 per cent of industry still operating after the 18 - month shutdown caused by Israel ’s economic siege has now been destroyed ” by Israeli forces using “ aerial bombing , tank shelling and armoured bulldozers to eliminate the productive capacity of some of Gaza ’s most important manufacturing plants , ” destroying or severely damaging 219 factories , according to Palestinian industrialists.43
To impede potential recovery , the IDF attacked universities , largely destroying the agriculture faculty at al - Azhar university ( considered pro-Fatah , Washington ’s favored faction ) , Al - Da’wa College for Humanities in Rafah , and the Gaza College for Security Sciences .
Six university buildings in Gaza were razed to the ground and 16 damaged .
Two of those destroyed housed the science and engineering laboratories of the Islamic University in Gaza .
44
The pretext was that they contributed to Hamas military activities .
By the same principle , Israeli ( and US ) universities are legitimate targets of large - scale terror .
There were occasional reports of the Israeli navy firing on fishing boats , but these conceal what appears to be a systematic campaign in recent years to drive the fishing industry towards shore – thereby destroying it , because the vast pollution caused by Israel ’s destruction of power stations and sewage facilities makes fishing impossible near shore .
Citing recent incidents , the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights in Gaza , which has been a highly reliable source , “ strongly condemn[ed ] the continuous escalation of the IOF [ Israeli Occupation Forces ] offensive against Palestinian civilians , including fishermen . ”
International human rights observers report regular attacks on fishing vessels in Gazan territorial waters .
Accompanying Palestinian fishers , they report having “ witnessed countless acts of Israeli military aggression against them whilst in Gazan territorial waters , despite a six - month ceasefire agreement holding at the time , ” and now again after the January ceasefire .
“ Gaza ’s 40,000 fishermen have been deprived of their livelihood ” by Israel naval attacks , Gideon Levy reported from the bedside of a 19 - year - old Gaza fisherman , severely wounded by Israeli gunboats who attacked his boat without warning near the Gaza shore on October 5 , a month before the ceasefire was broken by Israel ’s invasion of Gaza , events to which we return .
“ Every few days the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) publishes reports from its volunteers in Gaza about attacks on fishermen .
Sometimes the naval boats ram the wretched craft , sometimes the sailors use high - pressure water hoses on the fishermen , hurtling them into the sea , and sometimes they open lethal fire on them , ” Levy reported .
45
The international observers report that attacks on fishing boats began after the discovery of quite promising natural gas fields by the BG Group in 2000 , in Gaza ’s territorial waters .
The regular attacks gradually drove fishing boats towards shore , not by official order but by threat and violence .
Oil industry journals and the Israeli business press report that Israel ’s state - owned Israel Electric Corp. is negotiating “ for as much as 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Marine field located off the Mediterranean coast of the Palestinian controlled Gaza Strip . ”
It is hard to suppress the thought that the Gaza invasion may be related to the project of stealing these valuable resources from Palestine , which cannot take part in the negotiations .
46
Aggression always has a pretext : in this case , that Israel ’s patience had “ run out ” in the face of Hamas rocket attacks , as Ehud Barak put it .
The mantra that is endlessly repeated is that Israel has the right to use force to defend itself .
The thesis is partially defensible .
The rocketing is criminal , and it is true that a state has the right to defend itself against criminal attacks .
But it does not follow that it has a right to defend itself by force .
That goes far beyond any principle that we would or should accept .
Putin had no right to use force in response to Chechen terror – and his resort to force is not justified by the fact that he achieved results so far beyond what the US achieved in Iraq that if General Petraeus had approached them , he might have been crowned king .
47 Nazi Germany had no right to use force to defend itself against the terrorism of the partisans .
Kristallnacht was not justified by Herschel Grynszpan ’s assassination of a German Embassy official in Paris .
The British were not justified in using force to defend themselves against the ( very real ) terror of the American colonists seeking independence , or to terrorize Irish Catholics in response to IRA terror – and when they finally turned to the sensible policy of addressing legitimate grievances , the terror virtually ended .
It is not a matter of “ proportionality , ” but of choice of action in the first place :
Is there an alternative to violence ?
In all of these cases , there plainly was , so the resort to force had no justification whatsoever .
Any resort to force carries a heavy burden of proof , and we have to ask whether it can be met in the case of Israel ’s effort to quell any resistance to its daily criminal actions in Gaza and in the West Bank , where they still continue relentlessly after more than 40 years .
Perhaps I may quote myself in an interview in the Israeli press on the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance : “ We should recall that Gaza and the West Bank are recognized to be a unit , so that if resistance to Israel ’s destructive and illegal programs is legitimate within the West Bank ( and it would be interesting to see a rational argument to the contrary ) , then it is legitimate in Gaza as well . ”
48
Palestinian - American journalist Ali Abunimah observed that “ There are no rockets launched at Israel from the West Bank , and yet Israel ’s extrajudicial killings , land theft , settler pogroms and kidnappings never stopped for a day during the truce .
The western - backed Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas has acceded to all Israel ’s demands .
Under the proud eye of United States military advisors , Abbas has assembled `security forces ’ to fight the resistance on Israel ’s behalf .
None of that has spared a single Palestinian in the West Bank from Israel ’s relentless colonization ” – thanks to firm US backing .
The respected Palestinian parliamentarian Dr. Mustapha Barghouti adds that after Bush ’s Annapolis extravaganza in November 2007 , with much uplifting rhetoric about dedication to peace and justice , Israeli attacks on Palestinians escalated in the West Bank , along with a sharp increase in settlements and Israeli check points .
Obviously these criminal actions are not a response to rockets from Gaza , though the converse may well be the case .
49
The actions of people resisting brutal occupation can be condemned as criminal and politically foolish , but those who offer no alternative have no moral standing to issue such judgments .
The conclusion holds with particular force for Americans who choose to be directly implicated in Israel ’s ongoing crimes — by their words , their actions , or their silence .
All the more so because there are very clear non-violent alternatives – which , however , have the disadvantage that they bar the programs of illegal expansion that the US strongly supports in practice , while occasionally issuing a mild admonition that they are “ unhelpful . ”
50
Israel has straightforward means to defend itself : put an end to its criminal actions in occupied territories , and accept the long - standing international consensus on a two - state settlement that has been blocked by the US and Israel for over 30 years , since the US first vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for a political settlement in these terms in 1976 .
I will not once again run through the inglorious record , but it is important to be aware that US - Israeli rejectionism today is even more blatant than in the past .
The Arab League has gone even beyond the consensus , calling for full normalization of relations with Israel .
Hamas has repeatedly called for a two - state settlement in terms of the international consensus .
Iran and Hezbollah have made it clear that they will abide by any agreement that Palestinians accept .51
One can seek ambiguities and incompleteness , but not in the case of the US - Israel , which remain in splendid isolation , not only in words .
The more detailed record is informative .
The Palestinian National Council formally accepted the international consensus in 1988 .
The response of the Shamir - Peres coalition government , affirmed by James Baker ’s State Department , was that there cannot be an “ additional Palestinian state ” between Israel and Jordan – the latter already a Palestinian state by US - Israeli dictate .
The Oslo accords that followed explicitly put to the side potential Palestinian national rights : the Declaration of Principles signed with much fanfare on the White House lawn in September 1993 referred only to UN 242 , which grants nothing to the Palestinians , while pointedly ignoring subsequent UN declarations , all blocked by Washington , which respect Palestinian national rights .
The threat that these rights might be realized in some meaningful form was systematically undermined through the Oslo years by Israel ’s steady expansion of illegal settlements , with US support .
Settlement accelerated in 2000 , President Clinton ’s and Prime Minister Barak ’s last year , when negotiations took place at Camp David against that background .
After blaming Yassir Arafat for the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations , Clinton backtracked , and recognized that the US - Israeli proposals were too extreme to be acceptable to any Palestinian .
In December 2000 , he presented his “ parameters , ” vague but more forthcoming .
He then announced that both sides had accepted the parameters , while both expressed reservations .
The two sides met in Taba Egypt in January 2001 – four months after the outbreak of the intifida — and came very close to an agreement .
They would have been able to do so in a few more days , they said in their final press conference .
But the negotiations were cancelled prematurely by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
That week in Taba is the one break in over 30 years of US - Israeli rejectionism .
There is no reason why that one break in the record cannot be resumed .
52
The preferred version , reiterated by Ethan Bronner , is that “ Many abroad recall Mr. Barak as the prime minister who in 2000 went further than any Israeli leader in peace offers to the Palestinians , only to see the deal fail and explode in a violent Palestinian uprising [ the intifada ] that drove him from power . ”
It is quite true that “ many abroad ” believe this deceitful fairy tale , thanks to what Bronner and too many of his colleagues call “ journalism .
”
53
It is commonly claimed that a two - state solution is now unattainable because if the IDF tried to remove settlers , it would lead to a civil war .
That may be true , but much more argument is needed .
Without resorting to force to expel illegal settlers , the IDF could simply withdraw to whatever boundaries are established by negotiations .
The settlers beyond those boundaries would have the choice of leaving their subsidized homes to return to subsidized homes in Israel , or to remain under Palestinian authority .
The same was true of the carefully staged “ national trauma ” in Gaza in 2005 , so transparently fraudulent that it was ridiculed by Israeli commentators .
It would have sufficed for Israel to announce that the IDF would withdraw , and the settlers who were subsidized to enjoy their life in Gaza would have quietly climbed into the lorries provided to them and travelled to their new subsidized residences in the other occupied territories .
But that would not have produced tragic photos of agonized children and passionate calls of “ never again , ” thus providing a welcome propaganda cover for the real purpose of the partial “ disengagement ” : expansion of illegal settlement in the rest of the occupied territories .
54
To summarize , contrary to the claim that is constantly reiterated , Israel has no right to use force to defend itself against rockets from Gaza , even if they are regarded as terrorist crimes .
Furthermore , the reasons are transparent .
The pretext for launching the attack is without merit .
There is also a narrower question .
Does Israel have peaceful short - term alternatives to the use of force in response to rockets from Gaza .
One such alternative would be to accept a ceasefire .
Sometimes Israel has formally done so , while quickly violating it .
The most recent and currently relevant case is June 2008 .
The ceasefire called for opening the border crossings to “ allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza . ”
Israel formally agreed , but immediately announced that it would not abide by the agreement and open the borders until Hamas released Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in June 2006.55
After the Gaza invasion , Israel continued to reject Hamas proposals of a ceasefire and long - term truce , again citing the capture of Shalit .
Partly on the same grounds , it refused to permit any reconstruction , even the import of macaroni , crayons , tomato paste , lentils , soap , toilet paper , and other such weapons of mass destruction – eliciting some polite queries from Washington .56
The steady drumbeat of accusations about the capture of Shalit is , again , blatant hypocrisy , even putting aside Israel ’s long history of kidnapping .
In this case , the hypocrisy could not be more glaring .
One day before Hamas captured Shalit , Israeli soldiers entered Gaza City and kidnapped two civilians , the Muamar brothers , bringing them to Israel to join the thousands of other prisoners held there , hundreds reportedly without charge .
Kidnapping civilians is a far more serious crime than capturing a soldier of an attacking army , but as is the norm , it was barely reported in contrast to the furor over Shalit .
And all that remains in memory , blocking peace , is the capture of Shalit , another illustration of the depth of imperial mentality in the West .
Shalit should be returned – in a fair prisoner exchange .
57
It was after the capture of Shalit that Israel ’s unrelenting military attack against Gaza passed from merely vicious to truly sadistic .
But it is well to recall that even before his capture , Israel had fired more than 7,700 shells at northern Gaza after its September withdrawal , eliciting virtually no comment .
58
After immediately rejecting the June 2008 ceasefire it had formally accepted , Israel maintained its siege .
We may recall that a siege is an act of war .
In fact , Israel has always insisted on an even stronger principle : hampering access to the outside world , even well short of a siege , is an act of war , justifying massive violence in response .
Interference with Israel ’s passage through the Straits of Tiran was a large part of the justification offered for Israel ’s invasion of Egypt ( with France and England ) in 1956 , and for its launching of the June 1967 war .
The siege of Gaza is total , not partial , apart from occasional willingness of the occupiers to relax it slightly .
And it is vastly more harmful to Gazans than closing the Straits of Tiran was to Israel .
Supporters of Israeli doctrines and actions should therefore have no problem justifying rocket attacks on Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip .
Of course , again we run into the nullifying principle :
This is us , that is them .
Israel not only maintained the siege after June 2008 , but did so with extreme rigor .
It even prevented UNRWA from replenishing its stores , “ so when the ceasefire broke down , we ran out of food for the 750,000 who depend on us , ” UNRWA director John Ging informed the BBC.59
Despite the Israeli siege , rocketing sharply reduced .
According to the spokesperson for the Prime Minister , Mark Regev , there was not a single Hamas rocket among the few that were launched from the onset of the June 2008 ceasefire until November 4 , when Israel violated it still more egregiously with a raid into Gaza , leading to the death of 6 Palestinians and a retaliatory barrage of rockets ( with no injuries ) .
The raid was on the evening of the US presidential elections , when attention was focused elsewhere .
The pretext for the raid was that Israel had detected a tunnel in Gaza that might have been intended for use to capture another Israeli soldier ; a “ ticking tunnel ” in official communiques .
The pretext was transparently absurd , as a number of commentators noted .
If such a tunnel existed , and reached the border , Israel could easily have barred it right there .
But as usual , the ludicrous Israeli pretext was deemed credible , and the timing was overlooked .
60
What was the reason for the Israeli raid ?
We have no internal evidence about Israeli planning , but we do know that the raid came shortly before scheduled Hamas - Fatah talks in Cairo aimed at “ reconciling their differences and creating a single , unified government , ” British correspondent Rory McCarthy reported .
That was to be the first Fatah - Hamas meeting since the June 2007 civil war that left Hamas in control of Gaza , and would have been a significant step towards advancing diplomatic efforts .
There is a long history of Israel provocations to deter the threat of diplomacy , some already mentioned .
This may have been another one .
61
The civil war that left Hamas in control of Gaza is commonly described as a Hamas military coup , demonstrating again their evil nature .
The real world a little different .
The civil war was incited by the US and Israel , in a crude attempt at a military coup to overturn the free elections that brought Hamas to power .
That has been public knowledge at least since April 2008 , when David Rose published a detailed and documented account of how Bush , Rice , and Deputy National - Security Adviser Elliott Abrams “ backed an armed force under Fatah strongman Muhammad Dahlan , touching off a bloody civil war in Gaza and leaving Hamas stronger than ever . ”
The account was corroborated by Norman Olsen , who served for 26 years in the Foreign Service , including four years working in the Gaza Strip and four years at the US Embassy in Tel Aviv , and then moved on to become associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the Department of State .
Olson and his son detail the State Department shenanigans intended to ensure that their candidate , Abbas , would win in the January 2006 elections – in which case it would have been hailed as a triumph of democracy .
After the election - fixing failed , the US and Israel turned to the punishment of Palestinians for voting the wrong way , and began arming a militia run by Fatah strong - man Muhammad Dahlan .
But “ Dahlan ’s thugs moved too soon , ” the Olsons write , and a Hamas pre-emptive strike undermined the coup attempt .
62
The Party Line is more convenient .
The US - Israel responded to the failed coup attempt by introducing far harsher measures to punish the people of Gaza , and to ensure that that the plague of disobedience would not spread to the rest of Palestine .
Together with Jordan , the US undertook to arm and train more efficient Palestinian “ security force ” to maintain order in the West Bank , under the direction of US General Keith Dayton .
Israeli military officers participate as well , Ethan Bronner reported in the New York Times , describing how “ An Israeli officer inaugurated the firing range here , shooting a Palestinian weapon to test it and give his seal of approval . ”
The major achievement of the new paramilitary force , Bronner elaborated , was to have “ maintained tight order ” to prevent any kind of “ uprising ” – that is , significant show of sympathy and support – while Israel slaughtered Palestinians in Gaza and reduced much of it to rubble .
The effective performance of these forces also impressed Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair John Kerry .
In his address to the Brookings Institution , he spoke eloquently of “ the need to give the Israelis a legitimate partner for peace , ” which they evidently lacked during the decades of unilateral US - Israeli rejection of the international consensus on a peace settlement , which the Palestinian Liberation Organization supported , along with the Arab states ( and the world , outside the US - Israel ) .
We must overcome this failure , Kerry explained , suggesting several ways to weaken the elected government and strengthen our man Mahmoud Abbas .
“ Most importantly , ” Kerry went on , “ this means strengthening General Dayton ’s efforts to train Palestinian security forces that can keep order and fight terror …
Recent developments have been extremely encouraging : During the invasion of Gaza , Palestinian Security Forces largely succeeded in maintaining calm in the West Bank amidst widespread expectations of civil unrest .
Obviously , more remains to be done , but we can help do it .
” 63
So we can .
The US has had a century of rich experience in developing paramilitary and police forces to pacify conquered populations and to impose the structure of a long - lasting coercive security state that undermines nationalist and popular aspirations and sustains obedience to the wealthy classes and their foreign associates .
64
After Israel broke the June 2008 ceasefire ( such as it was ) in November , the siege was tightened further , with even more disastrous consequences for the population .
According to Sara Roy , the leading academic specialist on Gaza , “ On Nov. 5 , Israel sealed all crossing points into Gaza , vastly reducing and at times denying food supplies , medicines , fuel , cooking gas , and parts for water and sanitation systems ” “ During November , an average of 4.6 trucks of food per day entered Gaza from Israel compared with an average of 123 trucks per day in October .
Spare parts for the repair and maintenance of water - related equipment have been denied entry for over a year .
The World Health Organization just reported that half of Gaza ’s ambulances are now out of order ” – and the rest soon became targets for Israeli attack .
Gaza ’s only power station was forced to suspend operation for lack of fuel , and could not be started up again because they needed spare parts , which had been sitting in the Israeli port of Ashdod for 8 months .
Shortage of electricity led to a 300 % increase in burn cases at Shifaa ’ hospital in the Gaza Strip , resulting from efforts to light wood fires .
Israel barred shipment of Chlorine , so that by mid-December in Gaza City and the north access to water was limited to six hours every three days .
The human consequences are not counted among Palestinian victims of Israeli terror .65
After the November 4 Israeli attack , both sides escalated violence ( all deaths were Palestinian ) until the ceasefire formally ended on Dec. 19 , and Prime Minister Olmert authorized the full - scale invasion .
A few days earlier Hamas had proposed to return to the original July ceasefire agreement , which Israel had not observed .
Historian and former Carter administration high official Robert Pastor passed the proposal to a “ senior official ” in the IDF , but Israel did not respond .
The head of Shin Bet , Israel ’s internal security agency , was quoted in Israeli sources on December 21 as saying that Hamas is interested in continuing the “ calm ” with Israel , while its military wing is continuing preparations for conflict .
“ There clearly was an alternative to the military approach to stopping the rockets , ” Pastor said , keeping to the narrow issue of Gaza .
There was also a more far - reaching alternative , which is rarely discussed : namely , accepting a political settlement including all of the occupied territories .
66
Israel ’s senior diplomatic correspondent Akiva Eldar reports that shortly before Israel launched its full - scale invasion on Saturday Dec. 27 , “ Hamas politburo chief Khaled Meshal announced on the Iz al - Din al - Qassam Web site that he was prepared not only for a `cessation of aggression ’ — he proposed going back to the arrangement at the Rafah crossing as of 2005 , before Hamas won the elections and later took over the region .
That arrangement was for the crossing to be managed jointly by Egypt , the European Union , the Palestinian Authority presidency and Hamas , ” and as noted earlier , called for opening of the crossings to desperately needed supplies .
67
A standard claim of the more vulgar apologists for Israeli violence is that in the case of the current assault , “ as in so many instances in the past half century – the Lebanon War of 1982 , the ` Iron Fist ’ response to the 1988 intifada , the Lebanon War of 2006 – the Israelis have reacted to intolerable acts of terror with a determination to inflict terrible pain , to teach the enemy a lesson .
The civilian suffering and deaths are inevitable ; the lessons less so ” ( New Yorker editor David Remnick ) .
68
The 2006 invasion can be justified only on the grounds of appalling cynicism , as already discussed .
The reference to the vicious response to the 1988 intifada is too depraved even to discuss ; a sympathetic interpretation might be that it reflects astonishing ignorance .
But Remnick ’s claim about the 1982 invasion is quite common , a remarkable feat of incessant propaganda , which merits a few reminders .
The lessons , particularly about American intellectuals , are all too easy to recognize , though hardly “ inevitable . ”
Uncontroversially , the Israel - Lebanon border was quiet for a year before the Israeli invasion , at least from Lebanon to Israel , north to south .
Through the year , the PLO scrupulously observed a US - initiated ceasefire , despite constant Israeli provocations , including bombing with many civilian casualties , presumably intended to elicit some reaction that could be used to justify Israel ’s planned invasion .
The best Israel could achieve was two light symbolic responses .
It then invaded with a pretext too absurd to be taken seriously .
The invasion had nothing to do with “ intolerable acts of terror , ” though it did have to do with intolerable acts : of diplomacy .
That has never been obscure .
Shortly after the US - backed invasion began , Israel ’s leading academic specialist on the Palestinians , Yehoshua Porath – no dove — wrote that Arafat ’s success in maintaining the ceasefire constituted “ a veritable catastrophe in the eyes of the Israeli government , ” since it opened the way to a political settlement .
The government hoped that the PLO would resort to terrorism , undermining the threat that it would be “ a legitimate negotiating partner for future political accommodations . ”
The facts were well - understood in Israel , and not concealed .
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir stated that Israel went to war because there was “ a terrible danger …
Not so much a military one as a political one , ” prompting the fine Israeli satirist B. Michael to write that “ the lame excuse of a military danger or a danger to the Galilee is dead . ”
We “ have removed the political danger ” by striking first , in time ; now , “ Thank God , there is no one to talk to . ”
Historian Benny Morris recognized that the PLO had observed the ceasefire , and explained that “ the war ’s inevitability rested on the PLO as a political threat to Israel and to Israel ’s hold on the occupied territories . ”
Others have frankly acknowledged the unchallenged facts .
69
In a front - page think piece on the latest Gaza invasion , NYT correspondent Steven Lee Meyers writes that “ In some ways , the Gaza attacks were reminiscent of the gamble Israel took , and largely lost , in Lebanon in 1982 [ when ] it invaded to eliminate the threat of Yasir Arafat ’s forces . ”
Correct , but not in the sense he has in mind .
In 1982 , as in 2008 , it was necessary to eliminate the threat of political settlement .70
The hope of Israeli propagandists has been that Western intellectuals and media would buy the tale that Israel reacted to rockets raining on the Galilee , “ intolerable acts of terror . ”
And they have not been disappointed .
It is not that Israel does not want peace : everyone wants peace , even Hitler .
The question is : on what terms ?
From its origins , the Zionist movement has understood that to achieve its goals , the best strategy would be to delay political settlement , meanwhile slowly building facts on the ground .
Even the occasional agreements , as in 1947 , were regarded by the leadership as temporary steps towards further expansion .
71 The 1982 Lebanon war was a dramatic example of the desperate fear of diplomacy .
It was followed by Israeli support for Hamas so as to undermine the secular PLO and its irritating peace initiatives .
Another case that should be familiar is Israeli provocations before the 1967 war designed to elicit a Syrian response that could be used as a pretext for violence and takeover of more land – at least 80 % of the incidents , according to Defense Minister Moshe Dayan.72
The story goes far back .
The official history of the Haganah , the pre-state Jewish military force , describes the assassination of the religious Jewish poet Jacob de Haan in 1924 , accused of conspiring for an accommodation between the traditional Jewish community ( the Old Yishuv ) and the Arab Higher Committee .
And there have been numerous examples since .
73
The effort to delay political accommodation has always made perfect sense , as do the accompanying lies about how “ there is no partner for peace . ”
It is hard to think of another way to take over land where you are not wanted .
Similar reasons underlie Israel ’s preference for expansion over security .
Its violation of the ceasefire on November 4 , 2008 is one of many recent examples .
When Israel broke the June 2008 ceasefire on Nov. 4 , Amnesty International reported that the June 2008 ceasefire “ has brought enormous improvements in the quality of life in Sderot and other Israeli villages near Gaza , where before the ceasefire residents lived in fear of the next Palestinian rocket strike .
However , nearby in the Gaza Strip the Israeli blockade remains in place and the population has so far seen few dividends from the ceasefire .
Since June 2007 , the entire population of 1.5 million Palestinians has been trapped in Gaza , with dwindling resources and an economy in ruins .
Some 80 percent of the population now depend on the trickle of international aid that the Israeli army allows in . ” 74
But the gains in security for Israel towns near Gaza were evidently outweighed by the felt need to deter diplomatic moves that might impede West Bank expansion , and to crush any remaining resistance within Palestine .
The preference for expansion over security has been particularly evident since Israel ’s fateful decision in 1971 , backed by Henry Kissinger , to reject the offer of a full peace treaty by President Sadat of Egypt , offering nothing to the Palestinians – an agreement that the US and Israel were compelled to accept at Camp David eight years later , after a major war that was a near disaster for Israel .
A peace treaty with Egypt would have ended any significant security threat , but there was an unacceptable quid pro quo : Israel would have had to abandon its extensive settlement programs in the northeastern Sinai .
Security was a lower priority than expansion , as it still is .75
Today , Israel could have security , normalization of relations , and integration into the region .
But it very clearly prefers illegal expansion , conflict , and repeated exercise of violence , actions that are not only criminal , murderous and destructive but are also eroding its own long - term security .
US military and Middle East specialist Andrew Cordesman writes that while Israel military force can surely crush defenseless Gaza , “ neither Israel nor the US can gain from a war that produces [ a bitter ] reaction from one of the wisest and most moderate voices in the Arab world , Prince Turki al - Faisal of Saudi Arabia , who said on January 6 that ` The Bush administration has left [ Obama ] a disgusting legacy and a reckless position towards the massacres and bloodshed of innocents in Gaza … Enough is enough , today we are all Palestinians and we seek martyrdom for God and for Palestine , following those who died in Gaza ’ .
” 76
One of the wisest voices in Israel , Uri Avnery , writes that after an Israeli military victory , “ What will be seared into the consciousness of the world will be the image of Israel as a blood - stained monster , ready at any moment to commit war crimes and not prepared to abide by any moral restraints .
This will have severe consequences for our long - term future , our standing in the world , our chance of achieving peace and quiet .
In the end , this war is a crime against ourselves too , a crime against the State of Israel . ” 77
There is good reason to believe that he is right .
Israel is deliberately turning itself into one of the most hated countries in the world , and is also losing the allegiance of the population of the West , including younger American Jews , who are unlikely to tolerate its persistent shocking crimes for long .
Decades ago , I wrote that those who call themselves “ supporters of Israel ” are in reality supporters of its moral degeneration and probable ultimate destruction .
Regrettably , that judgment looks more and more plausible .
Meanwhile we are quietly observing a rare event in history , what the late Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling called “ politicide , ” the murder of a nation — at our hands .78

Financial businesses are different from most other types of business .
They entail sending your money to someone else to look after , on the promise they will give it back to you at a later dtae , preferably with some improvement in its value .
Because of this I have always favoured two types of regulation for financial businesses .
The first applies to deposit takers .
They should be required to meet overall standards of capital and cash reserves .
The Economic Policy review I helped produce in 2007 demanded stronger requirements in these important areas , as we could see the banking sector was grossly over extended under the then current regulation , which could make it difficult for people to retrieve their deposits from some banks if many wanted to at the same time .
The second type of regulation should apply to all financial businesses .
It should be a policing system designed to find the thieves amidst the large financial community , and take early action to prevent them trading or to wind them up rapidly where theft or fraud is occurring .
Instead , what we have witnessed is a a big growth in the regulation of the many honest businesses , in the strange belief that if you put in enough complicated rules to “ prevent ” some past way of carrying out a fraud , you will prevent fraud .
This is never likely to work , because of course if someone is going to commit theft , breaking a few Regulators rules and lying to the Regulator is just a subsidiary part of the task in order to steal all the money .
Fraudsters will break regulators ’ rules as well as pocketing the cash .
I am not surprised that a large fraud may have taken place in the US .
They like the UK have box ticking regulators who create ever more rules in substitute for being detectives seeking out the mercifully small number of bad apples in the financial barrel .
The danger of the US system is the regulators concentrate on a wide range of honest businesses who fall foul of the increasingly complex rules owing to human error , disagreements about what the rules mean , and through misreading the complexity of all the process issues the regulator seeks to control .
At the same time invetsment managers can be losing their clients billions legally , and a handful can be stealing billions of their clients money without the regulator being able to see it .
When I was the UK ’s non banking financial Regulator , in the days when that role resided in the DTI , I drew up a list of things regulators should look for to try to detect crooked businssses .
I told them to concentrate on that , as I was quite sure the public , like me , primarily wanted their regulators to find the Maxwells before they had taken too much money from clients or pension funds , and stop them .
Included in my list of warning signs worthy of investigation were : returns that are too good to be true ; promised returns out of line with the asset returns they said they were buying ; frequent changes of year end and auditor ; complex company structures ; lack of independent people on the Board and at the top of organisations ; lack of independent custodian arrangements ; market rumours .
I favoued using the invetsigatory powers , in private , when our suspicions were aroused .
A public investigation , or worse still a press briefing before enough evidence had been amassed ran the risk of breaking a perfectly good business if it had good reaons for the warning sign .
In the hue and cry that will follow the Madoff case there will doubtless be the demand for yet more process regulation to “ stop ” someone else doing what it is alleged he did .
Instead the cry should go up for a detection based approach to regulation , instead of yet more box ticking for the largely compliant and the wholly honest .
People should rememnber that it is only the honest who do the box ticking honestly .
Crooks can tick boxes too , and can make up the things to put in them .
It ’s just the same with money laundering .
Money launderers doubtless have passports and gas bills .
Making sure every financial business has all its clients passport and gas bill copies does not mean the end of money laundering .
As Baldwin once observed , language is both “ a political instrument , means , and proof of power , ” and “ the most vivid and crucial key to identity : it reveals the private identity , and connects one with , or divorces one from , the larger , public , or communal identity . ”
For Mr. Obama , whose improbable life story many voters regard as the embodiment of the American Dream , identity and the relationship between the personal and the public remain crucial issues .
Indeed , “ Dreams From My Father , ” written before he entered politics , was both a searching bildungsroman and an autobiographical quest to understand his roots — a quest in which he cast himself as both a Telemachus in search of his father and an Odysseus in search of a home .
Like “ Dreams From My Father , ” many of the novels Mr. Obama reportedly admires deal with the question of identity : Toni Morrison ’s “ Song of Solomon ” concerns a man ’s efforts to discover his origins and come to terms with his roots ; Doris Lessing ’s “ Golden Notebook ” recounts a woman ’s struggles to articulate her own sense of self ; and Ellison ’s “ Invisible Man ” grapples with the difficulty of self - definition in a race - conscious America and the possibility of transcendence .
The poems of Elizabeth Alexander , whom Mr. Obama chose as his inaugural poet , probe the intersection between the private and the political , time present and time past , while the verse of Derek Walcott ( a copy of whose collected poems was recently glimpsed in Mr. Obama ’s hands ) explores what it means to be a “ divided child , ” caught on the margins of different cultures , dislocated and rootless perhaps , but free to invent a new self .
This notion of self - creation is a deeply American one — a founding principle of this country , and a trope addressed by such classic works as “ The Great Gatsby ” — and it seems to exert a strong hold on Mr. Obama ’s imagination .
In a 2005 essay in Time magazine , he wrote of the humble beginnings that he and Lincoln shared , adding that the 16th president reminded him of “ a larger , fundamental element of American life — the enduring belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams . ”
Though some critics have taken Mr. Obama to task for self - consciously italicizing parallels between himself and Lincoln , there are in fact a host of uncanny correspondences between these two former Illinois state legislators who had short stints in Congress under their belts before coming to national prominence with speeches showcasing their eloquence : two cool , self - contained men , who managed to stay calm and graceful under pressure ; two stoics embracing the virtues of moderation and balance ; two relatively new politicians who were initially criticized for their lack of experience and for questioning an invasion of a country that , in Lincoln ’s words , was “ in no way molesting , or menacing the U.S. ”
As Fred Kaplan ’s illuminating new biography ( “ Lincoln : The Biography of a Writer ” ) makes clear , Lincoln , like Mr. Obama , was a lifelong lover of books , indelibly shaped by his reading — most notably , in his case , the Bible and Shakespeare — which honed his poetic sense of language and his philosophical view of the world .
Both men employ a densely allusive prose , richly embedded with the fruit of their reading , and both use language as a tool by which to explore and define themselves .
Eventually in Lincoln ’s case , Mr. Kaplan notes , “ the tool , the toolmaker , and the tool user became inseparably one .
He became what his language made him . ”
The incandescent power of Lincoln ’s language , its resonance and rhythmic cadences , as well as his ability to shift gears between the magisterial and the down - to - earth , has been a model for Mr. Obama — who has said he frequently rereads Lincoln for inspiration — and so , too , have been the uses to which Lincoln put his superior language skills : to goad Americans to complete the unfinished work of the founders , and to galvanize a nation reeling from hard times with a new vision of reconciliation and hope .

Thousands of demonstrators marched down Market Street in San Francisco on Friday night to protest the passage earlier this week of Proposition 8 , which effectively bans same - sex marriage in California .
The march began around 5:30 p.m. , as the group worked its way west toward its final destination of Dolores Park .
A large group remained around Ninth and Market streets , holding signs , chanting and jamming traffic .
About a dozen Muni buses were stuck in the traffic mess .
" Our rights have been taken away , " said Debra Walker , a lesbian who has lived in San Francisco since 1981 .
She is a member of the city 's building inspection commission and is the past president of the Harvey Milk Club .
" I came here because of the welcoming way of San Francisco .
It is so troubling that in 2008 , this would pass .
The fear campaign was unconscionable . "
Walker stood holding a banner across Market Street and said she was prepared to be arrested .
" A little traffic stoppage is mild compared to having rights taken away from you , " she said .
There were no reports of arrests in connection with the demonstration .
The crowd shouted chants such as " Our rights " and " We will not be quiet . "
One of the organizers of the demonstration , Ryan Kerian , 28 , a gay lawyer and San Francisco resident , said the rally was designed to " show that we wo n't be silent .
" We 've had rights stripped away from us , " he said .
" We are n't going to give up and go away . "
The crowd was ethnically mixed , but two African American men infuriated many demonstrators by loudly arguing in favor of Prop .
8 . They were berated repeatedly by opponents of the proposition , but spent more than 90 minutes arguing about the Bible .
" It is not discrimination , " said Chauncey Killens , who said he represented a small congregation in Prunedale ( Monterey County ) .
He carried a sign reading , " Yes on Prop 8 .
Protect marriage . "
The presence of the two men from Prunedale was deeply offensive to many of the demonstration participants , said Jeffrey Lebin , 52 , of San Jose .
" To have the lack of support from the black community is very painful to us .
Fifty years from now , I think the black community will be ashamed that they did n't support us . "
Uriah Findley , 27 , who is straight and was born and raised in conservative Orange County , said he believes that Prop. 8 will be a fleeting event in California history .
" This is their last hurrah , " he said .
" Proposition 8 is the last gasp of a dying way of thinking . "
He said religion has no place in laws .
" As far as I 'm concerned , this is n't something that ever should have been voted on , " he said .

In case you missed it , here are Round One Round Two and Round Three
Given the rapid advance of Moore 's Law , when does it make sense to throw hardware at a programming problem ?
As a general rule , I 'd say almost always .
Consider the average programmer salary here in the US :
You probably have several of these programmer guys or gals on staff .
I can't speak to how much your servers may cost , or how many of them you may need .
Or , maybe you do n't need any – perhaps all your code executes on your users ' hardware , which is an entirely different scenario .
Obviously , situations vary .
But even the most rudimentary math will tell you that it'd take a massive hardware outlay to equal the yearly costs of even a modest five person programming team .
For example , I just bought two very powerful servers for Stack Overflow .
Even after accounting for a third backup server and spare hard drives for the RAID arrays , my total outlay is around $ 5,000 .
These servers , compared to the ones we 're on now , offer :
roughly 50 % more CPU speed
2 to 6 times the memory capacity
almost twice the disk space ( and it 's a faster RAID 10 array )
Under this new hardware regime , we can expect average page response times to improve by about half .
All that for less than one month of an average programmer 's salary .
I 'd say that 's a great deal .
A no -brainer , even .
Incidentally , this is also why failing to outfit your ( relatively ) highly paid programmers with decent equipment as per the Programmer 's Bill of Rights is such a colossal mistake .
If a one - time investment of $ 4,000 on each programmer makes them merely 5 % more productive , you 'll break even after the first year .
Every year after that you 've made a profit .
Also , having programmers who believe that their employers actually give a damn about them is probably a good business strategy for companies that actually want to be around five or ten years from now .
Clearly , hardware is cheap , and programmers are expensive .
Whenever you 're provided an opportunity to leverage that imbalance , it would be incredibly foolish not to .
Despite the enduring wonder of the yearly parade of newer , better hardware , we 'd also do well to remember my all time favorite graph from Programming Pearls :
Everything is fast for small n .
When n gets large , that 's when things start to go sideways .
The above graph of an ancient Trash - 80 clobbering a semi- modern DEC Alpha is a sobering reminder that the fastest hardware in the world can't save you from bad code .
More specifically , poorly chosen data structures or algorithms .
It wo n't hurt to run badly written code on the fastest possible boxes you can throw at it , of course .
But if you want tangible performance improvements , you 'll often have to buckle down and optimize the code , too .
Patrick Smacchia 's lessons learned from a real - world focus on performance is a great case study in optimization .
Patrick was able to improve nDepend analysis performance fourfold , and cut memory consumption in half .
As predicted , most of this improvement was algorithmic in nature , but at least half of the overall improvement came from a variety of different optimization techniques .
Patrick likens this to his early days writing demo scene code on the Commodore Amiga :
In the early 90s , I participated in the Amiga demo scene .
It 's a great illustration of the idea that there is always room for better performance .
Every demo ran on the same hardware .
It was the perfect incentive for demo developers to produce more and more optimized code .
For several years , every month some record was beaten : the number of 3D polygons , the number of sprites , or the number of dots displayed simultaneously at the rate of 50 frames per second .
Over a period of a few years , the performance factor obtained was around 50 x !
Imagine what it means to perform a computation in one second that originally took an entire minute .
This massive gain was the result of both better algorithms ( with many pre-computations and delegations to sub-chips ) and micro-optimizations at assembly language level ( better use of the chip registers , better use of the set of instructions ) .
Patrick achieved outstanding results , but let 's be clear : optimizing your code is hard .
And sometimes , dangerous .
It is not something you undertake lightly , and you 'd certainly want your most skilled programmers working on it .
To put it in perspective , let 's dredge up a few classic quotes .
Rules of Optimization :
Rule 1 : Do n't do it .
Rule 2 ( for experts only ) : Do n't do it yet .
– M.A. Jackson
More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency ( without necessarily achieving it ) than for any other single reason - including blind stupidity .
– W.A. Wulf
Programmers have a tendency to get lost in the details of optimizing for the sake of optimization , as I 've noted before in Why Are n't My Optimizations Optimizing ?
and Micro-Optimization and Meatballs .
If you 're not extremely careful , you could end up spending a lot of very expensive development time with very little to show for it .
Or , worse , you 'll find yourself facing a slew of new , even more subtle bugs in your codebase .
That 's why I recommend the following approach :
Throw cheap , faster hardware at the performance problem .
If the application now meets your performance goals , stop .
Benchmark your code to identify specifically where the performance problems are .
Analyze and optimize the areas that you identified in the previous step .
If the application now meets your performance goals , stop .
Go to step 1 .
Always try to spend your way out of a performance problem first by throwing faster hardware at it .
It 'll often be a quicker and cheaper way to resolve immediate performance issues than attempting to code your way out of it .
Longer term , of course , you 'll do both .
You 'll eventually be forced to revisit those deeper algorithmic concerns and design issues with your code that prevent the application from running faster .
And the advantage of doing this on new hardware is that you 'll look like an even bigger hero when you deliver the double whammy of optimized code running on speedier hardware .
But until the day that Moore 's Law completely gives out on us , one thing 's for sure : hardware is cheap – and programmers are expensive .
John Forté plans to make the most of his second chance .
Following the announcement earlier this week that the former [ artist id =" 1075 " ]
Fugees [ / artist ] collaborator and solo hip - hop artist was one of 16 people to be pardoned or have their sentences commuted by outgoing President Bush , Forté is preparing to re-enter society after serving seven years of a 14 - year sentence for possession of 31 pounds of liquid cocaine with intent to distribute .
One of Forté 's lawyers , Aarti Tandon , told MTV News that contrary to earlier reports , her client had not been pardoned but had his sentence commuted , which means he does not have to serve the rest of it .
Though Forté cannot currently be reached by phone or e-mail to discuss his feelings about the commutation , Tandon said he is elated and looking forward to getting back in the music game .
" I have spoken with him , and he is pleased and very grateful to President Bush for commuting his sentence , " Tandon wrote .
" Mr. Forté is humbled by his life experiences .
He will use his early release to return to his family , re-enter the world of music , work with at - risk youth to deter them from drugs and crime , and continue his educational program at the London School of Economics . "
Forté — who studied violin at the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire as a youth — co-wrote and produced two songs on the Fugees ' Grammy - winning 1996 smash , The Score .
Two years later , he released his debut , Poly Sci , on which Fugees member [ artist id = " 1162 " ]
Wyclef Jean [ / artist ] has an executive - producer credit .
He released his second album , I , John , while in prison in 2002 .
Tandon said that Forté 's commutation came as a result of more than five years of campaigning by his lawyer , Michael Nussbaum , herself and a number of others , including singer [ artist id = " 16222 " ]
Carly Simon [ / artist ] .
Forté is a friend of Simon 's son , singer / songwriter Ben Taylor .
Tandon said Forté understands the lengths those who support him have gone to secure his release , and " he intends to justify fully the confidence shown in him . "
While in prison , Forté has been organizing music groups and Save Our Youth events ; working as a G.E.D. tutor ; leading classes in philosophy , writing and re-entry into society ; taking correspondence courses and writing music that he intends to record upon his release .
He was also admitted to a correspondence program with the London School of Economics for a degree in politics and international relations .
Forté is slated to be released on December 22 .
The tests were carried out on samples from rhesus monkeys Scientists believe successful tests in monkeys could prove a step towards a new type of drug to combat HIV .
The journal Nature reports infected animals survived almost twice as long after a single treatment to raise immune response to the virus .
An independent expert said multiple doses were possible , and might eliminate the virus .
Current antiretroviral drugs must be taken for life , giving HIV the opportunity to build up resistance .
It 's possible that multiple doses could eliminate the virus , although the present experiment has not shown that
Professor Thomas Lehner
King 's College London
Although millions of people with HIV cannot currently receive them , modern antiretroviral drugs have transformed the life expectancy of people with the infection .
However , scientists are constantly looking for alternative ways to keep the virus in check .
One option is being tested in the US on macaque monkeys infected with " simian immunodeficiency virus " - their equivalent of HIV .
One of the features of HIV is its ability to shut down or impede the body 's own methods for clearing viral infections .
In particular , it manages to activate a signalling system in the body 's immune cells - which then actually holds back the body 's immune response .
The latest treatment works by blocking that signalling system , which has the effect of boosting the function of " killer " immune cells .
The blocking antibody was injected once into nine animals who had developed AIDS after SIV infection , all of whom lived on average almost twice as long as other monkeys who did not receive the treatment .
The treated monkeys had clear signs of more active immune systems and reduction of the amount of virus circulating in their blood , both signs that they were tackling the disease more efficiently .
While the virus was not fully controlled in any of the monkeys , the scientists said that more than one dose was possible , and that it could be used in combination with antiretroviral drugs .
Long wait Dr Rama Amara , who led the research , said : " It is important to note that this therapy was effective without antiretroviral drugs and in monkeys with severe AIDS .
" It is critical to induce protective immune responses targeting the mutated virus for developing a successful immune therapy to control HIV infection . "
Another of the researchers said that the treatment also offered potential against other chronic infectious diseases such as hepatitis C and TB .
Professor Thomas Lehner , an immunologist from King 's College London , said that the findings were " very interesting " , and that the drug showed potential for human treatment .
He said : " It 's possible that multiple doses could eliminate the virus , although the present experiment has not shown that .
" It 's my understanding that some groups are already working to test this in humans , and although the safety of the drug is a concern , I see no reason why that should be a problem .
" It 's most likely that we will see it used alongside antiretroviral therapy . "
Dr Ade Fakoya , from the International HIV / AIDS Alliance , said that the research was " an important avenue " to pursue , particularly as it had managed to extend the lifespan of the monkeys .
However , he said : " There 's a long process of many years before this basic research is translated into actual research with the HIV virus in humans and then identifying a way to be able to actively block this on a large enough scale for it to be another useful tool in HIV treatments . "

UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) --
The United Nations is working to establish a commission to investigate the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , whose death came one year ago Sunday .
Benazir Bhutto greets supporters at the rally where she was later killed on December 27 , 2007 .
" The secretary - general is hopeful that , with the progression of the discussions , the commission could be established in the near future , " said a statement issued by the office of Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
The U.N. Secretariat has been talking to members of the Security Council and Pakistan over the structure of such a panel , according to the statement .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is Bhutto's widower and took office this year .
At the time of her assassination on December 27 , 2007 , it was Bhutto who was running for prime minister .
She was killed at a campaign rally in Rawalpindi ahead of parliamentary elections .
" On this painful anniversary , the secretary - general stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Pakistan and assures them of his commitment to contribute to their search for truth and justice , " the statement said .
The U.N. statement did not make reference to the heightening tension between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of last month 's attack that killed 160 people in the Indian city of Mumbai .
Troops had been redeployed from the western border with Afghanistan to the Indian border amid fears of an Indian ground incursion , according to military sources in Pakistan .
India believes the 10 men who carried out the attacks were trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani - controlled part of Kashmir .
Indian defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said Friday that India was n't carrying out a troop buildup along its western border and said he was " not aware " of military reports about Pakistani troop mobilization there .
All About Pakistan • Benazir Bhutto
On April 29 , 2004 , the last Oldsmobile rolled off the assembly line in Lansing , Michigan .
The Olds Cutlass had been the # 1 selling car in America in the mid-1970’s .
In the 80’s , Olds did well .
But in the 90’s , it became a stodgy , nothing - special vehicle , stuck in between Pontiac ( youth ) and Buick ( successful middle age ) .
I knew it was not long for this world when an ad agency introduced this slogan : “ This is not you father ’s Oldsmobile ! ”
This immediately popped into my head : “ Is it my grandfather ’s ? ”
Do you miss the Oldsmobile ?
Have you given it much thought ?
Fast forward to today .
Imagine a TV film clip of President - elect Obama .
“ Oldsmobile is the backbone of American manufacture . ”
You would think he has gone nuts .
Who cares about Oldsmobile ?
It ’s gone .
Forgotten .
Unlamented .
Obama said this on Sunday ’s “ Meet the Press ” : “ The auto industry is the backbone of American manufacture . ”
That sounded plausible , until we recognize the context : a proposal to bail out GM , Ford , and Chrysler .
Not under discussion is a bailout of Toyota , Honda , Nissan , BMW , and other automobile companies that produce cars in the United States .
This is a proposed bailout of the equivalent of Oldsmobile .
It is a bailout of firms that could not meet the test of the competitive marketplace .
Ford is the best of the bunch , and its share price says , “ Oldsmobile ! ”
It was over $ 35 in 1999 , $ 6 in 2003 , $ 17 in early 2004 , and then down , down , down .
It is under $ 3 today .
This is Detroit iron ’s “ giant . ”
This is its showcase .
The Big 3 automakers are not the backbone of the American manufacture .
Rather , they are located just below the backbone .
Obama continued : “ It is a huge employer across many states .
I do n’t think it ’s an option to allow it simply to collapse . ”
Not an option ?
Really ?
So , is this a one - time infusion of money ?
They wo n’t be back for more in 2009 ?
2010 ?
2011 ?
Not only is it an option , it is an inevitability .
This is your father ’s Big 3 .
You will pay to keep them on the road .
You will pay indefinitely .
With GM going through money at $ 2 billion a month , with Chrysler near bankruptcy , and with Ford promising profits no sooner than 2011 , they will be back for billions more before the swallows return to Capistrano .
Obama and Congress are also saying that Detroit must make big adjustments .
Its plans have not worked .
We already know this .
That is why their share prices have collapsed , along with their credit ratings .
That is why they are lined up in front of Congress , dutifully taking wisecracks from Masters of the Junket about why they were wrong in not flying on commercial jets to come and grovel .
Here is a Congress that is running a trillion dollar official on - budget deficit this year , and that has run up $ 70 trillion in unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations , lecturing three CEO ’s of busted car companies about their failure to plan .
We can see what is coming .
Congress will pass new laws governing the recipients .
These laws will be the strings attached .
There are always strings attached to Federal money .
The three CEO ’s will swallow the cyanide pills because they are groveling for loot extracted from the public .
They will consent to anything ; just give them the money .
The debate is over whether this is a new bailout or part of the one passed in September , the $ 25 billion bailout that received little attention .
That bailout was to help the Big 3 fund lower polluting cars .
Now Congress is considering the siphoning of $ 15 billion of this money to keep the companies alive long enough to adopt the new technologies .
What about the next round of Big 3 bailouts ?
Congress will fork over the money .
Not to do so would make this bailout look foolish .
They will pour good money after bad .
Detroit iron is a bottomless pit .
Congress can posture all it wants about the needed restructuring .
What does Congress know about building cars that people want to buy ?
Nothing .
NO MORE PORK !
Obama has assured us that the age of pork is over .
In an interview on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” Obama said : “ What we need to do is examine :
What are the projects where we ’re going to get the most bang for the buck ?
How are we going to make sure taxpayers are protected ?
“ You know , the days of just pork coming out of Congress as a strategy , those days are over . ”
Good news , indeed !
The tradition of Congressional pork is going to end , after only 220 years .
It ’s about time !
On this terrific news , stock markets around the world soared .
But there was this news , too .
“ If you look at the unemployment numbers … the fragility of the financial system and the fact that it ’s an international system , ” the recession “ is a big problem , and it ’s going to get worse , ” Obama told NBC News ’ Tom Brokaw on Saturday .
The interview aired Sunday on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
Acknowledging that his agenda had changed sharply just in the month since he was elected , Obama said passing a short - term economic stimulus package was now his top priority .
But stock market investors heard what they wanted to hear .
What they wanted to hear was this .
President - elect Barack Obama has warned that “ things are going to get worse before they get better ” as he outlined details of an economic stimulus package that could reach $ 1 trillion and is designed to lift the United States out of recession . ” . . .
He proposed government programmes for bridges , roads , broadband internet and schools as well as plans for greater energy efficiency and health spending .
The National Bureau of Economic Research has said that America has now been in recession for a year .
Although he played down expectation for a quick economic recovery , Mr. Obama said his plan was “ equal to the task ” that the US faced .
Let us add up these figures .
He is proposing a trillion dollars of new spending .
Noting the US budget deficit might exceed $ 1,000 bn even before his campaign promises and new spending plans were taken into account , factored in , Mr Obama said : “ We understand that we ’ve got to provide a blood infusion to the patient right now to make sure that the patient is stabilised .
“ And that means that we ca n’t worry short term about the deficit .
We ’ve got to make sure that the economic stimulus plan is large enough to get the economy moving . ”
The article went on to say that he has not announced an exact figure for increased spending .
Mr Obama has not put a full cost on his plan but his advisers estimate it will be more than $ 700 billion and could even top to $ 1 trillion .
But , we have been assured , there will be no pork this time .
Congress will lay off the pork .
An extra trillion dollars to go for state roads , bridges , and infrastructure , but there will be no pork .
JAPAN , 1990
We have seen all this before .
The Japanese government resorted to infrastructure spending and a decade of fiscal deficits to deal with the recession of 1990 .
It had been produced by the easy money , low - interest rate policy of the central bank .
The bubble burst in December 1989 .
At that time , the Nikkei stock index was over 39,000 .
Today , 19 years later , it stands a little over 8000 .
That is a 79 % decline , plus two decades of forfeited income .
The solution of Japan was to hide the so - called zombie loans of the zombie banks .
That is not Washington ’s way .
The banks ’ losses have been laid out for all the world to see .
Then Congress engineered a series of bailouts to allow huge banks to be absorbed by larger banks .
Number - four Wachovia was almost absorbed by number - one Citigroup in late September .
Two months later , Citigroup was within a weekend of bankruptcy .
The Treasury Department bailed it out .
Zombie banks .
Zombie loans .
Zombie taxpayers .
It ’s the year of the living dead .
Yet Obama ’s announcement of Japan II sent London ’s FTSE up by 6 % on Monday .
Germany ’s DAX was up 8 % .
The Nikkei was up by 5.2 % .
The optimism of investors seemed complete when the U.S. stock exchanges opened on Monday morning .
Up went the Dow by over 300 points : 3.6 % .
The faith of investors in the Federal deficit is complete .
What if there is a $ 1.5 trillion increase in fiscal 2009 ?
What if there is $ 2 trillion ?
No problem !
But there is a problem : the source of the funds .
Obama ’s website says that he will push for a tax cut for 95 % of American workers .
Cut taxes for 95 percent of workers and their families with a tax cut of $ 500 for workers or $ 1,000 for working couples .
Provide generous tax cuts for low - and middle - income seniors , homeowners , the uninsured , and families sending a child to college or looking to save and accumulate wealth .
Eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses , cut corporate taxes for firms that invest and create jobs in the United States , and provide tax credits to reduce the cost of healthcare and to reward investments in innovation .
Dramatically simplify taxes by consolidating existing tax credits , eliminating the need for millions of senior citizens to file tax forms , and enabling as many as 40 million middle - class Americans to do their own taxes in less than five minutes without an accountant .
So , as far as we can see , there will be lower taxes .
Unless Obama has become a devotee of what President Bush I dismissed as voodoo economics , he knows there will be falling revenues .
There is also a recession in progress .
Recessions reduce profits and therefore lower corporate tax revenues .
This raises a question :
Where will the extra $ 1.5 trillion to $ 2 trillion come from ?
There is the bond market .
The Treasury must not only roll over at least one - third of its $ 10 trillion debt , it must also sell an additional $ 1.5 trillion , minimum .
What will happen to interest rates ?
In a recession , Treasury rates may remain low .
Money that would have gone into stocks , corporate bonds , small business loans , and real estate will go into the Treasury .
But when the recovery begins , T - bonds will be sold , and investors will shift to stocks .
That will drive up rates , cutting short the recovery .
American stocks will fall .
Again .
Then there are Japan , China , Russia , and the oil - exporters .
Russia and the other oil exporters will be hurting from low oil prices .
Japan and China export manufactured goods .
To generate sales , they lend money to Americans to make these purchases .
The trade deficit is about $ 750 billion per year .
The basis of hope in the recovery is that the recession will frighten investors so badly that they will stay in Treasury bills , where there is no hope of capital gains , merely a little loss .
The other hope is a continuing trade deficit .
What else ?
Federal Reserve inflation .
In August 2007 , the first month of the credit crisis , its assets were at $ 900 billion .
As of December 3 , 2008 , this stood at $ 2.17 trillion .
That increase was funded by fiat money : an increase in the monetary base .
This was just the beginning .
The FED has announced the following loans :
1. $ 200 billion in student loans2 .
$ 100 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac3 .
$ 500 billion to cover in the two F ’s holdings of mortgage backed securities4 .
$ 306 billion ( at least ) for bad loans of Citigroup
The Treasury says that the government must force down mortgage rates to 4.5 % .
That will take a lot of new money .
The Treasury has taken over $ 5 trillion in bad or questionable assets .
The FED had absorbed over a trillion and a half , counting $ 406 billion in swaps of Treasury debt for toxic waste held by the biggest banks .
Then where are we ?
Here , says Prof. Rozeff .
The bad loans remain hidden and submerged within banks and other institutions .
This paralyzes lending .
The weak companies and poor managements that should be quickly cleaned out instead are given taxpayer money .
With public debt rising , the interest costs of the national debt rise .
Capital that should be going to healthy enterprises is diverted to government and to zombie enterprises .
Inefficient enterprises are subsidized .
Serious inflation looms larger and larger as a long - term problem .
The capital markets become dependent on Fed loans , and it is not clear how that dependence can be ended .
The government takes ownership interests in the most major banks , inducing further inefficiency in these semi-nationalized firms and threatening control of the allocation of capital .
In this regard , the government policies have already fostered an undue concentration of assets in large banks .
The three largest banks in the U.S. now have 38 % of all large bank assets as compared with 27 % in 2003 .
Banks with over $ 300 million in assets grew by 64 % in the last 5 years , which is a very high per annum number , but the three largest banks grew by a still higher 130 % .
In short , the actions of the government and the Fed are throwing a giant monkey wrench into the operations of banks and capital markets in intermediating capital from savers to businesses .
The likely result is a prolonged slowdown in economic growth and more government control over the economy .
Put another way , America has become Oldsmobile Nation .
CONCLUSION
The world we grew up in has been lost since August 2007 .
The man who saw this coming and warned about it , Dr. Kurt Richebächer , died that month .
He had predicted the worst capital crisis in our era .
This is what it is becoming .
Investors are Keynesians .
They believe that policies like these got America out of the Great Depression .
They did n’t .
World War II did , because 12 million male workers went into the military , because tax revenues quadrupled ( the withholding tax ) , because the Federal Reserve pumped in money , and because the government declared price controls and rationing .
Real wages plummeted , yet patriotic people worked for rationed peanuts “ to support our troops . ”
Nobody is willing to support our troops with self - restraint today .
That world is long gone .
Inflation is coming .
Then controls .
Then rationing .
This is the future of Oldsmobile Nation .

Do n't worry guys , you called him an idiot so what .
The guy above you suggested he kill himself lol .
I would certainly think that much worse .
Anyways , the guy is entitled to his opinion ..
AJ has the fight mentality but I think he expected it to happen really fast ..
I will admit I did to , I thought after 9/11 and the start of the Iraq war in 2003 that the government would be on a fast track to build up their power .
In all actuality they really have not , they did the exact opposite .
While we watch for troops marching down our street , while we look to the skies for black helicopters , while we look to prophets and seers to tell us the future and the dangers of impending attacks , the real men doing the damage where signing little peices of paper on live tv .
It is on these tiny papers , that in the name of all legal purposes that pose the greatest threat to our civilization and our very way of life .
We looked to long for further terrorist attacks , we waited to long for the troops to knock on our doors , we spent to much time worrying about camps and death trains .. we missed them take the power from our very hands .
The patriot act , for example , is exactly the thing I am talking about .
Every now and then the media makes big news out of some of the things coming out of the government , like the patriot act , domestic survaliance ... but nothing is done and they do what they want .
As of now , since 9/11 the government can1 .
spy on us .
2. arrest and detain us with out charge .
3. transport us to oversea prisions4 .
hold us indefinantly5 .
label us enemy combatants by the definition they give a terrorist , any dissident of the government6 .
track all sources of our finances7 .
take data from companies like google or AT & T.. for what reason who knows8 .
suspend habeus corpus9 .
order the actual military , including the national guard by order of the president into civil disorder , whether rioting , political dissent , pathogen outbreak , natural disaster .
10 .
execute in all legal terms a fully enforced by military strength quarenteen zones for all reasons and more listed above , with out declaring martial law .
Just a short quick summary I could come up with .. honestly the only thing I am waiting for is for them to take our guns away .
Get a liberal nutcase in there and a few more school shootings and no doubt we will be begging the government to take our own guns away .
Pancho Montana is an eXiled Special Mexican War on Drugs Correspondent .
As a native of Monterrey , Nuevo Leon , located in northern Mexico , Mr. Montana lives in Gulf Cartel territory .
That means the streets belong to the Zetas , a paramilitary organization trained by the Yankees and hired by the Gulf Cartel to keep things civilized and business booming .
His first dispatch is about neighborhood drug stores called “ tienditas . ”
They ’re sort of like your local Rite Aid , but they do n’t carry any Tylenol .
MONTERREY , MEXICO —
In my neighborhood there are two tienditas .
Mainly they sell crack and powdered cocaine .
A tiendita can be set up in any place .
It does not have to be a store , but for the sake of keeping up appearances they usually are .
I guess they do n’t want the continuous flow of clients and taxis double and triple - parked to raise unnecessary suspicion .
They do n’t need to advertise on billboards , although they could if they wanted to .
( I do n’t want to talk much about police / government involvement , but I ’ll say this : the cops protect the stores and patrol the streets like regular cops should , only that they report to the Zetas . )
Anyway , word - of - mouth spreads the message that there is a new place , right across the street , where you can get your fix easily and without hassle .
The buying process is simple .
You walk into the store , go to the counter , ask for your drug of choice ( crack , blow or weed ) , pay , walk out and enjoy .
It ’s that simple !
It ’s very impersonal , you do n’t have to go through all those trust issues I hear you people have for scoring shit in the US .
The inventory is simple , too .
These are n’t boutique medical marijuana shops I hear you have in California that offer 50 types of weed .
No , the main business of a tiendita is piedra , slang name for crack cocaine .
But after a drug shop becomes more established , the management expands into powder cocaine and pot .
The quality is not very good .
They cut it too much .
That ’s why a bolsita ( baggie ) of zetas pase ( blow ) is usually called rabia ( rabies ) .
Imagine why .
But even if you start foaming at the mouth like an infected dog , you will never complain about the price .
The minimum amount for a cocaine purchase — either crack or blow — is 1/2 gram for $ 120 pesos ( $ 8.50 USD ) .
Until very recently it was $ 100 pesos ( $ 7.00 USD ) , but the zetas added $ 20 pesos to the price .
The general druggies now think the zetas are a bunch of greedy fuckers .
But if you look at it from the zetas point of view ( remember , they are businessmen ) , that little price increase multiplied by the thousands of tienditas they run in Mexico increases their earnings big time .
So they are more like greedy fucking geniuses , because the average addict does n’t care about another measly $ 20 pesos .
They will pay the price as long as they can get a fix .
If you ask me it is a good business move for them .
Sure there is a small price increase for the consumer , but using one of their tienditas is safer than going to a bad neighborhood and it ’s just around the corner .
As for pot , one should stay away from the shit they sell at the tienditas , it ’s crap , all grinded together with the sticks and seeds .
They sell the weed in pezetas , which are small , sealed plastic bags with like 3 - 4 joints of regular size .
But if you want good weed , you need a good connection .
( That is what I got . )
Who works in the tienditas ?
Basically , anyone stupid and crazy enough .
Generally , it is the first career move for would - be thugs that want to make a name for themselves .
There are no armed guards , as far as I know , watching out for the store .
But generally anyone who works there carries a pistol or has a NexTel handy to call for the real zetas if anything weird happens .
Sometimes they will even keep an AK , but that is up to their bosses I think .
The tiendita shop keepers also serve as the fall guys .
When the army comes , they take away these idiots and the real owners just get a few more that same day .
The tiendita is protected by a network of informers known as Los Halcones , or hawks .
They frequently come in the form of taxi drivers , even street vendors could be in on it .
If you look closely , you ’ll see that taco stands are located in ideal places to inform of suspicious activity or if an army convoy is headed there to bust them .
The Halcones are complemented by the police .
They can be seen making the rounds around the neighborhood acting as informers , too .
They ’ll report on anything out of the ordinary and detain suspicious people .
If they are in luck and catch a possible “ pusher ” competing for business , they take him to the zetas .
( He ’ll probably end up being dissolved in a barrel or have his head chopped off and a pig ’s head screwed in there instead and be thrown onto the street for kids to play with . )
The police is corrupt and are generally assholes who deserve the reputation they have .
Most of the general population hates them .
More than anything , the cops are afraid of the narcos because they know that to them a cop ’s life is worth nothing .
And it ’s not like the public will mourn these fuckers .
Who buys drugs from a tiendita ?
Everyone and anyone buys there — from poor construction workers , to middle class teenagers , to affluent young adults .
But if you take drugs and have a good connection ( and a little bit more cash ) , there is no reason for stepping into a tiendita , unless you happen to be on a crack - smoking marathon , run out of your supply and ca n’t wait for a delivery .
But there is one thing the tienditas do n’t carry , and that is pills .
Right now I ’m taking some little white ones called rivotril but generally the only ones I like are rohypnols ( ” blue , 542 - marked , to go please ” ) .
You know them as roofies , I think .
There is a whole druggie subculture around this pills all over Mexico .
Since they are discontinued they are pretty hard to find , but ask anyone here that likes pills what their favorite one is .
I ’ll be suprised if they do n’t say rohypnol , or “ reinas ” as they are called here .
Our blue - eyed queens , haha !
But that is it for now .
Maybe I ’ll cover the queens in my next dispatch .
BURBANK , Calif .
WHAT ever happened to the four - toed statue ?
Why do some inhabitants of the island never seem to age ?
What is the Smoke Monster ?
And , as one of the time - traveling survivors of the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 asks in the premiere of the new season of “ Lost , ” Wednesday on ABC , “ When are we now ? ”
With 34 episodes to go in its two final seasons , the stories of nearly 100 characters to wrap up , several Dharma stations to keep track of and a whole lot of time traveling going on , the writers of “ Lost ” are doing anything but winding down .
Yet their task  untangling the seemingly impenetrable mass of plotlines that have become addictive to some viewers of the show and alienating to others  is relatively simple compared with that of Gregg Nations .
A co-producer and the show ’s longtime script coordinator , Mr. Nations has become the keeper of what has been found on “ Lost , ” charged with tracking everything that has happened and will happen to the characters on and off the island , in addition to charting the many mysterious characteristics of the island itself .
While most television series maintain a so - called bible  a guide to characters and plotlines that are developed by the creators but revealed over multiple seasons  few if any shows have twists and turns as byzantine as those on “ Lost . ”
the poor state of public transport in the emirate may compound the problems caused bythe ban
Sharjah , one of the seven emirates that makes up the UAE , is to bar workers in certain jobs from applying for driving licenses , a newspaper has reported .
The ban will cover 86 categories of mainly menial jobs - including cooks , housemaids , gardeners , and tailors .
It was brought in by Sharjah 's police traffic department to curb congestion and pollution , the report says .
The United Arab Emirates have one of the highest ratios of car ownership to population in the world .
The report , which appeared in the Gulf News daily newspaper , was linked to from Sharjah 's official police website .
The impact of the ban on workers may be compounded by the poor state of public transport in the emirate .
Many , if not most , of those hit by the driving ban will be foreign workers in low - paid , unskilled jobs .
The report said driving licence applications would still be accepted from those with university degrees .
The UAE is heavily dependent on foreign labour to fill positions which locals have not traditionally filled .
Expatriates make up 84 % of the United Arab Emirate 's 5.6 million population , often sending remittances home to boost family income .
Sharjah 's move comes in the wake of a decision by the other emirates to shelve a plan which would have banned all vehicles over 20 years old .
No official reason was given for the change of mind , but it is thought that the impact of the global economic downtown may have played into it .
From DNA to Marilyn Monroe :
The future of picture logic puzzles in education , final report - puzzles 3
As of late , we have read and listened to a great deal of research concerning aging and brain activity .
The baby - boomers are aging , quickly .
Nevertheless , if current scientific research is valid , there is a way to exercise the brain to improve and retain vital memory skills well into our advanced years .
Improved computer imaging technology has allowed scientist to record brain activity before , during , and after performing various tasks .
There is now a tremendous amount of evidence that the “ use it or lose it ” philosophy as regards to brain activity is accurate .
This being the case , I see a long and prosperous future for Conceptis - Type Image - Forming Puzzles in Education as well as in the mainstream public .
I must admit , although I keep abreast of current brain research , I was ignorant about these particular types of puzzles .
I have never really been a puzzle devotee , mostly due to lack of time .
However , the experiences that I had during this course took me by surprise .
When I read about the popularity of Conceptis type puzzles sweeping the globe I was intrigued .
Germans , Australians , and of course the Japanese are absolutely hooked on picture forming logic puzzles .
People are even asking people to marry them in puzzles , they are wearing their favorite puzzles on T - shirts and there are innumerable magazines and contest devoted to solving these image forming puzzles .
I feel as though I just woke up from another century , who knew ??
I am impressed by people ’s interest in and tenaciousness about solving these puzzles .
How to utilize these puzzles in my class
Obviously , this website was completely new territory and it looked both interesting and challenging .
After having spent considerable time reading the articles and reviewing the choices , the two activities that I chose to work with my class on were the Computer Keyboard Activity and the Famous Americans activity .
The question became how to utilize these puzzles in my class .
Initially , I thought I might use the puzzles just for fun , before or after a quiz , or as an extra credit challenge .
I also hoped to be able to use one or two of the activities to incorporate some basic terms of biology .
I was able to use the Link - a - Pix puzzles to reinforce basic terms ; I demonstrated using an overhead projector .
This helped a great deal and was effective with a large class .
We used upper - case letters and the first challenge , after the demonstration was to solve for ABC .
It took the kids awhile to get the hang of solving these puzzles but once they did most enjoyed .
However , some found this activity “ boring ” and wanted to know the relevance , they wanted to move on .
Students initially worked in pairs but most kids wanted to try the puzzles on their own .
They had the option to do either .

First , I gave my students one folder per team ( of two students ) , of letters from the Link - a - Pix puzzles .
Teams of students worked to complete puzzles using DNA acronyms , DNA , RNA , mRNA , tRNA , and words such as cell and gene .
Some students had difficulty so it worked out well using teams .
For students who typically have visual processing difficulty I paired them up with a student of more ability in that particular area .
It took most students two classes to complete ; this is a time intensive activity .
When the students completed their puzzles , we created a bulletin board of terms .
The Famous Americans Activity was our next task .
After downloading the inverted MAPs , I practiced completing some of these puzzles myself .
I really did need to work out the kinks for a while before trying to demonstrate and explain the directions to my students .
These puzzles were a bit confusing at first , but after reading many helpful suggestions from class members , I developed a clearer “ picture ” myself .
Once I clearly understood , I explained to the class , while I demonstrated on an overhead projector how Maze - a - Pix puzzles were different from the Link - a - Pix puzzles ; and that in order to find the solution to their puzzle , they must follow the dotted line .
I made copies of the four different puzzles that I hoped my students would solve ; I did not identify the people .
Unfamiliar names and faces
After reviewing the descriptions of the Famous Americans Activity and thinking about how I might in some way tie them to my subject area I chose the following : Martin Luther King , Humphrey Bogart , Marilyn Monroe , and Ronald Reagan .
The students then received their packets containing the four puzzles .
This was not an easy task as most of these Americans were unfamiliar names and faces to my students .
When the kids finished their faces , they could check the reference table complete with folders of pictures and articles containing facts about each of these celebrities ’ lives .
This activity was a refreshing change of pace and was an interesting and fun activity to do during a month when there were so many disruptions to our regular class schedule .
Although not science based , I used these puzzles to discuss my second favorite topic , social studies , and to incorporate the idea digital imaging technology .
I have become a convert to the use of puzzles
Because these four Famous Americans were unfamiliar to most of my students , interest really grew as they researched .
We had some very interesting discussions .
Always trying to make the connection to life science , we talked about , for example , the dangers of drug abuse and misuse , ( Marilyn Monroe ) , and the fact that she was and still is considered beautiful , although not by today ’s anorexic standard .
The impact of Alzheimer 's on brain activity , and current research in that field , was discussed with ( Ronald Reagan ) as well as the impact of politics in the funding of drug research .
Students then created a bulletin board and presented information that they had discovered about their Famous American .
They are happy to have their picture taken in front of their masterpieces !
I have become a convert to the use of puzzles as a motivational tool definitely , and as an educational tool in many circumstances .
Not to mention , anything that will help my aging brain is a welcome addition .
However , in light of standards based education , image - forming puzzles need to be directly related to the curriculum .
Yes , you can be creative in many instances and make the necessary leaps but on a day - to - day basis teachers must follow the frameworks and have a great deal of information to convey in the content areas .
It would be helpful to have Conceptis , if they are targeting the educational market , to align a few of their puzzles to these Frameworks as educational tools .

While the ' Yes on 8 ' Hate Mongers Declare Victory , ' No on 8 ' Campaign Understands Need to Wait For Complete Vote Count
Marriage Rights Hang in the Balance ...
Emily Levy Byon

Guest Blogged by Emily Levy of VelvetRevolution.us
California 's Proposition 8 --- a Constitutional amendment to ban the right to same - sex marriage in the state --- currently has more " yes " ( in favor of discrimination ) votes than " no " votes tallied , 52.2 % to 47.8 % , according to the CA Sec. of State 's website .
This represents a difference of 434,830 votes .
But according to the No on 8 campaign , three to four million provisional and vote - by - mail ballots remain uncounted ...
There may also be ballots uncounted due to machine breakdowns , misplaced computer memory cards ( oh , that would n't happen , would it ? ) and the like .
According to Sec. of State Debra Bowen 's office , the number of uncounted ballots may be available as early as tomorrow .
Counting them will take significantly longer , as each provisional ballot must be individually qualified .
Fortunately , the No on 8 campaign gets it .
This statement adorns their homepage :
Statement by No on Prop 8 Campaign on Election Status Nov 05 , 2008 Roughly 400,000 votes separate yes from no on Prop 8 – out of 10 million votes tallied .
Based on turnout estimates reported yesterday , we expect that there are more than 3 million and possibly as many as 4 million absentee and provisional ballots yet to be counted .
Given that fundamental rights are at stake , we must wait to hear from the Secretary of State tomorrow how many votes are yet to be counted as well as where they are from .
It is clearly a very close election and we monitored the results all evening and this morning .
As of this point , the election is too close to call .
Because Prop 8 involves the sensitive matter of individual rights , we believe it is important to wait until we receive further information about the outcome .
Geoff Kors
Executive Committee
NO on Prop 8 Kate Kendell
Executive Committee
NO on Prop 8
Yet according to the Sacramento Bee , " Frank Schubert , manager of the Yes on 8 campaign , declared victory shortly after midnight --- but opponents called that declaration ' presumptuous ' . "
We agree .
Proposition 8 , if it passes , would eliminate the right to same sex marriage through an amendment to California 's Constitution .
Uncounted ballots are n't the only issue here .
According to OurVoteLive , the website associated with the 1 - 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline for election problems , over 1,800 problems have been logged in California so far .
What percentage of people who have problems report them ?
Likely it 's a low number .
Many of the irregularities in yesterday 's election will take some time to surface .
And we 'll be watching and helping bring them to the surface and to your attention .
Here 's a sample from the OurVoteLive online database for California :
Voter Intimidation Problems :
# 31091 : Caller reports that San Diego Minute Men have announced that they intend to be " monitoring " Latino voters in area polling places .
Voting Equipment Problems :
# 61864 : Voting machine is shredding ballots in Fresno ... # 63263 : Scanner for F - K ballots rejecting all ballots as invalid .
Alternate electronic voting machine not operational ...
# 60678 : Voter was told all machines were down and that he could not vote .
They did not know how long would take , and voter had to return to work .
The polling place took back his ballot and ripped it up .
Voter still wants to vote .
Polling Place Problems :
# 92413 : Cops pulling over multiple people as they approach the polling place .
Polling place is the National Guard Recruiting Center ... ( Note : This probably should have been logged also as a voter intimidation problem . )
# 92971 : TOP OF BALLOT COUNTER WAS NOT ON CORRECTLY ( IT WAS ON BACKWARDS ) until 10 am , 200 ballots fell out crumpled , they put them into the box - AND BALLOTS WERE CRUMPLED AND THEY SHOVED THEM BACK INTO THE BOX , NOT SURE THEY ARE COUNTED ...( emphasis in original ) # 94051 : 2 separate ballots were given , one for presidential and one for propositions .
The presidential ballot was run through the machine , but the other machine was broken ...
So , where are we ?
Thousands of ballots yet uncounted .
Nearly two thousand reports , many of which could call counts into question .
And that does n't even touch the myriad dirty tricks that kept people from voting : tricks that made the lines too long for voters to wait .
That made polling places too far away for voters to reach .
That swindled voters out of their votes via phone calls reporting that Obama had won in a landslide and west coast voters need not vote .
And that 's just a sample of the things we know about so far .
It 's hard to wait to find out whether our Constitution is being used as a weapon against us .
But wait we must .
As we say so often here at The BRAD BLOG , it 's more important to get results accurately than to get them quickly .
While you 're waiting , though , there 's something important you can do in any state .
Get a team of volunteers together and observe the process of provisional ballot qualification at your county elections office .
Watch to make sure that decisions are made equitably and according to law about which ballots will and will not be counted .

Welcome
If you 're interested in conscious living , then likely you 're just as equally interested in Zen but simply not knowingly interested .
Usually Zen is associated with Japanese culture and religious or Buddhism practice , but true Zen ( or at least the way this site uses the term ) is emphasizing the value of conscious living .
Zen and conscious living come together and go hand - in - hand .
Hence , conscious living without Zen is a huge oversight and vice - versa because these are not two .
" Conscious Flex : Zen & Conscious Living " is designed to offer a partnership of how these seemingly two are actually one movement .
Zen is the foundational spaciousness or presence from which conscious living derives .
In the same manner that an artist , inventor or intuitive actions come from the stillness in the silence of non-movement .
In other words , Zen is a resting in the powerful space of not thinking about thought , not doing anything about doing , not trying to be the solver or understander , the knower collector but simply allowing the intelligence of life to flow through you and as you .
What is described can be thought of as meditation or accessing our intuition , but it 's actually just natural living .
Often you will see kids in a natural resting space or presence and we tell them " snap out of it " because we think they are in " lala land " or " fantasy land " and not paying attention but actually they are simply being completely present with what is .
It 's natural to just rest and be , that 's the flow from which insight and wisdom arises from .
Hence , conscious living is also the natural flow of how life organically expands upon itself .
Consequently , conscious living is Zen living , when it 's pure and without conceptual overlays .
Enjoy !

I purchased a AMD Athlon 2X 6000 Processor from Buy.com .
I usually go to Amazon.com but they only had the one that runs at 125 watts and I needed the one that runs at 89 watts .
After I purchased it it offered me a $ 10 coupon to use on my next Buy.com purchase .
I thought that was cool and accepted it .
Come to find out it enrolls you into a membership with a company called Shopper Discounts & Rewards whose business address is a post office box in Shelton , CT .
That should throw up a red flag ( No physical address ) .
But Buy.com transmits all your personal information to this company and INCLUDES YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION .
And to make matters worse , this company automatically enrolls you in a membership that charges you $ 12.00 a month .
All this without any authorization besides a checked box saying you accepted a $ 10 coupon .
And they even put the spin on their fine print too .
A really nice scam for people who do n't catch it .
I caught it and spent the evening getting myself unhinged from this nightmare .
Calling , speaking with customer service and sending e-mails getting my membership canceled .
Then I spent the rest of my time worried about it .
I am angry Buy.com actually got involved with this scam and actually gives all your information and CREDIT CARD information to them .
This is shameful and , in my opinion , wrong as hell .
I highly doubt I will be coming back to buy.com for anything else in the future .
I wish there was a class action suit against this Shopper Discounts & Rewards company .

Cooch pointed out some of the points I wanted to make about the difference between piracy and copyright infringement ( piracy involves the high seas and actual loot ) .
. Remember legality != morality .
Laws are rules that people make up that take away freedom from every citizen to protect a certain group of people .
That group of people is probably not you .
It was once ILLEGAL for blacks and whites to marry before Loving v. Virginia but that does n't make it morally right .
Because it is extremely hard to determine the morality of laws , each state has their own law making body while our country as a whole also has a law making body at the federal level .

You are n't really taking the profit from the pockets of the artists .
Who 's to say that you would have payed actual money for those songs had you not downloaded them .
Take the 1000 songs you downloaded , and if the going rate was $ 1 per song , you would have payed $ 1000 for music .
Seriously , would you have payed that amount of money for those songs you downloaded ?
Besides , most artists are whores to their distributors ( record label ) and are being pimped out by them .
The label gets most of the profit while shortchanging the artists .
That 's why so many of them have gone independent and chose alternate ways to distribute their music i.e. NiN and Radiohead .
. Metallica is a bunch of whining crybabies .
Their snobbery has caused them to lose a big portion of their fan base who really thought they were about " F*** ing the system " .
Besides , their post 90's stuff is garbage anyways ... I would n't even download it legally if it was free .
.
You might be actually helping the artist advertise his / her name .
Say you downloaded songs from an artist that is unfamiliar around you and your circle of friends .
You find out that it is really good music and discuss it with your friends .
Now they all know about the artist , hence , free advertising .
Then they tell it to their friends .
Next time that artist tours in your area , you and your friends cough up some cash to attend that concert .
Everybody wins .
This has happened to me lots of times .
. Technology advances on an use or lose basis .
If we do n't use it , we might lose it .
Had so many users not used Napster in the mid to late 90's , we may all still be using 56 k today because there would really be no great desire for higher bandwith to be accessible in the residential market .
Know that by using your choice file - sharing software , you are supporting something bigger than yourself .
The same thing happened with nuclear energy , had we pursued stabilizing this form of energy , we would n't be in this energy crisis of today .
Now more than ever , during these desperate times , we are pulling out those old blueprints and schematics from nuclear technology .
.
Know that YOU are not the cause of the failings of the music industry .
How many artists have you heard about that are now staving because people downloaded too much of their music ?
The RIAA themselves are even admitting that those so called lawsuits on copyright infringements are n't doing anything to help their profits and might even be deterring consumers from buying their products .
All that aside , if you are downloading music and selling them off for personal gain , then you are wrong .
That is a sin that one Our Father and 3 Hail Maries wo n't fix .
Please report yourself to the local authorities .
You are profiting off of somebody else 's blood and sweat .
In the end , the artists will be fine .
Support the artists that you actually like by buying their CDs or going to their concert .
" The present crisis is partially due to interest rates that remained at low levels for too long .
At that time , rates were lowered too much in order to stimulate growth .
We need to avoid repeating the same mistakes . "
Following recent similar moves by the Fed and the Swedish Riksbank the ECB and the Swiss National Bank both cut their official interest rates by 50 basis points .
But compared to the surprising drastic 150 basis point cut by the Bank of England today , these cuts looked like hawkish moves in comparison .
The Bank of England now has lower interest rates ( 3 % versus 3.25 % ) than the ECB for the first time ever during the 10 years that the ECB has existed .
Considering that risk premiums on credit markets have declined and considering that inflation in the U.K. is more than 5 % .
The sharp decline in the price of oil probably means that inflation will fall even in the U.K. , but considering how weak the pound is , inflation will probably not fall to the 2 % target .
The Bank of England is apparently so scared by the present U.K. downturn that it in effect has suspended its inflation target .
Given that inflation targeting is n't a good idea that is not necessarily a bad thing .
But suspending it in an asymmetric way ( ignoring it when inflation overshoots , while adhering to it when it undershoots ) implies a strong inflationary bias .
While everyone is now trapped in a Keynesian mindset that only the short term matter , we should n't forget that it was the previous inflationary bias that created these problems in the first place , and that doing it again will create more problems .
That is why it is good to see that there seems to be some central bankers who remember this .
ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi commented the call for even more drastic cuts ( like Bank of England 's ) this way
Childcare ' not just for women '
Men are being urged to take jobs in nurseries after a survey suggested many parents want their toddlers to have more contact with male role models .
For every 100 people working in childcare , only two are men .
The Children 's Workforce Development Council questioned 1,000 parents about the issue of men working in nurseries .
Single mothers appear to be particularly concerned , with 66 % saying they would like a man to be involved in their child 's development .
However , of the parents questioned , 59 % said there was not a single man employed at the nursery to which they sent their child .
' Job for a man '
The survey suggests 17 % of children have fewer than two hours of contact time per week with a male adult , and 39 % have less than six hours a week .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Just over half of those surveyed , 57 % , said they believed men and women had different skills to offer young children in their care .
Currently around 3,000 men work in early years childcare - about 2 % of the workforce .
The CWDC is calling for more men to consider working in early years settings .
They say it is crucial for children under the age of five to have contact with a responsible male adult .
Thom Crabbe , the council 's national development manager , said the career could bring great rewards .
" Male workers will get to work in a challenging , stimulating environment with like - minded professionals dedicated to the development of children - with positive benefits to babies , toddlers and young children to families and communities , " he said .
" Traditionally , it 's not been seen as a job for men , and we need to challenge that .
" The rewards and job satisfaction reported in early years childcare is very high for both women and men , " he added .
However , campaign group the Daycare Trust , said it was unlikely many more men would be attracted to the career until wages were improved in the sector .
Male role models Tricia Pritchard from the union Voice - which represents nursery nurses and other childcare and education staff across the UK - said children needed male as well as female role models .
" There are far more children nowadays who come from one parent families and , generally speaking , those one parent families have a female parent rather than a male parent , so children are n't getting a male role model at home , " she said .
" And at nursery and in school - because of the predominantly female workforce - they are n't getting a male role model there either .
" However , unless more is done to improve the pay , working conditions , training , career development and status of nursery staff , I fear that men - and , increasingly , women - will not be attracted to childcare as a profession .
" The problem is self - perpetuating - as children go through nurseries with predominantly female staff , they 've grown up perceiving it as a female profession , so when young men come to choose their own career , they do n't tend to think of childcare because they see it as ' female . ' "

The proportion of voters identifying with the Democratic Party has grown significantly since the 2004 election , and the shift has been particularly dramatic among younger voters .
Fully 61 % of voters ages 18 to 29 identify or lean Democratic and a comparable percentage supports Barack Obama .
But Democratic gains in party affiliation among older voters since 2004 have been much more modest .
Moreover , support for Obama among voters ages 50 and older is slightly lower than the share of this cohort that identifies with the Democratic Party .
In Pew surveys conducted since August of this year , 51 % of all voters say they think of themselves as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party , up five points from 46 % during the same period in 2004 .
Meanwhile , the number identifying with or leaning toward the Republican Party has fallen from 45 % to 41 % .
In this cycle , the Democratic Party enjoys a 10 - point advantage in party identification , compared with a one - point edge in the fall of 2004 .
The greatest gains for the Democratic Party have come among younger voters .
The percentage of voters ages 18 to 29 identifying with the Democratic Party has increased from 48 % in the fall of 2004 to 61 % currently .
Democrats now outnumber Republicans by a margin of nearly two - to - one ( 61 % to 32 % ) in this age group , up from only a seven - point advantage in 2004 .
Voters ages 30 to 49 , a group that includes the more conservative “ Generation X , “ also have shifted considerably since 2004 .
Nearly half ( 49 % ) of voters in this age group identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party , up from 43 % in 2004 .
Democrats currently have a six - point advantage over Republicans among voters in this age group ; at a comparable stage in the last campaign , Republicans had a six - point advantage .
However , voters who are now in their early to mid-40s , a cohort that came of age politically in the Reagan years , remain one of the most Republican - oriented age cohorts ; they are about evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans .
Baby Boomers , many of whom are now ages 50 to 64 , have long leaned Democratic as a generation , and this remains the case today .
Currently , just over half of voters in this age group identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party ( 51 % ) up slightly from 47 % during the 2004 election .
The Democratic advantage over the GOP among this age group has grown from two points in 2004 to 10 points now – about the same as the national total .
Only among voters age 65 and older has the percentage of voters identifying with the Democratic Party decreased slightly — from 49 % in 2004 to 47 % now .
This slight decline reflects the passing of members of the New Deal Generation — who leaned overwhelmingly Democratic but who are mostly in their 90s now .
In addition , voters who came of age politically in the Eisenhower administration , and are now in their late 60s , are closely divided in their party affiliation .
The relative stability of partisanship in this age group reflects the fact that these voters have been politically active for the longest period of time and may have the firmest partisan affiliations .
Party Identification and the Vote
Although Democrats have a 10 - point party identification advantage over Republicans ( 51 % vs. 41 % ) in the six surveys Pew has conducted since August , Barack Obama ’s lead over John McCain aggregated across the same surveys has been slightly narrower ( 49 % vs. 41 % ) .
The difference is mostly due to older voters .
Obama draws overwhelming support from both older and younger Democrats ; however , his lead among Democratic voters age 50 and older ( 84 % to 9 % ) is somewhat narrower than his lead among those younger than age 50 ( 90 % to 5 % ) .
As a result , while Democrats have a seven - point lead in party identification among voters age 50 and older ( 49 % to 42 % ) , Obama runs nearly even with McCain among voters in this age group ( 45 % vs. 44 % ) .
In the fall of 2004 , when Democratic and Republican Party identification ( 46 % vs. 45 % ) was nearly even heading into the presidential election , so too was overall candidate support ( 45 % Kerry and 46 % Bush in polls conducted between August and Election Day ) .
Support for Kerry tracked fairly evenly with Democratic Party identification for both older and younger voters .
Among voters under age 50 , 44 % supported Kerry and 45 % identified as Democrats .
Similarly , 46 % of those age 50 and older supported Kerry and 48 % identified with the Democratic Party .
Shifts in Party Identification Among Whites
Overall , more whites continue to identify as Republicans than as Democrats ( 48 % vs. 44 % ) ; this is narrower than the 52 % - to - 40 % advantage the GOP held in 2004 .
Since then , Democratic Party identification has increased four points ( from 40 % to 44 % ) among white voters .
Notably , the balance of party identification among younger white voters has reversed , from an 11 - point advantage for the GOP in 2004 to an 11 - point advantage for the Democrats today .
However , the 51 % - to - 41 %
Democratic advantage among white voters ages 18 to 29 is much smaller than the 29 - point advantage Democrats hold among all voters under 30 .
Among white voters ages 30 to 49 , the Republican Party holds an eight - point advantage in affiliation , which is far smaller than their 19 - point lead at this stage in 2004 .
However , this continues to be the most Republican - leaning age cohort among white voters .
The share of white voters ages 50 to 64 identifying with the Democratic Party has increased slightly from 43 % in 2004 to 45 % in 2008 .
Meanwhile , Republican identification has fallen from 51 % to 47 % , leaving the GOP with a slim two - point advantage , down from an eight - point advantage in 2004 .
Party ID and Vote Preference among Whites
The gap between partisan leaning and support for Obama is particularly clear among older white voters .
As is the case with younger voters overall , the share of younger white voters who affiliate with the Democratic Party and the share that supports Barack Obama is almost identical .
However , among white voters ages 50 and older , substantially fewer support Obama than identify with or lean to the Democratic Party .
There was no such gap in 2004 , when the balance of party and the balance of support for John Kerry was virtually identical across all age groups .

President - elect Obama , I work 14 hours a day , seven days a week .
Since I work that much , I can make a living .
I employ 14 workers .
If I am to be taxed for working hard , make everyone that receives my money work as hard and as long as me .
If they work seven days a week , they 'll have less time to spend and want .
I live in a small apartment and drive a five - year - old car .
I do n't have cable TV or Internet at home .
I keep the temperature at 80 degrees in the summer and never turn the heat on in the winter .
My debt is a very small fraction of my net worth .
I have cash to pay off my debt .
I have lived a frugal life .
If someone is to receive my money , they should be required to stay out of debt themselves .
I have chosen to eat good food and maintain my health .
I do n't take drugs of any kind .
If someone is to receive my money , they should be required to maintain their health to the level of not needing health care .
I worked two years before I could afford to purchase medical insurance with a $ 5,000 deduction .
Some of my workers do not take care of themselves and want me to get them insurance for free .
I could not imagine being required to do so .
I do not and will not support free public health insurance , retirement , protection , etc .
If I consider a plot of land , prepare the land ( remove rocks , trees , weeds ) , plow the rows , plant the seeds , and pray to God for sunshine and rain , am I required to give the [ harvest ] to someone who never put their hands to help nor their money and health at risk for failure or success ?
Do n't dilute my expectation .
If I fail , I fail alone .
No one wants to help pay for my failure .
If I succeed , you should not want to take my money and give it to one who has failed .
Since you are now the President - elect , you must have worked pretty hard to get there .
Others who supported you must have seen something in you that inspired them to give your campaign hard - earned money .
Please do not require less from every single American that is receiving money from those that pay .
I will support you if you do nothing less .

The addictive nature of online gaming has been proven , at least anecdotally , time and time again .
While not everyone who jumps into the digital realms of World of Warcraft or the various other massively - multiplayer online role - playing games is liable to get endlessly sucked in , those with addictive personalities certainly run the risk .
In fact , in the East , the problem has gotten so severe that the government of China will soon require MMO players to register their real names when creating online accounts as an anti-addiction measure .
Zhang Yijun , director of the General Administration of Press and Publication 's technology and digital publication department in China , said this week in Qingdao that the Chinese government will begin taking in personal information from any players who register to play MMO , free or otherwise .
Gamers will need to register their names along with the code for their government - issued ID cards .
While this " real - name system " will not affect what players do once they are in the game directly , the system is designed to link real people to their online accounts for the purposes of monitoring usage and preventing potential addiction .
Kou Xiaowei , vice - director of GAPP's A/V , Electronics , and Internet Administration Department , outlined the system back in 2006 :
A " real - name system " has three sub-systems :
One , a registration system that discriminates according to ID information ;
Two , an inquiry system that is open to the community and can allow parents to check whether their children are playing games ;
Three , a confirmation system that has the cooperation of the PSB to confirm the registered information .
Back in 2006 , this system was being tested with adult gamers , who understandably resisted the somewhat invasive system .
However , the original system has now essentially become law .
It applies to both young and old , as well .
The system falls in line with similar Chinese initiatives currently in development or in use , which attach real - name linking to online IDs for commenting on blogs and sharing online media .
This decision follows the exploits of four online game companies , which have had their operations suspended after their online gaming software was determined not to be in compliance with the government 's anti-addiction system .
China , Korea , and even Japan have had a long and sordid history with online gaming addiction .
There is little doubt that the potential for addiction exists with MMORPGs .
The need to feel connected to the game and to stay in touch with in - game friends can be very strong , and countless anecdotes from the East have produced horror stories that have gone so far as to end in death from malnourishment .
The government of China already treats addiction to Internet use as a medical disorder , so this would seem to be the next logical step from there — especially considering the country 's restrictive stance on online gaming for its students .

Barack Obama has really worked the public with his new public works program .
He will offer states a " compelling " investment : he will compel them to use citizens ' " precious tax dollars " to " invest " in massive public works projects — or risk losing the money .
This is a type of " investment " worth opting out of .
Except that it is not an investment at all — it is merely government consuming people 's tax dollars .
It is the equivalent of a thief telling you : " Do n't worry !
I 'll be investing your money .
And other people will be using it for their benefit .
Do n't be so selfish anyway . "
There is a lot of falsehood to unpack here but let us focus mainly on the destructive transfer of private sector resources to the public sector .
Obama plans to create " the largest public works program since President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the federal interstate system in the 1950s " that will probably have a ( nominal ) cost of at least $ 700 billion .
After all , this is the " main street " bailout ( literally since the plan includes the maintenance of roads ) , which will most certainly have to match or " one - up " the ( nominal ) $ 700 billion amount for the " wall street " bailout .
The money will be used to create 2.5 million jobs that will repair roads , bridges and public transport facilities , expand broadband technology , and create many new " green " jobs , in addition to possibly " guaranteeing every American a college education . "
Governments create incredibly perverse incentives .
Obama has said that states must accept the money quickly and get started immediately or they will risk losing the money altogether .
What governor would not accept the money ?
If you offered almost anyone the option of spending billions of dollars on something — anything — they would very likely do so .
And so we read , not surprisingly , " Governors praised Obama ’s proposals , saying their states stand ready with billions of dollars ’ worth of road and school projects that could be started quickly with an infusion of federal cash . "
Politicians are now jockeying for taxpayers ' money , manipulating numbers to show how " needy " each state is in order to receive the money .
Suddenly the more unemployment a state has the better , and the worse its infrastructure , the more likely it will receive the money .
Part of these funds will be used as a " massive effort " to convert federal buildings into more energy - efficient buildings by " replacing aging heating systems and installing efficient light bulbs . "
So the joke becomes :
How much does it cost to change a light bulb ?
Seven hundred billion dollars !
Taxpayers are " investing " their tax dollars so that government gets new heating systems and light bulbs ?
How about just shutting off the power and closing down the building ( for later auction to the private sector ) as a way to save billions of taxpayers ' money ?
How more apparent can the difference be between the government ( the State ) and the rest of " society " ?
The government would have us fund the improvement of their buildings at the expense of our homes !
Yet Obama says " we need action — and action now , " not something you want to hear from a politician in power and in control of your money .
We do not need politicians acting urgently or quickly — unless it is getting out of the way for private enterprise and voluntary production and exchange .
The less politicians do the better .
The relationship between those employed through Obama 's public works scheme and those forced to subsidize them creates a needless conflict — created by government — where one group lives off another .
In a free market , those who are unemployed and on welfare and who later find jobs actually take a burden off of those who were already employed ; those who were unemployed and not on welfare and become employed also help the currently employed , by increasing the labor supply and possibility of a further division of labor .
In addition , the newly employed worker still has their dignity intact and knows they are not part of a government welfare scheme , albeit one aimed at employment .
The reality is that labor has the opportunity cost of foregoing leisure .
Anyone can be engaged in labor to the extent they are not engaging in leisure .
In other words , if labor , or employment , is the goal , any task in which one is employed will qualify .
In the private sector the goal is not " jobs , " which merely please the worker , but the efficient use of resources to better satisfy workers and consumers .
The private sector could be termed the service sector and the public sector the parasitic sector .
We can measure how efficiently resources are being used in the private sector by whether a business is making a profit or loss .
In the public sector this is not the case ; indeed , almost the opposite is true : A money - losing government program ( or do I repeat myself ? ) usually receives more money !
The public sector is gauged by how much it spends , whereas the private sector is measured by how much it receives — ask ( by pleasing your customer better than your competitor ) and ye shall receive ( their money ) in the private sector ; or coerce ( the populace with rhetoric , propaganda , and empty promises ) and ye shall deceive in the public sector .
The public sector cannot be productive , as it merely subtracts from the private sector !
Public works will become public waste in the sense that resources will be diverted from the private sector — where they are engaged in voluntary production and exchange — to the public sector , where they are engaged in a form of involuntary production and coercive exchange .
If roads are being built , raw materials will be diverted from current , more efficient uses to less efficient uses .
The structure of production will also be manipulated as capital goods in higher stages of production will be necessary for heavy construction projects .
It will likely be the case that others who were engaged in different areas of production will lose their jobs .
Already , the shares of construction manufacturers and oil and copper have increased since the announcement .
The current uses of those resources , including labor , will either be switched to new uses , or not be used — unemployment , the unintended consequence of a government employment program !
Finally , the jobs will most likely be unproductive , or at least counterproductive .
There will be more diversion of resources towards public waste , including more money and bureaucracy .
Rothbard is once again most clear on this topic :
Forcing taxpayers to subsidize employers or to provide busy - work for unproductive “ jobs ” is worse than keeping welfare recipients idle .
There is no point to activity or work unless it is productive , and enacting a taxpayer subsidy is a sure way to keep the welfarees unproductive .
Subsidizing the idle is immoral and counterproductive ; paying people to work and creating jobs for them is also crazy , as well as being more expensive .
Obama said that this crisis is the “ opportunity to transform our economy . "
He just did n't finish the sentence : into full - scale Socialism .
It is what Rothbard termed the Long March toward Socialism .
And Obama 's leading the way .

The Best of Chris Brown
John Yoo , the former Deputy Attorney General at the agency 's Office of Legal Counsel , who drafted the infamous " torture memos " that gave former President George W. Bush and CIA interrogators the legal cover they needed to torture suspected terrorist detainees , offered some clues behind the genesis of the August 2002 legal opinions .
Yoo suggested in no uncertain terms that Bush administration officials sought to legalize torture and that he and his boss , Jay Bybee , fixed the law around the Bush administration 's policy .
Yoo , who is now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley , insisted that he only drafted the legal memos and that other officials decided what interrogation techniques were permissible .
The
" Decisions about interrogation methods at Guantanamo Bay were made by the Defense Department , " said Yoo in testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution last year .
But Yoo appears to be splitting hairs .
While it may be true that higher - ups in the Bush administration , including President Bush , had greater responsibility for approving the techniques , indeed , Yoo admitted in an editorial published Thursday in the Wall Street Journal that George W. Bush authorized waterboarding " three times in the years after 9/11 , " Yoo was not just the detached legal scholar that he has portrayed .
On Wednesday , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain still secret memos that Yoo and others at the DOJ drafted .
The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility has been investigating whether " the legal advice contained in those memoranda [ written by Yoo and Bybee ] was consistent with the professional standards that apply to Department of Justice attorneys . "
The results of the investigation could lead to a criminal probe .
In his 2006 book , War by Other Means : An Insider 's Account on the War On Terror , Yoo described his participation in meetings that helped develop the controversial policies for the treatment of detainees .
For instance , Yoo wrote about a trip he took to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , with other senior administration officials to observe interrogations and to join in discussions about specific interrogation methods .

Where am I Wearing : A Global Tour to the Countries , Factories , and People that Make Our Clothes I met a lot of garment workers .
Allow me to introduce you to a few of them :
Arifa holding her daughter Sadia
Arifa
Dhaka , Bangladesh
Quote : “ Their father was a crook , and the government does n’t take care of my children .
It ’s not like the USA or the UK . ”
Arifa is a single mother .
She lives on the sixth floor of a crumbling apartment building in Dhaka with her daughter Sadia , 4 , and her son Abir , 11 .
She has another son , Arman , 18 , who went to Saudi Arabia to work .
He sends half of his money home to help his mom and siblings Arifa works at a nearby garment factory where she earns $ 24 / month .
A trip through the market is enough to show that Arifa is well respected by all and feared by merchants , who do n’t dare bargain with her .
Nari ( left ) with roommates
Nari
Phnom Penh , Cambodia
Quote : “ The workers at beauty salons make less than garment workers , but I will be an owner and make more . ”
Nari works at a factory that makes blue jeans .
She shares an 8 ’ X 12 ’ apartment with seven other girls .
Four of the girls sleep on a bamboo bed and the other four sleep on the concrete floor .
Nari irons jeans .
It ’s a job that she had to pay a $ 50 bribe – a month ’s wage – to get .
Fifty dollars is probably enough for one person in Cambodia to live on , but Nari , like many of the garment workers in Cambodia , supports her family of six .
She is attending beauty school and hopes to open her own salon someday .
She does n’t like bowling .
Ai
Phnom Penh , Cambodia
Quote : “ I miss working and talking in the rice fields .
At the factory , we are n’t allowed to talk .
The bosses want us to work as quickly as possible . ”
Ai shares an apartment with Nari and works at the same factory .
She is a checker , looking for flaws .
Eighty - five people have a hand in sewing together a single pair of blue jeans , and Ai makes sure that no one screwed up .
Like many garment workers , she lives far from her home village and rarely visits ; a six - day workweek wo n’t allow it .
Ai does n’t have a contract with the factory , which means she does n’t have the same rights as other workers .
She can be fired for absolutely no reason .
She supports six people on her wage of $ 55 / month .
She owns a Tweety Bird shirt , but has no idea who Tweety Bird is .
Zhu Chun ( left ) , Dewan ( right )
Dewan and Zhu Chun
Guangzhou , China
Quote by Zhu Chun : “ One thing is for sure .
I do n’t want ( my son ) to come here to work in the factory .
I just want him to study , because people like us who do n’t have knowledge have to work very hard . ”
Dewan and Zhu Chun moved from their village 600 - miles away to Guangzhou to get a job at a factory making shoes .
They have n’t seen their 13 year - old - son in three years .
The original plan was to work a few years to pay off the home they built in their village , but Dewan ’s mother got sick and died .
Now they have a house and expensive medical bills to pay off .
A few years have become a few more .
The law limits their workweek to 44 hours , but they often work more than a hundred .
Neither one of them has eaten cheese .
Debbie holding the author 's favorite shorts
Debbie
Perry , New York
Quote : “ They would have to push me out the door to get me to leave . ”
Debbie ’s job working for Champion was supposed to be a filler between college and whatever she decided to do next .
Twenty - eight years later she is still working at the factory , which is no longer owned by Champion .
In 2002 Champion moved the factory ’s work and hundreds of jobs to Mexico .
Lucky for Debbie the community of Perry pulled together and a new company , American Classic Outfitters , was born from the ashes of Champion .
You ’ve seen Debbie ’s and ACO ’s work .
They make uniforms for 16 of the 30 NBA teams , all of the WNBA , 73 colleges , and 3 NFL teams .
Kelsey Timmerman is the author of Where am I Wearing .
From the inside flap :
Ninety - seven percent of our clothes are made overseas .
Yet globalization makes it difficult to know much about the origin of the products we buy — beyond the standard " Made in " label .
So journalist and blogger Kelsey Timmerman decided to visit each of the countries and factories where his five favorite items of clothing were made and meet the workers .
He knew the basics of globalized labor — the forces , processes , economics , and politics at work .
But what was lost among all those facts and numbers was an understanding of the lives , personalities , hopes , and dreams of the people who made his clothes .
In Bangladesh , he went undercover as an under - wear buyer , witnessed the child labor industry in action , and spent the day with a single mother who was forced to send her eldest son to Saudi Arabia to help support her family .
In Cambodia , he learned the difference between those who wear Levi's and those who make them .
In China , he saw the costs of globalization and the dark side of the Chinese economic miracle .
Kelsey 's blog is full of neat tidbits from the book .
Do n't miss the Underwear Wall of Fame and his informal survey of where people 's T - shirts were made .
Oh , one more thing : his wife Annie just gave birth to the couple 's first child , Harper Willow Timmerman , on January 6 , 2009 .
She 's very cute !

Are you an author and would like your books promoted on Neatorama ?
Let 's talk about a possible guest blog post just like this one !
In selected watering holes across America , it 's party time tonight .
In Washington , the festivities will centre on the venerable City Tavern in Georgetown ; for $ 90 ( £ 61 ) , you can taste the cocktail offerings of the capital 's most expert bartenders ( or " mixologists " as they like to term themselves ) , listen to a jazz band and , in the words of the invitation , " party like it 's 1933 " .
In San Francisco , after a parade through the streets , celebrants will make their way to the 21st Amendment Brewery , gaining entrance to the revelries within by use of a special password .
Similar events are being held in New York , Chicago , New Orleans and other US cities associated with an understanding acceptance of human frailty and having a good time .
By now the reason for these goings - on will be plain .
Tonight is the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition – of 5 December 1933 when Utah became the deciding 36th state to ratify the 21st amendment to the constitution , and restore to the country 's citizens the basic human right to go out and have a drink .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rarely in the annals of human experience has so well intentioned an idea been such a monument to failure as America 's 13 - year attempt to eradicate the evil of alcohol .
The National Prohibition ( or Volstead )
Act was passed by Congress in October 1919 , overriding the veto of President Woodrow Wilson .
The following January , the Act was ratified as the 18th amendment of the constitution after it had been approved by the required three - quarters majority of US states .
The " noble experiment " , as its supporters termed it , did indeed lead to a modest decline in alcohol consumption and an overall improvement in public health .
But those meagre and transient advantages were nothing compared to the unintended side - effects of Prohibition : a drastic decline in federal and state revenues , a surge in clandestine binge drinking and of course speak - easies , bootlegging , moonlighting and mobsters , not to mention the criminalisation of millions of US citizens , including some its most eminent politicians , who were technically flouting the law of the land .
Prohibition 's passing belongs to a distant age ; you have to be 90 years old at least to be a surviving violator .
But this 75th anniversary has a rare resonance .
Prohibition was brought down by its growing unpopularity , and the indisputable evidence the measure was doing far more harm than good .
But the final nail in its coffin was the Great Depression , at its height in 1933 .
Why should extra misery and deprivation continue to be heaped upon a population suffering so much hardship already ?
" The human suffering that it [ Prohibition ] entailed , " wrote H L Mencken , journalism 's bard of the age , " must have been a fair match for that of the Black Death and Thirty Years War . "
Three - quarters of a century on , the US is in the throes of its worst financial and economic crisis since the Depression , one which some experts say could yet turn into the real thing .
Then , as now , a new President is taking office – and the comparison most commonly drawn for Barack Obama is not with JFK but Franklin Roosevelt who , three weeks after taking office in March 1933 , signed an amendment to the Volstead Act , allowing production and sale of light beers and wines .
That Utah , citadel of the teetotalling Mormon church , was the state which put repeal over the top nine months later , only proved how disliked Prohibition had become .
To this day , it is the only amendment to the US constitution which has been overturned by another .
The challenges facing Mr Obama are many and massive .
But the country 's drinking laws are mercifully not among them .
Even so , Prohibition marks American government and society to this day .
The modern Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is a direct descendant of the Bureau of Prohibition ( later briefly the FBI 's delightfully named Alcohol Beverage Unit ) that was set up to enforce the 1919 act .
Hundreds of " dry " towns and counties are still to be found in the US , many of them in the South and Appalachian states .
Mississippi only ratified repeal of Prohibition in 1966 , while more than a dozen states still ban the sale of hard liquor on Sundays .
The American wine industry has long since recovered from its near - death experience during Prohibition – the country is now the world 's fourth - largest wine producer – but not until 2005 did the Supreme Court overturn post - Prohibition bans on direct shipment of out - of - state wines to consumers .

The most tangible enduring legacy of the age is on what Americans drink .
Before Prohibition , the most popular liquor was whiskey .
But to distil even the most barely passable whiskey takes time and technology – two commodities hard to come by when making any illegal product .
The great beneficiary of the age was gin and , by extension , the cocktail .
Neutral grain spirit needs no ageing , and is thus easier to produce .
But , with water and dosed with juniper flavouring , it provided a tolerable substitute for real gin .
Gin also mixes well .
Thus an explosion of cocktails , of exotic colours and ingredients to mask the fiery raw taste of the illegally produced spirit .
Never has necessity been a more prolific mother of invention .
Cocktails had long since been around – legend has it that the martini , the most famous cocktail of them all , was invented in Martinez , California , in the mid-19th century – but Prohibition was the making of them , and of that other quintessentially American institution , the cocktail party .
Still , it was a relief when everything became legal again .
" They 're disappearing fast , thank goodness , those vicious liquid heartburns " , ran a Martini & Rossi advertisement in a 1934 issue of Vanity Fair , " People are going back to civilised cocktails .
Martini . "
These days , not much is heard about temperance .
But the Prohibition Party , founded in 1872 and thus the third oldest US political party after the Republicans and Democrats , survives to this day .
Its candidate , Gene Amondson , even won 643 votes in last month 's presidential election .
Most important , the mindset that produced Prohibition lives on .
The cocktail , it is said , is enjoying a new golden age .
But a third of American adults do n't drink at all , and the country ranks only 40th in the international league table of alcohol consumption .
Indeed , since the late 1970s , consumption per head in the US has been falling steadily .
The great " war on alcohol " between 1920 and 1933 may have ended in resounding defeat .
But an American belief that human vices can be eradicated , and human nature perfected , persists , visible in the continuing , scarcely less futile " war on drugs " declared by Richard Nixon in 1971 and , who knows , maybe in George Bush 's " war on terror " as well .
But do n't let such sombre thoughts spoil the party tonight .
Drink your own : Classic recipes
Cocktails existed long before Prohibition but their qualities of disguise – especially if a colourless drink such as gin was mixed with fruit juice or other ingredients – made them a defining drink of the era .
They were especially popular in bars which served the super - rich , such as the Colony in New York .
Classic Prohibition cocktail recipes include ( for one person in all cases ) :
Colony
Shake well with cracked ice :
1 oz gin
¾ oz grapefruit juice
2 tsp maraschino
Strain into chilled cocktail glass .
Sidecar
Shake well with cracked ice :
1 ¼ oz cognac
oz Cointreau
¾ oz fresh - squeezed lemon juice .
Strain into chilled , sugar - rimmed cocktail glass
White Lady
1 tbsp gin
1 tbsp Cointreau
1 tbsp lemon juice
Mix all ingredients and strain and pour into a cocktail glass .
S.F. to fight bias in health insurance costs SAN FRANCISCO

The city of San Francisco is challenging state legislation that allows insurance companies to charge women more than men for health coverage .
In a practice known as gender rating , women in California pay up to 39 percent more than men for coverage in the individual insurance market , which is where people who are n't covered by employer plans or state health programs get their insurance .
Nationwide , about 7 percent of women buy their health coverage directly from insurance companies .
Gender rating is illegal in 10 states and restricted in two more , but in California , state legislation allows insurance companies to set different rates , on the basis that women are more expensive to care for than men , even without including maternity care .
At least until age 55 , women tend to visit their doctors for annual screenings and checkups more often than men and are more likely to suffer from certain chronic diseases .
But critics call the system unfair .
" This is something that acts in a discriminatory way over women who are seeking health insurance , " said San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera .
" It 's something we should not be promoting as a society . "
Herrera has sent a letter to the state attorney general giving notice that San Francisco intends to sue the state if legislation allowing gender rating is not repealed .
The city is targeting two state statues , one that was passed in 1991 and the other in 2005 .
The gender rating policy only came to the city 's attention a few months ago when a national study on insurance rates was released .
The city attorney is getting involved , Herrera said , because not only is gender rating unfair and discriminatory , it also puts the burden of health care on county governments when women can't afford high insurance rates .
" There 's a direct fiscal impact to the city when women who are being discriminated against are unable to get health insurance , " Herrera said .
" They 're forced into getting their health care from San Francisco General Hospital and city clinics . "
Insurance companies have argued that their premiums reflect the actual costs of health care .
Because women file more insurance claims than men , it makes sense that they should pay more for their coverage , said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for the trade group America 's Health Insurance Plans .
He noted that as people get older , the gender rating process reverses , with men paying more for their insurance than women .
" Health insurance premiums reflect the underlying cost of health care , and at younger ages women tend to use more health care services than men , " Zirkelbach said .
" It 's an effort to try to keep health care coverage as affordable as possible for as many people as possible . "
But women 's health advocates point out that the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission forbids employers from charging women higher premiums than men on the basis of gender alone .
If it 's considered sex discrimination on the job , the same rule should apply to people seeking individual insurance , they say .
In a report released in September , the National Women 's Law Center found that California women under age 55 pay up to 39 percent more for insurance than men .
The study looked at insurance coverage for women at ages 25 , 40 and 55 ; the premium rates did not include maternity care .
Nationwide , the study found that younger women paid up to 48 percent more than men .
At age 55 , the differences were especially remarkable - depending on the insurance company , women paid anywhere from 22 percent less than men to 37 percent more .
That the discrepancies were so varied is proof that insurance companies are n't basing their prices on actual costs , said Judy Waxman , vice president of health and reproductive rights for the National Women 's Law Center .
" Some insurers say they look at what women on average might spend and what men on average might spend , and then they come up with some premium cost , " Waxman said .
" But it 's very hard to get behind their numbers because it 's so gigantically different that it 's crazy . "
Lest there be any danger that the public miss the gathering ’s bipartisan theme , Monday ’s meeting between President - elect Barack Obama and Senator John McCain had an American flag between the two men and flags flanking them on either side .
“ We believe that Americans of all parties want and need their leaders to come together and change the bad habits of Washington so that we can solve the common and urgent challenges of our time , ” the men said in a joint statement released after they met .
The former adversaries added that they “ had a productive conversation today about the need to launch a new era of reform where we take on government waste and bitter partisanship in Washington in order to restore trust in government , and bring back prosperity and opportunity for every hardworking American family . ”
Rahm and Lindsey
Each man brought one aide to the three flag gathering , held at the Presidential Transition Office on the 38th floor of the Kluczynski Federal Building in downtown Chicago .
Seated around a low wood coffee table with the former candidates were Rep. Rahm Emanuel [ D ] of Illinois who will be Obama ’s White House chief of staff , and McCain ’s loyal sidekick during the long campaign , Senator Lindsey Graham [ R ] of South Carolina .
At a pre-meeting photo op , reporters asked about the session ’s expected outcome .
Mr. Obama said , “ We ’re going to have a good conversation about how we can do some work together to fix up the country , and also to offer thanks to Sen .
McCain for the outstanding service he ’s already rendered . ”
Obviously
McCain was in a taciturn mode .
When asked whether he would help Mr. Obama with his administration , the former Republican standard bearer said , “ Obviously . ”
When reporters tried to ask a question about the auto industry rescue plan being considered this week by the US Senate , press handlers shouted them down .
That prompted Mr. Obama to say with a smile , “ You ’re incorrigible ” as the media was ushered out .
According to the Associated Press , Obama told McCain “ the national press is tame compared to the Chicago press . ”
It is not known what – if anything – of substance took place at the session .
In their joint statement , the men offered few specifics .
“ We hope to work together in the days and months ahead on critical challenges like solving our financial crisis , creating a new energy economy , and protecting our nation ’s security , ” the statement said .
Both men have something to gain from working together .
Major items
The new president will have strong majorities in both houses of Congress .
So Democrats will be able to pass some measures without Republican votes .
But major items , like providing universal health care or comprehensive action to deal with global warming – will require bipartisan support .
Senator McCain has a record of working across the aisle to forge compromises on major issues and could be a valuable ally for President Obama .
For Senator McCain , the occasional alliance with a new President on a major issue could be a way to burnish his standing with independents who did not like the Senator ’s move rightward to appeal to the Republican base during the election .
As the Fix points out , being a bipartisan deal broker is only one of the options McCain can choose .
He also could opt to serve as the voice of the opposition to Obama ’s legislative agenda or simply wait to retire from the Senate in 2010 .
Monday ’s meeting appears to be without recent precedent in terms of how soon after the election it was held and the fact the subject was not a transition between the two men .
For example , President George Bush did not meet with Massachusetts Senator John Kerry after the 2004 election until the following year when the Boston Red Sox made a White House visit .

WASHINGTON  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday endorsed congressional efforts to craft a new economic stimulus package , noting risks of a " protracted slowdown . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday increased the odds of a second economic stimulus package , endorsing the action as a way to prevent a " protracted slowdown . "
Bernanke , responding to questions at a House Budget Committee hearing , declined to say whether the country is in a recession .
" We are in a serious slowdown in the economy , which has very significant consequences for the public , and whether it 's called a recession or not is of no consequence , " Bernanke said .
WHAT HE SAID : Read Bernanke 's testimony
The central bank chief also declined to give a specific price tag for a stimulus plan but said it should be " significant . "
Bernanke did say Congress should structure the legislation to boost spending when the economy is weakest , minimize long - term deficits and get credit flowing through direct loans , loan guarantees or tax credits .
" With the economy likely to be weak for several quarters , and with some risk of a protracted slowdown , consideration of a fiscal package … seems appropriate , " Bernanke said .
At the White House , which has been lukewarm , press secretary Dana Perino told reporters that President Bush is open to a stimulus bill , depending on how it 's structured .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Republican nominee John McCain have laid out plans , as have House and Senate leaders .
The two political parties have areas of agreement — such as enhancing unemployment benefits — but differ on tax policy and Democratic plans to spend on infrastructure such as roads or bridges .
Congress could come back in a special lame - duck session after the Nov. 4 election to consider stimulus legislation .
Brookings Institution economist Martin Baily told the panel a $ 150 billion to $ 300 billion measure would be appropriate .
Congress , in February , passed a $ 168 billion stimulus bill with consumer tax rebates and business tax cuts .
He said the timing of any rebound depends on how fast financial and credit markets recover .
On the plus side , he said , the recent rapid drop in oil and other commodity prices should ease inflation .
That would give the Fed more room to cut interest rates to boost growth .
Policymakers meet Oct. 28 - 29 to consider rates .
Lawmakers repeatedly told Bernanke that their constituents are frustrated by recent federal actions aimed more at Wall Street than Main Street .
Bernanke said all efforts have been aimed at helping regular workers .
If Congress had not passed the $ 700 billion rescue package on Oct. 3 , the nation would have had a " very severe financial crisis . "
Cop groupies , naval warfare nerds and gas - starved SUV moms around the world all had the same hero last week : the Indian Navy .
The Subcontinental squids announced that they had struck the first blow for law ’n ’order on the high seas by sinking a Somali pirate “ mother ship ” off Yemen .
Their timing was perfect .
The pirates had been looting every ship in the Indian Ocean for weeks with no retaliation .
Once again , the Somalis were doin ’ it old - school , on the cheap , making the rich countries look weak by facing them down armed with no more than our old friend the RPG .
Then came the news that the impudent bastards ’ “ mother ship ” had been blown out of the water .
The Indian press was so excited they were sweating their forehead dots off .
This was the sure sign of coming world dominance .
First you build the world ’s cheapest car — well , OK , the Tata has n’t exactly pushed Toyota into a panic — but we sure can blast those pirates , ca n’t we ?
They had a point , historically .
Pirate - busting is a time - honored way for up - and - coming world powers to strut their stuff when yellow - bellied old players wo n’t act .
That ’s how the “ shores of Tripoli ” made it into the USMC ’s hymn .
It was too good to be true .
In fact , war fans , here ’s a big , useful tip for doing your own war - nerding : if the story seems too good to be true — like , too heroic , too Chuck Norris , too perfectly - timed — it probably is .
War produces some genuine heroism but most of it never gets reported because heroes have the this habit of dying just when they ’re being most heroic .
So a lot of the heroism you do hear about comes because some news agency or other needs a good story .
Any time something like this happens — evil pirates getting blasted just when they ’re at their most dastardly — your first instinct should be “ Who says ? ”
For a good sober way to think about war , always remember the Congo , or the Eastern Front in 1944 : it ’s slow , grim stuff , not an action movie .
And this story was always too much like a movie .
For me , the nagging little problem was that “ mother ship ” bit .
It sounded like the Indian Navy had been watching Independence Day a few too many times .
Why would they need a “ mother ship ” ?
They just wait for a big fat target to come along and zip out to it in fast open boats , showing an RPG tube or two to ensure cooperation .
Nobody on a freighter or tanker full of fuel wants to see what happens when one of an RPG warhead blasts through the hull .
And since they were designed to cut through tank armor , nobody doubts they can .
Of course , there was a theory that would explain the “ mother ship ” notion : the Somalis are operating off Yemen , far from their home bases in Puntland .
Most of the captures they ’ve made have been closer to Yemen than Somalia , and the blasted “ mother ship ” was hit off the southern coast of Yemen .
So maybe , just maybe , they needed a “ mother ship ” to keep them supplied , give them a place to rest up between zips out to capture passing ships far from shore .
But what “ mother ship ” really meant was “ not your typical pirate boat at all . ”
In fact , it just came out in the world press that this mother was no pirate but a humble Thai fishing boat .
How do you say “ Whoopsie ! ” in Hindi ?
Another good question would be , what ’s a dead Thai fisherman worth , times 14 ?
Because there were 15 Thai crew on that fishing boat , and only one survived bombardment by the Indian navy frigate Tabar .
That ’s a lot of insurance payments , if you can hope to get money out of another country ’s navy operating in international waters .
The Indian Navy has already started the weaseling - out - of - responsibility process , a vitally important service for any modern navy .
The Navy spokesman said the trawler was a pirate ship “ in description and intent . ” I love that .
It gets back to everybody ’s favorite in - class debate trick , “ Define ‘ pirate ship ’ … I mean who can say what ’s a pirate ship and what ’s not ?
It ’s like ‘ love , ’ what ’s love ?
The love between a parent and a child , or a dog and a cat … ”
And so , your honor , we done blasted 14 shrimp fishermen right out of their Pad Thai .
What exactly does it mean to be a pirate ship in “ description and intent ” ?
I ’m guessing “ description ” means “ Uh , it had pirates on it and it was floating . ”
Which is true , you have to give the Mumbai mumblers that one : the Thai boat had been already hijacked by pirates , and according to the officers who gave the order to blast it , “ Pirates were seen roaming the deck with rocket - propelled grenade launchers . ”
And what I love about these Somalis is that those deck - roamin ’ Jack Sparrows “ responded ” to the frigate ’s call to heave to by “ saying [ they ] would blow up the Indian ship . ”
That ’s my boyeeeez !
A handful of Somalis with a couple of shoulder - fired Russian RPGs that were probably older than they were responded to a friggin ’ frigate , a high - tech blue - water full - size naval frigate , god damn it , by threatening to blow it up !
You ca n’t beat the Somalis .
Win or lose , I love these guys .
And for you bleeding hearts out there , the eeeeeevil pirates have n’t even been killing people .
On the contrary , according to news reports the pirate chiefs have actually hired local chefs to cook up primo gourmet meals for their hostages while they wait for the ransom to arrive .
This is business for these guys .
And let ’s not get all weepy about this Thai fishing boat either .
I love Thais , well their noodles anyway , and their war elephants and naturally muay Thai , but look , why do you think the whole population of coastal Somalia suddenly went pirate ?
Because the fish they used to catch are gone , vanished , keeping company with the Dodo and other former fauna of the Indian Ocean — thanks to the Asian fishing fleets that took advantage of the fact that Somalia has no government to zoom over and drop the big nets , the ones that take every last clam and beer bottle off the ocean floor .
There are no fish to fish any more .
So the Somalis , instead of waiting for a handout , went to work with what they had .
If life hands you lemons , grab your RPG and lasso a supertanker , as I believe Maya Angelou once said in her inspirational book , I Sure Am Funny - Looking .
Now in military terms the key question on the deck of that Indian frigate , the Tabar , would have been , what do you do ?
Do you blast the “ mother ship ” out of the mother - lovin ’ ocean with deck guns or do you board it , risking casualties and nasty holes in your nice clean hull ?
For your average spit and polish naval officer , whatever country , that ’s a no-brainer .
Ask any ex-Navy guy and what they love the most is practicing with the deck guns , totally useless in modern war but fun as Hell , using mid-size 57 mm rapid - fire models , basically varmint plinkers , the navy version of a farmer ’s .22 .
And how the ranks had a chance to actually use the damn thing and get on the BBC !
A legitimate target !
Live video games for everybody !
The temptation would have been too much for any red - blooded navy man .
In hindsight , sure , they could have asked , “ Any civilian crew with you pirates over there ?
Are you an evil alien mother ship or just , y’know , a shrimp boat outta Pattaya ? ”
But hindsight is 20 / 20 , or in this case 57 mm .
Kaboom !
And the world press had a new hero — for about four news cycles , until those widows in Pattaya started asking when hubby was coming home with his shrimp money .
And I ’ll bet you the story about how it was just a fishing boat after all wo n’t get a tenth of the play that “ Mother Ship Blasted ! ” story had last week .
And they say the media do n’t report the good news !
Truth is , they do — even when it ’s pure bullshit .

Oh , the delicious shapes !
Let 's begin with some truisms : a newspaper is not a blog - not even its online version .
Conversely , a blog is not a newspaper .
However , newspapers have been in the toilet lately , partly due to the proliferation of blogs .
One easy pseudo - solution some newspapers have settled on is to act more and more like blogs .
After all , this 2.0 world is all about " You , " the user , which in practice means it 's all about a false sense of democracy through publication of comments and user - generated content - just like a common blog .
After the jump : why newspapers should stop slumming as blogs and disallow comments .
Comments are thought to be an added value to a newspaper 's site — providing another reason to read .
You come for the article , and stay for the interesting discussion .
The only problem is , there is no interesting discussion .
Almost never .
Not even from the mythical supersmart New York Times readers .
Let 's take some examples from the weekend press .
First , there was New York Times reporter David Carr 's book excerpt in the NYT Magazine , a reported memoir of his crack addiction , recklessly bad behavior , and subsequent redemption .
Sample comments , notable only in how uneducated and un-thoughtful they were ?
" if he was n't a reporter for the new york times , would we be reading this ? "
" Monetizing your shameful past is disgusting .
Have n't you harmed your loved ones enough for one lifetime ? "
" Who cares .
grow some guts .
we all have problems .
most of us do n't blame drugs or alcohol ... you want a medal for doing your job and being a father ? "
Opening a deeply personal article up to the peanut gallery does these writers a great disservice — and yes , I include Emily Gould here , whose NYT Mag article was similarly pilloried in the comments section .
( Thanks for writing ; your check is in the mail , and oh — have fun getting senselessly torn apart in the comments .
No , there 's nothing we can do about it — it's 2.0 ! )
Some people argue that comments are the modern - day equivalent of the letter to the editor .
( Remember when people used to sit down and put five , maybe ten minutes of thought into what they wanted to tell a media outlet ? )
A look at a Daily News story says otherwise : they reported over the weekend on a strip club bust , a tangled story that involved some prostitution and possible money - laundering .
Readers ' reactions in the comments ?
" W - h - o - r-e , " read one comment , in its entirety .
Brilliant !
Perhaps newspapers , if they insist on allowing comments , should use the " letter to the editor " format for their comments .
Would " W - h - o - r - e " be a printable letter to the editor in the print version of the Daily News ?
Probably not .
It 's not well - argued or intelligent , however succinct .
So why allow it as a comment ?
( Also , why does a news story need to be opened up for comments in the first place ? )
You could argue that newspapers should rigorously vet and moderate their comments , or at least require them to use their full names .
I 'd argue that this is a silly misuse of their time ; I 'm not suggesting that newspapers should actively patrol their comments , like this and some other websites do .
( We 're a blog ; comments are in our blood . )
I 'm suggesting they get rid of them altogether .
( This does n't include the blog sections of various papers , which the NYT and Washington Post are stuffed full of . )
Newspapers have more important things to do than worry about comments — like , say , report the stories that blogs so desperately need in their 24 - 7 quest for content !
After all , blogs are often not equipped to regularly break the news , and we need content to chew on .
As Arthur Sulzberger 's relation Benjamin Dolnick lamented in the comments section of Carr's NYT story ( noticed by Choire Sicha at Radar ) : " If you ever want to lose faith in humanity , read any comments section on the internet . "
P.S. Also , nobody wants to hear the tired old " free speech " argument as a defense of comments .
We 've had free speech in this country for well over two hundred years , long before it was ever an option to comment on newspaper websites and blogs .
The foreign nonunion auto companies located in the South have a plan to reduce wages and benefits at their factories in the United States .
And to do it , they need to destroy the United Auto Workers .
Last week , Senate Republicans from some Southern states went to work trying to do just that , on the foreign car companies ’ behalf .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) and Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R - Ala . ) -- representatives from states that subsidize companies such as Honda , Volkswagen , Toyota and Nissan -- first tried to force the UAW to take reductions in wages and benefits as a condition for supporting the auto industry bailout bill .
When the UAW refused , those senators torpedoed the bill .
They claimed that they could n’t support the bill without specifics about how wages would be “ restructured . ”
They did n’t , however , require such specificity when it came to bailing out the financial sector .
Their grandstanding , and the government ’s generally lackluster response to the auto crisis , highlight many of the problems that have caused our current economic mess : the lack of concern about manufacturing , the privileged way our government treats the financial sector , and political support given to companies that attempt to slash worker ’s wages .
When one compares how the auto industry and the financial sector are being treated by Congress , the double standard is staggering .
In the financial sector , employee compensation makes up a huge percentage of costs .
According to the New York state comptroller , it accounted for more than 60 % of 2007 revenues for the seven largest financial firms in New York .
Advertisement
At Goldman Sachs , for example , employee compensation made up 71 % of total operating expenses in 2007 .
In the auto industry , by contrast , autoworker compensation makes up less than 10 % of the cost of manufacturing a car .
Hundreds of billions were given to the financial - services industry with barely a question about compensation ; the auto bailout , however , was sunk on this issue alone .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger realized that the existence of the union was under attack , which is why he refused to give in to the Senate Republicans ’ demands that the UAW make further concessions .
I say “ further ” because the union has already conceded a lot .
Its 2007 contract introduced a two - tier contract to pay new hires $ 15 an hour ( instead of $ 28 ) with no defined pension plan and dramatic cuts to their health insurance .
In addition , the UAW agreed that healthcare benefits for existing retirees would be transferred from the auto companies to an independent trust .
With the transferring of the healthcare costs , the labor cost gap between the Big Three and the foreign transplants will be almost eliminated by the end of the current contracts .
These concessions go some distance toward leveling the playing field ( retiree costs are still a factor for the Big Three ) .
But what the foreign car companies want is to level -- which is to say , wipe out -- the union .
They currently discourage their workforce from organizing by paying wages comparable to the Big Three ’s UAW contracts .
In fact , Toyota ’s per -hour wages are actually above UAW wages .
However , an internal Toyota report , leaked to the Detroit Free Press last year , reveals that the company wants to slash $ 300 million out of its rising labor costs by 2011 .
The report indicated that Toyota no longer wants to “ tie [ itself ] so closely to the U.S. auto industry . ”
Instead , the company intends to benchmark the prevailing manufacturing wage in the state in which a plant is located .
The Free Press reported that in Kentucky , where the company is headquartered , this wage is $ 12.64 an hour , according to federal labor statistics , less than half Toyota ’s $ 30 - an - hour wage .

If the companies , with the support of their senators , can wipe out or greatly weaken the UAW , they will be free to implement their plan .
But their plan will not work .
The Bush administration is likely to keep the Big Three alive long enough for President - elect Barack Obama to construct a real solution .
Democrats and even most Republicans understand that a nation that has already lost 2 million jobs this year cannot afford to put at risk 3 million more .
What the economy needs now is rising wages so the country can get on the path of wage - driven consumption growth .
That means stronger unions .
Indeed , I believe eventually it will mean the unionization of the entire U.S. auto industry .

An Anonymous reader who is part of a team that works for a small company , maintaining a messy codebase of a large and expensive company writes , " We were having trouble finding why a particular PL / SQL Stored Procedure was failing .
Inside the SP , we found the following :
IF .. AND p_program_name <> '[ executable name ] .exe '
THEN RAISE invalid_calling_pgm ; END IF ;
" Yes , the stored procedure is actually checking the filename of the program it 's being called from , apparently because the client wanted that particular stored procedure to do something completely different when called from a different source .
We overlook it , since it has the correct filename , and go back to scratching our heads . "
" Ten minutes later , a co-worker comes back to me and announces that he has found out why it fails .
He has realised that when running the code in debug mode - or from the IDE at all - the exe name is prepended by .vshost.exe ... and hence the DB call bails . "
" Yes , folks , our database code is not only dependant on the filename of the main client project executable but , because of this , follows a totally differnet code path when run from the IDE . "

The Senate could not agree on an auto bailout package .
So what may happen now ?
The Treasury may lend the Big Three about $ 15 billion under the authority given to it in the TARP legislation to buy any financial instrument necessary to promote financial market stability .
This authority was thus not to do any specific thing but to do what in the judgment of Henry Paulson would help fix the system .
So Congress basically gave the Fixer an almost blank check .
This supports the general point made by F.A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom that comprehensive economic planning and democracy are incompatible .
This is because there is no natural consensus when the State moves beyond a fairly confined sphere of action .
( See my previous post “ The Unity of the People ” . )
If there is to be an effective “ consensus ” ( in this case , a Senate majority or super - majority ) it must come out of the usual log-rolling .
But in this case there were too many doubts , too many disagreements , and too many people were fed up with the idea of throwing good money after bad .
But planning , in the name of the emergency , must be swift , targeted , agile ; it cannot depend on the drawn - out processes of legislation culminating in inaction or action - too - late to counter the cycle .
Hayek ’s words in Chapter V of The Road to Serfdom ( “ Planning and Democracy ” ) are quite relevant .
As the scope of State action increases beyond the minimum sphere ,
Parliaments come to be regarded as ineffective “ talking shops , ” unable or incompetent to carry out the tasks for which they have been chosen .
The conviction grows that if efficient planning is to be done , the direction must be “ taken out of politics ” and placed in the hands of experts – permanent officials or independent autonomous bodies ( p. 62 ) .
What is the role of Congress or parliaments in all this ?
Its Bills would take the form of general formulae conferring wide powers on the appropriate government departments … ( p. 63 ) .
Compare now the recent comments by Robert Reich on his blog :
What now for the automakers ?
The Troubled Assets Relief Program — TARP — was enacted to save Wall Street but it ’s already been so twisted out of its original shape by Hank Paulson that a bit more twisting to save the Big Three from bankruptcy over the next few weeks wo n’t be difficult .
The White House was behind the auto rescue , and Bush does n’t want to leave yet another failure on the portico as he leaves .
Democrats certainly wo n’t object , and Senate Republicans will growl but so what ?
This statement “ nicely ” exemplifies both the slippery slope tendency I recently blogged about ( here ) and the frustration ( disregard ? ) about democracy in the name of the emergency .
Planners know what is best ; there is no time for disagreement by the ignorant ( Senate Republicans ? ) .
Obviously , this problem of the erosion of democracy inherent in the administrative state did not begin with the current financial crisis .
But the current crisis is certainly accelerating the trend .
( This , of course , is in addition to the erosion of democracy brought on by the “ war on terror . ”
That is another story . )
What is the end - game ?
I am not predicting full - scale serfdom .
I am saying that if we do n’t count the costs of the desperate policy acts which we have witnessed and probably will continue to witness , we shall lose more and more freedom – both political and , of course , individual .
The US Supreme Court has agreed to take up the case of Ali Saleh al - Marri , a graduate student and suspected Al Qaeda sleeper agent who has been held without charge in a US military prison for more than five years .
The high court made the announcement on Friday after its private conference .
The case poses the most significant unresolved legal question yet in the Bush administration 's controversial approach to the war on terror , and it sets the stage for another potential landmark national security decision next June .
At issue is whether the president has the power to order someone who is legally present in the United States to be held in indefinite military detention as an " enemy combatant . "
The Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 5 to 4 in July that Congress had given the president the power to declare and hold enemy combatants , including individuals who are legally present in the US .
Lawyers for Mr. Marri are appealing that decision , saying civilians in the US may only be detained through the criminal - justice system .
They are asking the nation 's highest court to state clearly what the law is and what it requires .
" The lower court has replaced settled and historic protections with confusion , " writes Marri 's lawyer , Jonathan Hafetz of the American Civil Liberties Union , in his brief to the court .
" The Fourth Circuit has cast a pall over the physical liberty of all persons in the United States . "
The Marri case will not be argued and decided for many months , well after the departure of President Bush and the arrival of the Obama administration .
Mr. Hafetz says the US has long barred military action against civilians within US borders .
Congress has authorized war fighting and the holding of enemy combatants overseas , but lawmakers have insisted that the criminal justice system , not the military , be used to safeguard Americans at home , Hafetz says .
Government lawyers say that shortly after the 9/11 attacks , Congress passed a law called the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) .
They say that law granted the president broad power to designate civilians in the US - or anywhere - enemy combatants in the war on terror .
Once so designated , they may be held by the military for as long as the war on terror continues , they say .
Marri is no different than Mohammed Atta and the other 9/11 hijackers , government lawyers say .
" There can be no serious doubt that Congress , in passing the AUMF , sought to authorize the use of ' all necessary and appropriate force ' against aliens who have come to the United States to take an active part in al Qaeda terror operations , " writes Solicitor General Gregory Garre in his brief urging the court not to take up the case .
He says the AUMF was written to " protect United States citizens both at home and abroad . "
Marri 's lawyers argue that the government 's power to capture prisoners on a battlefield and hold those prisoners for the duration of hostilities does not apply to civilians in the US , who are far removed from any actual battlefield .
Government lawyers counter that the battlefield in the war on terror extends worldwide , including within US borders .
Al Qaeda operatives may be held by the US military regardless of where they are captured , they say .
Marri is a citizen of both Saudi Arabia and Qatar .
He has been held in US custody nearly seven years .
For the last five years he 's been detained without charge as an enemy combatant in a 9 - foot by 6 - foot cell at the US Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , S.C .
US officials suspect Marri was sent to America by Osama bin Laden to carry out a second wave of terror attacks after the 9/11 attacks .
They say he was plotting to wreak havoc on the US financial system by hacking into bank and other databases .
In addition , he received Al Qaeda training in the use of poisons , according to the government .
Marri 's lawyers deny the allegations .
Once in military custody , intelligence officials tried to pressure Marri into confessing .
His lawyers say he was subject to harsh interrogation tactics .
It is unclear what he told interrogators .
Solicitor General Garre urged the high court to reject Marri 's appeal .
He said the case should return to a federal judge in South Carolina where Marri would be given an opportunity to fight the allegations against him in a court hearing .
Hafetz says the central issue in the Marri case has been in some stage of litigation for nearly seven years .
" The permissible bounds of the executive 's domestic detention authority remain shockingly ill - defined , " he says .
" The issue before the court is not whether the government 's allegations are true , " Hafetz says .
" It is whether the government must prove those allegations in a criminal trial , with the full safeguards of the criminal process .
Further proceedings on remand will not affect or clarify that legal question . "
Hafetz says the appeals court decision in Marri 's case gives broad authority for the government to hold US citizens in open - ended military detention without charge .
" The Fourth Circuit 's decision has profound repercussions , " he writes .
" It grants the executive discretion to displace the constitutional protections of the criminal justice system , including the right to speedy presentment , confrontation , and trial by jury , merely by alleging a connection to possible terrorist activity . "
Garre said the case does not involve whether American citizens can be detained as enemy combatants .
He noted that Marri is a foreign national , not a citizen .
Most creditors believe that the debtor needs to take the lead in addressing their own problems .
China is , apparently , no different .
Geoff Dyer of the Financial Times reports :
Wang Qishan , a vice premier and leader of the Chinese delegation at the two - day talks , called on the US to take swift action to address the crisis and said the two countries needed to work together .
“ We hope the US side will take the necessary measures to stabilise the economy and financial markets as well as guarantee the safety of China ’s assets and investments in the US , ” Mr Wang said .
Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the Chinese central bank , urged the US to rebalance its economy .
“ Over-consumption and a high reliance on credit is the cause of the US financial crisis , ” Mr Zhou said .
“ As the largest and most important economy in the world , the US should take the initiative to adjust its policies , raise its savings ratio appropriately and reduce its trade and fiscal deficits . ”
Jim Fallows ’ interview with Gao Xiqing has a similar tone : the US should treat its creditors rather more nicely .
Fair enough .
China now almost certainly has well over $ 1 trillion in US Treasury and Agency bonds , and probably close to $ 1.5 trillion in total dollar exposure ( more on that next week ) .
That is a lot by any measure -- more than really makes sense .
On the other hand , I hope that Chinese policy makers recognize :
a) They , not the US , decided to intervene heavily and in sustained way to hold their exchange rate down , a policy that necessarily implies financial losses for China .
China is effectively overpaying for financial assets ( dollar reserves ) that it does n’t need in order to support its export sector .
There is no way the US can guarantee China against losses on its holdings of dollars .
b ) Investors in highly leveraged financial institutions risk large losses .
China ’s discomfort with its current losses suggests it never should have bought large stakes in major financial institutions .
One of the concerns Larry Summers raised about sovereign wealth fund investments in large financial institutions is such investments would turn the always difficult decision to wipe out the equity of a failed financial institution into a foreign policy decision .
That rings true .
c ) Given how much the US imports from China , it is hard to see how the US can increase its savings ( and reduce its trade deficit ) without putting pressure on China ’s export sector .
Indeed , right now the US consumer seems to be following PBoC governor Zhou ’s advice to save more - that is one reason why China ’s exports have slowed .
And that hardly has made Chinese policy makers happy .
Right now a smaller US fiscal deficit would imply even bigger falls in global demand for China ’s products .
d ) If China wants to maintain its trade surplus -- and in the process to maintain a world where China ’s exports are growing faster than the world ’s imports , meaning that China ’s global market share is rising -- other countries will necessarily have to run a trade deficit .
If oil remains in the 40s , some of that deficit will likely come from the world ’s oil exporters .
But they can finance their deficit by selling existing US and European assets .
They wo n’t necessary need to take on new debt and borrow China ’s surplus .
A lot of the offsetting deficit will likely come from the US .
By the same token , China can only save more than it invests if someone else invests more than it saves , and thus needs to borrow from the rest of the world -- just as the US can only invest more than it saves if someone else ( like China ’s government ) is willing to lend it the funds it needs .
There are n’t many places in the world that are likely to absorb China ’s projected $ 400 billion current account surplus .
Chinese complains about loose US policy are a bit at odds with other Chinese policy choices that are aimed at supporting China ’s exports .
I would have more sympathy for China ’s concerns about its export sector -- and the loss of jobs in its export sector -- if :
a) China was n’t running a large current account surplus as a result of policy choices in this decade that had the predictable result of leading to over - investment in China ’s export sector , and thus increased China ’s vulnerability to a global slowdown ( click here for a summary of the article I linked to above that is not behind a firewall ) .
b ) If China was n’t still widely forecast to grow more rapidly than almost anyone else , which admittedly is n’t saying all that much right now .
c ) If China did n’t have the capacity to support employment through a large domestic stimulus .
For example , the World Bank is forecasting a smaller swing in China ’s fiscal balance in 2009 than seems likely in the US .
d ) If China had n’t pursued a capital intensive development path that has been creating many jobs for a long - time .
Effectively China has substituted capital - intensive exports for labor - intensive exports ; remember , it is exporting way more in 2008 than in 2007 .
e ) If Chinese exports were n’t expected to grow faster ( or shrink by less ) than the world ’s imports .
Remember China has been gaining global market share for the past several years .
And yes , that is something that is , in my view , directly tied to the exchange rate -- China ’s market share in Europe soared after the RMB fell v the euro .
The World Bank forecasts that this will continue in 2009 even with the RMB ’s recent broad appreciation ...
( See figure 2 and the table on p. 9 of the World Bank Quarterly )
The slump in global trade -- Korea ’s exports were way down in November , and given US auto sales , Japan ’s exports likely will be too -- is sure to increase trade tensions .
And as China starts to realize the costs of its export subsidies -- and the fact that avoiding incurring financial losses on its existing investment requires making an ever bigger financial bet on the US and the US dollar -- it sure seems that China wants a bit more say over US policy .
That too is a potential source of tension .
China effectively choose to loose money lending to the US when it scaled up its purchases of dollars to resist pressure for the RMB to appreciate and in the process subsidize its export sector .
But I doubt China sees it that way .
Banks 'use credit crunch to milk borrowers of £ 3bn '
Banks were accused of ' milking ' nearly £ 3 billion extra cash from homeowners and blaming the credit crunch .
High Street lenders have made the money by raising their mortgage rates and fees over the past year , even though interest rate cuts have made it cheaper for some of them to borrow money .
A new study calculates that the country 's five biggest banks - Halifax , HSBC , Barclays , Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland - are raking in £ 2.8 billion more from mortgage borrowers compared to last year .
Halifax is one of several large banks to have profited by increasing their mortgage rates and fees
The news is bound to anger homeowners , who have seen budgets coming under massive pressure from rises in food and energy bills - and other bank charges .
Figures from the personal finance website Moneyfacts .co.uk show the average rate on a five - year fixed mortgage have risen by 0.43 per cent to 6.76 per cent since July last year .
However , a key wholesale interest rate used by banks , called the two - year swap rate , fell from 6.29 per cent to 5.66 per cent .
The figures are used in Monday 's Channel 4 Dispatches documentary on the credit crunch called How the Banks Never Lose .
On the basis of these figures , banks can potentially make an extra £ 2.8 billion over the course of a year from mortgage customers .
RBS , Barclays and others have lost tens of billions since the credit crunch erupted last August after buying toxic assets linked to low - income U.S. mortgages .
Over the past year banks have raised their borrowing rates and forced through sizeable rises in mortgage arrangement and credit card fees as they try to shore up their battered finances .
Their sky - high borrowing costs have frozen tens of thousands of first - time buyers out of the property market , putting further pressure on house prices .
Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Vince Cable said : ' The banks are milking overstretched families to make up for their previous mistakes .
' They 're trying to have it both ways , squeezing as much as they can out of their customers while running to the government for help . '
Earlier this year Chancellor Alistair Darling threw a £ 50 billion lifeline to the biggest banks by allowing them to swap huge swathes of home loans for iron - clad government bonds .
The move was designed to kick - start the property market .
Mr Cable says the Government should hold a wide - ranging probe into the banks ' conduct .
He said : ' The whole system of bank charging has been brought into disrepute . '
Melanie Bien , of mortgage broker Savills Private Finance , said : ' The banks have been frank about how they want to increase profit margins on their mortgage products , and that 's exactly what they 're doing .
' Last year there was fierce competition for new business - now that 's just not the case . '
Recent financial results show banks clawing back their sub - prime losses .
RBS has increased profits at its UK arm by nearly ten per cent , to £ 1.1 billion .
Some £ 158 million may have come from higher mortgage charges , according to the survey .
Halifax , Britain 's biggest lender , is estimated to have profited by £ 1.5 billion after upping its five - year fixed rate by 0.5 per cent .
A spokesman denied using the credit crunch as a smokescreen to raise charges .
He added : ' Today we announced yet another raft of mortgage rate reductions - our fifteenth this year .
We price in line with the market . '
Halifax to close some estate agent branches
Halifax announced it is closing 53 of its 200 estate agents branches as a result of the housing market downturn .
The closures will lead to up to 100 job cuts , although the group said the majority of staff in the affected branches would be transferred to similar roles in its banks .

A 10 - year - old apprentice matador fought and killed six young bulls at the weekend in southern Mexico a few hours after a ban on the controversial corrida was overturned .
Michel Lagravere , known as Michelito , performed before a crowd of about 4,000 in the bullring of his home city , Merida .
The president of the ring awarded him the honour of two bull ears , and he was carried out of the ring on the shoulders of his admirers .
" I am happy to have achieved this great victory , " Michelito said after the fight , Agence France Press reported .
His entourage said a video would be sent to Guinness World Records to claim the record of being the youngest bullfighter to kill so many calves .
Pressure from anti-bullfighting activists and child rights groups had earlier prompted the local child protection agency to prohibit Michelito 's Saturday fight on the grounds that he should not be allowed to put his life in danger .
" No one can stop me fighting , " the boy had told local newspaper Diario de Yucatan in defiant mood on Friday .
The ban was overturned shortly after .
Michelito started playing with a cape at the age of four and was facing bulls at six .
Encouraged by his French father , a former bullfighter , the boy killed his first calf in public at the age of nine .
He has fought in about 100 corridas and never had a serious accident .
" I have no reason to forbid him from his passion and I think people will understand me , " Michelito 's mother , Diana Peniche , said before Saturday 's fight .
" People who 've followed my son 's career have seen that the boy has special qualities . "
Banned from fighting in Spain , where the minimum age is 16 , the prodigy has been seen mainly in Latin America were rules are more relaxed .
Before killing six bulls this weekend in Mexico , his record had been four in the Peruvian capital , Lima .
Several fights by Michelito were banned in France last summer amid protests and he has been singled out by anti-bullfighting activists because , unlike most other child matadors , he always seeks to end a fight with a kill .
" People throw money at me but I am not paid a salary , just my expenses .
I do n't do it for money , that will come later , " Michelito told Diario de Yucatan .
" At the moment , I just want to be allowed to fight bulls .
I was born a bull fighter and I will die one . "
Now more than a year after its release , Team Fortress 2 , Valve 's stylish class - based first - person shooter , still draws dozens of servers full of skilled players at any given moment .
From day one , it 's provided players with an extremely satisfying multiplayer experience .
But while the core gameplay is as strong as ever , it 's not what has kept the TF2 community thriving well past day 400 .
For that , you can thank Valve 's ongoing improvements , additions and adjustments to the game .
New downloadable maps and gameplay modes in the months following a game 's initial launch have become commonplace , but the slew of class - specific unlockable achievements and special weapon upgrades that Valve is slowly rolling out for each of the nine playable classes in TF2 have tremendously boosted the title 's replayability .
Unlocking these class upgrades requires you to rack up a number of challenging achievements .
Fortunately , the task is highly addictive and the rewards extremely satisfying .
TF2 has existed in some form or another for around eight years , according to Valve 's Robin Walker .
One of the creators of the original Team Fortress mod , Walker says the version of the sequel that hit store shelves along with The Orange Box took about a year and a half to build , but it benefited from numerous gameplay experiments Valve tinkered with during the lengthy development cycle .
While the game transformed substantially from one iteration to the next , the team 's drive to improve the gameplay based on player feedback continues to usher in many additional and exciting changes .
Class Warfare
" We always planned to continue evolving TF2 after shipping , but it was n't planned that we 'd focus on class updates , " says Walker .
Shortly after launch , his team immediately set about the task of releasing frequent , smaller updates to the game via Valve 's Steam service .
These updates made subtle improvements to gameplay and performance but did n't garner much attention or draw many new players to the game .
Eventually , the team switched tactics , focusing instead on releasing larger chunks of high - profile content featuring tangible changes to each of the game 's character classes , in addition to minor bug - fixes and balance tweaks .
The first of three major updates rolled out in 2008 focused on the Medic class , giving players 36 new achievements to unlock three new items .
It also introduced a new map and Payload , a new game mode .
The next substantial update focused on the Pyro class , adding more achievements and unlockable weapons to the pile .
It also added a compressed air blaster to the default flamethrower and two new player - created maps .
A massive third update provided the Heavy class with extra achievements , boxing gloves , a new minigun , a health - restoring snack , a new arena mode and more extra maps .
The team quickly discovered hinging updates on each of the nine character classes got the response from players they were looking for .
" The updates we 've released have had a considerable impact on both the ongoing player numbers and the sales of the product , " says Walker .
Not only has each update drawn in many new players , but a substantial number of them stay after the initial spike in interest .

Where did the melamine come from ?
Two theories of melamine contamination
Secret tests and public lies
( Natural News )
Up to 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the United States may be contaminated with trace amounts of melamine , the toxic chemical linked to kidney damage , according to recent tests .
The FDA 's test results , which the agency hid from the public and only released after the Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request , showed that Nestle , Mead Johnson and Enfamil infant formula products were all contaminated with melamine .
The AP is also reporting that Abbott Laboratories conducted its own in - house tests that detected trace levels of melamine in its formula products .
Together , these infant formula manufacturers make about 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the United States .
Prior to these test results being made public , the FDA had published a document on its website that explained there was no safe level of melamine contamination in infant formula .
Specifically , the FDA stated , " FDA is currently unable to establish any level of melamine and melamine - related compounds in infant formula that does not raise public health concerns .
"
Once tests found melamine in U.S. - made formula products , however , the FDA changed its story .
As of today , the FDA has now officially declared melamine to be safe in infant formula as long as the contamination level is less than one part per million ( 1 ppm ) .
Astonishingly : Rather than being based on science , the FDA 's decision appears to be based entirely on creating cover for U.S. infant formula manufacturers whose products were found to be contaminated with melamine .
The " acceptable " level of contamination ( 1 ppm ) is conveniently just above the levels found in U.S. infant formula products , thus placing U.S. infant formula in the " safe " contamination level category .
And yet the FDA has conducted no safety testing whatsoever to determine whether 1 ppm of melamine is safe for infants to consume .
There is no science involved in this decision whatsoever .
Rather than this decision being based on science , the FDA is once again resorting to politically - motivated decisions that seek to protect the profits of Big Business rather than the safety of infants and children .
Recall that the FDA also recently declared Bisphenol - A to be safe for infants to consume , even while countries like Canada banned the chemical from baby bottles .
The FDA , it seems has never met a corporate - sponsored chemical it did n't like .
Laughingly , the FDA claims the 1ppm of melamine in U.S. infant formula must have come from the manufacturing machines or food packaging equipment .
And yet the AP is reporting that the expected level of melamine contamination from manufacturing equipment is only 15 ppb ( parts per billion ) .
But the FDA 's own tests on Mead Johnson infant formula reveal it to contain 245 ppb , or 1600 % more than what would be expected to exists due to melamine contamination from manufacturing equipment .
There are two really important questions that any intelligent consumer should be asking about all this : Question # 1 )
If the manufacturing and packaging equipment is contaminated with melamine , does this mean that ALL food products containing milk protein are similarly contaminated ?
The same companies that make infant formula also make Slim Fast , Ensure and Boost -- all are milk protein - based meal replacement products containing many of the same ingredients as infant formula .
Are they contaminated with melamine , too ?
Question # 2 ) If manufacturing and packaging machinery should only result in melamine contamination levels of 15 ppb , and yet 245 ppb were found in the infant formula , then The FDA has no explanation for this and seems to hope people will forget to ask .
I offer two theories to explain the melamine contamination of these products .
Obviously , the contamination could not be caused by the manufacturing and packaging of the product , because the melamine levels already found in U.S. infant formula products greatly exceed the expected levels from such manufacturing and packaging .
The following two theories may explain the additional levels of detected melamine .
This is what happened in China : Infant formula manufacturers added melamine to their milk protein to bulk up the product without adding much cost ( melamine is much cheaper than milk protein ) .
Because melamine 's chemical profile is strikingly similar to milk protein , it can often fool simple protein analysis tests and appear to be legitimate .
If infant formula products use any milk protein from China , it could very easily have been adulterated with melamine .
However , this is just a theory , and NaturalNews has no evidence that U.S. infant formula manufacturers actually used milk protein from China .
Thus , we do not believe Theory # 1 to be correct .
Theory # 2 , below , seems more likely .
Because melamine is passed through cow 's milk , the contamination of U.S. dairy cows with melamine through their feed could result in high melamine concentrations in the resulting milk proteins .
China has already admitted that melamine has been detected in alarming quantities in animal feed there , and tests have already shown chickens to be contaminated with the chemical .
The question today is this :
If so , then we may have a problem here that 's much , much bigger than infant formula .
We may have , which could mean that virtually all milk , yoghurt , butter and cheese produced in the U.S. might be contaminated with some level of melamine .
Again , NaturalNews has no proof that this is the situation , but the melamine must have come from somewhere .
It did n't just spontaneously generate in the infant formula as the FDA would seemingly want us to believe .
If the milk proteins in infant formula are contaminated with melamine , then it stands to reason that the milk proteins used throughout the food supply may also be contaminated .
We may , indeed , be looking at an industry - wide problem here .
Powdered milk , meal replacement products and even milk protein drinks may all be contaminated with melamine at levels similar to the infant formula products .
Because you have to follow the logic here :
Either the infant formula manufacturers ADDED melamine to their products ( highly unlikely ) , or the entire milk product industry has a melamine problem .
You can't logically conclude that these infant formula manufacturers somehow got all the melamine - contaminated milk proteins but everybody else got melamine - free milk proteins .
Milk proteins are a commodity in the food industry , and milk from thousands of different cows can all be mixed together in a single pound of milk protein .
What could be happening here is thatbecause it used cheap feed fillers from China .
At this point , this is all just a theory , but it 's a theory that makes sense .
It makes a lot more sense than the FDA 's theory that there 's no problem and babies should just keep drinking melamine ( and Bisphenol - A , for that matter ... ) and the press should stop asking questions .
There 's no doubt that these infant formula manufacturers are pursuing the very same contamination theories I 'm describing here .
They 're probably scrambling to test their milk protein sources , trying to figure out where all the extra melamine is coming from .
As usual , they 'll try to keep the test results secret , preventing this from exploding into a much larger public health issue .
The FDA , for its part , will continue to conduct any actual science in secret , preventing the public from knowing the tests results unless it is sued by organizations like the AP .
That 's assuming the FDA conducts any science at all , because now the FDA believes it can declare contaminants to be safe at a level it just invents on the spot , without conducting any science whatsoever .
The FDA is playing " Wheel of Fortune " with public safety ( https://www.naturalnews.com/023681.html ) , and it 's relying on guessing games - rather than actual science - to declare safety levels of chemicals it does n't even understand .
The upshot of all this is really quite simple :
If there was ever a reason to breastfeed your baby , this is it .
And if you 're looking for truly safe infant formula products , go with natural brands such as www.GenesisOrganics.com ) or other " natural " brands that do n't use cheap cow 's milk proteins .
After all , it 's quite clear at this point that .
You 're the only one who can protect your baby from melamine .
The FDA flat out refuses to do so .
In fact , it 's doing the opposite by declaring melamine to be safe !
Soand start feeding your baby what it was meant to consume : Human breast milk from a healthy , well - nourished mom who eats lots of omega - 3 oils and superfoods .
That 's the best infant formula in the world .
And by the way , human babies should n't be drinking bovine milk in the first place .
The whole infant formula industry was a scam long before melamine came along .
Now it 's ascam .

When the angry phone calls and emails started arriving at the office , I knew the holiday season was upon us .
A typical message shouted that we at the American Civil Liberties Union are " horrible " and " we should be ashamed of ourselves , " and then concluded with an incongruous and agitated " Merry Christmas .
"
We get this type of correspondence a lot , mostly in reaction to a well - organized attempt by extremist groups to demonize the ACLU , crush religious diversity , and make a few bucks in the process .
Sadly , this self - interested effort is being promoted in the guise of defending Christmas .
For example , the Alliance Defense Fund celebrates the season with an " It 's OK to say Merry Christmas " campaign , implying that the ACLU has challenged such holiday greetings .
( As part of the effort , you can get a pamphlet and two Christmas pins for $ 29 . )
The website WorldNetDaily touts a book claiming " a thorough and virulent anti-Christmas campaign is being waged today by liberal activists and ACLU fanatics . "
The site 's magazine has suggested there will be ACLU efforts to remove " In God We Trust " from U.S. currency , fire military chaplains , and expunge all references to God in America 's founding documents .
( Learn more for just $ 19.95 . . . ) Of course , there is no " Merry Christmas " lawsuit , nor is there any ACLU litigation about U.S. currency , military chaplains , etc .
But the facts are not important to these groups , because their real message is this :
By protecting the freedom of Muslims , Jews , and other non-Christians through preventing government entanglement with religion , the ACLU is somehow infringing on the rights of those with majority religious beliefs .
In truth , it is these website Christians who are taking the Christ out of the season .
Nowhere in the Sermon on the Mount did Jesus Christ ask that we celebrate
His birth with narrow - mindedness and intolerance , especially for those who are already marginalized and persecuted .
Instead , the New Testament — like the Torah and the Koran and countless other sacred texts — commands us to love our neighbor , and to comfort the sick and the imprisoned .
That 's what the ACLU does .
We live in a country filled with people who are sick and disabled , people who are imprisoned , and people who hunger and thirst for justice .
Those people come to our Indiana offices for help , at a rate of several hundred a week , usually because they have nowhere else to turn .
The least of our brothers and sisters sure are n't getting any help from the Alliance Defense Fund or WorldNet Daily .
So , as often as we can , ACLU secures justice for those folks who Jesus worried for the most .
As part of our justice mission , we work hard to protect the rights of free religious expression for all people , including Christians .
For example , we recently defended the First Amendment rights of a Baptist minister to preach his message on public streets in southern Indiana .
The ACLU intervened on behalf of a Christian valedictorian in a Michigan high school , which agreed to stop censoring religious yearbook entries , and supported the rights of Iowa students to distribute Christian literature at their school .
There are many more examples , because the ACLU is committed to preserving the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom for all .
We agree with the U.S. Supreme Court 's firm rulings that this freedom means that children who grow up in non-Christian homes should not be made to feel like outsiders in their own community 's courthouse , legislature or public schoolhouse .
To our " Merry Christmas " correspondents and all other Hoosiers , we wish you happy holidays .
Fran Quigley is executive director of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union , .
As of January 1 , 2006 , the organization is changing its name to ACLU of Indiana .
WASHINGTON — President - elect Barack Obama pivoted quickly to begin filling out his new administration today , selecting hard - charging Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel as White House chief of staff while aides stepped up the pace of transition work that had been cloaked in pre-election secrecy .
Several Democrats confirmed that Emanuel had been offered the job .
MSNBC reported he accepted it .
Although that was not initially confirmed , a rejection would amount to an unlikely public snub of the new president - elect within hours of an electoral college landslide .
With hundreds of jobs to fill and only 10 weeks until Inauguration Day , Obama and his transition team confronted a formidable task complicated by his anti-lobbyist campaign rhetoric .
The official campaign Web Site said no political appointees would be permitted to work on “ regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years .
And no political appointee will be able to lobby the executive branch after leaving government service during the remainder of the administration . ”
But almost exactly one year ago , on Nov. 3 , 2007 , candidate Obama went considerably further than that while campaigning in South Carolina .
“ I do n’t take a dime of their money , and when I am president , they wo n’t find a job in my White House , ” he said of lobbyists at the time .
Because they often have prior experience in government or politics , lobbyists figure as potential appointees for presidents of both parties .
On the morning after making history , the man elected the first black president had breakfast with his wife and two daughters at their Chicago home , went to a nearby gym and visited his downtown offices .
Aides said he planned no public appearances until later in the week , when he has promised to hold a news conference .
As president - elect , he begins receiving highly classified briefings from top intelligence officials Thursday .
In offering the post of White House chief of staff to Emanuel , Obama turned to a fellow Chicago politician with a far different style from his own , a man known for his bluntness as well as his single - minded determination .
Emanuel was a political and policy aide in Bill Clinton ’s White House .
Leaving that , he turned to investment banking , then won a Chicago - area House seat six years ago .
In Congress , he moved quickly into the leadership .
As chairman of the Democratic campaign committee in 2006 , he played an instrumental role in restoring his party to power after 12 years in the minority .
Emanuel maintained neutrality during the long primary battle between Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , not surprising given his long - standing ties to the former first lady and his Illinois connections with Obama .
The day after the election there already was jockeying for Cabinet appointments .
Several Democrats said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts , who won a new six - year term on Tuesday , was angling for secretary of state .
They spoke on condition of anonymity , saying they were not authorized to discuss any private conversations .
Kerry ’s spokeswoman , Brigid O’Rourke , disputed the reports .
“ It ’s not true .
It ’s ridiculous , ” she said in an interview .
Announcement of the transition team came in a written statement from the Obama camp .
The group is headed by John Podesta , who served as chief of staff under former President Clinton ; Pete Rouse , who has been Obama ’s chief of staff in the Senate , and Valerie Jarrett , a friend of the president - elect and campaign adviser .
Several Democrats described a sprawling operation well under way .
Officials had kept deliberations under wraps to avoid the appearance of overconfidence in the weeks leading to Tuesday ’s election .
They said the group was stocked with longtime associates of Obama , as well as veterans of Clinton ’s White House .
Quite apart from transition issues , Obama ’s status as an incumbent member of Congress presents issues unseen since 1960 , when John F. Kennedy moved from the Senate to the White House .
The Senate is scheduled to hold a postelection session in two weeks , and Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a news conference today to reinforce her call for quick action on a bill to stimulate the economy .
That places Obama in uncharted territory — a president - elect , presumably first among equals among congressional Democrats .
Yet his and their ability to enact legislation depends almost entirely until Inauguration Day on President Bush ’s willingness to sign it .
Obama ’s running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden , was elected to a new six - year term from Delaware on Tuesday and he must resign before he can be sworn in as vice president .
Democrats are certain to hold his seat , following Jack Markell ’s election as governor .
There has been intense speculation that Biden ’s son , Beau Biden , is interested in ascending to the seat .
But he is serving a one - year stint in Iraq as a member of the National Guard .
In the interim , outgoing Gov. Ruth Ann Minner is seen among many Democrats as a likely appointee to hold the office until an election in 2010 .
Obama also must resign his Senate seat before he can be sworn in as the 44th president .
Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich will pick a replacement .
— — —— Nedra Pickler reported from Chicago .
AP writers Liz Sidoti and Jim Kuhnhenn contributed from Washington and Glen Johnson from Boston .
CHICAGO  Little in Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich ’s background prepared the people of Illinois for the man who was revealed in the criminal complaint that dropped like a bombshell here on Tuesday .
Delusional , narcissistic , vengeful and profane , Mr. Blagojevich as portrayed by federal prosecutors shocked even his most ardent detractors .
“ I almost fell over , ” said Cindi Canary , executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform and a frequent critic of the governor .
“ I was speechless and sickened .
In all of the millions of indictments I ’ve read over the last years , I ca n’t remember anything as vile as this . ”
Mike Jacobs , a Democratic state senator and former friend of the governor , suggested that Mr. Blagojevich may have lost his grip on reality .
“ I ’m not sure he ’s playing with a full deck anymore , ” Mr. Jacobs said .
“ I think he brought a lot of this on himself .
He ’s so gifted , but so flawed in a number of fundamental areas .
It ’s like he dared the feds to come get him . ”
Japanese precision machinery manufacturer Castem has sent nine origami space shuttles to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) office in Houston , it was announced on October 7 .
If all goes as planned , the paper planes will conduct experimental flights from the space station to Earth early next year .
The 29 - gram ( 1 oz ) origami shuttles , which measure 38 centimeters ( 14 in ) long and 22 centimeter ( 9 in ) wide , are made from lightweight but durable sugar cane fiber paper that has been chemically treated to resist heat and water .
Developed by JAXA and the University of Tokyo , the special paper has already been used to construct a miniature prototype shuttle , which was tested in a hypersonic wind tunnel in January .
In that test , the prototype survived wind speeds of Mach 7 ( 8,600 kph / 5,300 mph ) and temperatures of around 200 degrees Celsius ( nearly 400 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
If NASA approves , the Space Shuttle Discovery will carry the origami planes to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in February 2009 .
JAXA astronaut Dr. Koichi Wakata , who will be living aboard ISS when the origami planes arrive , will carry out the experiment from the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module .
It is yet to be decided whether Wakata himself will throw the paper planes or whether he will use the space station 's robotic arm .
In either case , JAXA estimates it will take two days for the origami shuttles to complete the 400 - kilometer ( 250 mi ) journey from ISS to the planet surface .
A message printed beneath the wings identifies the plane , explains that it has completed a return journey from the space station , and requests the finder to contact JAXA .
The message is printed in 10 different languages , including Japanese , English , Chinese , Hindi , and Arabic .
Japan Origami Airplane Association chairman Takuo Toda , a strong proponent of the experiment , says he hopes the test flights will help engineers develop new types of lightweight spacecraft in the future .

Patients with spinal cord injuries will be first humans to receive repair cells derived from embryonic stem cells .
The first ever clinical trial using stem cells derived from embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) received the go - ahead today from the US Food and Drug Administration .
Geron Corporation , a company based in Menlo Park , California , hopes to mend the spines of patients paralysed from the chest down by injecting injury sites with stem cells that restore connections and repair damage .
“ This marks the beginning of what is potentially a new chapter in medical therapeutics , one that reaches beyond pills to a new level of healing : the restoration of organ and tissue function achieved by the injection of healthy replacement cells , ” said the company ’s president , Tom Okarma .

“ My hat is off to Geron – this is what we ’ve all been waiting for , ” says Robert Lanza , chief scientist at Advanced Cell Technology , a stem cell company in Worcester , Massachusetts .
“ It ’s been over a decade since embryonic stem cells were discovered , and this sends a message that we ’re ready at last to start helping people . ”
The trial had been “ on clinical hold ” for years over concerns that the cells could form tumours , but the FDA is now satisfied that this risk is low enough to allow the trial to proceed .
New political climate
Ethical concerns have also dogged the trial , because obtaining the cell lines involved destruction of embryos .
The previous US president , George Bush , had obstructed research using such cells for eight years to appease his conservative supporters .
However , the new president , Barack Obama , promised in his inaugural address to “ restore science to its rightful place “ , so approval of the trial could be an early sign that he will lift all the Bush restrictions on stem - cell research , first imposed in 2001 .
Hundreds of trials are already under way around the world with stem cells derived from adult or fetal tissue , but these cells are limited in the types of tissue they can turn into and repair .
The spine repair trial could open up a new era in medicine because embryonic stem cells are the only type that generate all 200 or so tissues of the body .
Revolutionary treatments
ESCs can’t be used directly , because they can form cancers called teratomas .
But they can be used in the lab to generate potentially inexhaustible supplies of all other types of cell that might be needed for repair .
The type to be used in the trial are neural stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells .
These support other neurons in the brain and nerves by supplying growth factors and by producing the myelin sheaths that protect neurons from damage .
In previous research with these cells , Geron showed that they could improve the mobility of rats whose hind legs had been made immobile by spinal injuries .
The treated rats could walk better and post - mortems showed that the injected cells had multiplied in the injury site and restored lost connections .
The hope now is that the same will happen in people .
Geron says that the main objective is to prove the cells are safe , especially given the FDA ’s earlier misgivings over the cancer risk .
But for one year after treatment , the company will also look closely for any recovery of function and movement in the lower body lost through the injury .
In all , the patients will be monitored for 15 years .
If the cells appear safe , it could open the floodgates for a host of other trials using cells originally derived from ESCs .
Geron itself has developed such cells for treating heart attacks , diabetes , bone damage , arthritis , liver failure and cancer .
Obama influence ?
The trial is the second revolutionary stem cell therapy to receive approval within a week .
On Monday , a UK company , ReNeuron , received clearance to inject stem cells into the brain , with the aim of repairing tissue damaged by strokes .
But John Sinden , chief scientist at ReNeuron , doubts whether the UK approval spurred the FDA to approve the Geron trial .
“ It ’s great news all round , ” he says .
“ It ’s like London buses , with two arriving together . ”
Sinden doubtes that Obama ’s arrival as president had any direct bearing on the outcome of the Geron trial , but it will undoubtedly have a benign influence on the FDA in the coming months .
“ You do n’t expect the FDA to move as quickly as that , ” said Sinden .
“ They probably had it in mind to approve the trial for a while . ”
As to pressure on the FDA behind the scenes from the new administration , he said he could only guess .
“ The FDA will change , and the new management will be very much aligned with Obama ’s views on stem cells , ” he said .
Sinden is now hopeful that the Geron approval could signal potential willingness by the FDA to approve ReNeuron ’s application to conduct a planned stroke trial in the US , which has been on hold for two years .
Likewise , Lanza ’s company hopes to apply to the FDA this summer to begin a trial using retinal stem cells derived from ESCs to prevent a form of blindness .

Gaza ’s suffering is sanitized .
( Hatem Omar / MaanImages )
- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
I am not sure that most people understand the meaning of the name “ Operation Cast Lead ” chosen by Israel for its murderous and criminal attack on Gaza .
The name is borrowed from a Hebrew nursery rhyme which was ( and may still be ) very popular among Israeli children in the 1950s .
In this song , a father promises to his child a special Hannukah gift : “ a cast lead sevivon . ”
Sevivon , in Hebrew ( A dreidel in Yiddish ) is a four - sided spinning top , played with during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah .
Somebody , in the Israeli army , who apparently feels nostalgic about his childhood , decided that if Israeli kids would enjoy a sevivon cast from lead there is no reason why Palestinian children would not appreciate it too .
After all Operation Cast Lead is not the first ( and unfortunately , will not be the last ) of Israel ’s cruel war games .
The cynicism embedded in the name , selected for what Ari Shavit , one of Israel ’s most celebrated commentators , called “ an intelligent , impressive operation , ” is symptomatic to the cold , meticulous and calculated cruelty with which this attack was “ designed , ” “ executed ” and “ marketed ” to the world .
As the perpetrators themselves proudly boast , Operation Cast Lead is not only a great military victory but also a success story of Israeli hasbara ( meaning in Hebrew , explanation , but practically referring to misinformation , spin and lies ) .
This great victory , as some ( but not enough ) noticed , prominent among them , Richard Falk , United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , is targeted against the “ wretched of the world . ”
They are first , second and third generation refugees ( originating from the area currently being rocketed from Gaza ) , the poorest people in the world , crammed in one of the most densely - populated areas on the planet , already starved and weakened by months of Israeli blockade .
The sanitized language of the western media calls it “ a disproportionate reaction . ”
But the ground zero that it creates for the Palestinians , who , over the last decades , have achieved the dubious honor of becoming the world ’s quintessential victims , should be a “ shock and awe ” for any person who has not , as yet , lost his or her basic humanity and sense of justice .
Israel ’s oiled propaganda - machine was further lubricated by its self - acknowledged decision to select women as their masbirim ( misinformation spokespersons ) so as “ to project a feminine and softer image . ”
To add some cool glamour to Israel ’s hot lies , Tzipi Livni , the state ’s foreign minister and a natural blonde , announced , in response to calls for truce : “ There is no humanitarian crisis in the [ Gaza ] Strip , and therefore there is no need for a humanitarian truce . ”
The blonde offensive , led by the rising star of Israeli politics , was fortified by a team of peroxide blonde Israeli women , whose sex , lies and video games decorated TV screens worldwide .
They explained to the sympathetic world the hardships endured by the nuclear - armed Israelis threatened by the crude rockets .
After all , one Israeli was killed in the last six months , while three other Israelis ( one of them a Palestinian citizen of Israel ) were killed by rockets since Gaza has been turned into a slaughter - house by the silk gloves of the Israeli army .
Quick to join this sugar - coated team of blonde bombshells were Israel ’s most celebrated and translated writers abroad , Amos Oz and David Grossman .
The two project to the international community ( i.e. , the so - called liberal west ) what it regards as Israeli political conscience and moral voice .
Both are given a special stage by prestigious western media platforms to express their opinions regarding major political events involving Israel .
They are Israel ’s hamasbirim haleumim ( the national spokespersons ) a euphemism for national ( or international ) deceivers , who whitewash Israel ’s dirty laundry in the global launderette .
Grossman ( slightly more to the “ left ” than Oz ) has obtained an extra moral authority after his own tank commander son was killed in Israel ’s murderous attack on Lebanon in 2006 .
In a militaristic society , centered on the cult of the fallen soldier , a bereaved father ( av shakul in Hebrew ) enjoys a special status .
One could have expected Grossman to “ cash ” in this newly gained status and come out with a more courageous stance , one that would criticize Israel ’s immoral massacre , rather than re-play the eternal Jewish victim , pleading “ to halt ” Israeli fire while promising Hamas that : “ Even if you continue to fire on Israel , we will not respond by resuming combat .
We will grit our teeth , just as we did throughout the period before our attack . ”
Israelis , in Grossman ’s self - adulatory discourse , are rahmanim bnei rahmanim ( merciful sons of merciful fathers ) , dignified and righteous victims .
Perhaps this is what Olmert meant when he talked about the silky touch of the Israeli gloves caressing “ ordinary , ” non-militant Palestinians in Gaza .
One could think about a braver bereaved parent , Smadar Elhanan - Peled for example .
A mother who , after losing her daughter in a suicide bomb attack in Jerusalem , publicly and openly put the blame for her daughter ’s death on the Israeli government and its cruel policies towards the Palestinians .
Her teenage daughter , unlike Grossman ’s son , was not a tank commander , not even a soldier but just an ordinary girl .
The well - orchestrated propaganda machinery was also equipped with Israel ’s most successful “ secret weapons ” of mass deception : playing the role of the victim again .
It is not an accident , therefore , that , as the Israeli spin doctors themselves explained in an interview to The Jewish Chronicle , that : “ The international media were directed to a press center set up by the foreign ministry in Sderot itself so that foreign reporters would spend as much time as possible in the main civilian area affected by Hamas rockets . ”
The scenes of crying , panic - stricken Israelis added some excessive emotionalism which counter - balanced , but nicely complemented , the team of the icy blonde offenders .
The designation of the Gaza Strip and south Israel as a “ closed military zone , ” and the ban on media coverage of the Gaza carnage contributes to the sanitized view of the Gaza story as manufactured by Israel .
The real horror and gore is reserved for the Al Jazeera ’s spectators , particularly the Arab ones .
Ghetto - under - siege Gaza remains almost silent and partly invisible to the rest of us .
We hardly hear or see in mainstream media , testimonies from the ground .
But we are bombarded by statements and “ explanations ” given by Israeli officials and “ international experts ” who discuss the “ situation ” calmly and “ logically . ”
After all , unlike the hysterical , always shouting and crying Gazans , they have not been bombarded by for nine days straight .
They are interviewed in their comfortable ( probably leather - clad ) offices .
They look and sound like respectable westerners , just like “ us , ” and their foreign minister is very calm and cool as her blonde hair obliges .
A pioneering study by the Glasgow University Media Group on media coverage of conflicts , taught us that if you look respectable and calm you must be right .
The Palestinians , by contrast , usually interviewed when they are in a state of shock , look disheveled , disoriented , slightly hysterical .
And they are always surrounded by chaos and disorder .
The buildings around are destroyed , debris is scattered everywhere , and the noise is unbearable ( not to mention that they speak this incomprehensible language ) .
Is something wrong with them ?
Also , even when they are not “ extremists ” they are always on the defense , almost apologetic , trying to convince us that they are not terrorists , not even militants , just ordinary people who want to survive , if not to enjoy this life .
This makes them look even more suspicious .
After all , if they are not terrorists , what are they doing in Gaza ?
Gaza , we should remember , was declared as “ hostile entity ” by Israel in September of 2007 .
And since only the powerful have the power to define , even if their definitions amount to tautologies or oxymorons , they are still the accepted ones .
According to this perverse logic , produced in Fortress Israel and marketed to the whole world , any Gazan deserves to die .
Furthermore , despite the fact that Israel claims to attack only Hamas and not the Palestinians ( conveniently oblivious to the fact that , as David Boardman reminds us , the majority of Palestinians voted democratically for Hamas ) , it still clings to its old law of blood , according to which , as John Berger observes : “ One Israeli life is worth a hundred Palestinian lives . ”
So if in the course of the last six months , one Israeli died as a result of a Hamas rocket attack , it is perfectly logical that in a week 500 Palestinians will lose their lives and thousands more will be injured .
This is what the Israelis view as a policy of deterrence .
We should not forget , however , that behind this cruel apparatus of sex , lies and video war games , a more “ primitive , ” “ organic , ” and tribal cruelty , usually well hidden from the scrutiny of the outside world , is operating .
Most people in the west do not realize the indifference , and more disturbingly , the joy with which Israelis receive news about the suffering of Arabs and particularly Palestinians .
It is more common in the west to see Arab and Muslim crowds “ dancing on the roofs ” when missiles or rockets hit Israel ( as was the case during the 1991 Gulf War ) but it is less common to see or hear Israelis cheered at the plight of suffering Palestinians and Arabs .
More than once , I have encountered a jovial taxi driver applauding the good news that he has just heard .
“ Let them all die in agony ” was a standard reaction that I have become accustomed to hear on a day - to - day basis while I was still living in Israel .
It was also not uncommon in my Jerusalem neighborhood — even prior to the onset of the second Palestinian intifada — to see Israeli Border Police brutally harass poor old Palestinians who came to collect some “ valuables ” from the garbage bins of the affluent Jews .
Time and again it happened in front of a popular Jerusalem cafe , where people were sipping their lattes , completely oblivious to the unfolding drama .
Nobody , among these beautiful people , seemed to be bothered by these scenes , or to suffer from some disturbing reflections on the transfer of guilt .
Israel ’s cruelty — manifested through its use ( or rather abuse ) of language , and creative “ strategy ” of “ re- branding ” its continuous assaults on the Palestinians as a war of defense , using their tautological logic to justify the extermination of an “ entity ” which they designate as “ hostile ” — should be interpreted in the spirit of Giorgio Agamben .
The influential Italian philosopher argued in relation to the Nazi death camps that the “ correct question to pose concerning the horrors committed in the camps is , therefore , not the hypocritical one of how crimes of such atrocity could be committed against human beings ” but what were “ the juridical procedures and deployments of power by which human beings could be so completely deprived of their rights and prerogatives that no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime . ”
We may well ask the same question today when listening to Israel ’s blonde bombshells explain the bombs tearing apart the people of Gaza .

Scientists at deCODE genetics have completed the largest study of ancient DNA from a single population ever undertaken .
Analyzing mitochondrial DNA , which is passed from mother to offspring , from 68 skeletal remains , the study provides a detailed look at how a contemporary population differs from that of its ancestors .
The study is published January 16 in the open- access journal PLoS Genetics .
The results confirm previous deCODE work that used genetics to test the history of Iceland as recorded in the sagas .
These studies demonstrated that the country seems to have been settled by men from Scandinavia – the vikings – but that the majority of the original female inhabitants were from the coastal regions of Scotland and Ireland , areas that regularly suffered raids by vikings in the years around the settlement of Iceland 1100 years ago .
The current study further shows that the gene pool of contemporary Icelanders appears to have evolved rapidly over the intervening thousand years .
As a result , the original female settlers are genetically less closely related to present - day Icelanders , and instead more closely related to the present day populations of Scotland , Ireland and Scandinavia , as well as those of northwestern and southwestern Europe .
This is a demonstration of a phenomenon known as ' genetic drift . '
In essence , in any population certain individuals will have more offspring and , by chance and in this case over the course of 35 generations , many more descendants than others .
And as a result , particularly in a small population , the genetic variety of the original population can decrease and change over time .
In this study only mitochondrial DNA was studied , but the same phenomenon applies to the Y chromosome , which is passed from fathers to sons , and to any other part of the genome .
" This study is a major contribution to the use of ancient DNA studies in tracing the history not just of single populations , but of our species and how we spread from Africa to every corner of the globe , " said Kari Stefansson , CEO of deCODE .
" It is the first such study to be large enough to permit meaningful statistical methods to be applied to ancient DNA .
We very much hope this will aid and encourage others to follow with large studies in other parts of the world . "

2008 has been an eventful year to say the least - it is difficult to sum up the thousands of stories in just a handful of photographs .
That said , I will try to do what I 've done with other photo narratives here , and tell a story of 2008 in photographs .
It 's notstory of 2008 , it 's certainly not all stories , but as a collection it does show a good portion of what life has been like over the past 12 months .
This is a multi-entry story , 120 photographs over three days .
Watch for part 2 and part 3 tomorrow and the next day .
( 40 photos total
A . That ’s a very good question .
Most of the illicit material in the 1960s came from Mexico .
So , in collaboration with the D.E.A. and the Mexican government , we acquired those seeds .
Later , we acquired others from Colombia , Thailand , Jamaica , India , Pakistan and places in the Middle East .
That permitted us to study chemical and botanical differences .
By 1976 , we were growing about 96 different varieties .
Interestingly , that led us to see that there was only one species of cannabis .
It had always been thought that there were many .
But you could see that the chemistry of this plant is the same qualitatively no matter where it comes from .
What makes each different is the relative proportion of the different chemicals in there , which does n’t make a different species .
It ’s really the same species , but different varieties of it .
The different types of varieties hybridize very easily .
Q. DOES THIS MEAN THAT ONE COULD MAKE GENETICALLY MODIFIED CANNABIS ?
A. Yes .
Absolutely .
That actually has been the trend over the years in the cultivation in the illicit market , and also in the legal market , where we are doing genetic selection , where we select specific materials that have the genes that produce higher levels of THC or some of the other ingredients .
Q. SO OUT THERE IN RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA , HAVE THEY BEEN IMPROVING THEIR CROPS WITH MODERN GENETICS ?
A . They have been doing genetic selection for years .
You can see the potency keeps going up .
In the 1970s , the seized marijuana had probably 1 percent or less of the active ingredient .
Now , it ’s about 8 percent , on the average .
Q. HOW DID YOU COME TO YOUR UNUSUAL SPECIALTY ?
A . The honest truth is that it began out of necessity .
In 1975 , while I was in my last year of graduate school in natural products chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh , the Lord provided me with twin daughters .
My graduate student stipend was already over , and my adviser said , “ You need to quickly find a job . ”
So he recommended me for a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Mississippi ’s Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences .
My first job here had to do with poison ivy .
Then a better - paying position opened up at the Marijuana Project , and I moved to that .
I liked the research , and I got on well with my supervisor and mentor , Dr. Carlton Turner , who later became the director of drug abuse policy in the Reagan White House .
So , this work , it just happened .
Q. DO YOUR NEIGHBORS EVER KID YOU ABOUT YOUR JOB ?
A . My daughters , when they were in grade school , the teachers would ask them , “ What does your father do ? ”
And they ’d say , “ He grows marijuana . ”
And the teachers ’ eyes would grow wide .
After a while , my daughters said : “ He works at the University of Mississippi .
He ’s a professor . ”
AIG has received a big cash injection from the US government
The troubled US insurer AIG will not be renewing its shirt sponsorship deal with Manchester United that expires in May 2010 .
AIG agreed to pay £ 14 m - a - year for four years for the shirt sponsorship and also has a longer £ 5 m - a - year deal to run MU Finance .
It is currently restructuring itself , having received a $ 150 bn ( £ 109 bn ) bail - out from the US government .
It is not clear whether the MU Finance deal will continue .
AIG signed a six - and - a- half year deal at the beginning of 2008 to offer insurance , credit cards and mortgages using the MU Finance brand .
Manchester United said that it had already started talking to a select group of potential sponsors .
Its spokesman added that it was normal to begin the process this early because technical issues surrounding the manufacturing of shirts meant that it has to know who will be its shirt sponsor for the 2010 / 2011 season by the autumn .
Last week in Macau , Manchester United chief executive David Gill said he would not be surprised if the AIG shirt sponsorship deal was not renewed .
AIG has already ended its sponsorship deal with the US Davis Cup tennis team .
Internet Explorer is used by the vast majority of computer users Microsoft has issued a patch to fix a security flaw believed to have affected as many as 10,000 websites .
The flaw in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser could allow criminals to take control of people 's computers and steal passwords .
Internet Explorer is used by a majority of computer users and the flaw could affect all versions of it .
However , so far the vulnerability has affected only machines running Internet Explorer 7 .
Security update MS08-078 would protect customers from active attacks against Internet Explorer , said the US software giant in a statement accompanying the release of the update .
" This update will be applied automatically to hundreds of millions of customers through automatic updates over the next few days , " said Mike Reavey , director of the Microsoft Security Response Center ( MSRC ) .
Potential danger According to Rick Ferguson , a senior security adviser at security firm Trend Micro , the flaw has so far been used to steal gaming passwords but more sensitive data could be at risk until the security update is installed .
MICROSOFT SECURITY ADVICE
Change IE security settings to high ( Look under Tools / Internet Options ) Switch to a Windows user account with limited rights to change a PC 's settings
With IE7 or 8 on Vista turn on Protected Mode Ensure your PC is updated Keep anti-virus and anti-spyware software up to date " It is inevitable that it will be adapted by criminals .
It 's just a question of modifying the payload the trojan installs , " he said .
It is relatively unusual for Microsoft to issue what it calls an " out - of - band " security bulletin and experts are reading the decision to rush out a patch as evidence of the potential danger of the flaw .
Some experts have suggested that users switch browsers until the flaw is fixed .
Firefox , Opera , Chrome and Apple 's Safari system are not vulnerable to this current flaw .
But Graham Cluley , senior consultant with security firm Sophos , said no browser is exempt from problems .
" Firefox has issued patches and Apple has too .
Whichever browser you are using you have to keep it up to date , " he said .
" People have to be prepared and willing to install security updates .
That nagging screen asking if you want to update should not be ignored , " he said .

“ So , what do you do ? ” “ Me? I ’m a web designer ”
and Jesse J. Holland
WASHINGTON — Some people worry , when they ’ve been away from home , that they might return to find something missing .
Sen .
Ted Stevens described a different problem .
Time and again , he testified Friday , he returned home to find something new and expensive .
A new porch .
A balcony .
A fully stocked tool chest .
A gas grill .
A steel staircase .
Rope lighting .
A generator .
“ I literally walked in and found all new furniture , ” Stevens testified Friday .
“ All of our furniture was gone . ”
Stevens testified that he did n’t want any of those things and never asked for them .
His friend , oil pipeline contractor Bill Allen , just kept giving .
“ All of these things kept appearing over the years at your chalet ? ” prosecutor Brenda Morris asked .
“ That ’s right , ” Stevens said , trying to keep his famously short - fused temper in check .
Stevens is charged with lying on Senate forms about $ 250,000 in home renovations and other gifts he received from Allen and his company , Veco .
Prosecutors say Stevens had a long history of accepting gifts from Allen .
“ You were the lion of the Senate , but you did n’t know how to stop this man from putting big - ticket items at your home ? ”
Morris said , teasing the Senate ’s longest - serving Republican .
As Morris repeatedly needled him on his relationship with Allen , Veco and the new things at his home , Stevens would shoot back with : “ You ’re not listening to me , I ’ve answered it twice , ” “ I ’m not going to get into a numbers game with you , ” “ You ’re making a lot of assumptions that are unwarranted . ”
Stevens , taking the stand as his own star witness Friday , strongly rejected the idea that he had his hand out looking for favors .
He said he would n’t even let someone pick up the tab at a restaurant and certainly would n’t let somebody tack on freebies to his home renovation project .
“ I pay my bills wherever I am , ” Stevens said .
“ I do n’t let people buy my lunch or buy my dinner .
Wherever I am , I pay my bills . ”
Morris will continue questioning Stevens — the last witness in the three - week trial — Monday .
Attorneys will then make closing arguments , with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan saying he expects the jury to start deliberating early next week .
Friday , Stevens said he never paid for the furniture Allen left at the house , for instance , because he never asked for it and did n’t want it .
“ It ’s still at your house ? ” Morris asked .
“ Yes it is , ” Stevens said .

ISR Issue 62 , November December 2008 Capitalism ’s worst crisis since the 1930s
By JOEL GEIER
The United States and the world are now in the opening stages of the worst economic crisis since the depression of the 1930s .
This crisis represents the greatest failure of the free market since the Second World War .
For some time now , economists have argued that the market is self - regulating and self - correcting ; this fantasy has been destroyed .
The crisis has led to a run on the international banking system , a stock market crash , and has opened the door to what will be the longest and deepest recession of the post–Second World War period .
This is not a typical cyclical crisis , which capitalism generally has every decade or so , but a systemic crisis , a crisis of the financial system , which provides money for the circulation of commodities , of trade , and of investment .
There is no alternative , we were told , to the free market .
What we are now told is that there is no alternative to government intervention and regulation .
As Karl Marx pointed out many years ago , capitalist crises do not come about because of a shortage of goods or crop failures , but because of overproduction .
This overproduction is not overproduction of things that are needed by people , but overproduction in terms of what can be sold profitably on the market .
If products cannot be sold profitably , whether they are physical commodities or debt securities , profits cannot be realized , and the system goes into crisis , as lending and investment seize up .
Workers are laid off , plants are closed , and the banks go bust , in a downward spiral .
Capitalism ’s only way out of the crisis is by lowering labor costs ( wage - cutting ) and the massive devaluation of capital , as businesses are destroyed and surviving capitalists swallow up the weaker businesses on the cheap .
There has already been an enormous destruction of capital .
In the last number of months , more than $ 7 trillion has been wiped off the U.S. stock market .
Indeed , $ 1.1 trillion was wiped out in a single day on October 15 .
As of mid-October , $ 27 trillion had been erased from stock markets worldwide .
Housing values in this country have already declined by $ 5 trillion ; pension funds by $ 2.5 trillion ; and bank write - offs are now at $ 600 to $ 700 billion and expected to be $ 1.4 trillion .
Large , conservative , seemingly stable companies have disappeared .
Lehman Brothers , which had been capitalized at $ 30 to $ 40 billion , has gone bankrupt , and AIG , which until a few months ago was capitalized at between $ 150 and $ 200 billion , required a $ 123 billion lifeline from the government to survive .
This has led to a massive credit crunch .
Banks and other financial institutions now no longer trust each other not to totter and collapse underneath the weight of toxic debt , and refuse to lend to each other , producing a credit meltdown affecting the entire global financial system .
All of this is opening up a longer , deeper recession .
In the U.S. , profits , the motor force of the capitalist system , are now in free fall .
They peaked in the third quarter of 2006 , and already are down 29 percent , not counting the banks ’ write - offs .
The failing housing market , which was the catalyst for this current financial crisis , continues to decline .
Housing prices are now down 23 percent nationally — and are down even further in California , Nevada , and Florida .
One sixth of all homes are now under water — the mortgage is now greater than the value of the home .
There are millions of unsold homes , and four million homes are expected to be in foreclosure ; and this before the recession and layoffs have really begun to hit hard .
Unemployment is already 6.1 percent , and economists are predicting that next year it may rise to 8 or 9 percent .
In the last recession in 2001 , unemployment peaked at 6.3 percent .
In the last year , unemployment has gone from 7.3 million to 9.5 million people .
The U.S. Department of Labor has reported that the rate of unemployment is 11 percent , if you count the 5 million “ discouraged ” workers who have recently stopped looking for work , and a portion of the 6.1 million involuntary part - time workers .
Moreover , real wages have declined even before this recession has gotten under way .
In the last year , weekly wages rose 2.8 percent , but after adjusting for inflation , they fell 2.5 percent .
And the credit contraction has only just begun .
Even if the latest moves of the European and American governments — who have decided at the eleventh hour to partially nationalize the banking system by injecting trillions of dollars into the banks — are successful , nonetheless the credit contraction , the rationing of credit , will continue .
The government has stepped in to provide capital for the banks in order for them to continue to function .
In the U.S. , a plan to invest $ 250 billion in nine of the country ’s largest banks superseded the previous plan to spend $ 700 billion of taxpayers ’ money to buy the banks ’ toxic debt .
Nonetheless , all the banks are still holding huge amounts of mortgages and other loans at highly inflated asset prices .
Even with the bailouts , they will have to sell off those assets in order to be able to raise capital .
The banks are also being de-leveraged , that is , they are being forced to pay off some of their debt and to cut back on the risky loans they ’ve made over the past several years .
Rather than loaning ten times more than their capital , they were loaning thirty and forty times their capital ; and in Europe the banks were leveraged at an even greater rate .
There will have to be a protracted period of restructuring and recapitalization of the banking system .
During this period there will be less money for loans for business investments and consumer purchases , which is only going to exacerbate the recession , leading to more corporate bankruptcies .
This in turn will lead to more layoffs , higher unemployment , and a continued downward spiral .
The restructuring of the banking system is not the only thing that will occur during this crisis .
There are going be all sorts of industries — not just corporations , but industries — that will be on the verge of bankruptcy , such as auto , home construction , and the airlines .
All those industries will have to be restructured through mergers and acquisitions , through leveraged buyouts , and through the sale of companies and assets at fire - sale prices .
Capitalism ’s only way out of this downward spiral , as in all capitalist crises , will be the massive devaluation of capital and a lowering of wage costs to the point where profits and investments are restored .
An international crisis
Meanwhile , the international character of the recession will deepen it .
Already , all of the advanced industrial countries — Germany , Italy , Britain , France , Japan are in deeper recession than the United States .
The banking situation in Europe may be even worse in than in the U.S. , because the housing bubbles in a number of countries were bigger , and because , as we have already mentioned , there was even more leverage in the European banking system than in the United States .
The collapse of the commodities boom — prices of oil , copper , grains , and other commodities have declined dramatically since the summer of 2008 — has thrown a number of emerging markets into chaos .
In Russia , the stock market has crashed , and as of mid-October was down 60 percent from its peak .
In a number of countries there have been currency collapses .
The value of Brazil ’s currency declined by 40 percent in the last two months , and Korea ’s currency declined by 50 percent .
Whole countries ( of which Iceland is only the first ) face the possibility of bankruptcy .
The Baltic dry index — the cost of shipping commodities — dropped 80 percent from where it was just a few months ago .
It is an indication of the collapse of world trade .
This will be the first time since 1973 that all of the world has gone into recession at once .
This will make the recession deeper , since it will be impossible for countries to export their way out of the crisis to countries that are still expanding .
The origins of the crisis
The current crisis is a product of the contradictions of the twenty - five - year - long neoliberal boom , which started in 1982 .
The postwar boom ended in 1973 , and from 1973 to 1982 there were three recessions in the United States .
The restructuring that went on in the United States , and to a lesser extent internationally , with the introduction of neoliberal , free - market measures , led to a twenty - five - year - long boom .
It is the contradictions of those neoliberal measures that have produced this crisis .
The first contradiction to note was the creation of a giant debt bubble .
The increase in debt during the Clinton and Bush years was staggering .
Over the two decades preceding 2007 , credit market debt roughly quadrupled from nearly $ 11 trillion to $ 48 trillion , far exceeding growth rates .
To put it in perspective : according to the Wall Street Journal , since 1983 debt expanded by 8.9 percent per year , while GDP expanded by only 5.9 percent .
The nation ’s debt grew to enormous , unsustainable proportions starting with the Asian financial crisis of 1997 – 98 .
There are a number of elements that contributed to creating this debt bubble .
The first is the use of monetary policy as a way to handle economic problems .
When the Asian crisis arose , the United States pumped tremendous amounts of liquidity , of money , into the banking system , and cut interest rates dramatically , even though the nation was still in boom .
This led to the creation of the dot - com bubble — the wild inflation of technology stocks — that burst in 2000 .
The second contradiction was that the United States became a buyer of last resort , establishing a trading system with Asia in which the Asian countries exported to the United States , which kept up spending through debt .
The American balance of payments went from approximately $ 200 billion a year to $ 700 to $ 800 billion per year .
All of this was borrowed .
The U.S. government had a budget surplus under Clinton .
But under Bush , with the tax cuts and war spending , the budgetary surplus disappeared , and the U.S. went from having a $ 250 billion government surplus in 2000 – 2001 to a $ 300 billion deficit in 2002 .
This stimulated the economy , but it meant that the United States became dependent on foreign capital , since the savings rate in this country had collapsed and was negative in the last years of this boom .
Foreign capital , in particular from China , Japan , and the Middle East oil exporting countries , financed the American debt .
When the dot - com bubble collapsed and recession came in 2001 , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan lowered interest rates to between 1 and 2 percent for three years .
This led to massive asset inflation , particularly in housing prices .
An important factor contributing to the explosion of debt was the phenomenal increase in income inequality .
The neoliberal boom was the result of a shift in the balance of class forces , in which the rate of exploitation was increased , real wages were depressed , and almost all wealth created went to capital .
Some figures will indicate how dramatic the shift was .
In 1973 , GDP per person , in constant non-inflationary dollars , was $ 20,000 a year .
By 2006 , it was $ 38,000 a year — a more than 90 percent rise .
Wages , however , in that same thirty - three - year period , declined .
Real wages in 1973 were $ 330 per week ; and in 2007 , wages were $ 279 — a decline of 15 percent .
This shift of wealth from the working class to the capitalist class produced a tremendous amount of capital for potential investment .
But in this last business cycle , that capital could not find all that many profitable outlets domestically .
There was no expanded reproduction , no accumulation of capital in the U.S. during the 2000s .
In this last business cycle , there were fewer factories at the beginning of the recession a year ago than there were in 1999 .
Instead of investing in new technologies , new plants and equipment , capitalists invested money overseas .
Domestically , investments went to the most profitable industries — housing , construction , and finance .
“ In 1983 , banks , brokerage houses and other financial businesses contributed 15.8 percent to domestic corporate profits , ” writes James Grant in the October 18 Wall Street Journal .
“ It ’s double that today . ”
These investments stimulated the housing and debt bubble .
Between 2000 and 2005 , housing prices increased by more than 50 percent , and there was a frenzy of housing construction .
Banks and other financial institutions went on a mortgage - lending spree , creating a massive market in subprime mortgages — adjustable rate mortgages sold to borrowers with weak credit .
There was also a big increase in housing speculation , with small investors buying second and third homes with the expectation that housing prices would keep rising and that these houses could be resold at a profit .
Merrill Lynch estimated that in the first half of 2005 , half of economic growth was related to the boom in the housing sector .
Meanwhile , workers tried to maintain their standard of living despite the decline in real wages .
In the 1980s and 1990s , they worked longer hours , took on more than one job , and increased the number of family members working .
This could prop up household income to some extent .
Yet even household income declined from 1998 through the boom of the 2000s .
The only way to maintain living standards in the midst of declining wages was by borrowing against the rising value of their homes through home equity loans and mortgage refinancing .
In the period of the last boom , homeowners took $ 5 trillion out of their home equity ( $ 9 trillion since 1997 ) , fueling an increasingly unsustainable debt structure that finally popped with the decline of inflated asset prices in housing .
The third contributing factor to this debt bubble was the deregulation of the banking system , which led to the creation of a shadow banking system .
This shadow banking system grew to be bigger than the regulated , insured commercial banks , which through this shadow system , were able to keep all sorts of loans and investments off their books , Enron - style .
In this shadow system , banks did not have to put up adequate capital reserves .
As a result , they were able , through this unregulated system , to borrow thirty , forty , or fifty times above the value of their capital in order to invest in the stock market and in various new exotic debt products , such as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , credit - default swaps ( CDSs — essentially a form of insurance against debt default ) , and various other financial swindles , many of which were based on the packaging and repackaging of housing mortgages .
These were bundled and sliced up into investment vehicles that contained a good deal of potentially toxic debt — $ 900 billion worth of subprime loans , for example .
The unregulated banking system provided a lot of the credit for this asset inflation and in the creation of these new credit instruments , mortgage - backed securities like credit derivatives , CDOs and CDSs , led to a speculative mania that drove prices higher and higher .
At the same time , these unregulated instruments were so complicated that no one really knew what they were really worth .
This setup provided enormous profits to the banks at first .
The feeding frenzy drove up asset prices , creating an environment in which everyone was eager to participate , setting the stage for the inevitable crash .
The house of cards started to collapse when the housing market went south .
The end of the debt - fueled trading system
The trading system that emerged out of the Asian crisis of 1998 was always unsustainable .
What is remarkable is how long it continued .
The current crisis now makes it impossible for it to continue .
The United States developed an enormous trade deficit , which was financed through foreign borrowing of dollars , the international reserve currency .
If the dollar were n’t the international reserve currency , it is unimaginable that this trade deficit could have gone on for so many years .
Now that the world has entered recession , the U.S. is going to be running higher budgetary deficits .
Those deficits will be increased also by the expansion of U.S. military spending , which has increased from $ 300 billion a year in 2000 to more than $ 800 billion a year now , if you include the supplemental costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
On top of this spending , the U.S. has introduced a hugely expensive bailout plan .
That means it will in all likelihood be running deficits of three - quarters of a trillion dollars , and possibly more , in the coming years .
Where will the money for that come ?
At the moment there is no savings in this country , though that may change dramatically .
But it is highly unlikely that China , Japan , and other countries are prepared to continue to finance an American trade deficit to the tune of $ 700 or $ 800 billion a year when the balance sheet of American finances , the huge national debt , has gone from $ 5 trillion when Bush came into office to $ 11 trillion today .
It is unlikely that the Chinese and others are going to continue to finance this debt — although at this point in time U.S. treasuries are still a safe haven .
This is particularly true because China ’s trade surplus is going to contract considerably as a result of the world recession .
The Chinese population only consumes 35 percent of what it produces .
The rest goes for reinvestment and export .
China ’s economy has the highest rate of exploitation in the industrial world .
But its export markets are going to constrict — they ’ve already started to decline .
As a result , China ’s desire to lend greater amounts to the United States is problematic , particularly if interest rates in the United States are low .
The United States therefore can no longer continue to run an enormous trade deficit while it is building an enormous budgetary deficit , and sustain both of them on the basis of foreign borrowing .
There will have to be a restructuring and reordering of the system .
At the same time , the U.S. may become more dependent on direct foreign investment from countries like Japan and China that , as we ’ve mentioned , have developed large cash reserves .
That is what we mean when we say that this is not just a typical cyclical crisis of capitalism .
All of the contradictions of the neoliberal boom have burst asunder and now have to be addressed .
Government intervention
There has been some talk on the right that government intervention is “ socialist . ”
Even Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , after he agreed , in response to Britain ’s bailout plan , to shift the government ’s commitment from buying bad debt from the banks to injecting capital into them , said that “ [ G] overnment owning a stake in any private U.S. company is objectionable to most Americans — me included . ”
Living in the rarified world of bankers and speculators , he apparently has not seen the polls showing that a majority of Americans want single - payer health care and better social services .
For those free market hacks who fear that the bailout plan represents some kind of creeping socialism , the words of a Financial Times editorial are instructive :
Does this rescue mean the end of private financial capitalism ?
Of course not .
Although the size of the crisis requires an exceptional response , this is but the latest in a long line of banking crises and state rescues .
Nationally owned banks seem likely to be a reality in many countries for a decade .
In the next great financial crisis — rest assured , there will be others — bank rescues with equity purchases may be a first step rather than a last resort .
But stakes in banks will , eventually , be sold back to private investors .
Governments — rightly — will regulate to avoid further crises .
They will fail , and then be forced to act to pick up the pieces .
There is no alternative .
Modern capitalism needs well - functioning banks .
Businesses and individuals need liquidity and an effective means of turning their savings into productive investments .
But banks perform this function by making bets on the future .
This is the purpose for which they exist — but it makes them inherently unstable .
They tend to overextend themselves in the good times and are over - cautious in the bad , exacerbating booms and busts … .
These leaders are not putting capitalism to the sword in favor of the gentler rule of the state .
They are using the state to defeat the marketplace ’s most dangerous historic enemy : widespread depression .
And they are right to do so .
The editorial goes so far as to admit that the boom - bust cycle is endemic to capitalism , and that credit , while it fuels and extends the boom , also makes the crisis worse .
The old neoliberal mantra TINA — There Is No Alternative to free market capitalism — is now transformed into :
There is no alternative to state intervention to save capitalism from its inevitable tendency toward crisis .
Let us be very clear : State intervention to save capitalism from its own contradictions has nothing to do with socialism .
The U.S. government is a capitalist government , staffed by political representatives of the capitalist class from the Democratic and Republican Parties .
Paulson , for example , was once a top executive at Goldman Sachs .
The government thinks in the same way the capitalist class does ; it defends their interests , and it wears the same blinders .
It was the government that deregulated the banking system , in particular under the leadership of Alan Greenspan ( chair of the Federal Reserve from 1987 – 2006 ) , Robert Rubin ( treasury secretary under Clinton ) and Lawrence Summers ( treasury secretary in the last year and a half of the Clinton administration ) .
Together , they deregulated the banks and defended the development of the unregulated debt trading system .
It was the government and its policies that greased the wheels for this catastrophe .
It presided over the redistribution of wealth from labor to capital , it gave enormous tax breaks to the rich , and it encouraged easy credit and debt spending .
The government therefore bears as much responsibility for this crisis as the bankers do .
The response of the government to the financial meltdown until mid-October , moreover , has been totally inadequate .
This crisis has been unfolding for two years now , and for months the government refused to recognize the depth of the problem , taking action that was too little , too late .
There have been five different ad - hoc rescue attempts , including cutting interest rates and opening up cheap credit lines to the banks , and the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Paulson then allowed Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt , a move that triggered a deeper financial panic .
This was followed by the bailout of AIG , leading up to Paulson ’s $ 700 bailout plan to buy up the banks ’ bad assets .
Now comes the sixth attempt to stabilize the financial system — the decision in mid-October to recapitalize the banks and partially nationalize them — a plan initiated by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
This might finally be the one that unfreezes banking loans .
In their ad - hoc attempts to solve the crisis , officials took this to be a liquidity rather than an insolvency problem — a problem simply of getting money into the banking system so that the banks would loan .
But the banks refused to loan to each other because they knew that other banks had assets on their books that were as bad as their own — and which might lead to defaults .
This is called counterparty risk : banks are afraid that the other banks are on the verge of bankruptcy and so wo n’t give them loans .
This aversion to risk reached a crescendo when Lehman Brothers was allowed to go bankrupt in mid-September .
This is what led to the credit meltdown of late September into mid-October that roiled markets all over the world .
The other problem with Washington policy makers is that they refused to put any floor under the housing crisis .
When Bear Stearns went bankrupt last March , the New York Times ran an editorial and liberal economist Paul Krugman wrote a column arguing that while the government is right to defend the banking system , it cannot save the housing market because the housing market is overinflated .
That has been the government policy at all points — and it is why it refused to do anything about foreclosures .
However , it is the deflation of housing asset prices that has thrown mortgage - backed securities and other loans into crisis , and is why the banks are becoming insolvent .
The government has tried to save the holders of the bad debt while allowing the cause of the bad debt problem to get worse .
For months the government refused to recapitalize the banks .
Instead , they said to the banks : we will take some bad assets off your books at inflated prices to give you some money .
This is the worst possible way in which to try and restore lending .
Banks can loan up to ten times the amount they are capitalized , whereas taking bad debt off their books does not have the same effect .
The truth was that nobody understood what Paulson ’s plan was and how it would work , and he could never explain it .
British prime minister Brown denounced it as worthless .
Paulson only decided to adopt the partial ( and temporary ) nationalization plan after Britain adopted it , and then Europe followed suit .
Paulson therefore bears responsibility for the depth of this crisis .
In a normal situation he would be forced to walk the plank .
However , there is a total political vacuum in this country .
The Bush administration did nothing ; the Republicans in Congress are living in the nineteenth century ; and the Democrats are afraid to do anything that might hurt their chances in the election — so they all do nothing .
It has been Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke who have been filling the vacuum ; and it has been Paulson who has been carrying out economic policy .
Bernanke now claims that he was always for the recapitalization of the banks .
Paulson and Bush vetoed it , however , on the grounds that it represented a partial nationalization ; they did not want the government having stock in the banks .
Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee : “ There were some that said we should just go and stick capital in the banks , put preferred stocks …
But we said , the right way to do this is not going around and using guarantees or injecting capital , and there ’s been various proposals to do that , but to use market mechanisms . ”
Today Paulson is singing a different tune .
Paulson ’s version of the partial nationalization plan involves giving the banks cash without exercising control over how they spend it .
Banks will have a relatively free hand to do with it what they please because the state is going to purchase non-voting shares .
What we ’re looking at , in the words of Multinational Monitor writer Robert Weissman , is public ownership without public control .
Paulson ’s new plan sets up minimal rules that require participating financial firms merely to discourage “ unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution . ”
In essence , the same banks whose unregulated , profligate investing led us to this impasse are being entrusted again to “ self - regulate . ”
What ’s to stop them from using state funds , even as they continue to hemorrhage hundreds of billions of dollars , to pay off shareholders and executives rather than using them to restart lending ?
As Weissman notes , “ The banks are not obligated to lend with the money they are getting .
The banks are not obligated to renegotiate mortgage terms with borrowers — even though a staggering one in six homeowners owe more than the value of their homes . ”
If more evidence is needed of the reluctance of the state to exercise too much control over the banks , the insurance giant AIG , after the government took an 80 percent controlling stake in the company , is being permitted to spend millions lobbying Congress to ease some provisions in a new federal law establishing strict oversight of mortgage originators .
So the government , at all points , has operated with the same blinders as the richest capitalists .
It has been obvious for well over a year that we have been in an enormous financial crisis , the worst since the 1930s .
Yet until now , the government has reacted on an ad - hoc , knee - jerk basis , allowing the problem to get bigger and bigger .
The limits of state intervention
This is an international crisis , and yet there is no international government that can impose a coordinated response .
There ’s no government that ’s going to protect all the banks internationally .
Each state is attempting to save its own banks .
Things have now come to such a juncture , however , that everyone is forced to act , and the scale of the crisis has forced them all to finally act in a similar way .
Estimates are that the U.S. has so far committed $ 4 to $ 6 trillion in tax dollars to bailout efforts , and Europe has committed $ 2.3 trillion .
But this is n’t so much cooperation as it is an attempt by each state to keep pace with its national rivals .
Everyone understands to some extent what happened in the 1930s — that the recession became a world depression when the international banking system collapsed and states imposed beggar - thy - neighbor policies that further contracted world trade and deepened the world depression .
Yet at the same time there are limits to what states can do because they also compete with each other .
Each one only controls a small patch of an integrated world economy .
State intervention can therefore mitigate the effects of the crisis , but it cannot prevent the recession .
Until now , the only state that could have coordinated international action was the United States .
But it failed to do so .
Its plans were inadequate , and no one took them seriously internationally .
Now , there is a consensus that only massive recapitalization and state guarantee of loans between banks can unlock the financial system .
The British government is going a step further by guaranteeing not only bank deposits , but also all interbank loans .
However , in the U.S. , Paulson is refusing to do this .
He is still trying to protect the shadow banking system .
At the same time , what coordination there is seems to be taking place between the older developed nations , without including BRIC [ Brazil , Russia , India , and China ] or other developing countries .
Some of the richer countries will find it relatively easier to withstand the strain , whereas many of the developing countries ( other than China ) will find it more difficult .
As Lee Sustar writes in Socialist Worker , “ Once the banks are effectively nationalized , the health of the financial system will depend on the fiscal situation in each country . ”
Smaller , more heavily indebted states , for example in Eastern Europe and Latin America , will have far less room to maneuver and may well face 1930s - style depression conditions .
If the bailouts restore lending , as they may have done by the time this article appears , it will not mean that the crisis is over .
For even though banks may start making loans again , they will be doing so with far less capital , since they ’re still dealing with the losses from mortgage - backed securities .
Lehman Brothers went down over the decline of commercial real estate , and AIG required an $ 85 billion bailout in mid-September ( later expanded to $ 122 billion ) to cover its credit - default swaps , and there will be other shoes to drop .
There will be more bank losses related to auto loans , business and construction loans , and merger and acquisition loans .
The entire credit structure was as bad in other areas as it was in housing .
Many poor - quality loans , made without documentation or down payments , were extended to private equity firms and hedge funds .
These loans are going to come due , and the banks are not going to be able to roll them over with new credit .
As a result , all sorts of junk bonds and leveraged buyout deals are also going to go bankrupt .
The entire banking system is being de-leveraged .
Banks will no longer be allowed to make loans thirty or forty times the value of their capital .
Instead , they will be held to a leverage ratio of ten .
That means tight credit .
Just as the asset inflation and credit bubble extended the boom , and contributed to the creation of an enormous amount of fictitious capital , the destruction of that fictitious capital , and the destruction of real capital , will prolong the slowdown .
The impact of the crisis on the position of the U.S. in the world system
The United States — economically , militarily , and ideologically — is in decline .
There is no longer a “ Washington Consensus ” — the dominance of the United States economically and ideologically in the world system .
The U.S. is no longer in a position to dictate what the rest of the world must do .
That world — a world in which the U.S. could dominate the world trading system and set its rules ; in which it could dominate the world financially through its banks , which were the most powerful in the world — is gone .
Militarily , the U.S. remains unchallenged ; but the crisis puts greater economic strain on its ability to maintain this dominance .
It is still militarily bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan , in a losing situation in the Middle East that is costing it enormous amounts of money and is putting a great strain on the military .
The U.S. does not have the wherewithal now to go after North Korea , or Syria , or other members of the so - called Axis of Evil .
It can not respond as it would like , except with hot air , to Russia ’s reassertion of control over Georgia .
What we are witnessing is the simultaneous collapse of the Washington Consensus and the Bush Doctrine , i.e. , of the twin pillars of American economic and military policy .
The U.S. ruling class will have to reexamine its policies and options .
They are not being examined in the pre-election period .
Instead , we are getting platitudes .
This is true of both John McCain and Barack Obama and their respective political parties , because they want to avoid making any difficult decisions in the midst of this election .
Nevertheless , everything is going to have to be reexamined .
However , it is difficult to discuss how things will play out , because this economic crisis has just begun , and we do not yet know its impact on other countries .
For example , the Russians felt emboldened to deal with American encroachments on what they considered to be their area of control , the former Soviet Union in Central Asia and the Caucasus , as a result of the enormous economic rise of Russia that resulted from the oil and commodities boom .
The boom led Russia to hold more than $ 500 billion dollars in U.S. currency reserves , the third largest in the world after China and Japan .
It thought it had the money to modernize its military .
All that was true just a few months ago .
The collapse of oil prices , however , has produced an enormous credit crunch in Russia , whose stock market is now one of the weakest in the world .
In October 2008 , it shut down three times in two weeks as a result of the banking crisis .
So , whereas one could talk about a resurgent Russia some months ago , it is difficult now to discuss it in the same way .
Similarly , the German finance minister , Peer Steinbruck , claimed at the end of September that the U.S. will no longer be the world ’s financial superpower , and that there will now be a financially multipolar world .
The following week , when the French proposed a joint bailout plan similar to Paulson ’s plan , Germany refused to participate , which triggered a credit crunch in Europe .
The Germans argued that the crisis was an American problem , not a German problem .
The truth of the matter is that the banking system in Germany may be the weakest , because they had even greater leverage than the American banks .
They have been carrying hugely overinflated assets .
The fact that Germany finally pledged $ 679 billion to recapitalize its banks in mid-October is proof enough of the seriousness of its banking crisis .
The position of the dollar is another question mark .
Three months ago , the American dollar was collapsing ; more recently , there has been an enormous dollar rally as the crisis has spread internationally .
So the question is not just the effect of the crisis on the U.S. , but also the impact of the crisis on each country , and how it positions them in relation to the others .
We know there is going to be an enormous shift in the balance of forces internationally .
We know that the United States had an exaggerated view of what its power was .
This was what was behind the huffing and puffing of the neocons and the trumpeting of the Bush Doctrine — that the U.S. had the ability not just to preemptively invade , but to occupy countries at will .
All that is now out the window .
So there ’s going to have to be an enormous rebalancing on the basis of the real relation of forces in the world .
But it is impossible to say too much about how that will look at the beginning of this crisis because we are not just talking about the United States , but about how the crisis affects the rest of the world .
Very clearly , however , there are going to be a large number of nationalist and protectionist conflicts .
Even before this recession began , the Doha round of world trade talks had collapsed , due to the resistance of developing countries , led by China and India , against efforts of the G - 8 countries to force greater openings in developing markets without offering any reciprocal concessions .
Various countries are going to do whatever is necessary to protect themselves against their competitors .
We do n’t know how it ’s going to play out .
But we do know that just as there is going to be an attempt made to get the working class to pay for the crisis , which will create the possibility of greater resistance and class struggle , there will also be the attempt to get other nations to pay the price , and therefore for struggles between nations .
Beyond those generalizations , it ’s too early to say more .
We will know much better in the coming months .
The U.S. in the late 1980s and 1990s improved its competitive position in the world economy and attempted to assert its role as the sole superpower .
Though it secured better rates of growth than its competitors in Japan and Europe over the past twenty - five years , it fell behind the growth rates of emerging nations like China , and in order to sustain its own economy it fell into debt .
The result is that in the last decade , the United States has lost its competitive position on the world market .
Now it will have to restructure , which will involve attempting to raise the rate of exploitation — increasing productivity while lowering wages and benefits even further .
We ’ve already seen it in the auto industry , where wages have already been cut in half in many cases .
The United States will become a cheap labor country compared to its competitors .
Auto wages in this country are probably about a third of what they are in Germany .
The minimum wage is half of what it is in Britain , France , Germany , and Ireland .
The contradictions of neoliberalism have increased the immiseration and the poverty of the American working class .
And to get out of the crisis they are going to attack workers ’ living standards even further .
Questions raised by the crisis
The economic instability of this period is leading to political and ideological instability .
Working - class consciousness is going to shift in response .
Until now , people thought of this recession mainly in terms of the decline of the housing market , and then in the last year in the rise of food and gasoline prices .
Now their pensions are being destroyed ; that is , the savings of the American working class are being wiped out by the decline of housing prices , pension funds , and so on .
People ’s incomes are declining , and layoffs are mounting .
Everyone knows we are in a crisis , and no one has confidence in the banking system or the government .
Some people will be swept up by Obabamania , just for the hope of any change , because there is no faith in existing institutions or in the politicians .
It would be hard to find another figure , aside from Obama , in which there are illusions .
It is n’t that ordinary people were gung ho about the market — they accepted it , but they did n’t embrace it .
Now they are seeing its total failure , and that government intervention is necessary .
The state must intervene .
That ’s what the banks all say , and that ’s what the capitalist class says , aside from increasingly marginal conservatives .
There has been an enormous shift in terms of what was the prevailing free market ideology that the media and the universities all upheld .
They promoted the idea that government intervention is bad , markets are good , and that unrestrained globalization was the answer .
All of that is collapsing in front of our eyes .
What is going to replace it ?
The immediate replacement will be traditional liberalism .
The Democrats are going to sweep the elections .
They are going to come up with an alternative economic plan .
There will be programs for stimulating the economy through more unemployment benefits , more infrastructural spending .
Overall , there will be a call for more shared sacrifice .
The billionaires cannot make that call — you need the liberals and the Democrats to make that appeal .
Until now , it has been the Bush administration that is held responsible for the war and for the economic disaster — the enemy has been the right wing .
Now you ’re going to have liberalism in power , and whatever it does not accomplish — in terms of easing layoffs , extending unemployment benefits , and stopping foreclosures — will reshape U.S. politics .
The economic crisis does not mean that there are openings for only the Left .
The Right will also grow .
In Austria , the far Right emerged with 30 percent of the vote .
In Italy , neofascists are in the coalition government introducing racist laws against Roma people ( gypsies ) .
In South Africa , there was a pogrom against refugees from other African countries .
There will be a lot of nasty political moves by the Right , which will become a bigger danger .
It wo n’t be the traditional Right , but new right formations that will organize around anti-immigrant racism , protectionism , and other forms of right - wing populism .
On the other hand , there ’s an enormous opening for a Left that has been marginalized for decades .
The disaster of the free market makes it easier for us to argue about the failure of capitalism and the need for an alternative based on human needs .
The free market , which supposedly triumphed in 1989 and brought us the “ end of history , ” has led to nothing but misery and the ruin of millions of people , who are mired in poverty , hunger , unemployment , and ill health , but thanks to the free - market mania of the past decades , face a shredded safety net that does n’t begin to address these problems .
People will also be forced to ask : what does government intervention mean when this is a government not of the workers , not of the masses of people , but a government that represents the interests of the owners , the bankers , and the industrialists ?
The state is being used for state capitalist purposes , in order to reorganize capital , even to curb some of its excesses .
But its aim is to keep capitalism and its social relations going — relations in which labor is dominated and exploited for the profits of a few .
Part of the restructuring will involve , as we ’ve said , an even harsher attack on working - class living standards .
At the same time , nationalization opens up space for us to argue against wholesale privatization , for the defense of public schools against privatization , and even to argue for nationalized health care .
But we have to be clear that state capitalist nationalization — that is , the intervention of the state in order to prop up the bankers and the industrialists at our expense and without any democratic control over the process — is no great improvement over what went before .
Liberals will accept that kind of state intervention .
We must demand the kind of state intervention that will come only with mass pressure and control from below — intervention to improve health care , education , unemployment benefits , to prevent foreclosures , and so on .
The Left has to operate on two levels .
First , a Left has to be built , or rather rebuilt , in this country that is prepared to fight on every front in defense of working - class interests , whether it is against layoffs , against foreclosures , or against cuts in health care and social services .
Second , the Left must be prepared to take part in any struggles to defend the interests of the working class , as well as creating a political and ideological alternative to the free market and its defenders , conservative or liberal .
The Left must utilize the crisis to conduct an ideological offensive against capitalism and to argue for a socialist alternative .

TEL AVIV -- Israeli combat jets and helicopters targeted Hamas security compounds across the Gaza Strip Saturday in a massive and bloody aerial assault , a move that Israeli officials characterized as the start of an open - ended offensive against the Islamic militant group .
Hamas officials claimed at least 200 dead and hundreds others injured in the attack , suggesting the highest one - day Palestinian death toll in years .
It was impossible to verify those numbers .

EASTON , Md. --
The auctioneer told the small crowd huddled outside the Talbot County Courthouse that the property would be sold " as is " -- rectory , bell tower , oak pews and rose - tinted stained glass windows included .
" Who gives $ 700,000 , 700 , 700 ? " he called out .
One man , a representative for a local bank , raised his finger .
The auctioneer tried in vain to nudge the price up .
" Sold ! " he cried .
St. Andrew Anglican Church had just been bought by the bank that had started foreclosure proceedings against it .
" It 's probably good for my soul to be taken down a notch , " said the Right Rev. Joel Marcus Johnson , the rector of St. Andrew , after the auction .
During this holiday season of hard times , not even houses of God have been spared .
Some lenders believe more churches than ever have fallen behind on loans or defaulted this year .
Some churches , and at least one company that specialized in church lending , have filed for bankruptcy .
Church giving is down as much as 15 % in some places , pastors and lenders report .
Just in time for Cinco de Mayo celebrations , here 's a cookbook on tacos , the ultimate street food of Mexico .
The book has an array of recipes for such classics as Pork Carnitas and Rajas and Cheese ( poblano chiles and cheese ) as well as ones with a twist , such as Chicken with Apples and Goat Cheese .
Mark Miller , author of " Tacos : 75 Authentic and Inspired Recipes , " published by Ten Speed Press , writes that he had a New England childhood but spent summers at a hacienda near Guadalajara .
While in Mexico he tagged along with the family cooks while they shopped , and they always had time for a taco after they finished .
The recipes reflect what Miller , the founder of the Coyote Cafe in Sante Fe , N.M. , means when he says " the heart of a great taco is the filling . "
Most recipes are easy and have terrific color photos .
When applicable , the level of heat is listed on each recipe with 0 the mildest and 10 the hottest .
There also are detailed recipes for making your own corn or flour tortillas and shells for tostadas and crispy tacos .
The recipes call for typical Hispanic ingredients , which you can find at area grocery stores or Hispanic grocers .

Cook 's note :
To dry - roast the garlic , place unpeeled garlic cloves in a heavy skillet over low heat .
Cook until softened , about 30 to 40 minutes , shaking the pan occasionally .
Or roast in a preheated oven until soft -- about 20 to 30 minutes .
When done , the garlic will be soft , creamy and sweet , and soft enough to slip out of their skins .

Houses • Japan Architects : Curiosity , Milligram Studio
Area Area of this architecture project Area : 189 m²
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2005
Text description provided by the architects .
The originality of the c - 1 project started from the design process .
it is designed as a product , unique independant , a seamless space where architecture interior furniture and products will become an unique emotional experience , each carefully connected .
C - 1 designed like a movie with a scenario and story boards , the basic design include from the beginning all the aspects of the project , from the shape of the building to the light switch position .
The basic design defines the different missions project that should be initiated to achieve the goal , from building design to tap design .
Thus unlike the usual process of articture projects which is of course designed from architecture , inetrior and finally products , all designs were developped in parallell .
The basic architectural design , a glass box surrounded by a walkway - gallery that connects the floor , was designed before the land was found .
the basic design is defined from a user point of view , with movement and discovery as the main theme .
the design is not defined by the wall and floor but by the movement of the user within the space , defined by a series of scenes .
how the user will appear and disappear from floor to floor .
to realise the seamless movement , the cooperate architec , tomoyuki ustumi proposed to use 25 mm steel slabs as floor and finally the thickness finally comes to only 60 mm when added to the flooring material .
this is equivalent to a line in the architectural scale .
As the walkway surrounds the house , the interior should be designed in 3 dimensions , visble from floor level to ceiling level the top of a table is as visible as the buttom , a real 3d interior , and a very difficult challenge .
using 3d animations the sequences of the interior were check from all angles .
Also , the challenge of c - 1 is to define a different topology for the different aspects of life .
an alternative to the existing our perception of space and object is the result of informations we memorized as we try to recognize things to understand them .
c - 1 design aim to define a different perception , the existence itself of each element and object is questioned .
1 - the exterior of the building itself , a specific material like wood or concrete would reveal the scale of it , the actual finish create a scaleless architecture .
in the same way to achieve seamless interior materials were developed .
the facade finish and interior is the same , a textured white finish , a specific melamine ( collaboration with aica ) was created to achieve the same visual effect with high functional specification for strenghs and cleaning .
2 - the size , proportion , hight and materials of furniture re-evaluated the perception of scale .
without user within the space the real scale and size of the interior is difficult to evaluate .
all the elements that could reveal the scale and function of the space were redesigned .
the kitchen identity , usually revealled by the tap and hood design disappear as the tap ( just a metal line ) and hood ( integrated vertically within the wall ) was developped , so the kitchen function even open does not seems to exist .
A private house is not a canvas for life it should define life itself , each action and movement is defined and controlled by the design of the space and it creates the balance of life , the speed and rythm of the human body .
WASHINGTON – Nearly one out of two women would rather give up sex for two weeks than go without the Internet , according to a recent survey .
Far fewer men would choose to go without sex , according to the survey of 2,119 adults carried out by the online research firm Harris Interactive and sponsored by Intel Corp. , the world 's biggest computer chip maker .
Forty - six per cent of the women polled said they would rather go without sex for two weeks than give up access to the Internet for the same period of time , according to the survey , " Internet Reliance in Today 's Economy . "
Only 30 per cent of men said they would rather forgo intimate relations than cyber ones .
Ninety - five percent of those surveyed said it is " very important , important or somewhat important " to be able to access the Internet .
Sixty - five per cent of those surveyed rated Internet access above other discretionary spending items such as cable television subscriptions ( 39 per cent ) , dining out ( 20 per cent ) , shopping for clothes ( 18 per cent ) or a health club membership ( 10 percent ) .
Sixty - one per cent of the women surveyed said they would rather give up watching television for two weeks than give up access to the Internet for one week .
Harris Interactive and Intel said the survey was conducted November 18 - 20 .
They did not provide a margin of error for the results .
Johan Santana sat in an interview room at Shea Stadium on Sept. 27 , the penultimate day of the season , with his left knee packed in ice .
No one else there that afternoon knew  or had reason to believe  that Santana had just pitched a three - hit shutout on short rest , briefly revitalizing the Mets ’ playoff hopes , despite enduring discomfort so severe that it would require surgery .
“ You just saw me that day  trust me , I had been icing it for the last two months , ” Santana said Saturday in a telephone interview from his off - season home in Fort Myers , Fla .
“ The last four starts is when I felt it got worse , when it was really tough for me to bend my knee .
But that game , I was so into it that I did n’t feel anything , to be honest .
As soon as the game was over , though , I ran back to the training room and got some ice and tape and started to feel some relief . ”
On Oct. 1 , Santana had arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus , and said he started rehabilitating the next day .
He has since had no setbacks , he said , and his off - season workout regimen has not been hindered .
It is too soon , he has been told , to start running , but he rides an exercise bike to maintain his range of motion and trains at a gym almost daily .
“ I ’m right on track , ” said Santana , adding that he intends to pitch for Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic .
“ Everything ’s been in place , the way it ’s supposed to be , and I ’m taking everything easy to make sure I ’m ready for spring training . ”
Telecommuting is great .
I 've been doing it full time for most of 20 years .
But it is n't perfect .
Working at home has its own set of irritations , some of which are n't well understood — particularly by those who do n't telecommute .
Some telecommuting frustrations are minor things that seem too petty to complain about , especially to those who are stuck in rush hour traffic .
Others are major problems that can affect your career .
This article lists some from each category , provided by real telecommuters who have entirely too much personal experience .
CIO.com has plenty more information on improving the telecommuting lifestyle .
Start with Seven
Things the CIO Should Know About Telecommuting and then see the rest of the articles in our telecommuting resource guide .
Telecommuting 's Trivial Annoyances
Are these minor ?
Sure .
Would they keep you from telecommuting ?
No .
But they sure do add up .
1 . No free food .
During tight deadline crunches and at team get - togethers , the office brings in lunch for in - person meeting participants .
People who work at home are excluded from the free pizza , office donuts and holiday potlucks .
Considering the generally poor quality of such food , and a telecommuter 's freedom to toddle down the hall to the kitchen , this may not sound like a big deal .
But it works to exclude the remote team member from the community .
Also , telecommuters can be motivated by pizza as much as anyone else is .
( Besides , the kitchen can present its own danger .
Many new telecommuters put on ten pounds because it 's entirely too easy to snack . )
2. Technology gets in the way .
You can't count on coworkers or clients to have the PC skills or hardware necessary to set up a remote meeting with screen sharing , webcams , etc .
A lot of time is wasted sorting out those issues .
Nor is this problem limited to others :
When your own Internet access gets flaky , you can't get your work done .
3 . You need to create a go - to - work routine .
For some , telecommuting is difficult because there 's no ramp - up time driving to the office , coffee in hand , during which a worker plans out the day .
4 . You have no reason to dress up .
One telecommuting advantage is that you can work all day in your bathrobe .
But it also means you never have an excuse to wear make - up or jewelry .
And nobody compliments you about your beautiful new sweater .
( It 's red . )
5 . You miss the " meeting after the meeting . "
You see it all the time when you 're in the office :
The meeting is supposedly over , everyone says their farewells , and the folks in the office hang up the speakerphone .
Almost immediately , the conversation continues around the conference table in a far less inhibited way than it did when everyone was involved .
6 . You find out about relevant events too late .
Team members can schedule events ( such as training classes ) so late that it 's difficult for telecommuters to arrange to travel to the office .
Often , it 's too expensive or seemingly pointless to try to attend .
7. People fail to recognize time zone differences .
If the home office is on the east coast , some people assume you are on the east coast .
So they will blithely call someone in California in a home office at 6:00 am , thinking that it 's 9:00 am .
( " Oh gosh , sorry I woke you .
But can you still answer this question for me ? " )
8 . The many teleconference inadequacies .
Oh , there are so many !
Few people understand teleconference etiquette , and telecommuters spend a lot of time on conference calls .
For example : the annoyance of people who lead teleconferences ( with a half dozen participants ) and start out by saying , " Who 's here ? "
Doing so makes everyone on the phone wonder if it's their turn to speak up ; or everyone talks at once .
Instead :
If this is your weekly meeting , just go around the table and take a roll call ( " Joe ? " " I 'm here . " " Steve ? " " Yup . "
And so on . ) .
We could list several ways in which people could stand to improve their teleconferencing skills .
( And in fact we have , in Running an Effective Teleconference or Virtual Meeting . )
Here are a few more specific to telecommuting :
Being subjected to terrible music - on - hold .
Worse , when you start to sing along ... and that 's when you suddenly find yourself belting out Kenny Loggins ' songs in the middle of the teleconference .
Uh ... Hi , Boss !
People who send a dial - code without regard to someone 's ability to read or type it in .
Send 800- 123-4567 , please , not 8001234567 .
Organizers who show up late .
Telecommuters are stuck listening to music - on - hold for ten minutes , during which they wonder , " Was today the right day ?
Did I miss the meeting ? "
People who mumble , talk very quietly , or otherwise do n't direct their voice to a mic ; no one on the phone can hear them .
Or those who rustle stuff right by the mic , so nobody on the phone can hear anything .
How many times is it polite to interrupt and say , " Hey , speak up ! " ?
People who do n't mute their phones when they 're in a noisy environment , so the entire team learns which plane is boarding but cannot hear each other speak .
People who refer to a lot of visuals without bothering to send the file to telecommuters ; and then they do n't refer aloud to the data they 're pointing at .
Meeting organizers who forget to conference in the remote people for the meeting .
And that 's the minor problems .
Telecommuting 's Unspoken Disadvantages
Most of the items above are irritating , but other issues are more serious and have lasting effects on a team 's ability to collaborate and on an employee 's belief that he is a valued member .
9. Travel Budget ?
What Travel Budget ?
When you signed on as a full time telecommuter , everyone ( from management on down ) agreed how often you would spend a week in the office ( say , once every three or four months ) .
But when the budget gets tight , the very first thing to be cut is the travel budget for your on - site trips .
Does n't that make you feel special and valued ?
10 .
It 's hard to read emotions from afar .
This might sound like a " little " thing , but it has big ramifications : you miss body language , intonation and serendipitous hallway encounters that help build an organization 's integument .
Despite e-mail , instant messaging and social networks , it 's not the same .
( Which is why those quarterly visits are so important . )
11 . The lack of immediate , nonverbal feedback .
When you attend a meeting in person , you can see when people look uncomfortable at an idea you propose , or when their body language indicates they are offended by a joke you tell .
It 's hard to fix social or team problems that you can't see .
12 . You have to work harder to form interpersonal relationships .
There 's no small talk while getting coffee from a vending machine during a break in the meeting .
That limits group effectiveness , but more importantly , it sucks a lot of the enjoyment out of the work experience .
13 .
You do n't get the office gossip .
This might sound like an advantage to those who are weary of never - ending tattletales , but it 's yet another way for telecommuters to fall out of the loop .
On a personal level , it means you do n't know about a coworker 's family bereavement so you can sent a card ; you do n't learn that someone got engaged , became a grandparent or took a leave of absence .
Professionally , it means you do n't hear about decisions that affect your work , and you miss general news from other departments , such as staff promotions and transfers .
14 . Your family and friends do n't understand that you 're working at home .
You are n't hanging around , ready to take on any " honey - do " task and infinitely interruptible .
Too many people assume that you have all day every day to take care of logistics , with no work responsibilities .
Training children that " Daddy 's working " is hard .
Training spouses is worse .
( Pets , however , believe that your keyboard is the best place to sleep .
That 's not necessarily a disadvantage , though . )
15 .
Out of site ( pun intended ) , out of mind .
Telecommuters can sometimes feel as though they wear an invisibility cloak .
You have to make an extra effort to connect with coworkers and clients .
You can't just stop by somebody 's office to get a quick question answered ; you need to wait for him to respond to an e-mail message or phone call .
Few people treat those communications media with the same urgency as someone standing at their office door .
16 . Some employers make telecommuting difficult .
Some companies still frown on telecommuting because they are sure that anyone working at home cannot be trusted to actually , gasp , work at home .
Thus they put ridiculous and arbitrary barriers in place .
For example : requiring staff to create a work plan with management approval on what you would work on , then file a report a day later indicating how much you got done .
( Yes , that 's a true story . )
17 . Employees who prove the distrustful management view to be accurate .
Some people are not self - starters and treat their own work - at - home days the way their managers fear : I 'll dial in for the meeting , I 'll poke at some of my work , and I 'll spend the rest of the day playing on Facebook or doing personal errands .
Those " telecommuters " imagine that everyone has as poor a work ethic as they do .
Such workers give the rest of us a bad name , and enrage telecommuters whose major problem — the much more common one — is that they can't stop working .
( Your computer calls to you .
Constantly .
Nights and weekends . )
That 's just the start , however .
I 'm sure you could add your own telecommuting pet peeves to the list — minor and major .

CCTV , China :
A fatal accident was captured on camera when a coal truck made a roll over trying to dodge two motorcyclists that run a red light at an intersection .
This guide intended for Gentlemen who do not wish to break the social norms when relieving themselves and want to alleviate any awkwardness in the Men 's Room .
1 ) WHERE TO GO ?
Using either urinal or a stall is acceptable , although most Gentlemen with any self - reliance should use the urinal .
Make every effort not to enter the restrooms at the same time as a buddy or work colleague .
If you do enter at the same time as someone else , one of you will be expected to use the stall so as to avoid an awkward situation .
If there are 2 urinals and one is in use , use a stall .
If there are 3 urinals and the middle one is in use , use a stall .
If there are 3 urinals and the 2 outer ones are in use , use a stall .
If there are 3 urinals and one end one is in use , use the other end urinal .
For larger bathrooms , the general rule is to leave a courtesy buffer of at least one empty urinal between you and the next Gentlemen .
The above rule does not apply in busy / heavy drinking events such as sports events , bars , and night clubs .
In this case each Gentleman is expected to follow the ' one urinal , one Gentleman ' rule .
If there is a long trough then the general rule for knowing how close you may stand to another Gentleman is that you should never be able to ' cross the streams ' .
Stand with legs shoulder - width apart .
One hand on the hip or in a pocket is considered ' good form ' .
Placing both hands on your ' unit ' should be avoided .
If you need both hands to take aim then you should go back to potty training .
In normal circumstances it is expected to look straight ahead at the wall .
You may also look down to check your aim .
All men of refinement understand that ' Shooting the soap ' is fun .
Do not look at anyone else , or turn around to see who has just entered the room .
Some forward - thinking bars and clubs place newspapers , sports memorabilia or posters on the wall directly in front of you .
If you are talking to the person next to you and you feel that it would be rude to continue to stare at the wall , then turn your head and lock eyes with the other Gentleman .
Never look with 30 degrees of another Gentleman 's ' unit ' .
Talking should be avoided if possible .
A cursory ' hello ' is much more acceptable and comfortable for both parties than a full conversation .
Never start a conversation until you are both washing your hands .
If someone starts a conversation with you , keep it very brief , but polite .
If a conversation is in progress as you enter the bathroom with someone else , try to pause the talking until hand washing is in progress .
Never , under any circumstances , talk to someone in a stall .
Talking on cell phones used to be completely prohibited , but is now gradually becoming more accepted .
Try to keep conversations to sport and the weather .
The normal ending process is the ' shake and squeeze ' .
Some Gentlemen may have the bravado to shake their entire body , perhaps even standing up on their toes if they feel particularly upbeat .
Spitting is considered ' good form ' .
Flush the urinal with gusto ... as if you were changing gear in Ferrari 360 .
It is expected that you wash your hands unless you are particularly intoxicated .

The reason given was “ security concerns . ”
According to Damian Thompson , of the London Telegraph , the School had no such fears when known “ members of Al - Mujaharoun , a pro-terror Islamist organisation , ” spoke there .
Thompson was in attendance .
“ The presence of the group was announced in advance , but that was OK with the School .
Presumably that was because it was also OK with the Islamic campus ideologues in front of whom it cowers . ’ ”
This is maddening and tragic .
According to Peter Whittle , Director of the New Culture Forum ( who , to his credit , has just invited Murray to chair their first program of 2009 ) :
“ The ban on Mr Murray is outrageous .
Even more worrying however is the total silence on such occasions from our elected ‘ representatives ’ in public life .
Are they cowards ?
Are they in denial ?
Certainly , Douglas Murray is neither . ”
I have met and worked with Douglas Murray .
He is a bright , shining star .
His Center has recently published an excellent study ( by James Brandon and Salam Hafez ) titled : “ Crimes of the Community : Honor - Based Violence in the UK . ”
I have just drawn upon this for my own forthcoming study about honor killings in the West which will soon be published in The Middle East Quarterly .
And , I have also been banned , albeit more “ softly , ” by Cambridge University .
Asked to deliver a keynote address about Islamic gender apartheid and the failure of western feminists to address it , I agreed to do so ; but I asked them to evaluate whether or not I might need security .
They must have done so for they cancelled their invitation to me to speak at the international conference .
According to my friend and colleague , the esteemed author and journalist , Carol Gould , “ Both Douglas Murray and Peter Whittle are brave and tireless champions of free speech in an ever more repressive British society living in fear of offending Islamic radicals and their followers . ”
The handwriting is on the sky .
The Islamic mobs have slaughtered and silenced their own intellectuals and human rights activists .
They are now turning to their Western - based counterparts .
The West seems suicidally ready to give us up .
Why is Holland putting Geert Wilders on trial for “ anti-Islamic hate speech ” instead of deporting those whom themselves “ hate ” free speech and truth - telling and who speak in the language of violence ?
Why is the London School of Economics banning Murray but allowing jihadic terrorists to speak at will ?
I would like to thank Carol Gould for calling this matter to my attention .
Classmates.com User Sues ; Schoolmates Were n't Really Looking for Him A Classmates.com user sues , claiming no one was trying to reach him .
Nov. 12 , 2008  --
When Classmates.com told user Anthony Michaels last Christmas
Eve that his former school chums were trying to contact him , he pulled out his wallet and upgraded to the premium membership that would let him contact long - lost fifth - grade dodge - ball buddies and see if his secret crush from high school had looked him up online .
But once he'd parted with the $ 15 , Michaels learned the shocking truth :
No one he knew was trying to contact him at all .
Classmates.com 's come - on was a lie , and he'd been scammed .
At least that 's what the San Diego resident alleges in a lawsuit filed against one of the net 's original social networking sites , whose banner ads featuring unflattering yearbook pictures remain a staple around the internet .
If the lawsuit , which is seeking class action status , succeeds , it could raise the minimum standards of honesty for online businesses .
" Upon logging into his Gold Membership profile in order to view the classmate contacts … Plaintiff discovered that in fact , no former classmate of his had tried to contact him or view his profile , " the complaint reads .
" Of those www.classmates.com users who were characterized ... as members who viewed Plaintiff 's profile , none were former classmates of Plaintiff or persons familiar with or known to Plaintiff for that matter . "
The putative class action suit , filed in a California state court on October 30 , says there are hundreds of thousands of Anthony Michaels around the country who were similarly duped .
The lawsuit asks the court to force the company to refund millions in subscription dollars and fine the company for deceptive advertising .
Lawsuits that seem funny are not always a laughing matter , according to Scott A. Kamber , a plaintiff 's attorney with KamberEdelson .
" Cases that seemingly have a similar chuckle factor are rooted in a real consumer fraud that influences a consumer purchase decision , " Kamber said .
" Sometimes people are defrauded and misled and obviously there is a financial benefit in companies making those claims or they would n't do it . "
Classmates.com could have a good defense , according to internet law expert Mark Rasch , if someone was actually contacting Michaels but was defrauding Clasmates.com by claiming to have gone to a certain high school .
" Or were they making statements they know to be false to induce a person to pony up the oney for a premium service to learn these statements were n't true ? "
Rasch asked .
" A lot of this comes down to knowledge and intent on the part of Classmates.com . "
Classmates.com was founded in 1995 , years before Friendster , MySpace or Facebook grew popular , and is one of the net 's largest advertisers , having spent $ 30 million in 2005 , for example , on online advertising .
The company claims to have 40 million registered users , some of whom pay $ 15 every three months to be able to send and receive messages .
The site 's billing practices are complained about nearly daily on ConsumerAffairs.com .
The suit is not the first legal action accusing a prominent online company of deception .
In 2003 , Bonzi Software settled a class action lawsuit that alleged its banner ads ( which mimicked Windows operating system warnings ) were deceptive .
And in January , Member Source Media agreed to pay $ 200,000 to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint about the company 's spam messages that promised consumers , " Congratulations .
You 've won an iPod video player . "
While the FTC and state attorneys general have handled some deceptive advertising claims , in tight financial times the burden of online fraud fighting is increasingly falling on class - action attorneys , according to Kamber .
" Attorney General offices are seriously under budget pressure and federal enforcement in last eight last years has not been picking up the slack for the state budget issues , " Kamber said .
" That leaves class action attorneys on the front line of technology in the consumer area . "
Neither Classmates.com nor Michaels ' law firm , Kabateck , Brown and Kellner , responded to requests for comment .
Attorney Erik Sinrod , a partner at Duane Morris in San Francisco and a legal columnist at Findlaw , says that legitmate companies make a better target for lawsuits than outright scammers , like those sending fraudulent offers of long - lost Nigerian fortunes .
" Classmates.com is not some fly - by - night company -- it is a real service , not something being operated by unknown people offshore , " Sinrod said .
" So they are subject to U.S. law and regulators if they are conduct themselves improperly . "
The Office of Thrift Supervision ’s western regional director , Darrel W. Dochow , allowed IndyMac Bank to receive $ 18 million from its parent company on May 9 but to book the money as having arrived on March 31 , according to the Treasury Department ’s inspector general , Eric M. Thorson .
The backdated capital infusion allowed IndyMac to plug a hole that its auditors had belatedly found in the bank ’s financial results for the first quarter .
If IndyMac had not been able to plug that hole retroactively , its reserves would have slipped below the minimum level that regulators require for classifying banks as well capitalized .
Though the $ 18 million transaction was minuscule in comparison to IndyMac ’s $ 32 billion in assets , it had tremendous significance .
If IndyMac had lost its well - capitalized status it would not have been allowed to accept “ brokered deposits ” from other financial institutions .
Brokered deposits are typically high - yielding certificates of deposit arranged by brokers and sold to savings and loans .
IndyMac relied heavily on brokered deposits , which amounted to $ 6.8 billion or 37 percent of its total deposits last spring .
“ This is very significant in terms of whether IndyMac was over or under the O.T.S. ’s thresholds for capital , ” said Bert Ely , a veteran banking analysts in Alexandria , Va .
“ But what ’s really troubling is that it seems to have been going on elsewhere . ”
The episode had a link to the savings - and - loan scandals of the late 1980s , which cost the federal government more than $ 100 billion .
Mr. Dochow played a central role in the savings - and - loan scandal of the 1980s , overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize Lincoln Savings , the giant savings and loan owned by Charles Keating .
Lincoln became one of the biggest institutions to collapse .
Mr. Keating served four and a half years in prison before his fraud and racketeering convictions were overturned .
He later pleaded guilty to more limited charges , and was sentenced to the time already served .
Federal health officials have begun a criminal investigation into the actions of the Peanut Corporation of America , which they said knowingly sold contaminated peanut butter and peanut products to major food makers .
The investigation is being conducted by the Food and Drug Administration and the Justice Department , according to Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof , director of the food center at the F.D.A .
The agency rarely discloses criminal investigations that are in progress , but did so in this case after several influential members of Congress demanded a criminal investigation in recent days .
The contamination of the company ’s products with salmonella bacteria has led to one of the largest food recalls in the nation ’s history .
More than 400 products containing peanuts , peanut butter or peanut meal have been recalled , and more recalls are expected .

Six things to do before Nov. 4 Barack Obama on the campaign issues : Taxes | Iraq | Energy | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights
Match up with a candidate :
Our issues game lets you compare your views with those of Obama and McCain .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Barack Obama has his Bill Ayers connection .
Now John McCain may have an Iran - Contra connection .
In the 1980s , McCain served on the advisory board to the U.S. chapter of an international group linked to ultra - right - wing death squads in Central America .
The U.S. Council for World Freedom aided rebels trying to overthrow the leftist government of Nicaragua .
That landed the group in the middle of the Iran - Contra affair and in legal trouble with the Internal Revenue Service , which revoked the charitable organization 's tax exemption .
The council created by retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub was the U.S. chapter of the World Anti-Communist League , an international organization linked to former Nazi collaborators and ultra - right - wing death squads in Central America .
After setting up the U.S. council , Singlaub served as the international league 's chairman .
McCain 's tie to Singlaub 's council is undergoing renewed scrutiny after his campaign criticized Obama for his link to Ayers , a former radical who engaged in violent acts 40 years ago .
Over the weekend , Democratic operative Paul Begala said on ABC's " This Week " that this " guilt by association " tactic could backfire on the McCain campaign by renewing discussion of McCain 's service on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom , " an ultraconservative right - wing group . "
In two interviews with The Associated Press in August and September , Singlaub said McCain became associated with the organization in the early 1980s as McCain launched his political career .
McCain was elected to the House in 1982 .
Singlaub said McCain was a supporter but not an active member .
" McCain was a new guy on the block learning the ropes , " Singlaub said .
" I think I met him in the Washington area when he was just a new congressman .
We had McCain on the board to make him feel like he was n't left out .
It looks good to have names on a letterhead who are well - known and appreciated .
" I do n't recall talking to McCain at all on the work of the group , " Singlaub said .
McCain has said he resigned from the council in 1984 and asked in 1986 to have his name removed from the group 's letterhead .
" I did n't know whether ( the group 's activity ) was legal or illegal , but I did n't think I wanted to be associated with them , " McCain said in a 1986 newspaper interview .
Singlaub does not recall any McCain resignation in 1984 or May 1986 .
Nor does Joyce Downey , who oversaw the group 's day - to - day activities .
" That 's a surprise to me , " Singlaub said .
" This is the first time I 've ever heard that .
There may have been someone in his office communicating with our office . "
" I do n't ever remember hearing about his resigning , but I really was n't worried about that part of our activities , a housekeeping thing , " said Singlaub .
" If he did n't want to be on the board that 's OK .
It was n't as if he had been active participant and we were going to miss his help .
He had no active interest .
He certainly supported us . "
A news article and two documents tie McCain to the council in 1985 , a year after he says he resigned .
The group 's Internal Revenue Service filing in 1985 , covering the previous year , lists McCain as a member of the council 's advisory board .
In October 1985 , a States News Service report placed McCain , Rep. Tom Loeffler , R - Texas , and an Arizona congressman at a Washington awards ceremony staged by the council .
On Tuesday , the McCain campaign addressed the resignation by saying the candidate disassociated himself from " one Arizona - based group when questions were raised about its activities . "
Taking an opportunity to attack the Obama - Biden ticket , the McCain campaign added that as a House member and later as a senator , McCain fought against communist influence in Central America while Sen .
Joe Biden tried to cut off money for anti-communist forces in El Salvador and Nicaragua .
The renewed attention over McCain 's association with Singlaub 's group comes as his campaign steps up criticism of Obama 's dealings with Ayers , now a college professor who co-founded the Weather Underground in the 1960s and years later worked with Obama on the board of an education reform group in Chicago .
Ayers held a meet - the - candidate event at his home when Obama first ran for public office in the mid-1990s .
In McCain 's case , he was a House member and a board member of Singlaub 's council when , as a new congressman , he voted for military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras , a CIA - organized guerrilla force .
In 1984 , Congress cut off military assistance to the rebels .
Months before the cutoff , top Reagan administration officials ramped up a secret White House - directed supply network run by national security advisers Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter .
The operation 's day - to - day activities were handled by National Security Council aide Oliver North , who relied on retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord to carry out the operation .
The goal was to keep the Contras operating until Congress could be persuaded to resume CIA funding .
Singlaub 's private group became the public front for the secret White House activity .
" It was noted that they were trying to act as suppliers .
It was pretty good cover for us , " Secord , the field operations chief for the secret effort , said Tuesday in an interview .
The White House - directed network 's covert arms shipments , financed in part by the Reagan administration 's secret arms sales to Iran , exploded into the Iran - Contra affair in November 1986 .
The scandal proved to be the undoing of Singlaub 's council .
In 1987 , the IRS withdrew tax - exempt status from Singlaub 's group because of its activities on behalf of the Contras .
Peter Kornbluh , co-author of " The Iran - Contra Scandal : A Declassified History , " said the Council on World Freedom was crucial to diverting public attention from the Reagan White House 's fundraising for the Contras .
Singlaub and the council publicly urged private support for the Contras , providing what Singlaub later called " a lightning rod " to explain how the rebels sustained themselves despite Congress ' cutoff .
In October 1986 , the secrecy of North 's network unraveled after one of its planes was shot down over Nicaragua .
One American crewman , Eugene Hasenfus , was captured by the Nicaraguan government .
At first , Reagan administration officials lied by saying that the plane had no connection to the U.S. government and was part of Singlaub 's operation .
" I resented it that reporters thought it was my plane .
I do n't run a sloppy operation , " Singlaub told The AP .
In an interview last month , Downey , the full - time employee of Singlaub 's council , said she has a clear memory of McCain resigning in 1986 , but not earlier .
" It was during the time when the U.S. Council had been wrongly accused of being owners of the Hasenfus plane downed in Nicaragua , " said Downey .
" A couple of days after that , I was in Washington and called home to get messages from my mother .
I returned that call and a staff person wanted to ask for the resignation of Congressman McCain . "
When Hasenfus was shot down , McCain was in the final month of his first campaign for the Senate seat he still holds .
McCain 's office responded quickly .
McCain said he had resigned from the council in 1984 .
Further , McCain said that in May 1986 he asked the group to remove his name from the letterhead .
McCain 's office produced two letters from 1984 and 1986 to back his account .
The dates on the resignation letters in 1984 and May 1986 coincided with McCain election campaigns and increasingly critical public scrutiny of the World Anti-Communist League , the umbrella group Singlaub chaired .
In 1983 and 1984 for example , columnist Jack Anderson linked the league 's Latin American affiliate to death squad political assassinations .
The Latin American affiliate was kicked out of the league .
At the time , Singlaub told the columnist the Latin American affiliate had " knowingly promoted pro-Nazi groups " and was " virulently anti-Semitic . "
" That was putting it mildly , " Anderson wrote in a Sept. 11 , 1984 , column on alleged death squad murders , an article that appeared two months before the U.S. election day .
Two weeks after Anderson 's column , a letter from McCain addressed to Singlaub asks that the congressman 's name be taken off the board because he did n't have time for the council .
Singlaub told AP that " certainly by 1984 , " he had purged the World Anti-Communist League of extremists .
Singlaub complains that American news media wrote that the league had n't gotten rid of extremist elements and tried to tarnish the league 's credibility , " making something evil out of fighting communism . "

Spitting cobras do n't truly spit venom .
But they are incredibly accurate shooters , hitting a target — the victim 's eyes — from 2 feet ( 60 cm ) away with impressive accuracy , studies have shown .
New research confirms how they do it .
Scientists have long known that spitting cobras do n't actually spit .
Rather , muscle contractions squeeze the cobra 's venom gland , forcing venom to stream out of the snake 's fangs , explains Bruce Young , a researcher at the University of Massachusetts .
The muscles can produce enough pressure to spray venom up to 6 feet ( nearly 2 meters ) .
To be effective , venom — a cocktail of neurotoxins and tissue - attacking poisons — must make contact with an attacker 's eyes , where it causes severe pain and possibly blindness .
Turns out the venom does not hit a victim in just one spot .
Instead , the venom lands in complex geometric patterns .
A European study in 2005 showed that cobras do aim for the eyes , but their venom is shot out in a spray rather than a stream .
Young and his team now have figured out how this spray is generated .
They used high - speed photography and electromyography ( EMG ) to detect contractions of cobra head and neck muscles .
The snakes engage their head and neck muscles a split second before " spitting " to rotate their heads , then jerk them from side to side .
" The venom - delivery system functions to propel the venom forward while the [ head and neck ] muscles produce rapid oscillations of the head that … disperse the venom , presumably maximizing the chance that a portion of the spat venom will contact the eye , " the researchers write in the journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology .
If you ’re at all interested in the conflict between Israel and Hamas , you have two things you need to do right this very second .
First , watch this remarkable video report from Zouheir Alnajjar , an Algerian - born guerrilla journalist who now lives in the Gaza Strip .
In it , a pair of Palestinian militants lead him , blindfolded , into their D.I.Y. rocket - building lab .
Then they show him how they make their weapons , out of fertilizer and scrap metal .
Then they fire the thing off .
Check it out – and thank Boing Boing for the heads - up .
Done ?
Okay , onto assignment number two : Jeffrey Goldberg ’s fascinating portrait of Hamas chieftain Nizar Rayyan .
He ’s a man of murderous acts — and extreme , twisted views .
While " it is not literally true that Jews today are descended from pigs and apes , but it is true that some of the ancestors of Jews were transformed into pigs and apes , and it is true that Allah continually makes the Jews pay for their crimes in many different ways .
They are a cursed people , " he tells Goldberg .
I asked him the question I always ask of Hamas leaders : Could you agree to anything more than a tactical cease - fire with Israel ?
I felt slightly ridiculous asking : A man who believes that God every now and again transforms Jews into pigs and apes might not be the most obvious candidate for peace talks at Camp David .
Mr. Rayyan answered the question as I thought he would , saying that a long - term cease - fire would be unnecessary , because it will not take long for the forces of
Islam to eradicate Israel .
There is a fixed idea among some Israeli leaders that Hamas can be bombed into moderation .
This is a false and dangerous notion .
It is true that Hamas can be deterred militarily for a time , but tanks cannot defeat deeply felt belief .
The reverse is also true : Hamas can not be cajoled into moderation .
Neither position credits Hamas with sincerity , or seriousness .

" In a government of law , the existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously .
Our government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher .
For good or for ill , it teaches the whole people by example .
Crime is contagious .
If the government becomes a lawbreaker , it breeds contempt for the law ; it invites every man to become a law unto himself ; it invites anarchy . "
~ Justice Louis Brandeis
Is Pakistan responsible for the Mumbai attack in India ?
No .
Is India ’s repression of its Muslim minority responsible ?
No .
Is the United States government responsible ?
Yes .
The attack on Mumbai required radicalized Muslims .
Radicalized Muslims resulted from the US overthrowing the elected government in Iran and imposing the Shah ; from the US stationing troops in Saudi Arabia ; from the US invading and attempting to occupy Afghanistan and Iraq , bombing weddings , funerals , and children ’s soccer games ; from the US violating international and US law by torturing its Muslim victims ; from the US enlisting Pakistan in its war against the Taliban ; from the US violating Pakistan ’s sovereignty by conducting military operations on Pakistani territory , killing Pakistani civilians ; from the US government supporting a half century of Israeli ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their lands , towns and villages ; from the assault of American culture on Muslim values ; from the US purchasing the government of Egypt to act as its puppet ; from US arrogance that America is the supreme arbiter of morality .
As Justice Brandeis said , crime is contagious .
Government teaches by example , and America ’s example is lawlessness .
America ’s brutal crimes against the Muslim world have invited every Muslim to become a law unto himself — a revolutionary .
It is not terror that Washington confronts but revolution .
By illegal , uncivilized and undiplomatic behavior , the US has stirred Muslim peoples from their long slumber as serfs of Western colonial powers .
Some Muslims have had all that they can take , and their fury drives them to rouse a billion of their fellows to throw off the yoke of foreign hegemony .
The arrogant incompetence of American governments brought this conflict to the American people and inflicted it upon the world .
By destabilizing Pakistan , the US lost a puppet and created an opportunity for Muslim revolutionaries to exploit .
By enraging India against Pakistan , the Mumbai attack has created new problems for Pakistan that will focus that government ’s attention away from combating Taliban sanctuaries on Pakistan ’s border with Afghanistan .
If the US picks up the slack , it will have invaded yet another country and become trapped in a larger quagmire .
Having fomented terrorism , the American government now pretends to be the innocent victim , just as Israelis , having brought about terrorism by driving Palestinians from their homes and villages , pretend to be innocent victims .
Today European members of NATO , an outdated organization formed to defend Western Europe against Soviet invasion , are sacrificing the lives of their soldiers fighting the American Empire ’s war in Afghanistan .
If America continues to have its way , Europeans will soon be dying in Ukraine , Georgia , and Iran .
The American government , which preaches " freedom and democracy " has in the 21st century gone to great extremes to stamp out the US Constitution and the civil liberties that it guarantees .
The US government has repudiated the Geneva Conventions and the prohibitions in US statutory law against torture .
The US government has set aside habeas corpus , the ancient legal principle guaranteed by the US Constitution that prohibits governments from holding people in prisons without presenting charges .
The US government has broken the laws of other nations by kidnapping foreign citizens and transporting them to other lands to be tortured .
These massive crimes have been justified in the name of the " war on terror . "
In truth , America ’s crimes foment revolution .
It was the US government that created the " war on terror , " which has been used to murder and dispossess millions of Iraqis and Afghans , to imprison US citizens as if they were medieval serfs , and to squander three trillion dollars for the sole purpose of enriching Halliburton and the military - security complex .
Investigative journalist John Pilger has shown that the so - called " moral superiority of the West " is a hoax designed to shield from view the self - seeking West ’s crimes against humanity .
Obama promised change from this destructive behavior , but how does change arise when the most arrogant woman on earth is appointed Secretary of State and the rest of the new government is staffed with tried - and - true Likudniks and servants of the military - security complex ?
The change over which Obama will preside will have no American victories .
The change will come from America as a failed state , from the dollar dethroned as reserve currency , from America repudiated by its allies and paid puppets , from massive unemployment for which there is no solution , from hyperinflation that produces anarchy .
The day might arrive when Washington is faced with revolution at home as well as abroad .

The Chinese Government says a total of 294,000 children fell ill from consuming dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine , with 154 of them still in serious condition .
In a statement on its website , the health ministry also indicated the number of dead may rise from the four previously announced , saying that six deaths since September 10 may be linked to the consumption of melamine - laced milk .
The health ministry 's total number of children sickened amid this year 's scandal was a more than five - fold rise from the Government 's previous figure given in September of 53,000 .

Inheriting Victory in Iraq
William McGurn writes in today 's Journal :
In a few hours , George W. Bush will walk out of the Oval Office for the last time as president .
As he leaves , he carries with him the near - universal opprobrium of the permanent class that inhabits our nation 's capital .
Yet perhaps the most important reason for this unpopularity is the one least commented on .
Here 's a hint :
It 's not because of his failures .
To the contrary , Mr. Bush 's disfavor in Washington owes more to his greatest success .
Simply put , there are those who will never forgive Mr. Bush for not losing a war they had all declared unwinnable .
As McGurn notes , both Obama and Biden opposed the surge on the grounds that it would only make the situation worse , and both subscribed to the view widely held among the press and the Democratic leadership that the war was lost -- that the only thing to do was to retreat , even at the cost of genocide in Iraq .
We now know that Bush was right , the surge has succeeded , and even liberals like Peter Beinart are demanding that their fellow Democrats admit their mistake .
The result is that Obama has inherited victory in Iraq .
Bush has done more than , as McGurn quotes Biden in early 2007 , " keep it from totally collapsing ...[ until he could ] hand it off to the next guy . "
Now rather than retreat in defeat , our new president must manage to withdraw American troops without undermining their success .
It will be a tremendous challenge , but the press will not be able to blame Bush if security deteriorates in Iraq after Obama gives the Joint Chiefs their " new mission . "
The victory in Iraq is Obama 's to lose .
The European Union will have a population of 499.7 million at the start of 2009 , the EU 's statistics bureau Eurostat said Monday .

It has been 25 years since he ordered a martini , shaken , not stirred .
But Sean Connery , who played James Bond in seven of the classic spy movies , has a sudden taste for a comeback - as a villain .
Preliminary discussions are said to have taken place between the 77 - year - old actor and Bond producers since Daniel Craig reinvigorated the 007 role two years ago with Casino Royale .
Scroll down for more ...
But it would take an exceptional pay - cheque to lure Connery , who usually commands £ 10 million a film , out of retirement .
He first played Bond in 1962's Dr No , followed by From Russia With Love , Goldfinger , Thunderball , You Only Live Twice , Diamonds Are Forever then Never Say Never Again in 1983 .
" I would n't mind coming back as a Bond villain , " he said .
" But I do n't think they would pay me enough money . "
The actor who played Ian Fleming 's agent on screen seven times , says he has been so impressed by Daniel Craig 's debut that he wants to be pitched against him .

" I think Daniel Craig is a terrific choice , " said Connery .
" I think they 're going back to a more realistic type of Bond movie as I do n't think they could have gone much further with the special effects . "
He added : " They do n't pay the money for the other parts , only for the Bond character , although that was n't the case when I was doing it . "
The jibe about money is related to the fact that Connery earned just £ 50,000 to play James Bond for the first time .
By his last 007 movie in 1983 , where he also negotiated a percentage of profits , Connery was paid £ 3 million .

Daniel Craig has signed a £ 30 million deal to make the next four films in the Bond franchise .
Connery added that despite not playing 007 for the past 25 years , he is still typecast by the part .
Asked about losing the James Bond tag , he said : " It 's not something that 's ever likely to happen , " he says .

Waiting for the Next Generation of Open Source Business Models
by Ostatic Staff - Dec. 30 , 2008
One of the big debates going on in December among the open source cognoscenti is whether fee - based models are going to start to proliferate .
This post contends that 2009 will see a lot more business models built around formerly free software , and this post points to support among CTOs for charging for open source software .
I tend to agree that we 'll see more of this , but charging for what was formerly free has to be handled deftly .
Here are some important points about monetization models .
Dana Blankenhorn argues that open source business models must be voluntary .
" Proprietary models are all compulsory .
You want the PC , you buy the Microsoft license . "
Without a doubt , the way to build a sustainable monetization model for open source is to make users want to pay for what they perceive to be valuable .
Red
Hat has proven that it can do well with a model where code is free , but customers choose to pay for support and services .
Other open source projects offer a free , open source solution but build extra functionality into fee - based variants .
This has proven to work very well in the freeware arena , and I think we 'll see more of it .
There is also room for tiered Software - as - a - Service solutions .
For example , Ulteo.com lets you use the OpenOffice applications online and gives you 1GB of storage for free , but you can pay moderate fees if you want more storage .
The company is also doing interesting things surrounding letting people use Linux and Windows concurrently , which could blossom into a number of different fee - based services .
This post forwards an idea that I very much agree with : " Have a great freaking product , and charge a fair price for it . "
Very true .
It goes on to propose , though , that there are three workable business models for open source projects :
1. Selling support , consulting and related services for the " free " software ( aka the professional open source business model ) – RedHat 2 .
Dual license the code and then sell traditional software licenses to enterprise customers who are scared of the GPL – MySQL AB 3 .
Build a proprietary Web application powered by open source software – Google
I think there are actually many more workable models than these .
In 2009 , we 're likely to see open source offerings challenge the pricing models for cloud services , SaaS applications , and much more , where the challenge will be for entrepeneurs to come up with creative new ways to monetize projects .
Creative is the key word there , and ongoing creativity is why we have n't yet seen all workable open source business models .
[ TYPES ]
First mechanized proofs of type soundness of delimited control
We present two very different mechanized proofs of soundness of a type - and - effect system for delimited control operators shift / reset .
Our calculus is call - by - value simply - typed lambda - calculus with constants and answer - type - modifying delimited control .
The dynamic semantics is small - step .
This is the calculus originally proposed by Danvy and Filinski , enhanced by Asai and Kameyama ( APLAS07 ) with let - bound polymorphism .
The constants of the calculus may include natural numbers , arithmetic , and the fixpoint .
The type of a general expression specifies not only the type of the produced value but also the _effect_ of the expression .
In the simplest case , the effect may be raising of an exception ; more complex effects include co-routine invocations or backtracking .
The type of a functional value is not just a->b but rather a /t1->b/t2 , so to describe effects that may occur when the function is applied .
Despite the more complex expression and arrow types , all types are inferred and no type annotations are required .
This is joint work with Kenichi Asai , Noriko Hirota , Yukiyoshi Kameyama and Chung - chieh Shan .
One mechanized soundness proof is done in Coq with a locally nameless methodology .
The calculus includes the let - bound polymorphism but omits , for simplicity , the fixpoint and constants .
This development deals only with meta - theory : it proves subject reduction and progress properties , but does not infer types and does not evaluate expressions .
The complete Coq development is available at http://okmij.org/ftp/formalizations/shift-Coq/README.dr
We have also mechanized type soundness in Twelf , using an approach that is different from known to us ways of mechanizing meta - theory in Twelf .
We present not only progress and subject reduction proofs but also the type inferencer and the evaluator : we can run sample terms and see their types .
Our code includes the standard shift / reset test suite .
It is Twelf itself that infers and checks object language types .
We did not specify the type - checking relation since terms not typeable in the object language cannot be built .
More remarkably , the one - step evaluator of our calculus is also the proof term of type soundness .
In other words , the very _proof_ of type soundness can be used to evaluate sample expressions .
Proofs literally have a practical use .
The functional relation eval for one - step reduction is defined as eval : { E:exp
T} non-value E -> exp T -> type .
That definition itself is the statement of subject reduction : any expression E of type T which is not a value is reduced to an expression of the same type T. Furthermore , eval is total : _every_ non-value can be further reduced .
This is the statement of progress .
We supply the totality declaration , and Twelf agrees .
The Twelf development is available at http://okmij.org/ftp/formalizations/tagless-dl.elf
Here is an introduction to the tagless typed approach to mechanizing type soundness in Twelf , for simply typed lambda - calculus : http://okmij.org/ftp/formalizations/tagless-l.elf
We have also tried Isabelle / HOL .
Without the nominal package , Kenichi Asai has formalized Danvy / Filinski calculus with the type - and - effect system , without let - polymorphism .
He has proved subject reduction .
http://okmij.org/ftp/formalizations/shift-Isabelle/README.dr
To introduce let - polymorphism into this framework , one has to consider alpha - renaming more seriously .
He tried Nominal Isabelle for this purpose , but without success , because of the eigen variable problem in a proof tree .
The bound variables in terms are nicely treated by the nominal package , but a similar problem occurred for a variable that is introduced within a proof tree that has to be fresh .
HSBC banker found hanged by belt at 5 - star London hotel after ' committing suicide '
A leading City banker was found hanged in a five - star hotel in an apparent suicide , police said yesterday .
Christen Schnor , 49 , was discovered by a hotel worker naked with a belt around his neck in the cupboard of his £ 500 a night suite .
The married father of two earned a six - figure salary as HSBC 's head of insurance and also had a seat on the bank 's executive committee .
Tragedy : Mr Schnor on a ski trip with friend Nicole Vseticka
A suicide note written in his native Danish was found next to his body when he was discovered last Wednesday afternoon .
Police are not treating the death as suspicious .
Mr Schnor and his wife , Marianne , rented a £ 390 a day four - bedroom flat in a Victorian mansion in Chelsea .
He was believed to be staying at the nearby Jumeriah Carlton Tower Hotel while building work was carried out on his flat .
Mr Schnor , a former soldier , also ran a real estate business in France with his wife and was described by friends as a man of ' independent wealth . '
He joined HSBC last year from the pensions company Winterthur Group where he had been an executive board member since 2003 .
At the time HSBC chief executive Dyfrig John said his proven expertise in the insurance industry would take the bank 's operations to a new level of ' excellence and performance . '
A spokesman for the bank said last night : ' Our thoughts are with his family and we will do all we can to help them at this difficult time . '
Mr Schnor worked at the HSBC building in Canary Wharf
HSBC suffered 500 job losses earlier this month , but is regarded as one of the world 's strongest bank 's which is best prepared for the global financial crisis .
Mr Schnor grew up in Denmark and went to school in Runsted , an exclusive suburb north of the capital Copenhagen .
He later attended the city 's military academy and after graduating in 1984 spent five years in the army .
But he quit in 1989 and started a career in business with British Tyre & Rubber .
He received an MBA in international business from the Henley Management College in 1994 and went on to work in Hong Kong and Switzerland before moving to London .
But he continued to play a role in the Danish military and last year was appointed lieutenant colonel in the country 's army reserve .
A colleague said : ' Christen did not seem under any pressure and was quiet man .
He always appeared hard - working , diligent and very capable . '
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were called to reports of a man found hanging in hotel room at 2.30 pm on December 17 .
He said : ' The 49 - year - old man was pronounced dead at the scene .
' A post mortem will take place in due course .
His death is being treated as non-suspicious . '
Earlier this year Mr Schnor became embroiled in a legal row with the landlords of his rented flat after claiming he had to spend £ 4,500 decorating it , even though the agents had said it would be put in good decorative order when he moved in .
He also alleged that delays meant he and his wife did not get possession of the flat for a month after they signed the two - year lease .
Apparently a voluntary ban on chemicals in toys is n’t enough to do the trick in Canada .
A year - long survey found that three - quarters of soft plastic toys in the country contain chemicals founds to be dangerous …and banned in the European Union .
[ social_buttons ]
Like so many other stories about chemicals in everyday products , the countries of North America once again come up short of Europe .
The chemical family is phthalates , and the chemicals are used to soften toys for children .
But they ’ve been found to cause reproductive harm and cancer , and since they easily leach from toys , they can be especially dangerous to children who suck on everything when learning to teeth .
>> Read more about the chemicals in everyday products at Green Options
President Bush has also recognized their danger , and toys containing the chemicals will be illegal to sell in the United States in February .
“ What these results mean is that many toys on sale in Canada are illegal to sell in the European Union and George Bush ’s government has said that they are too toxic to be on sale in the U.S. as of February .
So why do Canadian kids deserve less protection than George Bush is giving to American children ? ” asked Rick Smith , executive director of Environmental Defence , in an interview with CanWest News Service .
Though the chemicals were taken out of teethers and rattles a decade ago , there was never any sort of ban on other toys , which children are just as apt to put into their mouths .
I think this shows that there must be strong legislation to take chemicals out of everyday products .
It ’s only when countries , such as those in Europe , have prohibited chemicals that they actually have been taken out of products on a wide scale .
It ’s absurd that some companies make two different kinds of products to sell to two different types of markets : that of the countries who accept the chemicals , and that of the countries who have n’t .
America can claim itself a leader in many areas , but in this case , it ’s far behind .

Obama sides with protesting Chicago factory workers Stephen C. Webster
Published : Sunday December 7 , 2008
Print This Email This On Sunday , the third day of sit - in protests by workers at Chicago 's Republic Windows and Doors , spirits were lifted among the desperate activists by a reassurance from none other than the President - elect .
 When it comes to the situation here in Chicago with the workers who are asking for their benefits and payments they have earned , I think they are absolutely right ,  said Obama during a Sunday news conference , as reported by the Chicago Sun -Times .
 What s happening to them is reflective of whats happening across this economy .
 When you have a financial system that is shaky , credit contracts .
Businesses large and small start cutting back on their plants and equipment and their workforces .
That s why its so important for us to maintain a strong financial system .
But its also important for us to make sure that the plans and programs that we design arent just targeted at maintaining the solvency of banks , but they are designed to get money out the doors and to help people on Main Street .
So , number one , I think that these workers , if they have earned their benefits and their pay , then these companies need to follow through on those commitments .
 Number two , I think it is important for us to make sure that , moving forward , any economic plan we put in place helps businesses to meet payroll so we are not seeing these kinds of circumstances again .
Have we done everything that we can to make sure credit is flowing to businesses and to families , and to students who are trying to get loans ?
And to homeowners who have been making payments on their homes but are still finding their property values so depressed that it becomes very difficult for them to make the mortgage payments ? "

Rwandan and Democratic Republic of Congo officials announced Friday the arrest of Gen. Laurent Nkunda , a Congolese Tutsi rebel leader wanted for war crimes in Congo ( formerly Zaire ) .
Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) reports that General Nkunda was captured in Rwanda Thursday after being chased across the Congo - Rwanda border by joint forces from both countries .
Congo issued an arrest warrant for Nkunda in 2005 for war crimes committed by the rebel faction he led , the National Congress for the Defence of the People ( CNDP ) .
Nkunda and the CNDP sought to overthrow the Congolese government , led by Joseph Kabila , and claim to be protecting the Tutsi people of eastern Congo from Hutu militias that fled Rwanda .
The BBC writes that Nkunda 's arrest is a " startling about - turn by Rwanda , which had been accused of backing Gen Nkunda . "
Nkunda 's position was complicated by the departure of Bosco Ntaganda , Nkunda 's former chief of staff , reports the Associated Press .
Mr. Ntaganda formed a splinter movement of the CNDP and announced last week that his new group would cooperate with the Congolese army in hunting Hutu rebels , with the goal of eventually integrating into Congo 's military .
The Times ( London ) adds that his arrest may also be due to his allies ' irritation with " his erratic , narcissistic style – promising one thing in media interviews before contradicting himself days later . "
Experts note that Nkunda 's captures does n't mean that the conflict in Congo will end soon , writes Bloomberg .
It may mean that Nkunda will be brought to justice for war crimes , though .
The International Herald Tribune reports that human right groups say Nkunda was involved in mass killings while part of a different rebel faction in 2002 .
They also say that the CNDP has carried out several massacres since Nkunda founded the group .
As a result , Reuters writes , human rights groups " said they would be watching how Rwanda and Congo dealt with Nkunda . "
As Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson acknowleged during a news conference on Wednesday , the initial decision to buy troubled mortgage assets of financial institutions was " not the most effective way " to use the $ 700 billion bailout package .
Instead , the Treasury will now use the money to buy securities backed by credit card debt , student loans , auto loans , housing and government agency debt .
The intent is to help unfreeze those markets , where interest rates have soared and consumers often are unable to get credit for purchases .
Paulson said that 40 percent of US consumer credit is provided through such securities .
" This market , which is vital for lending and growth , has for all practical purposes ground to a halt , " Paulson said .
For real - time , after - hours quotes on all the Dow 30 stocks , click here .
The Treasury also plans to continue injecting money directly into troubled banks as well as nonbank financial institutions .
There is one change , however : the banks may have to raise funds privately in order to get government money .
For Investors
So how exactly would the new plan work ?
According to economists , the Treasury would simply go out and buy some of these consumer - debt securities whenever the price fell far enough to push the yield up to a certain level , say 9 percent .
Like Treasury bonds , these debt securities have a fixed interest rate , so their yield changes according to whatever price investors are willing to pay for them .
If investors knew that the government would enter the market whenever the yield on these securities hit 9 % , the theory goes , that would encourage them to buy up the debt as well .
The Cristiano Ronaldo to Spain saga resurfaced on Wednesday when a Real Madrid director was quoted as saying that Manchester United had agreed to allow the Portuguese winger to move to the Bernabéu next summer .
According to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo , only a confidentiality clause prevents Madrid from announcing the deal , while it also claims that other directors have privately leaked the news too .
The newspaper published a conversation between the Real Madrid director Pedro Trapote and a " very close confidant " which it claims took place two days ago .
" We have already signed the top player for next summer , " El Mundo alleges Trapote to have said .
" The top is the top .
It is Cristiano , there is no one else .
It 's not bad , is it ? "
But Trapote added : " It is better not to say anything right now because there are clauses that prevent us from announcing it right now .
For us it would be the right moment [ to go public ] but we should n't do so . "
Doubts remain , however , after the Madrid president , Ramón Calderón , himself privately briefed that Ronaldo 's transfer was a certainty last summer only for him to remain at Old Trafford .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Turn up the heat , somebody .
The globe is freezing .
Even Al Gore is looking for an extra blanket .
Winter has barely come to the northern latitudes and already we ’ve got bigger goosebumps than usual .
So far the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reports 63 record snowfalls in the United States , 115 lowest - ever temperatures for the month .
Only 44 Octobers over the past 114 years have been cooler than this last one .
The polar ice is accumulating faster than usual , and some of the experts now concede that the globe has n’t warmed since 1995 .
You may have noticed , in fact , that Al and his pals , having given up on the sun , no longer even warn of global warming .
Now it ’s “ climate change . ”
The marketing men enlisted by Al and the doom criers to come up with a flexible “ brand ” took a cue from the country philosopher who observed , correctly , that “ if you ’ve got one foot in the fire and the other in a bucket of ice , on average you ’re warm . ”
On average , “ climate change ” covers every possibility .
This is similar to the science practiced by Dr. James Hansen at NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , the source of much of the voodoo that Al Gore has been peddling since the doctor showed up at a Senate hearing in 1988 and told ghost stories that Al swallowed whole .
Only last month Dr. Hansen ’s institute announced that October was the hottest on record , and then said “ uh , never mind . ”
The London Daily Telegraph calls this “ a surreal blunder [ that ] raised a huge question mark about the temperature records that underpin the worldwide alarm over global warming . ”
In this account , the institute had to make the humiliating climb - down after two leading skeptics of the global - warming scam , Anthony Watts , an American meteorologist , and Steve McIntyre , a Canadian computer analyst , discovered that temperature readings from September had been carried over and repeated for October .
We should sigh , shrug and give the scientists at NASA the benefit of the doubt that this was a mistake and not a deliberate howl at the moon .
A spokesman for the institute explains that readings borrowed from Russia , which had been described as 10 degrees higher than normal for October , distorted the figures but , after all , the data had been obtained from others .
So we should blame someone else .
This is the science we ’re expected to take on faith .
The false figures - we must be generous and not say “ faked ” - were supplied by the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change .
These are the most widely quoted readings , and consistently show higher temperatures than other “ data sets . ”
Would the United Nations lie ?
( No giggling , please . )
This sets a new standard for hubris , arrogance and haughty self - importance .
Skeptics of the global - warming scam , even those with unquestioned academic and real - world credentials , are treated as ignorant pariahs by pundits , presidential candidates and other politicians who know better , or ought to .
This is not the first time , writes Christopher Booker in the Daily Telegraph , that Dr. Hansen ’s methodology has been sharply questioned .
Two years ago , Messrs .
Watts and McIntyre , the bloggers who caught the October fiasco , forced him to withdraw his published findings on surface temperatures in the United States , to correct his claim that the hottest decade of the 20th century was the 1990s .
It was the 1930s , when the much - maligned sport utility vehicle was still a truck and Detroit made economical cars everybody wanted .
Man ’s notion that his science can realign the stars , adjust the orbit of planets and reorganize the universe leads him to say silly things and assert goofy claims .
Saying silly things and asserting goofy claims is usually harmless as entertainment , so long as the claims are subjected to rigorous analysis and debate .
But contrarian arguments about global warming , climate change and freezing heat are not tolerated by the scientists with an uneasy grip on the research money .
It ’s clear now that the earth has been cooling for the past decade , to the sorrow of the special pleaders and despite everything Al can do about it .
The solar cycle peaked , the sun is quieter , the sunspots have faded and everybody but Al is cooling off .
Even the United Nations says so .
The director of the U.N. ’s panel on climate change concedes that nature has overwhelmed everything man can do and it might even be another decade before man can rally and the warming resumes .
Until then , like it or not , nature rules the cosmos .

Crack open a cold can of awesome and get a load of the Mission Gathering Church ‘s billboard in San Diego , which reads :
“ Mission Gathering Christian Church is sorry for the narrow - minded , judgmental , deceptive , manipulative actions of those who took away the rights and equality of so many in the name of God . ”
The church was founded by a group of young adults who say they wanted “ to embody God ’s grace to the emerging / postmodern culture they were a part of . ”
It ’s affiliated with The Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) which has approximately 723,000 members throughout North America and is the denomination Ronald Reagan was baptized in .
So , despite having a Facebook page and a podcast that includes titles like “ Sexuality & Spirituality : Sex , Lies and Craigslist ” , the apologetic Christians sit squarely within the mainline Protestant tradition .
San Diego has been arguably the epicenter of the Prop 8 .
protest movement , with over 25,000 people marching in the streets in last week ’s “ Day of Impact Protest ” – the largest group anywhere .
Q : Is it better to drive an older , well - maintained car that gets about 25 miles per gallon or to buy a new car that gets about 35 miles per gallon ?
– Edward Peabody , via e-mail
A : It definitely makes more sense from a green perspective to keep your old car running and well - maintained as long as you can – especially if it ’s getting such good mileage .
There are significant environmental costs to both manufacturing a new automobile and adding your old car to the ever - growing collective junk heap .
A 2004 analysis by Toyota found that as much as 28 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life cycle of a typical gasoline - powered car can occur during its manufacture and transportation to the dealer ; the remaining emissions occur during driving once its new owner takes possession .
An earlier study by Seikei University in Japan put the prepurchase number at 12 percent .
Regardless of which result is closer to the truth , your current car has already passed its manufacture and transport stage , so the relevant comparison has to do with its remaining carbon footprint compared with that of a new car ’s manufacture , transport , and driver ’s footprints – not to mention the environmental impact of disposing of your old car or selling it to a new owner who will continue to drive it .
There are environmental impacts even if your old car is junked , dismantled , and sold for parts and scrap .
Do n’t forget that the new hybrids – despite their lower emissions and better gas mileage – actually have a much larger environmental impact in their manufacturing compared with nonhybrids .
The batteries that hybrids use to store energy for the drivetrain are no friend to the environment – and having two engines ( gas and electric ) under one hood increases manufacturing emissions .
And all - electric vehicles are only emission - free if the outlet providing the juice is connected to a renewable energy source , rather than a coal - burning power plant , which is more likely .
You can assess your car ’s fuel efficiency or emissions by using one of many services available online .
The government website FuelEconomy.gov provides fuel efficiency figures for hundreds of different vehicles dating back to 1985 .
Web­­sites like TrackYourGasMileage.com and MPGTune.com can help you track your mileage and provide ongoing tips to improve fuel efficiency for your specific make and model vehicle .
MyMileMarker.com takes it a step further , making projections about annual mileage , fuel costs , and fuel efficiency based on your driving habits .
If you have an iPhone , you can keep track of your car ’s carbon footprint with the new Greenmeter App from Hunter Research and Technologies .
The program tracks numerous variables to make its calculations as you drive , including weather conditions , cost of fuel , vehicle weight , and more .
If you simply must change your vehicle , be it for fuel efficiency or some other reason , one option is to simply buy a used car that gets better gas mileage than your existing one .
There ’s much to be said , from many environmental vantage points , about postponing replacement purchases – of anything , not just cars .
It ’s a good idea to keep out of the waste stream anything that has already been made and to delay the additional environmental costs of making something new .

A little while ago a nightly of Firefox 3.1 included support for the new Element Traversal API proposed by the W3C .
The purpose of this proposal is to make it easier for developers to traverse through DOM elements without having to worry about intermediary text nodes , comment nodes , etc .
This has long been a bane of web developers , in particular , with cases like document.documentElement.firstChild yielding different results depending on the whitespace structure of a document .
The Element Traversal API introduces a number of new DOM node properties which can make this traversing much simpler .
Here ’s a full break - down of the existing DOM node properties and their new counterparts :
Purpose All DOM Nodes Just DOM Elements First .firstChild .firstElementChild Last .lastChild .lastElementChild Previous .previousSibling .previousElementSibling Next .nextSibling .nextElementSibling Length .childNodes.length .childElementCount
These properties provide a fairly simple addition to the DOM specification ( and , honestly , they ’re something that should ’ve been in the specification to begin with ) .
There is one property that is conspicuously absent , though : .childElements ( as a counterpart to .childNodes ) .
This property ( which contained a live NodeSet of the child elements of the DOM element ) was in previous iterations of the specification but it seems to have gone on the cutting room floor at some point in the interim .
But all is not lost .
Right now Internet Explorer , Opera , and Safari all support a .children property which provides a super - set of the functionality that was supposed to have been make possible by .childElements .
When support for the Element Traversal API was finally landed for Firefox 3.1 , support for .children was included .
This now means that every major browser will support this property ( far in advance of all browsers supporting the rest of the true Element Traversal specification ) .
I think that the Element Traversal spec is missing a huge opportunity here to specify something that has become a de facto standard amongst browsers .
Maybe it ’ll make the second version of the Element Traversal spec , heh .
There are two big points that need to be explored here :
Now that the .children property is virtually everywhere how can we start to use it to simplify our code ?
Can we use .children , or parts of the Element Traversal API , to help speed up existing code ?
To answer this question I mocked up a quick little plugin for jQuery that replaces the internals of the existing .prev( ) , .next ( ) , .prevAll ( ) , .nextAll ( ) , .siblings ( ) , and .children ( ) methods with .children and the Element Traversal API methods .
The resulting code is absolutely simpler – previously there were numerous checks to see if a Node was , or was not , a DOM element – which resulted in lots of extra kludgy methods to handle those cases .
But was the code faster ?
I plugged the code into Dromaeo to see if there was any speed up in Firefox 3.1 .
The result ?
There is no discernible speed improvement to using the new DOM Traversal methods ( .firstChildElement , etc. ) .
This is n’t , necessarily , a bad thing – we just got the same performance that we see now but with a better API .
However there is a large improvement in speed when using .children ( for the .siblings ( ) and .children ( ) j Query methods ) .
With this addition .siblings ( ) is 84 % faster and .children ( ) is 35 % faster .
Considering that the .children method is now available in all browsers it ’s making a lot of sense for people to get on board and start using it in their code bases for a definite hot path to extra performance .
( Although , this is definitely not a new revelation – with frameworks like Dojo having used . children in their selector code for quite some time now . )
FL's 24th District ' Vote - Rigging ' Congressman , Election Integrity Enemy , Finally Defeated ...
Jim Cirile Byon
11/4/2008 , 6:31 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jim Cirile
Republican Congressman Tom Feeney , rated by nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( C.R.E.W. ) as one of the " most corrupt members of Congress " for three years straight , has been defeated in Florida 's 24th district .
Regular readers of The BRAD BLOG readers know Feeney as the man who allegedly asked computer programmer Clint Curtis to write vote - flipping software in 2000 and escaped all accountability in an investigation stacked with Jeb Bush loyalists .
( Full Curtis / Feeney scandal story summarized here , indexed in full here , new documentary film about the terrifying story here . )
According to the official FL Sec State website , as of 9:25 PM Eastern time , Feeney is losing to his Democratic challenger , Suzanne Kosmas by 19 percentage points -- 59 % Kosmas , 40 % Feeney .
While we here at The BRAD BLOG are of course saddened that it was not Clint Curtis himself --- who left the Republican party after his dealings with Feeney and ran as a Democrat to unseat him in '06 and again in '08 when he lost in the primary --- who finally ended Feeney 's ruinous reign , hey , any way we can get rid of Feeney , we 'll take it .
Of course , Kosmas is a corporate blue dog Dem with ethics issues of here own , as we 've discussed here previously , but at this point we 'll take the lesser of two evils and happily discharge Mr. Feeney .
Here are your walking papers , sir .
Job poorly done .
Now Go Away .
Hopefully to jail .

Deflation talk is surfacing in China as Chairman Liu Mingkang says China December Producer Price Index to Drop .
China 's producer price index is expected to drop " sharply " in December , China Banking Regulatory Commission Chairman Liu Mingkang said .
The world 's fourth - biggest economy is shifting toward deflation , Liu told a financial forum in Beijing today .
Capital inflows may shift to outflows , with gross domestic product projected around 8 percent next year , he said .
China 's producer - price inflation slowed to half the pace estimated by economists in November as commodity and energy costs fell , raising the possibility that the country will slide into deflation as demand wanes at home and abroad .
Prices at the factory gate rose 2 percent in November from a year earlier , the statistics bureau said Dec. 10 , after gaining 6.6 percent in October .
That was the slowest pace in two years and less than the 4.5 percent median estimate of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Massive Overcapacity In China
China ’s economic slowdown is deepening , with overcapacity in almost all industries , and wo n’t bottom out until after the first quarter of next year , two senior officials said today .
Exports fell for the first time in seven years last month , imports plunged and manufacturing contracted by a record as the global recession pushed the world ’s fourth - biggest economy into a slump .
The slowdown will deepen before a 4 trillion yuan ( $ 585 billion ) stimulus package kicks in from the second quarter of next year , Liu He , a senior economic policy official , said at a conference in Beijing .
China will support nine industries , including steel , telecommunications and automotive by cutting taxes , offering subsidies for technological upgrades and helping smaller companies get credit , Li , the industry minister , said .
China ’s industrial - production growth cooled in October to 8.2 percent , the weakest pace in seven years .
China may help steelmakers hurt by weaker demand for automobiles and electric appliances by purchasing steel stockpiles , offering subsidies for plant upgrades and increasing export - tax rebates , Li said .
“ Just about every industry ” has overcapacity , he said .
Purchasing Stockpiles Is No Solution
China to increase supply of money to boost economy
China said it plans to increase the amount of money circulating in its economy next year in a new effort to spur consumer spending and shield the country from a global downturn .
Saturday 's announcement by the country 's State Council , or Cabinet , comes on the heels of a multibillion - dollar economic stimulus package announced last month that calls for injecting more government money into the economy through spending on construction and other projects .
There are mounting signs that China 's economic slowdown is sharper and deeper than expected .
Exports fell in November for the first time in seven years and the industry minister warned Friday that worse was to come .
China will increase its money supply by 17 percent next year , the Cabinet said in a statement on its Web site .
It said that would be 3 to 4 percentage points above the total growth of economic output and consumer prices .
Beggar Thy Neighbor
Beggar Thy Neighbor :
An international trade policy of competitive devaluations and increased protective barriers that one country institutes to gain at the expense of its trading partners .
Note :
The following is from Asia Times .
The site has some nasty pop-ups at times .
The latest summit between the United States and Chinese officials graphically illustrates that China has learned to play two games from the West : hardball and beggar thy neighbor .
In fact , China 's new policy represents both retaliation and a bargaining chip .
The retaliatory part of the hardball message has been aimed directly at US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who , much to the displeasure of the Chinese , continues to repeat his demand for Chinese currency reform .
As for the beggar thy neighbor , it has become clear over the past week that Chinese government officials intend to export their way out of the global economic crisis .
This is all too readily apparent in the recent downward movements of the Chinese yuan relative to the dollar .
Stripped of any rhetoric , this movement represents a " competitive devaluation " designed to boost Chinese exports to the US at the expense of both domestic US manufacturers and competing countries such as South Korea and Japan .
In fact , Chinese currency manipulation represents " beggar thy neighbor " on a grand scale .
By grossly undervaluing the Chinese yuan relative to the US dollar over the past five years , China has grown its economy on the backs of American workers and helped to decimate the American manufacturing base .
Today , it is almost impossible for American manufacturers to compete against their Chinese counterparts when the yuan is undervalued by 30 % or more .
Add to this an extensive array of illegal Chinese export subsidies , and it becomes easy to understand how China has been able to offshore so many American jobs to its own factories .
Does anyone want a strong currency ?
WASHINGTON -- Barack Obama will make his first foreign trip as president of the United States to Canada — restoring a long - standing tradition abandoned eight years ago by George W. Bush .
Officials in Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s office confirmed Obama has accepted an offer to visit Canada “ soon ” after his Jan. 20 inauguration as America ’s 44th president .
“ We have been in close contact with president - elect Obama ’s transition team , ” said Dimitri Soudas , a spokesman for the prime minister ’s office .
“ We can confirm that the president - elect has accepted the prime minister ’s invitation to visit Canada soon after he is inaugurated .
This will be president Obama ’s first foreign visit . ”
New U.S. presidents , dating to Warren Harding in 1923 and Franklin D. Roosevelt 1933 , have typically made Canada their first international visit following their election .
But Bush deviated from that historical pattern after his inauguration in 2001 , travelling to Mexico to meet with then - president Vicente Fox in a bid to improve ties and strike an immigration deal with America ’s southern neighbour .
The disclosure of Obama ’s trip to Canada came after word that the president - elect planned to meet this Monday in Washington with Mexican President Felipe Calderon , the first foreign leader he will meet since his election on Nov. 4 .
Soudas did not announce a date for the Obama visit , or disclose its location or specifics of the agenda .
Brooke Anderson , an official in Obama ’s presidential transition told Canwest News Service she could “ confirm that is true . ”
“ President - elect Obama looks forward to his visit to Canada .
It will be the first foreign visit in his presidency , underscoring the importance of the relationship between the United States and Canada , ” said Anderson , Obama ’s chief national security spokesman .
It ’s expected the date of the visit will not be known until after the inauguration .
Canada ’s junior Foreign Affairs minister Peter Kent said the move was great news for Canada .
“ It ’s a long tradition and it ’s a tradition that Canada is very proud of , ” he told Global News .
“ With very few exceptions Canada is the first visit made by an American president and our government is proud and delighted that President Obama will follow that tradition . ”
Harper does not plan to attend Obama ’s inauguration .
The Canadian government will be represented by Kent and Jason Kenney , the citizenship and immigration minister .
Stephen Clarkson , a political economy professor at the University of Toronto , said Obama ’s decision to make Canada the first country he visits as U.S. president shows that he wants to work closely with Harper .
“ This is symbolically , a great move for Canada , ” said Clarkson , who has been a professor for more than 40 years .
“ Canada is losing its importance to the world and to the United States in general .
This visit will show that the U.S. thinks that ‘ Canada is important to us ’ . ”
Clarkson said the amount of time Obama spends in Canada during his visit will set the schedule for what he and the prime minister will discuss .
“ There are a number of important issues to talk about .
They might have some problems because of their ideological differences .
Harper has been extremely close to ( President ) Bush on foreign policy positions and Kyoto , ” he said .
“ It may be important for Harper to listen to what Obama might say .
THE “ wall of money ” argument is a hardy investment perennial .
Back in the 1980s , it was the Japanese who would sweep in and push up stockmarkets .
In recent years , sovereign - wealth funds have assumed the role of sugar daddies , with cash readily available to support asset prices .
For a while , in the autumn of 2007 , things seemed to be going according to script , with the funds taking stakes in a number of American financial institutions .
But that round of investments turned out to be badly timed , and the sovereign - wealth funds quickly lost money on their stakes .
They have been awfully quiet since , even though one would have thought the state of corporate - bond and equity markets would give them plenty of scope to exploit their buying power .
Richard Cookson , a strategist at HSBC ( and formerly a journalist for The Economist ) , reckons this is not surprising .
For a start , he thinks it was always unlikely that reserves could keep growing as fast as they did in the first few years of this decade .
The growth of sovereign - wealth funds is , of course , directly related to current - account surpluses in emerging markets .
But the counterpart of a current - account surplus is a capital - account deficit .
It was always odd that fast - growing parts of the world economy were exporting capital to the slow - growing parts ; it should be the other way round .
Over the last year , foreign - exchange reserves in several countries have started to shrink ( see chart ) .
According to Mr Cookson , the reserves of South Korea , India and Russia have dropped by around one - fourth from their peaks .
This seems to be down to two factors .
First , commodity prices , a big earner for emerging markets , have collapsed .
Second , the currencies of emerging countries have come under pressure .
In the boom years , emerging - market governments were trying to hold their exchange rates down , so they were selling their local currency and buying dollars , euros and other foreign currencies .
That built up their reserves .
Now that their exchange rates are falling , they no longer need to intervene .
All of this means that sovereign - wealth funds are a bit less flush .
But Mr Cookson thinks that it is not just a matter of the funds being less of a net buyer ; they may turn into net sellers .
During the credit boom , Western banks did not just lend to hedge funds or subprime borrowers in Florida ; they also lent to companies in emerging markets .
In the current crunch , they are cutting back their lending across the globe .
Figures from the Bank for International Settlements show that foreign bank lending was already falling in the first half of the year — down 2.4 % of GDP in China , 5.7 % of GDP in the Philippines and 19.8 % of GDP in the Czech Republic .
Things have presumably got worse since then .
Where else will borrowers in the emerging markets turn for capital but to the sovereign - wealth funds ?
Russia has already used some of its money to inject capital into its struggling banks .
If things get bad enough , Mr Cookson argues , the sovereign - wealth funds may be forced to sell some overseas assets to provide the money for rescue packages .
In other words , if you were counting on sovereign - wealth funds to be the catalyst for a global stockmarket recovery , you may have to look elsewhere .
CHICAGO ---
Maybe you have an 85 - year - old grandfather who still whips through the newspaper crossword puzzle every morning or a 94 - year - old aunt who never forgets a name or a face .
They do n't seem to suffer the ravages of memory that beset most people as they age .
Researchers at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine wondered if the brains of the elderly with still laser sharp memory -- called " super aged " -- were somehow different than everyone else's .
So , instead of the usual approach in which scientists explore what goes wrong in a brain when older people lose their memory , they investigated what goes right in an aging brain that stays nimble .
Now they have a preliminary answer .
Scientists examined the brains of five deceased people considered super aged because of their high performance on memory tests when they were more than 80 years old and compared them to the brains of elderly , non-demented individuals .
Researchers found the super aged brains had many fewer fiber - like tangles than the brains of those who had aged normally .
The tangles consist of a protein called tau that accumulates inside brain cells and is thought to eventually kill the cells .
Tangles are found in moderate numbers in the brains of elderly and increase substantially in the brains of Alzheimer 's disease patients .
" This new finding in super aged brains is very exciting , " said Changiz Geula , principal investigator of the study and a research professor of neurology at the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer 's Disease Center at Northwestern 's Feinberg School .
" It was always assumed that the accumulation of these tangles is a progressive phenomenon through the aging process .
But we are seeing that some individuals are immune to tangle formation and that the presence of these tangles seems to influence cognitive performance . "
Individuals who have few tangles perform at superior levels , while those who have more tangles appear to be normal for their age , Geula noted .
Geula will present his findings Sunday , November 16 , at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in Washington , D.C .
The number of plaques in the brains of the super aged was similar to that in the brains of the normally aging group .
The plaque is an aggregation of protein called amyloid that becomes deposited outside the brain cell and disrupts communication between neurons .
Like tangles , plaques also are found in modest numbers in the brains of aged individuals and show a dramatic increase in number in Alzheimer 's disease .
Geula said the lower number of tangles in the super aged appears to be the critical difference in maintaining memory skills .
Some of the super aged in the study performed memory tasks at the level of people who were about 50 years old .
For example , after being told a story , they were able to remember it immediately after and still accurately recall its details 30 minutes later .
They also remembered a list of 15 words and recalled these words equally well when tested after 30 minutes .
Geula said new research will focus on what makes cells in super aged brains more resistant to tangle formation .
" We want to see what protects the brains of these individuals against the ravages that cause memory loss , " he said .
" Understanding the specific genetic and molecular characteristics of the brains that makes them resistant , someday may lead to the ability to protect average brains from memory loss . "
Geula 's research is part of a larger super aging study at Northwestern 's Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer 's Disease Center ( CNADC ) .
The study 's goal is to identify high functioning individuals over 80 and investigate what factors are important to maintain this ability into old age .
A number of super aged individuals have been identified and are being followed up annually with tests of cognitive abilities .
Recruitment continues for the study .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Hundreds of auto - parts suppliers , companies that make all the things that go into new cars , could fail this year leading to industry disruptions and big job losses .
What 's more , when Americans are ready to start buying cars again - projected to happen in about a year - the industry may find itself unable to build them .
" Things are bad and they are going to get worse very rapidly , " said Neil De Koker , president of industry group the Original Equipment Suppliers Association .
At least 10 % of the auto - parts suppliers in America face bankruptcy this year unless actions are taken to free up credit for the industry , De Koker said .
That would mean about 7,300 jobs lost from parts suppliers , but the full effect could be almost five times as large .
When a supplier shuts down , other related companies tend to go down too .
While government loans have helped ensure the near - term survival of some of the suppliers ' biggest customers , production cutbacks combined with tight credit markets have created urgent cash flow problems for many parts companies , according to De Koker .
Auto factory shutdowns later this year wo n't be caused by lack of demand for the product , but by the inability to produce it due to lack of parts , said Kimberly Rodriguez , an analyst with consultants Grant Thornton .
" The OEMs can pay their receivables , but that 's only a small piece of the pie , " said Rodriguez .
OEMs , or original equipment manufacturers , is an industry term for automakers as opposed to parts suppliers .
If a major automaker were to go bankrupt , De Koker said , the number of auto - parts suppliers facing failure would rise to as much 25 % .
Squeeze at the top
Automakers , themselves struggling to survive a crushing drop in demand , can't do much to help , said a source at one automaker , even though they see this as a problem that will , ultimately , become their problem .
" This is a tremendous concern , " said an auto company executive , who asked not be identified .
" There is tremendous chaos in the industry . "
It typically takes 45 days from the time a supplier sends parts to a carmakers ' factory until the bill for those parts gets paid .
While they wait for the checks to arrive , parts suppliers typically take out loans , using those " accounts receivable " invoices as collateral .
With auto sales down , automakers are slowing down production and idling factories .
That means , of course , fewer orders for parts .
That means fewer invoices against which to borrow to pay current costs .
To make matters worse , many banks are simply refusing to lend at all against accounts receivable from domestic automakers , said De Koker .
" We can't borrow money on a normal basis , " De Koker said , " because the banks just quit lending money , especially in the automobile industry . "
Asking for government bailouts , similar to those received by General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler , is n't feasible , De Koker said .
There are only a few major automakers , but thousands of parts suppliers .
What the government could do , De Koker said , is help to free up credit for the industry .
" The banks need assurance that it is safe to lend to the automobile industry , " he said .
De Koker suggests that government provide guarantees on loans based on accounts receivable from domestic automakers .
While that would n't make up for production cuts , it would at least restore the normal flow of money based on the current level of orders .
The automakers can offer some help to their suppliers when the need is critical .
For instance , automakers are sometimes asked to make quick payments for the parts they receive , which lessens the need for suppliers to rely on loans .
So far in January , 2009 , automakers have received more requests like this than they received in all of 2008 , said Rodriguez .
But the automakers are struggling , too .
" If suppliers started asking for that , the cash we have would just evaporate , " said the auto executive .
Trouble from the bottom
The biggest risk , Rodriguez said , is n't with the big parts suppliers that ship directly to the automakers .
Those companies , the ones that provide finished parts like seats , instrument clusters and headlights to automakers , tend to be bigger , more mature companies that are better prepared to handle market challenges in a way that , at least , minimizes disruption , she said .
The real danger lies in failures of companies further down in the chain , she said .
These are the companies that supply things like wiring , springs or raw materials to companies that make the larger components of a car .
The further down the supply chain failures happen , the broader the impact spreads , Rodriguez said .
While one company that makes seats , for instance , might supply several automakers , a company that makes wire frames or foam inserts might supply more than one seat company and those seat companies would , in turn , supply a much larger number of automakers .
Given the state of the industry - auto sales last month were running 36 % behind the pace set a year earlier - there is simply no way to support the number of parts suppliers currently in business , Rodriguez said .
A culling of some sort has to take place .
" My fear is that consolidation will not be as orderly as it could be , " she said , " and that will cause substantial production shutdowns that would not help the industry at all . "
Factory shutdowns caused by supply chain disruptions will likely begin later this year , she predicted .
Auto sales are expected to begin picking up a bit in early 2010 , according to industry analysts at CSM Automotive .
Rodriguez recommends a solution to the credit crisis problem similar to that suggested by De Koker : loan guarantees .
But Rodriguez would like to see a requirement that multiple lenders participate in each loan as a way of ensuring creditworthiness and spreading risk .
One positive side of the current crisis in the market , said Shelly Lombar , a bond analyst with Gimme Credit , is that companies are seeking help sooner .
That 's because , with credit markets frozen , companies have no cushion to save them .
" You can't wait until you 're down to your last $ 5 to go into bankruptcy , " she said .
But the credit problem , alone , should be relatively easy to solve .
Bringing back the customers will be harder .
" The ' more production ' part has to come from consumer confidence and more people buying cars , " she said .
Visitors said the park was nothing like the marketing on its website
In pictures
A security guard at a Lapland - style theme park criticised by visitors as " hell " and a " scam " said he resigned because he was " ashamed to work there " .
Adrian Wood worked in the security hut at Lapland New Forest which opened on Friday on the Hampshire - Dorset border .
He said he resigned at seeing a family take their mother out of a hospice for what could be her last Christmas .
A friend of Victor Mears , director of the attraction , said he was " genuinely concerned and upset " about events .
Mr Wood also said he and other staff had been attacked by irate visitors .
More than 2,000 people who paid £ 25 - £ 30 for tickets to the park near Ringwood have officially complained .
Hundreds of people want refunds and are calling for the closure of the attraction , complaining it does not resemble marketing images on its website .
Santa got attacked , one of the elves got smacked in the face and pushed into a pram

The website became unavailable on Monday afternoon , but has since been republished with different pictures .
Trading standards officers said they had visited the park but do not have the power to shut it down .
" I quit late Sunday afternoon due to all the events that have been going on , the complaints and the violence towards myself and to other members of staff , " Mr Wood told BBC News .
" But what put the final icing on the cake for me to walk out , was a family had taken their mother out of a hospice for cancer patients , who was n't expected to see this Christmas .
" So they decided to bring her to Lapland to see the Christmas show .
" On getting there they found it difficult to get access with the wheelchair with the mother .

" They were in a queue for nearly an hour - and - a - half in the pouring rain waiting to see Santa .
" If they 'd stayed another two to three hours they would have seen him , but unfortunately the queues were that long it was ridiculous . "
He said he felt " very , very sorry " for people who had visited the park .
" They have been ripped off , " he said .
In the three days that he worked there he said he was " inundated with complaints " .
' Punched in face ' " Santa got attacked , one of the elves got smacked in the face and pushed into a pram .
" I was punched in the forehead in the ticket office by an irate customer .
" I was ashamed to work there , really , really ashamed . "
The theme park 's website had shown pictures of snowy " winter wonderland " scenes and icicles .
It also promised real log cabins , a nativity scene , husky dogs and other animals , as well as a " bustling " Christmas market .
Many people said they were disappointed by the Chistmas market Hundreds of people have complained to the BBC about the park since the weekend , saying the animals looked unhappy and huskies looked thin and were chained up in a pen .
Other facilities , including a broken ice rink , were poor , they said , describing the site as a " scam " , a " joke " , " disorganised chaos " and " hell " .
Tickets cost £ 30 for individuals , £ 25 for each person for families of four or more , and £ 10 for children under two years old .
Many said they had spent £ 150 for a family to visit .
Some complained they then had to pay more to use some of the facilities once inside the park .
Meanwhile , East Dorset District Council has stopped the sale of alcohol on site because an application for a licence had been granted but was not yet in force .
The RSPCA said it was investigating after receiving a number of complaints .
Henry Mears , who organises the park 's marketing and advertising , told the BBC on Monday : " We do n't believe we ripped anyone off .
What is not here that we have n't advertised ? "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He blamed " a few groups of professional troublemakers " for the allegations over the attraction .
Mr Mears has not been available for comment since Monday morning .
However , a friend of Victor Mears , the registered director of Lapland New Forest , said things started to go wrong when the director was hospitalised in the run-up to the opening of the event .
David Bishop told the BBC : " They 're going to lose a hell of a lot of money and possibly one of them 's going to lose a house over this .
" They have n't tried to cheat , they have n't run , they have n't taken no money out of the bank .
" He was in floods of tears the other day when I was talking to him because he felt that he had done something wrong to kids . "
Unsatisfied customers have been advised by Consumer Direct to consider taking the matter to county court if writing a letter is unsuccessful .
The government - funded advice service has received more than 2,000 complaints about the theme park .

I 'm not beaten yet : Terry Prachett on the frustration and fury of Alzheimer's
He can no longer drive and struggles to dress himself but Terry Prachett , creator of the cult Discworld books , refuses to be broken by Alzheimer's .
Author Terry Pratchett has coined a word to describe the dementia with which he was diagnosed last year .
He calls it an ' embuggerance ' , which deftly expresses his frustration at the encumbrance it represents .
He recalls the fury and isolation he felt when he was told he had Alzheimer 's : ' When Satan was cast into the pit of hell and raged at heaven , he was only a trifle miffed compared to how I felt that day , ' he says .
' I felt totally alone , with the world receding from me in every direction . '
Although he calls it a ' wretched disease ' , since disclosing that he has it , he has retained his dark sense of comedy .
He began an address to his latest convention of fans by cracking a joke .
' I said , " Hello my name is ... "
Then I retrieved a crumpled piece of paper from my pocket and read out my name , ' he recalls .
Frustration and encumbrance : Terry Prachett described living with Alzheimer 's as ' embuggerance '
The audience laughed because Terry , afflicted by an illness that steals both memory and identity , was permitting them to do so .
Until the day he ' came out ' , as he puts it , and announced he had a very rare form of earlyonset dementia called posterior cortical atrophy ( PCA ) - he had not then turned 60 - he was , of course , best known as an author .
His most celebrated works are the comedy - fantasy Discworld novels - The Colour Of Magic , the film adaptation of the first book in the series , starring David Jason , has just been released on DVD .
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the series , which sells in such prodigious number that Terry long ago stopped trying to keep a tally , but at the last count he 'd sold 60 million books .
But such literary milestones have been eclipsed by his personal story .
When I broach the subject of his illness with a pointed , ' How are you ? ' he sighs a tad wearily .
He 's done nothing but talk about dementia , every permutation and implication of it , since September last year , and he 's practically run out of things to say .
' I have n't for a moment regretted coming out , as it were , because it does look as if that 's done some good , ' he says .
( He also donated £ 500,000 to research into the disease , thereby elevating awareness of it . ) '
Nevertheless , it 's amazing how I 've ceased to become an author and have now become Mr Alzheimer's .
' But to answer your question , I 'm fine .
I just had a test that showed I was pretty much the same as the last time I was tested .
It cheers me to find the creative process still works : my last book , Nation , was definitely written by a bloke with PCA - I 'd got halfway through it before I was diagnosed - and it got excellent reviews .
I know it was good .
That 's not a boast .
If it was n't , I would n't have sent it to the publisher . '
The illness has brought small , incremental changes .
He has difficulties handling the practicalities of the physical world , but his loquacity , vocabulary and his fertile imagination remain undiminished .
' I had to give up driving .
That would be a big thing for most men , but I did n't bat an eyelid .
It does n't interfere with my core business .
My wife drives ; my PA drives ; I can hire a cab .
The real embuggerance is that my typing and handwriting are all over the place , and I sometimes lose track of spellings completely .
' I also have the odd moment when my brain has to pause to sort things out .
The quintessential one is the glass revolving door .
I have to approach it very carefully .
It 's glass .
It 's full of reflections .
It 's coming towards me and going away at the same time .
I have to wait for a second or two before I go through .
But I 'm still coherent on just about every news channel , just more and more tired as the day wears on .
Which is n't what you 'd normally expect from someone with dementia , but I was diagnosed very early .
' If I did n't tell you anything was wrong , you 'd have to know me very well indeed to tell anything was amiss .
You 'd probably have to watch me getting dressed .
Retrieving a shirt sleeve that 's been turned inside - out can be tricky . '
He has told his fans , who are legion , worldwide and mostly women , that he wants to retain a sense of optimism and cheerfulness .
' But people still tend to come up and talk in hushed voices .
I say , " We 're not in church , you know . " '
They 've also sent in ideas for cures .
' I once said I 'd gnaw the a**e off a dead mole if I thought there was any science behind it .
That provoked a response from a mole catcher from Somerset who had a more ethereal cure in mind .
Lots of people have offered me all kinds of ideas , but I 've said I 'll only entertain offers of help from high - end experts in brain chemistry . '
He is famously uxorious and has been happily married to his wife , Lyn , for 40 years .
They have a daughter , Rhianna , 32 , also a writer , and live in rural Wiltshire where they keep a well - stocked garden and chickens - Terry returns from cleaning their coop for our chat .
I ask , what with his high proportion of women fans , whether he 's ever been propositioned .
He guffaws with laughter .
' Once , ' he confesses .
' In another country .
Proposition would be the wrong word , but unmistakable signals were sent and received .
I thanked the nice lady concerned for her kind offer to " show me the town " , but explained that I was moving on - I was on a signing tour .
' That afternoon I dropped into a gardening shop and bought a thermometer for my compost heap .
I 'd always wanted one .
I thought , " I 've extricated myself from an awkward situation and bought a compost thermometer .
I must be the most married man in the entire world . " '
He does not covet a starry , metropolitan lifestyle , and has obdurately resisted offers from Hollywood to adapt his books .
Only two , Hogfather and The Colour Of Magic , have been made into films , both for Sky TV .
' The budget for The Colour Of Magic was about the size of Arnold Schwarzenegger 's cigar bill , ' he says .
' I could play around with the script and make suggestions .
I wanted the Arch Chancellor 's study to be dustier , so they got a dust machine and did what they call , " snotting up " . '
He is genial company and would probably have chatted until teatime had Lyn not called on the intercom to remind him about lunch .
What are his hopes for the future ?
' It 's too early to say the war will be won because no one is talking about a cure .
It 's something like the treatment for HIV : you live with the disease to a decent age , and it 's kept pretty much in check , and then you die . '
Does he fear death ?
' No , it is n't death that worries me , ' he says .
' Everyone dies .
I 'd just quite like to be there when it happens . '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
To save the planet and move away from imported fuel , some say a big energy tax is the best way to go .
If the nation is going to develop fuel alternatives that will clean the air , limit global warming and make it energy independent , making fossil fuels more expensive is essential , supporters say .
Otherwise , fossil fuels are just too cheap to let alternatives emerge on a big scale .
And many say that with gas and oil prices currently so low , it 's the ideal time to push through a hefty tax .
Besides , they say eventually we 're going to be paying more for our energy , so it is important to stimulate the development of alternatives now before an energy crisis strikes .
Clean energy :
The next really , really big thing
" What 's at stake is whether or not America is going to be the winner in the next , great global industry , " John Doerr , a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins , told Congress Wednesday that higher fossil fuel prices are , among other things , essential if the U.S. is going to develop renewable industries .
The prospect of making fossil fuels more expensive is nearly a foregone conclusion .
Even when gas prices were over $ 4 a gallon this summer , both Democrat and Republican presidential candidates were pushing for regulations on greenhouse gasses .
Even Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , long accused of funding global - warming naysayers , seems to accept that some type of regulation is forthcoming and necessary .
What 's at issue now is how it should be done .
Congress will almost certainly debate a law capping greenhouse gas emissions in the coming year - a kind of tax wrapped in the guise of the free market .
There 's a decent chance the proposal will pass , ushering in higher prices for everything from electricity to manufactured goods , as companies are forced to either clean up their emissions or buy permits to pollute .
Proponents of this plan - known as cap - and - trade - say it 's needed because it uses market forces to bring about guaranteed reductions in greenhouse gasses .
It 's also modeled on a tried and successful plan to reduce acid rain , and is similar to the global plan already under way to limit greenhouse gasses - the Kyoto Treaty .
Carbon tax
But critics say this cap - and - trade is little more than a cop -out - an easy way for politicians to duck an unpopular tax .
The most efficient way to cut greenhouse gasses , many economists say , is a simple tax on carbon dioxide .
This is n't the small 10 cent - a - gallon increase proposed recently to pay for more road work .
This would be a hefty tax designed to cut fossil - fuel use .
A carbon tax , as explained by Dan Rosenblum of the Carbon Tax Center , would be a tax on oil , natural gas or coal levied at either the refinery , well head or mine mouth .
Naturally , energy companies would pas this tax on to consumers , who could expect to see a $ 1 - a - gallon increase in the price of gasoline and a $ 70 increase in the average monthly household electric bill once the taxes were fully phased in over 10 years , according to numbers from the Carbon Tax Center .
The carbon tax is five times more efficient than a cap - and - trade scheme , said Rosenblum , because it cuts out the need to administer the program - which would need a permitting agency , inspectors to monitor emissions , a carbon exchange futures market and Wall Street banks that would likely run it .
Exxon :
An unlikely proponent
Even Exxon , the world 's largest publicly traded oil company , favors a carbon tax over a cap - and - trade system .
" A carbon tax strikes us as a more direct , transparent and effective approach , " Rex Tillerson , Exxon 's chief executive , said at a speech in Washington Thursday .
" It is the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions - from investments made by companies , to fuel and product choices made by consumers . "
Supporters of cap - and - trade doubt a carbon tax would be more efficient , and say the flexibility offered by cap - and - trade make it a better solution .
" We have a system that is preferable to most of the people involved - companies , regulators and the international community , " said Eben Burnham - Snyder , a spokesman for Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass. ) of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
There are , of course , opponents of making fossil fuels more expensive at all , and they generally fall into two camps .
Some , like Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) who once famously called global warming the " greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people , " simply do n't think it 's a big deal .
Others say it may be a big deal and we should do something about it , but not now - not when the country is in the midst of the worst recession in decades .
To this last point , Rosenblum and other supporters say the carbon tax can be offset with tax breaks , like a reduction in the payroll tax .
That way , they say , the government could discourage something it does n't want - pollution - and encourage something it does - employment - through the tax code .
Still , a carbon tax has attracted scant supporters in Congress .
When Rep. Peter Stark ( D - Calif. ) proposed one last year , it attracted a total of three co-sponsors among the 435 House members .
" I know it 's widely popular and makes a lot of sense to economists and academics , " said one Democrat Senate staffer .
" But unless a member of Congress was considering early retirement , it 's not an approach they would consider on the Hill .
It 's political suicide . "
Sorry to inundate you with even more protest - ness , but this is happening all over the state today , citizens protesting Prop.

Jameth is over at the state capital capturing what 's going down today .

Seriously , how cool are these pics , phone - wise ?
Very .
We had no idea . )
He presided during the collapse of the investment banking system and the biggest Ponzi scheme in history , but according to head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Christopher Cox , none of that was his fault .
In an interview with the Washington Post , Cox â Wall Streetâs principal regulator â proffered a list of explanations for his actions and inaction .
On the failures of Lehmann Brothers and Bear Stearns , Cox told the Post the SECâs job was not to prevent investment banks from collapsing , " but rather [ to shelter ] their securities trading units from problems in the broader corporation . "
Of course , when the entire bank sinks , the securities desk goes , too .
As to how his agency missed Bernard Madoffâs giant Ponzi scheme , despite numerous warnings and aborted investigations , Cox claimed that " concerns about Madoff 's activities were never presented to the commissioners , " according to the Post .
The agency is now investigating itself to figure out how it managed to miss the red flags that led many bankers and investors to steer clear of Madoff .
The Post details how Cox took a machete to the agencyâs enforcement division â cutting staff , axing whole offices and hacking back at the fines imposed on Wall Streeters for violating SEC rules .
Yet Cox remains steadfast in his defense .
Hereâs how the Post put it :
When Cox was asked whether he should be blamed for a culture of lax enforcement that allowed multiple warnings about the fraud to go undetected , he said : " Absolutely not .
In fact , it 's in the DNA here that people thrive on bringing big cases . "
The Post points out that Cox was mostly sidelined as Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke shaped the financial rescue .
While they pushed for their version of the bailout , Cox was seen as a " nonplayer " sitting on the " sidelines , " according to the Post .
Cox concedes that he bent to " intense pressure " imposed by Paulson and Bernanke to ban short selling for three weeks in September .
He tries to put a different gloss on his failure to act on the other big problems , or to act more forcefully during the financial implosion :
" What we have done in this current turmoil is stay calm , which has been our greatest contribution â not being impulsive , not changing the rules willy - nilly , but going through a very professional and orderly process that takes into account unintended consequences and gives ample notice to market participants . "
Cox calls that a " signal achievement for the SEC . "
Bobby Brown's Scary Confession
Cringing is one of the first things that we do when we see singeron television .
Brown has been such a complete and total disaster for so many year that his confessions are not nearly as shocking as he intends .
In 2007 Bobby and his wife of fifteen years Whitney Houston divorced .
The pair shared their love of drugs and craziness that swarmed around the loopy train .
Brown talked to MTV.com recently and had this to say :
" I had a desk like Scarface 's in my room , and I kept ( cocaine ) piled up on it .
Every time I walked past my desk , I 'd make a line of coke from one end to the other .
I 'd take a straw and snort a line the same way Scarface did it in the movie .
You could n't tell me nothing .
I felt like I was Tony Montana !
The world was mine ! "
I never had to look for coke ; I kept it plentiful .
There was times when I went on my binges and would lock myself up in a room for days at a time just getting high . "
There is so not a whole heck of a lot to say here except maybe .... get your s#!t together because nobody really likes watching you on TV and another news flash - snorting that long line has seriously messed up something in your noggin .
The best thing that Brown could do at this point would be to star in a before and after documentary on exactly what the effects of long term drug use can do to the mind .

More than 10,000 demonstrators yelling , " Down with the pigs , " and carrying black flags marched through a city landscape of burned and looted shops in Athens in a nationwide strike which quickly turned violent as threw fire bombs and chunks of marble at the police .
The 24 - hour general strike , called by the country 's two largest private and public sector unions , was held amid increasing tensions in the country after days and nights of violence triggered by police shooting dead a 15 - year - old youth last Saturday in the bohemian Athens district of Exarchia .
Witnesses said the police officer deliberately aimed for the boy , but a ballistics report , not yet made public , showed on Wednesday the boy was killed by an accidental ricochet .
Despite pleas from the officers of their innocence , clashes erupted at the main court house before the hearing for the two officers accused of the shooting .
Protesters hurled two petrol bombs outside the Athens court as the two officers went before a magistrate for questioning , police said .
The two police , who are both under arrest , were making their first appearance before an investigating magistrate since the fatal shooting of 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos on Saturday .
The petrol bombs were thrown as the lawyer for the police officers , Alexis Kouyias , was preparing to talk to reporters outside the court .
The lawyer was not hurt .
Police said the youths who threw the bombs were friends of the dead boy .
The shooting sparked five days of violence across the country already discontented with the government over rising unemployment , scandals and poverty .
Hundreds of youths hurled fire bombs , bottles and stones at riot police on guard in front of parliament , who retaliated with tear gas .
The clashes continued for several hours throughout the city centre .
National strike adds insult to injury
After the march , a violent demonstration broke out
The nationwide strike grounded all flights at Athens ' international airport , shut down banks and schools and paralysed bus , tram and metro services .
Hospitals were operating on emergency staff .
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis had asked opposition party leaders to unite in an effort to end the crisis and appealed to unions to cancel Wednesday 's rally .
But no one was willing to compromise .
Instead , the main opposition Socialist party said the government , which has a one - seat majority in parliament , should resign saying it has lost the trust of the people .
Greece 's private - sector GSEE and public - sector ADEDY unions are protesting the government 's recent pension reforms , which raise the retirement age and cut back benefits .
The unions also oppose recent labour reforms , privatizations and tax - raising measures .
The two unions represent more than half of the country 's workforce of 5 million .
Rioting eroding patience of Athens citizens
The riots are having a clear effect on the people of Greece
Four successive nights of rioting and looting have left hundreds of cars , stores and buildings charred and gutted at least 10 cities across Greece and left many Athenians angry about the response of the government and police and their inability to stop the destruction .
The protests also spread abroad as the Greek embassies in London , Berlin , Paris and in Cyprus were occupied by demonstrators in the past few days .
Reports said rioters have damaged or destroyed more than 350 stores and 200 banks in Athens , while 50 buildings were damaged by fires .
Another 100 stores were damaged in Thessaloniki .
Damage is estimated in the millions of euros .
In the centre of Athens the majority of shops were shut for the day while in the popular areas of Plaka and Monastiraki they were devoid of tourists .
Embattled government promises help in recovery
Businesses have been hit by riots and face huge losses
The government , which has seen its ratings fall sharply behind the main opposition Socialists , has promised to compensate businesses for the damage suffered .
The prime minister had made similar promises when large parts of mainland Peloponnese suffered devastating forest fires more than a year ago .
Residents in those areas hit by the devastating fires claim the government 's promises were never met .
The shooting of the teenager was seen as the last straw by many young Greeks whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment rate and low wages .
Unemployment is pegged at over 7 per cent , and nearly 20 per cent of Greeks live below the poverty line , earning less than 600 euros ( $ 775 ) a month .
" Everyone appears to have let our children down .
Students have become more hostile towards us and to figures of authority , " Christos Kittas said on resigning as the dean of Athens University after rioting spread to campuses .
Creating Virtual Machines For Xen , KVM , VMware Workstation 6 , and VMware Server With vmbuilder On Ubuntu 8.10
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
vmbuilder is a tool ( introduced on Ubuntu 8.10 ) that allows you to build virtual machines ( with Ubuntu as the OS ) for multiple virtualization techniques .
Currently it supports Xen , KVM , VMware Workstation 6 , and VMware Server .
You can afterwards copy the virtual machines to another system ( a Xen , KVM , VMware Workstation 6 , or VMware Server host ) and run them there .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
I 'm using a machine with the hostname server1.example.com and the IP address 192.168.0.100 here as my host system .
Because we will run all the steps from this tutorial with root privileges , we can either prepend all commands in this tutorial with the string sudo , or we become root right now by typing
sudo su
2 Installing vmbuilder
vmbuilder can be installed as follows :
apt - get install python-vm - builder
3 Installing apt-proxy
Whenever vmbuilder builds a new VM , it has to download all packages from an Ubuntu mirror which can take quite some time .
To speed this up , we install apt - proxy ...
apt - get install apt- proxy
... to cache the downloaded packages so that subsequent VM installations will be a lot faster .
Now open /etc/ apt - proxy / apt- proxy - v2.conf ...
vi /etc / apt- proxy / apt-proxy - v2.conf
... and replace the default Ubuntu mirror with a mirror close to you ( e.g. http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu if you are in Germany ) :
[...] [ ubuntu ] ;;
Ubuntu archive backends =
http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu min_refresh_delay = 15 m [...]
Then we restart apt - proxy :
/etc/init.d/ apt-proxy restart
apt - proxy listens on port 9999 , so we can pass our local apt - proxy " mirror " as an argument to the vmbuilder script .
4 Using vmbuilder
Take a look at the following commands to learn how to use vmbuilder :
vmbuilder xen ubuntu -- help
vmbuilder kvm ubuntu -- help
vmbuilder vmw6 ubuntu -- help
vmbuilder vmserver ubuntu -- help
I will now create four virtual machines with the name vm7 , one for Xen , one for KVM , one for VMware Workstation 6 , and one for VMware Server .
I 'm assuming that you are using bridging for your virtual machines .
vmbuilder uses a template to create virtual machines - this template is located in the /etc / vmbuilder / libvirt / directory .
Because we must modify the template , we create a copy and modify that one :
mkdir -p ~/vm7/mytemplates/libvirt
cp /etc/vmbuilder / libvirt/*
~/vm7/mytemplates/libvirt/AdvertisementAdvertisement
Now we open
~/vm7/mytemplates/libvirt/libvirtxml.tmpl ...
vi ~/vm7/mytemplates/libvirt/libvirtxml.tmpl
... and change the network section from
[...] < interface type= ' network '> < source network= ' default '/> </interface > [... ]
to
[...] < interface type=' bridge '> < source bridge= 'br0 '/> </ interface > [...]
because we want the VMs to use bridging ( if you use NAT instead of bridging , then do n't modify the template ! ) .
Now we come to the partitioning of our VM .
We create a file called vmbuilder .
partition ...
Advertisement
vi ~/vm7/vmbuilder.partition
... and define the desired partitions as follows :
root 8000 swap 4000 / var 20000
This defines a root partition ( / ) with a size of 8000 MB , a swap partition of 4000MB , and a / var partition of 20000MB .
Of course , you are free to define whatever partitions you like ( as long as you also define root and swap ) .
I want to install openssh - server in the VM .
To make sure that each VM gets a unique OpenSSH key , we cannot install openssh - server when we create the VM .
Therefore we create a script called boot.sh that will be executed when the VM is booted for the first time .
It will install openssh - server ( with a unique key ) and also force the user ( I will use the default username administrator for my VMs together with the default password howtoforge ) to change the password when he logs in for the first time :
vi ~/vm7/boot.sh
# This script will run the first time the virtual machine boots #
It is ran as root .
# Expire the user account passwd -e administrator # Install openssh - server apt - get update apt - get install - qqy -- force - yes openssh - server
Make sure you replace the username administrator with your default login name .
( You can find more about this here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JeOSVMBuilder#First%20boot)
( You can also define a " first login " script as described here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JeOSVMBuilder#First%20login)
Obama details largest public works projects in generations RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 6 , 2008
Print This Email This President - elect promises millions of jobs through green programs , infrastructure modernization , Internet
WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US President - elect Barack Obama on Saturday vowed to make the largest investment in the country 's infrastructure since the 1950s and bolster development of broadband Internet connections as part of his program to create 2.5 million new jobs .
The announcement came less than a week after the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research officially said the United Sates was in a recession , which began in December 2007 .
Last month , Obama announced that he had asked his economic team to develop an economic recovery plan that will help save or create 2.5 million jobs , while rebuilding US infrastructure , improving schools , reducing the country 's dependence on foreign oil and saving billions of dollars .
In his weekly radio address on Saturday , the president - elect unveiled five specific components of the plan that he believes will help the country overcome the recession .
" We wo n't do it the old Washington way , " Obama said about his plan .
" We wo n't just throw money at the problem .
We 'll measure progress by the reforms we make and the results we achieve -- by the jobs we create , by the energy we save , by whether America is more competitive in the world . "
Under the plan , the Obama administration will launch a massive effort to make public buildings more energy - efficient by replacing old heating systems and installing energy efficient light bulbs .
" Our government now pays the highest energy bill in the world .
We need to change that , " said the president elect .
The future Democratic president also pledged to create employment on a mass scale .
" We will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s , " he said .
" We 'll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways , and we 'll set a simple rule - use it or lose it , " he said .
" If a state does n't act quickly to invest in roads and bridges in their communities , they 'll lose the money . "
The plan , according to Obama , also calls for launching a sweeping effort to modernize and upgrade school buildings by making them energy - efficient and equipped with computers .
" Because to help our children compete in a 21st century economy , we need to send them to 21st century schools , " he argued .
Obama also vowed to increase the accessibility of broadband Internet connections in the United States , making them available to schoolchildren and hospitals .
" It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption , " he said .
" Here , in the country that invented the Internet , every child should have the chance to get online , and they 'll get that chance when I 'm president -- because that 's how we 'll strengthen America 's competitiveness in the world . "
The president - elect also said the government must ensure that hospitals are connected to each other through the Internet .
Obama has promised a series of strong anti-recession measures early in his administration , vowing to return people to work .
According to official government data , the US economy contracted at a 0.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2007 but grew 0.8 percent in the first quarter and 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
It then contracted 0.5 percent in the third quarter , based on a provisional estimate .
The committee that made the recession assessment issued no forecast on how long it will last , but said that in the past they have run from six to 18 months .
The jobless rate , based on a separate survey of households , rose last month to 6.7 percent , the highest since October 1993 but slightly better than the consensus estimate of economists of 6.8 percent .
That survey showed 2.7 million people have joined the jobless ranks since the recession began .
The stunning retrenchment cut 533,000 jobs from US payrolls in November , sending the unemployment rate to a 15 - year high , according to official data .
The President - elect is asking supporters and detractors alike to send in their best ideas of how to aid the U.S. economy , and has provided a submission form on his transition team 's Web site , found here .
The following video was posted to President - elect Obama 's Change.gov on Saturday , Dec. 6 .

The $ 700 bn ( £ 494bn ) US bail - out package has already " clearly helped stabilise " the financial system , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has said .
But he added that there were still many challenges ahead and market turbulence was likely to continue for some time .
Mr Paulson said authorities had abandoned plans to use some of the $ 700 bn to buy up banks ' bad debts .
He also appeared to rule out giving any of the funds to US carmakers , saying the bail - out was for financial firms .
Falling stocks Instead of buying up the banks ' toxic debts , as first proposed by the rescue deal , the bail - out fund will continue to be used to buy shares in the lenders to help boost their balance sheets .
The US is embracing a form of state control and intervention that looks remarkably Chinese
Robert Peston , BBC Business Editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog in full However , Mr Paulson added that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve would continue to monitor whether bad - debt purchases could " play a useful role " in the future .
Mr Paulson 's comments did little to ease continuing investor jitters , and Wall Street 's main Dow Jones index ended Wednesday trading in New York down 4.7 % .
However , many analysts said he was right to backtrack on the plan to buy up the bad debts , saying it was difficult to see it being workable , and that simply buying up more banking stock was more straightforward .
" The best bet is just to give them [ the banks ] the capital and to let them absorb the losses anyway , " said Rudy Narvas , senior analyst at 4Cast .
" That is exactly what it looks like is happening . "
Carmakers Mr Paulson 's comments regarding America 's three main carmakers - General Motors , Ford and Chrysler - are likely to have disappointed House of Representatives Speaker and leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi .
BAIL - OUT PROGRESS 3 October - $ 700 bn rescue bill passes through Congress 14 October - Plans announced to buy $ 250bn in banking stock 26 October - First $ 115 bn spent buying shares in eight lenders 10 November - $ 40 bn to buy stake in insurer AIG
She is now calling for the three firms - which are struggling against big losses and falling sales - to share $ 25 m in emergency aid out of the $ 700 bn financial sector bail - out fund .
There is , however , a great deal of opposition to a bail - out for the car industry .
" Once we cross the divide from financial institutions to individual corporations , truly , where would you draw the line ? " said Jeff Sessions , Republican Senator for Alabama .
Massive losses
The call for help comes after General Motors ( GM ) announced a third - quarter operating loss of $ 4.2 bn last week .
The carmaker said it would run out of cash early in 2009 if market conditions did not improve .
GM also announced it would be forced to lay off 3,600 workers , and has since announced a further 1,900 job cuts .
Last week , Ford also reported a $ 2.98 bn loss for the third quarter and said it would have to cut salary - related expenses in North America by 10 % .
Sales at the two car giants have been hit hard as consumers tighten their belts for the impending recession .
Sales at GM fell by 45 % in October compared with the same month last year , while sales at Ford fell 30 % .
Chrysler was also hit hard , with sales falling 35 % .
At the start of October , President George W Bush signed legislation that gives GM and fellow US carmakers Chrysler and Ford access to $ 25bn of cheap government - backed loans to help them develop less - polluting cars .

Gaza relief boat carrying Cynthia McKinney rammed by Israelis David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 30 , 2008

An Israeli patrol boat intercepted a yacht carrying three tons of medical supplies to Gaza in international waters early on Tuesday as it attempted to run an Israeli blockade .
According to those on board , the patrol boat accused the relief vessel of being involved in terrorist activity and then deliberately rammed it , forcing it to return to port in Lebanon .
Among the yacht 's 16 passengers were doctors , journalists , and human rights activists , including former Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( D - GA ) .
McKinney spoke to CNN from Lebanon , telling John Roberts , " Our boat was rammed three times , twice in the front and once on the side . "
McKinney described as " outright disinformation " a statement by the Israeli Foreign Ministry which called the charge that the ramming was deliberate " absurd . "
According to the Israeli spokesman , the boat was struck as it attempted to outmaneuver the Israeli vessel .
The Free Gaza movement , which sponsored the relief mission , explained in a press release , " This is the sixth boat that the Free Gaza movement has sent ... in a symbolic effort to end the seige of Gaza .
These are small boats , and they do not cross into Israeli waters at all .
This Israeli attack on the boat , which occurred in international waters , cannot be described as ' self defense ' by any stretch of delusional imagination . "
" Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies , " McKinney told CNN , " and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military . "
McKinney then appealed to President - elect Obama to " say something , please , about the humanitarian crisis that is being experienced right now by the people of Gaza . "
She referred to Martin Luther King 's description of the United States as " the greatest purveyor of violence on the planet " and noted that " the weapons that are being used by Israel are weapons that are being supplied by the United States . "
McKinney has been known for her opposition to Israeli policies , which is blamed in part for her loss of her Congressional seat .
According to the Washington Post , " In 2002 , two Democrats in Congress with records of voting against Israel 's interests -- Reps. Earl Hilliard of Alabama and Cynthia McKinney of Georgia -- faced primary opponents who received substantial support from Jewish donors .
A majority of AIPAC board members gave to either McKinney 's challenger or Hilliard 's or both .
Hilliard and McKinney lost . "

The ASA said violence was shown to be inappropriate and unacceptable A hard - hitting TV commercial for children 's charity Barnardo's will continue to be screened , despite attracting almost 500 complaints .
Viewers - including some child abuse victims - had complained its repeated scenes of a young girl being hit and later taking drugs were distressing .
But the Advertising Standards Authority said the issues raised justified the use of such " shocking " images .
Barnardo's said the advert highlighted the " vicious cycle " of abuse and crime .
In it , a teenage girl is pictured behind a prison door , then at a kitchen table where a man hits her hard on the back of the head and calls her a " worthless little cow " .
The next scene pictures her at her classroom desk , tearfully telling the teacher : " I do n't know what it says " , before she appears in a deserted setting having just taken drugs .
The scenes are repeated at increasing speed , emphasising the sound of the slap and the girl 's sobs .
Deprivation and exclusion
Text on the screen reads : " For thousands of children in the UK the story will keep repeating itself , until someone stops it . "
The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) investigated the advert after receiving 477 complaints and said more viewers had complained since then .
It acknowledged the abuse victims ' distress but noted that " the scene involving the violence , although shocking to watch , showed the violence as unacceptable behaviour and did not encourage or condone it .
" We concluded that the aim of the ads justified the use of such strong imagery , " it added , noting that the adverts were shown after 2100 GMT and away from programmes popular with children .
Barnardo's spokeswoman Diana Tickell said the vicious cycle of deprivation , exclusion , abuse and crime was the greatest threat to the UK 's most vulnerable children .
She added : " We hoped that viewers of the advertisement would be able to look beyond the challenging story and realise that this is a very real issue and that the shocking fact is that for some children the story will keep repeating itself until someone stops it . "

PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain conceded the presidential race before a crowd of supporters in Phoenix on Tuesday .
He also congratulated Sen. Barack Obama .
Here is a transcript :
Sen . John McCain concedes defeat in the presidential election to Barack Obama .
McCain : Thank you .
Thank you , my friends .
Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening .
My friends , we have -- we have come to the end of a long journey .
The American people have spoken , and they have spoken clearly .
A little while ago , I had the honor of calling Sen. Barack Obama to congratulate him .
Watch McCain 's speech »
To congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love .
In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been , his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance .
But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving .
This is an historic election , and I recognize the special significance it has for African - Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight .
I 've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it .
Sen .
Obama believes that , too .
But we both recognize that , though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation 's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship , the memory of them still had the power to wound .
A century ago , President Theodore Roosevelt 's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters .
America today is a world away from the cruel and frightful bigotry of that time .
There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African - American to the presidency of the United States .
Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this , the greatest nation on Earth .
Sen .
Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country .
I applaud him for it , and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day .
Though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise .
Sen . Obama and I have had and argued our differences , and he has prevailed .
No doubt many of those differences remain .
These are difficult times for our country .
And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face .
I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him , but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity , defend our security in a dangerous world , and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger , better country than we inherited .
Whatever our differences , we are fellow Americans .
And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that .
It is natural .
It 's natural , tonight , to feel some disappointment .
But tomorrow , we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again .
We fought -- we fought as hard as we could .
And though we fell short , the failure is mine , not yours .
I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me .
I wish the outcome had been different , my friends .
The road was a difficult one from the outset , but your support and friendship never wavered .
I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you .
I 'm especially grateful to my wife , Cindy , my children , my dear mother and all my family , and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign .
I have always been a fortunate man , and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me .
You know , campaigns are often harder on a candidate 's family than on the candidate , and that 's been true in this campaign .
All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead .
I am also -- I am also , of course , very thankful to Gov. Sarah Palin , one of the best campaigners I 've ever seen , and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength , her husband Todd and their five beautiful children for their tireless dedication to our cause , and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign .
We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska , the Republican Party and our country .
To all my campaign comrades , from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter , to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly , month after month , in what at times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times , thank you so much .
A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship .
I do n't know -- I do n't know what more we could have done to try to win this election .
I 'll leave that to others to determine .
Every candidate makes mistakes , and I 'm sure I made my share of them .
But I wo n't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been .
This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life , and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Sen.
Obama and my old friend Sen .
Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years .
I would not -- I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century .
Today , I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much .
And tonight , I remain her servant .
That is blessing enough for anyone , and I thank the people of Arizona for it .
Tonight -- tonight , more than any night , I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens , whether they supported me or Sen.
Obama -- whether they supported me or Sen. Obama .
I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president .
And I call on all Americans , as I have often in this campaign , to not despair of our present difficulties , but to believe , always , in the promise and greatness of America , because nothing is inevitable here .
Americans never quit .
We never surrender .
We never hide from history .
We make history .
Thank you , and God bless you , and God bless America .
Thank you all very much .

Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads .
The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface .
In addition , they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest ( although the responseXML and channel attributes are always null ) .
Once created , a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code ( and vice versa ) .
This article provides a detailed introduction to using web workers .
Web Workers API
A worker is an object created using a constructor ( e.g. Worker ( ) ) that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread ; workers run in another global context that is different from the current window .
Thus , using the window shortcut to get the current global scope ( instead of self ) within a Worker will return an error .
The worker context is represented by a DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope object in the case of dedicated workers ( standard workers that are utilized by a single script ; shared workers use SharedWorkerGlobalScope ) .
A dedicated worker is only accessible from the script that first spawned it , whereas shared workers can be accessed from multiple scripts .
Note : See The Web Workers API landing page for reference documentation on workers and additional guides .
You can run whatever code you like inside the worker thread , with some exceptions .
For example , you can't directly manipulate the DOM from inside a worker , or use some default methods and properties of the window object .
But you can use a large number of items available under window , including WebSockets , and data storage mechanisms like IndexedDB .
See Functions and classes available to workers for more details .
Data is sent between workers and the main thread via a system of messages — both sides send their messages using the postMessage ( ) method , and respond to messages via the onmessage event handler ( the message is contained within the Message event 's data attribute . )
The data is copied rather than shared .
Workers may , in turn , spawn new workers , as long as those workers are hosted within the same origin as the parent page .
In addition , workers may use XMLHttpRequest for network I/O , with the exception that the responseXML and channel attributes on XMLHttpRequest always return null .
Dedicated workers
As mentioned above , a dedicated worker is only accessible by the script that called it .
In this section we 'll discuss the JavaScript found in our Basic dedicated worker example ( run dedicated worker ) :
This allows you to enter two numbers to be multiplied together .
The numbers are sent to a dedicated worker , multiplied together , and the result is returned to the page and displayed .
This example is rather trivial , but we decided to keep it simple while introducing you to basic worker concepts .
More advanced details are covered later on in the article .
Worker feature detection
For slightly more controlled error handling and backwards compatibility , it is a good idea to wrap your worker accessing code in the following ( main.js ) :
if ( window .
Worker ) { ... }
Spawning a dedicated worker
Creating a new worker is simple .
All you need to do is call the Worker ( ) constructor , specifying the URI of a script to execute in the worker thread ( main.js ) :
var myWorker = new Worker ( ' worker.js ' ) ;
Sending messages to and from a dedicated worker
The magic of workers happens via the postMessage ( ) method and the onmessage event handler .
When you want to send a message to the worker , you post messages to it like this ( main.js ) :
first.onchange = function ( ) { myWorker.postMessage([first.value,second.value ] ) ; console.log (' Message posted to worker ' ) ; } second.onchange = function ( ) { myWorker.postMessage([first.value,second.value ] ) ; console.log (' Message posted to worker ' ) ; }
So here we have two < input > elements represented by the variables first and second ; when the value of either is changed , myWorker.postMessage([first.value,second.value ] ) is used to send the value inside both to the worker , as an array .
You can send pretty much anything you like in the message .
In the worker , we can respond when the message is received by writing an event handler block like this ( worker.js ) :
onmessage = function(e ) { console.log (' Message received from main script ' ) ; var workerResult = ' Result : ' + ( e.data [ 0 ] * e.data [ 1 ] ) ; console.log (' Posting message back to main script ' ) ; postMessage ( workerResult ) ; }
The onmessage handler allows us to run some code whenever a message is received , with the message itself being available in the message event 's data attribute .
Here we simply multiply together the two numbers then use postMessage ( ) again , to post the result back to the main thread .
Back in the main thread , we use onmessage again , to respond to the message sent back from the worker :
myWorker.onmessage = function(e ) { result.textContent = e.data ; console.log (' Message received from worker ' ) ; }
Here we grab the message event data and set it as the textContent of the result paragraph , so the user can see the result of the calculation .
Note : Notice that onmessage and postMessage ( ) need to be hung off the Worker object when used in the main script thread , but not when used in the worker .
This is because , inside the worker , the worker is effectively the global scope .
Note :
When a message is passed between the main thread and worker , it is copied or " transferred " ( moved ) , not shared .

When a message is passed between the main thread and worker , it is copied or " transferred " ( moved ) , not shared .
Read Transferring data to and from workers : further details for a much more thorough explanation .
Terminating a worker
If you need to immediately terminate a running worker from the main thread , you can do so by calling the worker 's terminate method :
myWorker.terminate ( ) ;
The worker thread is killed immediately .
Handling errors
When a runtime error occurs in the worker , its onerror event handler is called .
It receives an event named error which implements the ErrorEvent interface .
The event does n't bubble and is cancelable ; to prevent the default action from taking place , the worker can call the error event 's preventDefault ( ) method .
The error event has the following three fields that are of interest :
message A human - readable error message .
filename
The name of the script file in which the error occurred .
lineno
The line number of the script file on which the error occurred .
Spawning subworkers
Workers may spawn more workers if they wish .
So - called sub - workers must be hosted within the same origin as the parent page .
Also , the URIs for subworkers are resolved relative to the parent worker 's location rather than that of the owning page .
This makes it easier for workers to keep track of where their dependencies are .
Importing scripts and libraries
Worker threads have access to a global function , importScripts ( ) , which lets them import scripts .
It accepts zero or more URIs as parameters to resources to import ; all of the following examples are valid :
importScripts ( ) ; /* imports nothing */ importScripts (' foo.js ' ) ; /* imports just " foo.js " */ importScripts (' foo.js ' , ' bar.js ' ) ; /* imports two scripts */ importScripts ('//example.com/hello.js ' ) ; /*
You can import scripts from other origins */
The browser loads each listed script and executes it .
Any global objects from each script may then be used by the worker .
If the script can't be loaded , NETWORK_ERROR is thrown , and subsequent code will not be executed .
Previously executed code ( including code deferred using window.setTimeout( ) ) will still be functional though .
Function declarations after the importScripts ( ) method are also kept , since these are always evaluated before the rest of the code .
Note : Scripts may be downloaded in any order , but will be executed in the order in which you pass the filenames into importScripts ( ) .
This is done synchronously ; importScripts ( ) does not return until all the scripts have been loaded and executed .
Shared workers
A shared worker is accessible by multiple scripts — even if they are being accessed by different windows , iframes or even workers .
In this section we 'll discuss the JavaScript found in our Basic shared worker example ( run shared worker ) :
This is very similar to the basic dedicated worker example , except that it has two functions available handled by different script files : multiplying two numbers , or squaring a number .
Both scripts use the same worker to do the actual calculation required .
Here we 'll concentrate on the differences between dedicated and shared workers .
Note that in this example we have two HTML pages , each with JavaScript applied that uses the same single worker file .
Note : If SharedWorker can be accessed from several browsing contexts , all those browsing contexts must share the exact same origin ( same protocol , host , and port ) .
Note :
In Firefox , shared workers cannot be shared between documents loaded in private and non-private windows ( bug 1177621 ) .
Spawning a shared worker
Spawning a new shared worker is pretty much the same as with a dedicated worker , but with a different constructor name ( see index.html and index2.html ) — each one has to spin up the worker using code like the following :
var myWorker = new SharedWorker (' worker.js ' ) ;
One big difference is that with a shared worker you have to communicate via a port object — an explicit port is opened that the scripts can use to communicate with the worker ( this is done implicitly in the case of dedicated workers ) .
The port connection needs to be started either implicitly by use of the onmessage event handler or explicitly with the start ( ) method before any messages can be posted .
Calling start ( ) is only needed if the message event is wired up via the addEventListener ( ) method .
Note : When using the start ( ) method to open the port connection , it needs to be called from both the parent thread and the worker thread if two - way communication is needed .
Sending messages to and from a shared worker
Now messages can be sent to the worker as before , but the postMessage ( ) method has to be invoked through the port object ( again , you 'll see similar constructs in both multiply . js and square.js ) :
squareNumber.onchange = function ( ) { myWorker.port.postMessage([squareNumber.value ,squareNumber.value ] ) ; console.log (' Message posted to worker ' ) ; }
Now , on to the worker .
There is a bit more complexity here as well ( worker.js ) :
onconnect = function (e ) { var port = e.ports [ 0 ] ; port.onmessage = function(e ) { var workerResult = ' Result : ' + ( e.data [ 0 ] * e.data [ 1 ] ) ; port.postMessage( workerResult ) ; } }
First , we use an onconnect handler to fire code when a connection to the port happens ( i.e. when the onmessage event handler in the parent thread is setup , or when the start ( ) method is explicitly called in the parent thread ) .
We use the ports attribute of this event object to grab the port and store it in a variable .
Next , we add a message handler on the port to do the calculation and return the result to the main thread .
Setting up this message handler in the worker thread also implicitly opens the port connection back to the parent thread , so the call to port.start ( ) is not actually needed , as noted above .
Finally , back in the main script , we deal with the message ( again , you 'll see similar constructs in both multiply . js and square.js ) :
myWorker.port.onmessage = function(e ) { result2.textContent = e.data ; console.log (' Message received from worker ' ) ; }
When a message comes back through the port from the worker , we insert the calculation result inside the appropriate result paragraph .
About thread safety
The Worker interface spawns real OS - level threads , and mindful programmers may be concerned that concurrency can cause “ interesting ” effects in your code if you are n't careful .
However , since web workers have carefully controlled communication points with other threads , it 's actually very hard to cause concurrency problems .
There 's no access to non-threadsafe components or the DOM .
And you have to pass specific data in and out of a thread through serialized objects .
So you have to work really hard to cause problems in your code .
Content security policy
Workers are considered to have their own execution context , distinct from the document that created them .
For this reason they are , in general , not governed by the content security policy of the document ( or parent worker ) that created them .
So for example , suppose a document is served with the following header :
Content - Security - Policy : script - src ' self '
eval ( ) .
However , if the script constructs a worker , code running in the worker 's context will be allowed to use eval ( ) .
To specify a content security policy for the worker , set a
The exception to this is if the worker script 's origin is a globally unique identifier ( for example , if its URL has a scheme of data or blob ) .
In this case , the worker does inherit the CSP of the document or worker that created it .
Among other things , this will prevent any scripts it includes from using .
However , if the script constructs a worker , code running in the worker 's context will be allowed to useTo specify a content security policy for the worker , set a Content - Security - Policy response header for the request which delivered the worker script itself .
The exception to this is if the worker script 's origin is a globally unique identifier ( for example , if its URL has a scheme of data or blob ) .
In this case , the worker does inherit the CSP of the document or worker that created it .
Transferring data to and from workers : further details
Data passed between the main page and workers is copied , not shared .
Objects are serialized as they 're handed to the worker , and subsequently , de-serialized on the other end .
The page and worker do not share the same instance , so the end result is that a duplicate is created on each end .
Most browsers implement this feature as structured cloning .
To illustrate this , let 's create for didactical purpose a function named emulateMessage ( ) , which will simulate the behavior of a value that is cloned and not shared during the passage from a worker to the main page or vice versa :
function emulateMessage ( vVal ) { return eval ( ' (' + JSON.stringify ( vVal ) + ' ) ' ) ; } // Tests // test # 1 var example1 = new Number ( 3 ) ; console.log(typeof example1 ) ; // object console.log( typeof emulateMessage( example1 ) ) ; // number // test # 2 var example2 = true ; console.log( typeof example2 ) ; // boolean console.log( typeof emulateMessage( example2 ) ) ; // boolean // test # 3 var example3 = new String ( ' Hello World ' ) ; console.log(typeof example3 ) ; // object console.log( typeof emulateMessage( example3 ) ) ; // string // test # 4 var example4 = { ' name ' : ' John Smith ' , " age " : 43 } ; console.log(typeof example4 ) ; // object console.log(typeof emulateMessage( example4 ) ) ; // object // test # 5 function Animal ( sType , nAge ) { this .
type = sType ; this .age = nAge ; } var example5 = new Animal ( ' Cat ' , 3 ) ; alert ( example5.constructor ) ; // Animal alert ( emulateMessage( example5).constructor ) ; // Object
A value that is cloned and not shared is called message .
As you will probably know by now , messages can be sent to and from the main thread by using postMessage ( ) , and the message event 's data attribute contains data passed back from the worker .
example .html : ( the main page ) :
var myWorker = new Worker ( 'my_task.js ' ) ; myWorker.onmessage = function ( oEvent ) { console.log ( ' Worker said : ' + oEvent.data ) ; } ; myWorker.postMessage ( ' ali ' ) ;
my_task.js ( the worker ) :
postMessage ( " I\'m working before postMessage ( \' ali\ ' ) . " ) ; onmessage = function ( oEvent ) { postMessage ( ' Hi ' + o Event.data ) ; } ;
The structured cloning algorithm can accept JSON and a few things that JSON can't — like circular references .
Passing data examples
Example # 1 : Advanced passing JSON Data and creating a switching system
If you have to pass some complex data and have to call many different functions both on the main page and in the Worker , you can create a system which groups everything together .
First , we create a Queryable Worker class that takes the url of the worker , a default listener , and an error handler , and this class is going to keep track of a list of listeners and help us communicate with the worker :
function QueryableWorker ( url , defaultListener , on Error ) { var instance = this , worker = new Worker ( url ) , listeners = {} ; this .defaultListener = defaultListener || function ( ) {} ; if ( onError ) { worker .
onerror = on Error;} this .postMessage = function ( message ) { worker.postMessage ( message ) ; } this .terminate = function ( ) { worker.terminate( ) ; } }
Then we add the methods of adding / removing listeners :
this.addListeners = function ( name , listener ) { listeners [ name ] = listener ; } this .removeListeners = function ( name ) { delete listeners [ name ] ; }
Here we let the worker handle two simple operations for illustration : getting the difference of two numbers and making an alert after three seconds .
In order to achieve that we first implement a sendQuery method which queries if the worker actually has the corresponding methods to do what we want .
/* This functions takes at least one argument , the method name we want to query .
Then we can pass in the arguments that the method needs .
*/ this.sendQuery = function ( ) { if ( arguments.
length < 1 ) { throw new TypeError ( ' QueryableWorker.sendQuery takes at least one argument ' ) ; return ; } worker.postMessage ( { ' queryMethod ' : arguments [ 0 ] , ' queryArguments ' : Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments , 1 ) } ) ; }
We finish QueryableWorker with the onmessage method .
If the worker has the corresponding methods we queried , it should return the name of the corresponding listener and the arguments it needs , we just need to find it in listeners .:
worker.onmessage = function ( event ) { if ( event.data instanceof Object && event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodListener ' ) & & event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodArguments ' ) ) { listeners [ event.data.queryMethodListener].apply( instance , event.data.queryMethodArguments ) ; } else { this.defaultListener.call( instance , event.data ) ; } }
Now onto the worker .
First we need to have the methods to handle the two simple operations :
var queryableFunctions = { getDifference : function ( a , b ) { reply ( ' printStuff ' , a - b ) ; } , waitSomeTime : function ( ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { reply ( ' doAlert ' , 3 , ' seconds ' ) ; } , 3000 ) ; } } function reply ( ) { if ( arguments . length < 1 ) { throw new TypeError ( ' reply - takes at least one argument ' ) ; return ; } postMessage ( { queryMethodListener : arguments [ 0 ] , queryMethodArguments : Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments , 1 ) } ) ; } /*
This method is called when main page calls QueryWorker 's postMessage method directly */ function defaultReply ( message ) { // do something }
And the onmessage method is now trivial :
onmessage = function ( event ) { if ( event.data instanceof Object && event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethod ' ) && event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodArguments ' ) ) { queryableFunctions[event.data.queryMethod ] .apply ( self , event.data.queryMethodArguments ) ; } else { defaultReply ( event.data ) ; } }
Here are the full implementation :
example .html ( the main page ) :
<! doctype html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " /> < title > MDN
Example - Queryable worker < / title > < script type =" text / javascript " >
/* QueryableWorker instances methods : * sendQuery ( queryable function name , argument to pass 1 , argument to pass 2 , etc. etc ) : calls a Worker 's queryable function * postMessage ( string or JSON Data ) : see Worker.prototype.postMessage( ) * terminate ( ) : terminates the Worker * addListener ( name , function ) : adds a listener * removeListener ( name ) : removes a listener Queryable Worker instances properties : * defaultListener : the default listener executed only when the Worker calls the postMessage ( ) function directly */ function QueryableWorker ( url , defaultListener , onError ) { var instance = this , worker = new Worker ( url ) , listeners = {} ; this .defaultListener = defaultListener || function ( ) {} ; if ( onError ) { worker .
onerror = onError;} this .postMessage = function ( message ) { worker.postMessage ( message ) ; } this .terminate = function ( ) { worker.terminate( ) ; } this .
addListener = function ( name , listener ) { listeners [ name ] = listener ; } this .removeListener = function ( name ) { delete listeners [ name ] ; } /*
This functions takes at least one argument , the method name we want to query .
Then we can pass in the arguments that the method needs .
*/ this.sendQuery = function ( ) { if ( arguments.
length < 1 ) { throw new TypeError ( ' QueryableWorker.sendQuery takes at least one argument ' ) ; return ; } worker.postMessage ( { ' queryMethod ' : arguments [ 0 ] , ' queryMethodArguments ' : Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments , 1 ) } ) ; } worker .onmessage = function ( event ) { if ( event.data instanceof Object && event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodListener ' ) & & event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodArguments ' ) ) { listeners [ event.data.queryMethodListener].apply( instance , event.data.queryMethodArguments ) ; } else { this.defaultListener.call( instance , event.data ) ; } } } // your custom " queryable " worker var myTask = new QueryableWorker ('my_task.js ' ) ; // your custom " listeners " myTask.addListener(' printStuff ' , function ( result ) { document.getElementById(' firstLink').parentNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
' The difference is ' + result + '!' ) ) ; } ) ; myTask.addListener( 'doAlert ' , function ( time , unit ) { alert ( ' Worker waited for ' + time + ' ' + unit + ' :-) ' ) ; } ) ; </ script > </head > < body > < ul > < li ><a id=" firstLink " href= " javascript:myTask.sendQuery(' getDifference ' , 5 , 3 ) ; " > What is the difference between 5 and 3 ?
</a></li> < li >< a href= " javascript:myTask.sendQuery(' waitSomeTime ' ) ; " > Wait 3 seconds </a></li> < li >< a href= " javascript:myTask.terminate ( ) ; " > terminate ( ) the Worker </a></li> </ul > </ body > </html >
my_task.js ( the worker ) :
var queryableFunctions = { // example # 1 : get the difference between two numbers : getDifference : function ( nMinuend , nSubtrahend ) { reply ( ' printStuff ' , nMinuend - n Subtrahend ) ; } , // example # 2 : wait three seconds waitSomeTime : function ( ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { reply ( ' doAlert ' , 3 , ' seconds ' ) ; } , 3000 ) ; } } ; // system functions function defaultReply ( message ) { // your default PUBLIC function executed only when main page calls the queryableWorker.postMessage ( ) method directly // do something } function reply ( ) { if ( arguments .
length < 1 ) { throw new TypeError ( ' reply - not enough arguments ' ) ; return ; } postMessage ( { ' queryMethodListener ' : arguments [ 0 ] , ' queryMethodArguments ' : Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments , 1 ) } ) ; } onmessage = function ( oEvent ) { if ( oEvent.data instanceof Object && oEvent.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethod ' ) && o Event.data.hasOwnProperty('queryMethodArguments ' ) ) { queryableFunctions [ oEvent.data.queryMethod].apply ( self , oEvent.data.queryMethodArguments ) ; } else { defaultReply ( oEvent.data ) ; } } ;
It is possible to switch the content of each mainpage -> worker and worker -> mainpage message .
And the property names " queryMethod " , " queryMethodListeners " , " queryMethodArguments " can be anything as long as they are consistent in QueryableWorker and the worker .
Passing data by transferring ownership ( transferable objects )
Google Chrome 17 + and Firefox 18 + contain an additional way to pass certain types of objects ( transferable objects , that is objects implementing the Transferable interface ) to or from a worker with high performance .
Transferable objects are transferred from one context to another with a zero-copy operation , which results in a vast performance improvement when sending large data sets .
Think of it as pass - by - reference if you 're from the C/ C++ world .
However , unlike pass - by - reference , the ' version ' from the calling context is no longer available once transferred .
Its ownership is transferred to the new context .
For example , when transferring an ArrayBuffer from your main app to a worker script , the original ArrayBuffer is cleared and no longer usable .
Its content is ( quite literally ) transferred to the worker context .
// Create a 32MB " file " and fill it .
var uInt8 Array = new Uint8Array ( 1024 * 1024 * 32 ) ; // 32 MB for ( var i = 0 ; i < uInt8Array.length ; ++i ) { uInt8Array [ i ] = i ; } worker.postMessage(uInt8Array.buffer , [ uInt8Array.buffer ] ) ;
Note :
For more information on transferable objects , performance , and feature - detection for this method , read Transferable Objects : Lightning Fast ! on HTML5 Rocks .
Embedded workers
There is not an " official " way to embed the code of a worker within a web page , like < script > elements do for normal scripts .
But a < script > element that does not have a src attribute and has a type attribute that does not identify an executable MIME type can be considered a data block element that JavaScript could use .
" Data blocks " is a more general feature of HTML5 that can carry almost any textual data .
So , a worker could be embedded in this way :
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " /> < title > MDN
Example - Embedded worker < / title > < script type =" text / js-worker " > //
This script WON'T be parsed by JS engines because its MIME type is text / js - worker .
var myVar = ' Hello World ! ' ; //
Rest of your worker code goes here .

It is also worth noting that you can also convert a function into a Blob , then generate an object URL from that blob .
For example :
function fn2workerURL ( fn ) { var blob = new Blob ( [ '( '+ fn.toString ( ) + ' ) ( ) ' ] , {type : ' application /javascript'} ) return URL.createObjectURL( blob ) }
Further examples
This section provides further examples of how to use web workers .
Performing computations in the background
Workers are mainly useful for allowing your code to perform processor - intensive calculations without blocking the user interface thread .
In this example , a worker is used to calculate Fibonacci numbers .
The JavaScript code
The following JavaScript code is stored in the " fibonacci.js " file referenced by the HTML in the next section .
var results = [ ] ; function resultReceiver ( event ) { results.push ( parseInt( event.data ) ) ; if ( results. length == 2 ) { postMessage ( results [ 0 ] + results [ 1 ] ) ; } } function errorReceiver ( event ) { throw event.data ; } onmessage = function ( event ) { var n = parseInt ( event.data ) ; if ( n == 0 || n == 1 ) { postMessage (n ) ; return ; } for ( var i = 1 ; i <= 2 ; i++) { var worker = new Worker ( ' fibonacci.js ' ) ; worker .
onmessage = resultReceiver ; worker .
onerror = errorReceiver ; worker.postMessage(n - i ) ; } } ;
The worker sets the property onmessage to a function which will receive messages sent when the worker object 's postMessage ( ) is called ( note that this differs from defining a global variable of that name , or defining a function with that name .
var onmessage and function onmessage will define global properties with those names , but they will not register the function to receive messages sent by the web page that created the worker ) .
This starts the recursion , spawning new copies of itself to handle each iteration of the calculation .
The HTML code
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < meta charset = " UTF - 8 " /> < title > Test threads fibonacci </ title > </ head > < body > < div id =" result " ></div > < script language= " javascript " > var worker = new Worker ( ' fibonacci.js ' ) ; worker .onmessage = function ( event ) { document.getElementById(' result ') .textContent = event.data ; dump ( ' Got : ' + event.data + '
' ) ; } ; worker . onerror = function ( error ) { dump ( ' Worker error : ' + error.message + '
' ) ; throw error ; } ; worker.postMessage ( ' 5 ' ) ; </ script > </ body > </html >
The web page creates a div element with the ID result , which gets used to display the result , then spawns the worker .
After spawning the worker , the onmessage handler is configured to display the results by setting the contents of the div element , and the onerror handler is set to dump the error message .
Finally , a message is sent to the worker to start it .
Try this example live .
Performing web I/O in the background
You can find an example of this in the article Using workers in extensions .
Dividing tasks among multiple workers
As multi-core computers become increasingly common , it 's often useful to divide computationally complex tasks among multiple workers , which may then perform those tasks on multiple - processor cores .
Other types of worker
In addition to dedicated and shared web workers , there are other types of worker available :
ServiceWorkers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications , and the browser and network ( when available ) .
They are intended to ( amongst other things ) enable the creation of effective offline experiences , intercepting network requests and taking appropriate action based on whether the network is available and updated assets reside on the server .
They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs .
Chrome Workers are a Firefox - only type of worker that you can use if you are developing add - ons and want to use workers in extensions and have access to js - ctypes in your worker .
See ChromeWorker for more details .
for more details .
Audio Worklet provide the ability for direct scripted audio processing to be done in a worklet ( a lightweight version of worker ) context .
Functions and interfaces available in workers
You can use most standard JavaScript features inside a web worker , including :
The main thing you can't do in a Worker is directly affect the parent page .
This includes manipulating the DOM and using that page 's objects .
You have to do it indirectly , by sending a message back to the main script via DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.postMessage , then actioning the changes from there .
Note :

Businesses are crying foul after receiving sky - high phone bills that charged them upwards of $ 200,000 because hackers broke into their voicemail system and hijacked it to make long - distance calls .
While a spokeswoman for BCE 's Bell Canada ( TSX : BCE ) says the bills have been reduced by the phone company , the businesses insist they should n't be forced to pay for any of the illicit calls .
Martin & Hillyer , a law firm based in Burlington , says it has been hacked and is battling to erase a bill that includes charges worth more than $ 207,000 in calls to Sierra Leone in western Africa .
The law firm is n't alone in but Bell Canada spokeswoman Julie Smithers calls the situation " really rare " and a " very old scam " that affects primarily business customers , although she said some residential consumers have been caught .
Here 's how Bell thinks it works : an automated dialler will target a specific phone number , and wait for the voicemail to respond .
Then , the computer will go through standard voicemail passwords .
Once it finds the correct password – often a predictable number combination – the automated dialler will choose an option on the voicemail that allows it to make long - distance phone calls .
On the phone bill it looks like the calls were made directly from the office or home number .
Smithers said Bell does have technologies to detect " bizarre calling patterns and in a lot of cases we can stop it by placing a block on long distance . "
But she added " it is extremely important and it is the customer 's responsibility to put passwords in place that are difficult to guess . "
In Oakville , Gordon Cowan , the president of GPS Consulting Group & Insurance Agencies , faced a similar problem on a smaller scale .
His offices rung up more than $ 60,000 in charges , starting with a 14 - hour period on a weekend in early October .
" I came in on Sunday and there was a call from the Bell Canada fraud squad saying we had been breached .
They shut our voice mail system down , " Cowan said in an interview .
" They told us to change our passwords , which we have been doing anyway , and they would be in contact with us . "
Cowan says that a week later the hacking happened again .
In both instances , Bell Canada agreed to reduce the bill as a ``goodwill gesture " – in the law firm 's case they cut it down to about half of the $ 207,000 .
Cowan's $ 60,000 bill was slashed to about $ 7,000 .
Bell says that Canadians are responsible for taking steps to prevent their voicemail from being hacked .

" It is something that 's not unique to Bell – it has been seen by pretty much every telephone company in the country , the U.S. and internationally , " Smithers said .
Last week , reports from Australia said that police were investigating claims from a Perth business that its Internet phone lines were hacked , resulting in a $ 120,000 phone bill from more than 11,000 international calls .
The Mojo Nation Story
[ Guest post by Steve Schear ] Mojo Nation was the brainchild of Jim McCoy ( then formerly of Yahoo ) and Doug Barnes ( then formerly of C2 Net ) .
Their vision was a fully distributed peer - to - peer network with a financial mechanism that offered efficient cost recovery and discouraged the free - riding known to P2P people as leeching ( a problem that continues to plague P2P ) .
The most radical element of MN was its method of pricing all activities in terms of network resources .
It was also one of the first attempts at a P2P network using a fully distributed approach and a publishing versus a file sharing metaphor .
Unfortunately , MN was never fully operational .
It never reached a point of deployment that allowed many of its novel architectural and technological assumptions , especially the mint , to be truly tested .
It 's not clear what economic lessons to draw from its operational vision , but here are some of the reasons behind its business failure :
MN failed because it failed to get continued funding .
It only received seed money from its founder , Jim McCoy .
MN was in development before Napster but its greater complexity caused a delayed public release .
Jim had the foresight to thoroughly investigate the legal aspects of P2P and architecture MN to segregate tracking and file storage and distance itself from either .
Nevertheless , Napster 's negative publicity closed the door on VC funding and development beyond beta testing .
It failed because the UI never reached a point of maturity that enabled mostly automated meta -data tags ( e.g. , from mp3 ) to be generated from published content .
This required users to tediously enter this data ( and re-enter it when they were forced to republish , see below ) .
It failed because software instabilities prevented its distributed servers from accumulating and retaining enough content and becoming stable ( network effects ) .
This instability required constant , manual , republishing of content by users who soon fatigued ( user churn ) .
The most notable result from MN was Bram 's Bit Torrent .
Though , as we saw , Bram failed to heed warnings ( and discussion at MN ) about protecting the trackers until the MPAA / RIAA were able to shut many down .
Its been reported that many of these shortcomings have been fixed but I still can't seem to get Azureus ( the most popular BT client ) to work as expected with the distributed tracking .
Since the demise of eDonkey , et al , due to the MGM vs. Grokster BT has been given a shot at reassuming the P2P leadership mantle .
I hope it succeeds .
Or perhaps P2P 's next growth will have to wait until enough its users discover the advantages of an anonymizing transport layers , like TOR and I2P .
