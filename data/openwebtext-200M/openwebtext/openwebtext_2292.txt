The Kodak EASYSHARE V1273 was launched in early January 2008 .
With the launch of this model , Kodak reaffirms its philosophy - “ You press the button , We ’ll do the rest ” .
DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY
The Kodak EASYSHARE V1273 is a well - designed compact with the outer shell made from engineering plastic and metal .
The design is sleek with minimalist buttons and the camera can be carried easily in a shirt pocket .
The edges and corners and rounded , providing a nice comfortable grip .
The camera is attractive except for the cheap - looking plastic sticker in the front .
The tripod mount is made from metal .
KEY FEATURES
The Kodak EASYSHARE V1273 is a 12 - megapixel compact using a 1/1.72 - inch Type CCD senson .
The camera boasts a SCHNEIDER - KREUZNACH VARIOGON 3 x zoom lens equivalent to 37 - 111 mm in the 35 mm format .
The lens incorporates an optical image stabilizer along with blur - reduction technology that minimizes blur caused by subject movement .
The camera has minimum number of buttons and instead has a large 3 - inch LCD touch screen display with a user interface that requires a bit of practice before it appears user friendly .
Basically , there are four shooting modes you can select from : Smart Capture , Program , Scene , and Movie .
Smart Capture Mode :
This mode is for general picture taking .
Using Kodak ’s Perfect Touch technology ( which image are enhanced during capture / review ) , this mode also detects faces , while the scene is analyzed for subject matter and lighting .
You can even opt between various aspect ratio : 3:2 , 16:9 , and 4:3 ( default setting ) .
Program Mode :
The Program mode allows creative control of images , wherein you have access to all picture taking settings .
Scene mode :
As the name suggests , this is a scene - related shooting mode .
Available scenes are : Portrait , Panorama ( left to right ) , Panorama ( right to left ) , Blur reduction , Sport , Landscape , Close - up ( closer than 70 cms / 28 - inches ) Night Portrait , Night Landscape , Snow , Beach , Text , Fireworks , Flower ( general flower pictures in bright light ) , Manor / Museum , Self - portrait , High ISO , Children , Backlight , Panning shot , Candle light , and Sunset .
Video Mode :
For video clips with sound .
As you can change the aspect ratios , the megapixel ratings change too .
At 4:3 aspect ratio , the camera offers 12 , 5 , 3.1 , or 1.2 - megapixel output .
At 3:2 aspect ratio , you get either 10.7MP or 2.2MP ; at 16.9 aspect ratio , its either 9MP or 2.1MP .
Color mode can be set to High , Natural , Low , Black and White or Sepia .
Autofocus can be set to single or continuous .
The V1273 lets you select the following Whte Balance settings : Auto , Daylight , Tungsten , Fluorescent , or Open shade .
Metering can be set to Multi- pattern , Center - weighted or Spot , while ISO can be set to Auto , ISO 64 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1600 , or 3200 .
Autofocus can be either Multi-zone , Center - zone .
The V1273 has a bult - in flash that offers the following flash modes : Auto , Fill ( not available in Smart Capture mode ) , Red-eye Reduction and Off .
The camera uses SD or SDHC card and also has a 32 MB internal memory for storing images .
Images can be tagged during viewing ( for example , birthday , holiday or wedding ) and they can be viewed in high definition on an HDTV .
ERGONOMICS
The V1273 takes a while to get accustomed to the Touch - Screen operation .
The slightly recessed LCD lets you place the camera on its back without fear of scratching the LCD .
The Power button too is slightly recessed , which is a good thing , as it makes it difficult to inadvertently put the camera ‘ on ’ ( for example , when putting the camera in a touch ) .
The battery / memory card compartment door lock is a bit flimsy – on our test sample , it opened up sometimes when it should n’t have !
User Interface was somewhat difficult to navigate and this was further compounded by the touch screen feature .
PERFORMANCE
The Kodak V1273 takes about one second to get ready to fire .
Our testing confirmed that it is a good performer .
In fact , Kodak claims that you can make a 40×30 - inch print using this camera .
( In all fairness , such a print should be viewed from a minimum 50 - inch distance ) .
Let ’s see if this claim is true .
The V1273 ’x maximum ( native ) resolution is 4000×3000 .
At the industry accepted resolution of 300dpi , that works out to a print size of 13.3 ×10 - inches .
If you need to make a 40×30 - inch print , you either need to interpolate or print at a reduced dpi ( which works out to 100 dpi ) .
A printing machine like the Kodak LED II prints at 250 dpi .
If you supply it with a 100 dpi resolution file , it will automatically interpolate the resolution to 250 dpi and print , For the test , we interpolated the file size to 40×30 - inches and the overall image quality was good .
Readers not very familiar with file upsizing may ask if the same does not hold true with other digital camera files .
The quality of interpolated images has a lot to do with the data available in the original files ( and the user ’s ability with Photoshop ) .
If the original files lack information , the interpolated files appear poor in overall quality .
With the V1273 , we were satisfied with the final results of the interpolated files ( 40×30 - inches ) , though the image gets slightly soft .
The in - built image stabilizer worked well ( our test was conducted when the wind pressure was very strong and standing still was quite difficult ) and the images were sufficiently sharp and with good contrast .
Color rendition was neutral ( We used ‘ Natural Color ’ from the Menu ) .
White Balance performance showed slight color casts at various White Balance settings though nothing that could not be easily corrected in Photoshop .
Digital ‘ noice ’ is well controlled up to ISO 800 but you could use the higher setting in a pinch .
Barrel distortion was visible at the wide end ; and so was vignetting at the corners .
And now for some brickbats :
The LCD was very difficult to see clearly unless you were in total shade .
Outdoors , even in cloudy dull conditions ( and with the LCD at its brightest ) , at times I could not even see clearly what I was photographing !
On one occasion , the camera hung could not be switched off and could not proceed with picture taking .
The battery had to be removed and re-inserted before normal operation re-started .
Kodak must also improve the User Manual and not expect user to go to their website for the extended user guide .
VALUE FOR MONEY
The Kodak EASYSHARE V1273 is available at an MRP of Rs. 15,999 / - ( approx $ 380 )
At this price and performance , it is very good value for money .
Cramer 's not alone in his crusade against Washington 's ethanol mandate .
Recently , Rick Perry , Texas ' Republican governor , asked the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the federal requuirements on that biofuel .
Of course , the EPA said no , virtually ignoring the huge food inflation that 's occurred as a result of putting 30 % of the U.S. corn crop into the production of only 3 % of the fuel we use .
Texas consumers , like everyone else , have been feeling the pain .
So Governor Perry has stepped up and is making his state a more alternative - energy - friendly place by building wind - power farms and solar - power installations and , just as important , the infrastructure needed to bring that power to market .
Watch this video to find out what else Perry has going on and why he said the ethanol mandate was " the biggest scam that 's ever come along . "

Heretic and Hexen Sources Re-released Under the GPL - 96 Comments
In a surprise email from Raven Software employee James Monroe , James " Quasar " Haley of Team Eternity has been notified that the source code for Heretic and Hexen has been re-released under the GNU General Public License , and is now available from Sourceforge .
Having the code relicensed required a community effort spanning almost a decade .
At its height , this included an online petition , an open letter , snail mail campaigns , e-mail , an international action item on GNU.org , insider efforts by Chris Rhinehart of Human Head Studios and Doom 's own John Romero , and other activities carried on individually by countless community members .
This release is of monumental importance , as it will allow GPL Doom source ports to freely integrate support for Heretic and Hexen without requiring the code to be rewritten from scratch or to be emulated through empirical testing .
The door is also now open for new ports such as " Chocolate " Heretic and Hexen , and for such ports to be distributed in free software packages .
Twelve - year - old giant panda , Guo Guo , who was relocated after May ’s devastating earthquake in the Sichuan province of China gave birth to twin cubs on Sunday .
She became the first panda to bear cubs since the disaster and the first to give birth around the globe this year .
The elder of the two small pandas weighs only 170 grams .
Guo Guo was one of the six pandas evacuated from the Giant Panda Research Center in Hetaoping to breeding bases .
After traveling more than 100 km during gestation , the evacuation process turned out to be exhausting and Guo Guo got medical attention as soon as she arrived in the new shelter .
Congratulations to the new mother which has also managed to give birth each year for the last three years .
And if you think pandas are cute , you are sure to get a kick out of these Pandas ’ Sneezing Fits .

Sometimes advertising is clever enough to make the leap from commercial to something much more .
In this particular case the small , geeky , videos have gone from gimmick to internet meme .
Forget branding , this is a cult hit !
You know you have a successful ad when people send it to their friends without realizing they are promoting your brand !
On the face of it the concept is simple .
Tom Dickson ( founder of Blendtec ) shoves something into a blender and see what happens .
The result though has really hit a nerve , to the point where the ad has spawned a catch phrase often repeated on the holy grail of nerd traffic , Digg.com
Part of the appeal ( and search juice ) is from clever choices of things to blend , the Apple iPhone , an iPod , Halo 3 , Nintendo Wii … and of course it is just plain fun to watch !

Obama denies shifting to reach political center Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Asked by a voter about accusations of flip - flopping , Democrat Barack Obama dismissed the notion Tuesday that he has been shifting stances on Iraq , guns and the death penalty to break with his party 's liberal wing and court a wider swath of voters .
" The people who say this have n't apparently been listening to me , " the likely Democratic presidential nominee said in response to a question at a town - hall style event .
Obama blamed criticism from " my friends on the left " and " some of the media " in part on cynicism that ascribes political motives for every move candidates make .
" You 're not going to agree with me on 100 percent of what I think , but do n't assume that if I do n't agree with you on something that it must be because I 'm doing that politically , " he said .
" I may just disagree with you . "
The Illinois senator was responding to a question from a self - described " reformed Republican " who said he worked for Democrat Bobby Kennedy four decades ago and thanked Obama for restoring " that faith . "
" You had an interesting week off being accused of flip - flopping , which is mostly nonsense , " the man said .
He then asked Obama to restate his Iraq position , and Obama used the opportunity to dispel the idea he had changed his stances on a range of issues .
Since wrapping up the Democratic nomination last month , Obama has voiced positions that break with the Democratic Party 's left and have seemed at times to shade his own past positions on a range of subjects .
He 's drawn criticism from some liberal Democrats who question his loyalty and from Republicans who accuse him of flip - flopping .
His remarks aside , Obama is clearly competing for the center of the electorate .
Originally best known as an anti-Iraq war candidate , his latest commercials make an obvious play for voters across the political spectrum by focusing on family values and patriotism as well as " welfare to work " and lower taxes .
Over the past few weeks , he angered liberals by supporting compromise electronic surveillance rules for the government 's eavesdropping program even though the bill provided immunity that he opposed last year for telecommunications companies that conducted warrantless eavesdropping .
When the Supreme Court overturned the District of Columbia 's gun ban , he said he favors both an individual 's right to bear firearms and a government 's right to regulate them .
And , he broke with death penalty opponents when he disagreed with the Supreme Court 's decision outlawing executions of people who rape children .
On Iraq , he has gone from hard - line opposition to the war to more nuanced rhetoric that calls for a troop drawdown process that could last 16 months .
He has said that the safety of U.S. troops and the stability of Iraq might force him to adjust that timetable - a potentially flexible formulation that has troubled liberals even though he 's long said the nation needs to be careful leaving Iraq .
" I am somebody who is no doubt progressive .
I believe in a tax code that we need to make more fair .
I believe in universal health care .
I believe in making college affordable .
I believe in paying our teachers more money .
I believe in early childhood education , " Obama told his audience here .
" I believe in a whole lot of things that make me progressive and squarely in the Democratic camp . "
But , he said : " I 'm not just somebody who is talking about government as the solution to everything .
I also believe in personal responsibility .
I also believe in faith . "
So , he said when he talks about the idea of recruiting churches and other religious groups to provide community services through faith - based initiatives , as he did last week , " that 's not something new .
I 've been talking about that for years now .
I 've been organizing with churches for years in the community .
So the notion that somehow that 's me trying to look more centered , more centrist , is just not true . "
He also raised the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the rights of individuals to bear arms and said : " I actually have said that I agree with that for years , even before the ruling came down . "
He said that does n't contradict his view that " we 've got decent controls over the use of illegal firearms in our community . "
On Iraq , he drew cheers when he said : " I opposed this war from the start " and " I have also consistently said that once we were in , we had to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in . "

How China 's taking over Africa , and why the West should be VERY worried
On June 5 , 1873 , in a letter to The Times , Sir Francis Galton , the cousin of Charles Darwin and a distinguished African explorer in his own right , outlined a daring ( if by today 's standards utterly offensive ) new method to ' tame ' and colonise what was then known as the Dark Continent .
' My proposal is to make the encouragement of Chinese settlements of Africa a part of our national policy , in the belief that the Chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position , but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior Negro race , ' wrote Galton .
' I should expect that the African seaboard , now sparsely occupied by lazy , palavering savages , might in a few years be tenanted by industrious , order - loving Chinese , living either as a semidetached dependency of China , or else in perfect freedom under their own law . '
Close relations : Chinese President Hu Jintao accompanies Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe to a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing
Despite an outcry in Parliament and heated debate in the august salons of the Royal Geographic Society , Galton insisted that ' the history of the world tells the tale of the continual displacement of populations , each by a worthier successor , and humanity gains thereby ' .
A controversial figure , Galton was also the pioneer of eugenics , the theory that was used by Hitler to try to fulfil his mad dreams of a German Master Race .
Eventually , Galton 's grand resettlement plans fizzled out because there were much more exciting things going on in Africa .
But that was more than 100 years ago , and with legendary explorers such as Livingstone , Speke and Burton still battling to find the source of the Nile - and new discoveries of exotic species of birds and animals featuring regularly on newspaper front pages - vast swathes of the continent had not even been ' discovered ' .
Yet Sir Francis Galton , it now appears , was ahead of his time .
His vision is coming true - if not in the way he imagined .
An astonishing invasion of Africa is now under way .
In the greatest movement of people the world has ever seen , China is secretly working to turn the entire continent into a new colony .
Reminiscent of the West 's imperial push in the 18th and 19th centuries - but on a much more dramatic , determined scale - China 's rulers believe Africa can become a ' satellite ' state , solving its own problems of over - population and shortage of natural resources at a stroke .
With little fanfare , a staggering 750,000 Chinese have settled in Africa over the past decade .
More are on the way .
The strategy has been carefully devised by officials in Beijing , where one expert has estimated that China will eventually need to send 300 million people to Africa to solve the problems of over - population and pollution .
The plans appear on track .
Across Africa , the red flag of China is flying .
Lucrative deals are being struck to buy its commodities - oil , platinum , gold and minerals .
New embassies and air routes are opening up .
The continent 's new Chinese elite can be seen everywhere , shopping at their own expensive boutiques , driving Mercedes and BMW limousines , sending their children to exclusive private schools .
The pot -holed roads are cluttered with Chinese buses , taking people to markets filled with cheap Chinese goods .
More than a thousand miles of new Chinese railroads are crisscrossing the continent , carrying billions of tons of illegally - logged timber , diamonds and gold .
New horizons ?
Mugabe has said : ' We must turn from the West and face the East '
The trains are linked to ports dotted around the coast , waiting to carry the goods back to Beijing after unloading cargoes of cheap toys made in China .
Confucius Institutes ( state - funded Chinese ' cultural centres ' ) have sprung up throughout Africa , as far afield as the tiny land - locked countries of Burundi and Rwanda , teaching baffled local people how to do business in Mandarin and Cantonese .
Massive dams are being built , flooding nature reserves .
The land is scarred with giant Chinese mines , with ' slave ' labourers paid less than £ 1 a day to extract ore and minerals .
Pristine forests are being destroyed , with China taking up to 70 per cent of all timber from Africa .
All over this great continent , the Chinese presence is swelling into a flood .
Angola has its own ' Chinatown ' , as do great African cities such as Dar es Salaam and Nairobi .
Exclusive , gated compounds , serving only Chinese food , and where no blacks are allowed , are being built all over the continent .
' African cloths ' sold in markets on the continent are now almost always imported , bearing the legend : ' Made in China ' .
From Nigeria in the north , to Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and Angola in the west , across Chad and Sudan in the east , and south through Zambia , Zimbabwe and Mozambique , China has seized a vice - like grip on a continent which officials have decided is crucial to the superpower 's long - term survival .
' The Chinese are all over the place , ' says Trevor Ncube , a prominent African businessman with publishing interests around the continent .
' If the British were our masters yesterday , the Chinese have taken their place . '
Likened to one race deciding to adopt a new home on another planet , Beijing has launched its so - called ' One China In Africa ' policy because of crippling pressure on its own natural resources in a country where the population has almost trebled from 500 million to 1.3 billion in 50 years .
China is hungry - for land , food and energy .
While accounting for a fifth of the world 's population , its oil consumption has risen 35 - fold in the past decade and Africa is now providing a third of it ; imports of steel , copper and aluminium have also shot up , with Beijing devouring 80 per cent of world supplies .

Fuelling its own boom at home , China is also desperate for new markets to sell goods .
And Africa , with non-existent health and safety rules to protect against shoddy and dangerous goods , is the perfect destination .
The result of China 's demand for raw materials and its sales of products to Africa is that turnover in trade between Africa and China has risen from £ 5 million annually a decade ago to £ 6 billion today .
However , there is a lethal price to pay .
There is a sinister aspect to this invasion .
Chinese - made war planes roar through the African sky , bombing opponents .
Chinese - made assault rifles and grenades are being used to fuel countless murderous civil wars , often over the materials the Chinese are desperate to buy .
Take , for example , Zimbabwe .
Recently , a giant container ship from China was due to deliver its cargo of three million rounds of AK - 47 ammunition , 3,000 rocket - propelled grenades and 1,500 mortars to President Robert Mugabe 's regime .
After an international outcry , the vessel , the An Yue Jiang , was forced to return to China , despite Beijing 's insistence that the arms consignment was a ' normal commercial deal ' .
Indeed , the 77 - ton arms shipment would have been small beer - a fraction of China 's help to Mugabe .
He already has high - tech , Chinese - built helicopter gunships and fighter jets to use against his people .
Ever since the U.S. and Britain imposed sanctions in 2003 , Mugabe has courted the Chinese , offering mining concessions for arms and currency .
While flying regularly to Beijing as a high - ranking guest , the 84 - year - old dictator rants at ' small dots ' such as Britain and America .
He can afford to .
Mugabe is orchestrating his campaign of terror from a 25 - bedroom , pagoda - style mansion built by the Chinese .
Much of his estimated £ 1 billion fortune is believed to have been siphoned off from Chinese ' loans ' .
The imposing grey building of ZANU - PF , his ruling party , was paid for and built by the Chinese .
Mugabe received £ 200 million last year alone from China , enabling him to buy loyalty from the army .
In another disturbing illustration of the warm relations between China and the ageing dictator , a platoon of the China People 's Liberation Army has been out on the streets of Mutare , a city near the border with Mozambique , which voted against the president in the recent , disputed election .
Almost 30 years ago , Britain pulled out of Zimbabwe - as it had done already out of the rest of Africa , in the wake of Harold Macmillan 's ' wind of change ' speech .
Today , Mugabe says : ' We have turned East , where the sun rises , and given our backs to the West , where the sun sets . '
Despite Britain 's commendable colonial legacy of a network of roads , railways and schools , the British are now being shunned .
According to one veteran diplomat : ' China is easier to do business with because it does n't care about human rights in Africa - just as it does n't care about them in its own country .
All the Chinese care about is money . '
Nowhere is that more true than Sudan .
Branded ' Africa 's Killing Fields ' , the massive oil - rich East African state is in the throes of the genocide and slaughter of hundreds of thousands of black , non-Arab peasants in southern Sudan .
In effect , through its supplies of arms and support , China has been accused of underwriting a humanitarian scandal .
The atrocities in Sudan have been described by the U.S. as ' the worst human rights crisis in the world today ' .
Mugabe has received hundreds of millions of pounds from Chinese sources
The government in Khartoum has helped the feared Janjaweed militia to rape , murder and burn to death more than 350,000 people .
The Chinese - who now buy half of all Sudan 's oil - have happily provided armoured vehicles , aircraft and millions of bullets and grenades in return for lucrative deals .
Indeed , an estimated £ 1 billion of Chinese cash has been spent on weapons .
According to Human Rights First , a leading human rights advocacy organisation , Chinese - made AK - 47 assault rifles , grenade launchers and ammunition for rifles and heavy machine guns are continuing to flow into Darfur , which is dotted with giant refugee camps , each containing hundreds of thousands of people .
Between 2003 and 2006 , China sold Sudan $ 55 million worth of small arms , flouting a United Nations weapons embargo .
With new warnings that the cycle of killing is intensifying , an estimated two thirds of the non-Arab population has lost at least one member of their families in Darfur .
Although two million people have been uprooted from their homes in the conflict , China has repeatedly thwarted United Nations denunciations of the Sudanese regime .
While the Sudanese slaughter has attracted worldwide condemnation , prompting Hollywood film - maker Steven Spielberg to quit as artistic director of the Beijing Olympics , few parts of Africa are now untouched by China .
In Congo , more than £ 2 billion has been ' loaned ' to the government .
In Angola , £ 3 billion has been paid in exchange for oil .
In Nigeria , more than £ 5 billion has been handed over .
In Equatorial Guinea , where the president publicly hung his predecessor from a cage suspended in a theatre before having him shot , Chinese firms are helping the dictator build an entirely new capital , full of gleaming skyscrapers and , of course , Chinese restaurants .
After battling for years against the white colonial powers of Britain , France , Belgium and Germany , post - independence African leaders are happy to do business with China for a straightforward reason : cash .
With western loans linked to an insistence on democratic reforms and the need for ' transparency ' in using the money ( diplomatic language for rules to ensure dictators do not pocket millions ) , the Chinese have proved much more relaxed about what their billions are used for .
Certainly , little of it reaches the continent 's impoverished 800 million people .
Much of it goes straight into the pockets of dictators .
In Africa , corruption is a multi-billion pound industry and many experts believe that China is fuelling the cancer .
The Chinese are contemptuous of such criticism .
To them , Africa is about pragmatism , not human rights .
' Business is business , ' says Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong , adding that Beijing should not interfere in ' internal ' affairs .
' We try to separate politics from business . '
While the bounty has , not surprisingly , been welcomed by African dictators , the people of Africa are less impressed .
At a market in Zimbabwe recently , where Chinese goods were on sale at nearly every stall , one woman told me she would not waste her money on ' Zing - Zong ' products .
' They go Zing when they work , and then they quickly go Zong and break , ' she said .
' They are a waste of money .
But there 's nothing else .
China is the only country that will do business with us . '
There have also been riots in Zambia , Angola and Congo over the flood of Chinese immigrant workers .
The Chinese do not use African labour where possible , saying black Africans are lazy and unskilled .
In Angola , the government has agreed that 70 per cent of tendered public works must go to Chinese firms , most of which do not employ Angolans .
As well as enticing hundreds of thousands to settle in Africa , they have even shipped Chinese prisoners to produce the goods cheaply .
In Kenya , for example , only ten textile factories are still producing , compared with 200 factories five years ago , as China undercuts locals in the production of ' African ' souvenirs .
Where will it all end ?
As far as Beijing is concerned , it will stop only when Africa no longer has any minerals or oil to be extracted from the continent .
A century after Sir Francis Galton outlined his vision for Africa , the Chinese are here to stay .
More will come .
The people of this bewitching , beautiful continent , where humankind first emerged from the Great Rift Valley , desperately need progress .
The Chinese are not here for that .
They are here for plunder .
After centuries of pain and war , Africa deserves better .
Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman spent yesterday condemning cloud computing and is calling for users to reject popular web applications .
He insists that reliance on web - based software poses a serious risk to freedom and privacy .
Cloud computing is just a " hype campaign " perpetrated by software vendors who want to control users , he says , and the only way to fight the problem is to stop using the software .
Cloud computing is one of the most significant emerging trends in the technology industry .
Users are becoming increasingly reliant on web applications and remote data storage solutions .
The popularity of cloud computing is climbing in both enterprise and consumer markets , and the trend is widely regarded as a game - changing advancement in software deployment and consumption .
In light of the growing importance of cloud computing , Stallman 's call for its rejection warrants both scrutiny and skepticism .
" It 's stupidity .
It 's worse than stupidity : it 's a marketing hype campaign , " Stallman told The Guardian in reference to cloud computing .
" It 's just as bad as using a proprietary program .
Do your own computing on your own computer with your copy of a freedom - respecting program .
If you use a proprietary program or somebody else 's web server , you 're defenseless .
You 're putty in the hands of whoever developed that software . "
The negative characteristics of cloud computing that Stallman identifies are very real , but the solution that he prescribes seems grossly myopic and counterintuitive .
The lack of seamless interoperability between mainstream web applications imposes barriers that limit data portability .
Much like proprietary file formats on the desktop , the lack of data portability in closed - web ecosystems creates the potential for vendor lock - in and reduces the amount of control that users have over their own data .
Many web applications also have restrictive terms of service that require users to cede some rights to their own data so that it can be exploited by the application providers for invasive advertising or other purposes .
Stallman correctly recognizes those problems , but his belief that the problems are intractable is simply wrong .
The open source software movement has found productive ways to address the same kind of problems on the desktop , and I 'm confident that reasonable solutions can be found to bring the same level of freedom to the cloud .
The challenges posed by new computing paradigms will require the open source software community to evolve and adapt , not collectively stick its head in the sand .
The rapidly shifting landscape in the technology industry demands that participants cultivate a high level of adaptability .
Stakeholders have to be willing to keep an open mind and find practical ways to embrace major changes , or risk getting left behind .
If the software freedom movement is too brittle to withstand the rise of cloud computing , then it 's not going to have any serious staying power .
Fortunately , I 'm not the only open source software enthusiast who does n't buy into what I view as Stallman 's hysteria and defeatism .
Earlier this year , tech publisher Tim O'Reilly discussed the issue during a keynote presentation at the annual O'Reilly Open Source Conference ( OSCON ) .
O'Reilly acknowledged the challenges posed by cloud computing , but he also pointed out that the vibrant open source software community has already started exploring experimental solutions .
Here at Ars , we have reported on several intriguing open web service initiatives that have been launched in the past few years .
The developers of the open source GNOME desktop environment , for instance , created the open online .
gnome.org web infrastructure so that they could make web integration a core part of the user experience without compromising software freedom .
Luis Villa , a law student and GNOME community member , authored a draft for an open services definition last year .
His ideas have influenced broad discussion in the GNOME community .
Another really good open web services experiment is Mozilla 's Weave synchronization service for Firefox .
Weave is still in the early stages of development , but the long - term plan is to provide a secure web storage platform that is accessible to the browser and third - party software components .
Weave uses encryption so that the data is never visible to the operator of the server .
It also uses the WebDAV protocol and does n't depend on any specialized server - side capabilities , so it will be easy for users to self - host their Weave storage and use third - party providers for the backend .
The open source Identi.ca microblogging application is another open web service that 's gaining users .
Identi.ca pioneered the OpenMicroBlogging standard , an interoperability protocol that makes it possible for users to communicate across compatible microblogging services .
Identi.ca founder Evan Prodromou is one of many open source community members who is speaking out against Stallman 's rejection of cloud computing .
" I 'm very supportive of [ Stallman 's ] concern about cloud computing , and I agree that it 's something that the Free Software and Free Culture communities need to address .
But in rejecting all network computing , I think RMS has thrown out the baby with the bathwater , " Prodromou wrote in a blog entry this morning .
" I do n't believe loss of absolute control means that you lose your autonomy completely .
And I think that exchanging some control in order to participate in social , collaborative computing is ultimately enriching for individuals and for society . "
Prodromou is a signatory of the Franklin Street Statement , a roadmap for delivering software freedom in a cloud computing environment .
The statement , which was authored by members of the open source software community in collaboration with the Free Software Foundation , encourages service providers to release their software under open licenses and give users the ability to control their own data .
Another facet of this issue that is worth considering is that cloud computing has the potential to expand user freedom in some very important ways .
For instance , the growth of cloud computing and the shift in focus away from the desktop is rapidly eroding the leverage of the companies that control desktop platforms .
Microsoft 's operating system monopoly , for instance , is largely predicated on the abundance of software that is only available on Windows .
If more of that software shifts to the web , users will become less dependent on Windows and will have more freedom to choose which operating system they adopt .
That is one of the many factors that has contributed to the recent increase in vendor adoption of Linux on netbook devices .
Stallman 's dismissal of cloud computing and call for the categorical rejection of web services is puzzling in light of the potential opportunities created by web technologies and the innovative work that is being done by software freedom advocates to bring openness to the web .
Stallman should be using his visibility to promote adoption of the principles embodied in the Franklin Street Statement .
Instead he is undermining those efforts by disingenuously dismissing the entire concept of network computing .
Let ’s start with the money the Bush administration has already thrown at the war in Iraq .
According to the June congressional testimony of William Beach , director of the Center for Data Analysis , the war has cost $ 646 billion so far .
The new defense budget for 2009 tacks on another $ 68.6 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in the coming year .
However , military expert Bill Hartung of the New America Foundation puts a conservative estimate of the costs of a single week of the Iraq War at approximately $ 3.5 billion ( or about $ 180 billion a year ) .
In other words , the war in Iraq will cost far more in the next year than the Iraq portion of that $ 68.6 billion Congress is about to pony up in the defense budget , and so will be funded , as has long been true , through supplemental war bills submitted by the Bush administration ( and then whatever administration follows ) .
In other words , sometime in 2009 the direct costs of the war the Bush administration once predicted would cost perhaps $ 50 - 60 billion in total will stand at more than $ 800 billion , or $ 100 billion above the cost ( if all goes well , which it wo n’t ) of the bailout of the financial system now being proposed in Washington .
Estimates of the true long - term costs of the president ’s war of choice , including payments of health care and veterans benefits into the distant future , soar into the budgetary stratosphere .
They range from the Congressional Budget Office ’s $ 1 - 2 trillion to an estimate by economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes of up to $ 4 - 5 trillion .
So we ’re talking somewhere between one - and - a - half and seven bailouts - worth of taxpayer dollars flowing into the morass of disaster , corruption , and carnage in Iraq .
And here ’s another curious bit of information : Just the other day , the Web site ThinkProgress pointed out a strange glitch in Iraq planning .
The Bush administration , deep into negotiations with the Iraqi government , evidently managed to wheedle an extra year ’s time for the prospective withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraq ; they pushed the date from 2010  the year suggested by both Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki  to 2011 .
According to Maliki in an interview with an Iraqi TV station , this change came from the administration ’s concern over the “ domestic situation ” in the U.S. ( that is , the needs of the McCain campaign ) .
“ Actually , ” said Maliki , “ the final date was really the end of 2010 and the period between the end of 2010 and the end of 2011 was for withdrawing the remaining troops from all of Iraq , but they asked for a change [ in date ] due to political circumstances related to the [ U.S ] domestic situation so it will not be said to the end of 2010 followed by one year for withdrawal but the end of 2011 as a final date . ”
So we ’re talking about another perhaps $ 150 - 180 billion in 2011  or approximately the full suggested initial payout in the Washington bailout plan of at least one key Democrat .
This gives the phrase “ presidential politics ” new meaning .
Now , just imagine for a moment the situation we might be in if there had been no Iraq War .
We could have bailed ourselves out many times over .
As Chalmers Johnson , author most recently of Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , the final volume of his Blowback Trilogy , has pointed out for years , the Pentagon , the military - industrial complex , and America ’s wars are in the process of bankrupting us .
How strange then that , as he indicates below , no one in the mainstream even blinks when a staggering new Pentagon budget sails through the House of Representatives and then , by voice vote , through the Senate just as negotiators in Washington have been scrambling to find a similar sum to deal with a catastrophic financial meltdown ; nor does anyone in the mainstream bother to make any connection between that budget and the funds we do n’t have available to use elsewhere , or between the looting of Iraq and the looting of our financial system ( and , in both cases , of course , the looting of the American taxpayer ) .
Tom
We Have the Money
If only we did n’t waste it on the defense budget
by Chalmers Johnson
There has been much moaning , air - sucking , and outrage about the $ 700 billion that the U.S. government is thinking of throwing away on rich New York bankers who have been ripping us off for the past few years and then letting greed drive their businesses into a variety of ditches .
In fact , we dole out similar amounts of money every year in the form of payoffs to the armed services , the military - industrial complex , and powerful senators and representatives allied with the Pentagon .
On Wednesday , Sept. 24 , right in the middle of the fight over billions of taxpayer dollars slated to bail out Wall Street , the House of Representatives passed a $ 612 billion defense authorization bill for 2009 without a murmur of public protest or any meaningful press comment at all .
( The New York Times gave the matter only three short paragraphs buried in a story about another appropriations measure . )
The defense bill includes $ 68.6 billion to pursue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which is only a down - payment on the full yearly cost of these wars .
( The rest will be raised through future supplementary bills . )
It also included a 3.9 percent pay raise for military personnel and $ 5 billion in pork - barrel projects not even requested by the administration or the secretary of defense .
It also fully funds the Pentagon ’s request for a radar site in the Czech Republic , a hare - brained scheme sure to infuriate the Russians just as much as a Russian missile base in Cuba once infuriated us .
The whole bill passed by a vote of 392-39 and will fly through the Senate , where a similar bill has already been approved .
And no one will even think to mention it in the same breath with the discussion of bailout funds for dying investment banks and the like .
This is pure waste .
Our annual spending on “ national security ”  meaning the defense budget plus all military expenditures hidden in the budgets for the departments of Energy , State , Treasury , Veterans Affairs , the CIA , and numerous other places in the executive branch  already exceeds a trillion dollars , an amount larger than that of all other national defense budgets combined .
Not only was there no significant media coverage of this latest appropriation , there have been no signs of even the slightest urge to inquire into the relationship between our bloated military , our staggering weapons expenditures , our extravagantly expensive failed wars abroad , and the financial catastrophe on Wall Street .
The only congressional “ commentary ” on the size of our military outlay was the usual pompous drivel about how a failure to vote for the defense authorization bill would betray our troops .
The aged Sen. John Warner ( R - Va. ) , former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , implored his Republican colleagues to vote for the bill “ out of respect for military personnel . ”
He seems to be unaware that these troops are actually volunteers , not draftees , and that they joined the armed forces as a matter of career choice , rather than because the nation demanded such a sacrifice from them .
We would better respect our armed forces by bringing the futile and misbegotten wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to an end .
A relative degree of peace and order has returned to Iraq not because of President Bush ’s belated reinforcement of our expeditionary army there ( the so - called surge ) , but thanks to shifting internal dynamics within Iraq and in the Middle East region generally .
Such shifts include a growing awareness among Iraq ’s Sunni population of the need to restore law and order , a growing confidence among Iraqi Shi’ites of their nearly unassailable position of political influence in the country , and a growing awareness among Sunni nations that the ill - informed war of aggression the Bush administration waged against Iraq has vastly increased the influence of Shi’ism and Iran in the region .
The continued presence of American troops and their heavily reinforced bases in Iraq threatens this return to relative stability .
The refusal of the Shia government of Iraq to agree to an American Status of Forces Agreement  much desired by the Bush administration  that would exempt off - duty American troops from Iraqi law is actually a good sign for the future of Iraq .
In Afghanistan , our historically deaf generals and civilian strategists do not seem to understand that our defeat by the Afghan insurgents is inevitable .
Since the time of Alexander the Great , no foreign intruder has ever prevailed over Afghan guerrillas defending their home turf .
The first Anglo - Afghan War ( 1838 - 1842 ) marked a particularly humiliating defeat of British imperialism at the very height of English military power in the Victorian era .
The Soviet - Afghan War ( 1978 - 1989 ) resulted in a Russian defeat so demoralizing that it contributed significantly to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union in 1991 .
We are now on track to repeat virtually all the errors committed by previous invaders of Afghanistan over the centuries .
In the past year , perhaps most disastrously , we have carried our Afghan war into Pakistan , a relatively wealthy and sophisticated nuclear power that has long cooperated with us militarily .
Our recent bungling brutality along the Afghan - Pakistan border threatens to radicalize the Pashtuns in both countries and advance the interests of radical Islam throughout the region .
The United States is now identified in each country mainly with Hellfire missiles , unmanned drones , special operations raids , and repeated incidents of the killing of innocent bystanders .
The brutal bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Pakistan ’s capital , Islamabad , on Sept. 20 , 2008 , was a powerful indicator of the spreading strength of virulent anti-American sentiment in the area .
The hotel was a well - known watering hole for American Marines , Special Forces troops , and CIA agents .
Our military activities in Pakistan have been as misguided as the Nixon - Kissinger invasion of Cambodia in 1970 .
The end result will almost surely be the same .
We should begin our disengagement from Afghanistan at once .
We dislike the Taliban ’s fundamentalist religious values , but the Afghan public , with its desperate desire for a return of law and order and the curbing of corruption , knows that the Taliban is the only political force in the country that has ever brought the opium trade under control .
The Pakistanis and their effective army can defend their country from Taliban domination so long as we abandon the activities that are causing both Afghans and Pakistanis to see the Taliban as a lesser evil .
One of America ’s greatest authorities on the defense budget , Winslow Wheeler , worked for 31 years for Republican members of the Senate and for the General Accounting Office on military expenditures .
His conclusion , when it comes to the fiscal sanity of our military spending , is devastating :
“ America ’s defense budget is now larger in inflation - adjusted dollars than at any point since the end of World War II , and yet our Army has fewer combat brigades than at any point in that period ; our Navy has fewer combat ships ; and the Air Force has fewer combat aircraft .
Our major equipment inventories for these major forces are older on average than any point since 1946  or in some cases , in our entire history . ”
This in itself is a national disgrace .
Spending hundreds of billions of dollars on present and future wars that have nothing to do with our national security is simply obscene .
And yet Congress has been corrupted by the military - industrial complex into believing that , by voting for more defense spending , they are supplying “ jobs ” for the economy .
In fact , they are only diverting scarce resources from the desperately needed rebuilding of the American infrastructure and other crucial spending necessities into utterly wasteful munitions .
If we can not cut back our long - standing , ever increasing military spending in a major way , then the bankruptcy of the United States is inevitable .
As the current Wall Street meltdown has demonstrated , that is no longer an abstract possibility but a growing likelihood .
We do not have much time left .

This article describes how one amateur number theorist with only limited computer experience ( i.e. , E. Rosenstiel ) formed a team with two computer scientists to show that 6 963 472 309 248 = 2 4213 + 19 0833 = 5 4363 + 18 9483 = 10 2003 + 18 0723 = 13 3223 + 16 6303 is the least solution in distinct positive integers of s q = x3 + y3 = z3 + w3 = u3 + v3 = m3 + n3 , that the three next larger solutions are : 12 625 136 269 928 = 4 2753 + 23 2373 = 7 0683 + 23 0663 = 10 3623 + 22 5803 = 12 9393 + 21 8693 21 131 226 514 944 = 1 5393 + 27 6453 = 8 6643 + 27 3603 = 11 7723 + 26 9163 = 17 1763 + 25 2323 26 059 452 841 000 = 4 1703 + 29 6203 = 12 9003 + 28 8103 = 14 5773 + 28 4233 = 21 9303 + 24 9403 and that the next one is greater than 5 x 1013 .
The paper ends with a brief survey of unsolved related problems .
Introduction ( E. Rosenstiel )
T HIS project started when I was asked to write a program to list up to as high a limit as a simple microcomputer would permit all so called cubic doublets starting with
1729 = 93 + 103 = 13 + 123 ,
which was already known in Euler 's time as the least integer having two representations as the sum of two positive cubes .
( In this century this " least doublet " entered mathematical folklore through Hardy 's report of a visit to Ramanujanl in a Putney hospital via taxi cab No.1729 . )
My first attempts did not get very far , but a BASIC program written by J. A. Dardis and run on my Commodore PET computer sufficed to list , in about a week , all sums s d under 109 sorted in ascending order , where s d = x3 + y3 = z3 + w3 , i.e. , where s d is a doublet .
In order to check these results , but also to extend my list , using the old PET with only 32 K memory I had come to the end of my own explorations : J. A. Dardis ran a much faster FORTRAN program on a mainframe machine which quite quickly printed a complete list of all sums s d under 4 x 109 sorted in ascending order but which now included all positive primitive and nonprimitive solutions .
And thus happened our first discovery .
Looking in this list for instances where the same value s d occurred , but with different summands x , y , z and w , led to the rediscovery of the least triple identity s t , first reported by Leech2 in 1957 , namely that the first of these equal sums was
s t = 87 539 319 = 1673 + 4363 = 2283 + 4233 = 2553 + 4143 .
Here s t must be least , and it must be primitive .
Otherwise a common factor N > 1 could be removed .
Thus let s t = N3s t* , then s t* < s t , and s t* should have been listed earlier in the search .
Now we had no idea how Leech had programmed his protocomputer over 30 years ago but we realised that we had stumbled on a practical method for finding not just cubic " doublets , " but also " triplets , " " quadruplets , " etc. in ascending order .
Hardy and Wright3 had long ago reproduced the proof that the Diophantine equation
x 1 3 + y 1 3 = x 2 3 + y 2 3 = ... = x r 3 + y r 3 (*)
has solutions in positive integers for any given r.
In their book this relation is referred to as " Theorem 412 . "
The existence of the least quadruple identity
s q = x3 + y3 = z3 + w3 = u3 + v3 = m3 + n 3 ( ** )
was therefore assured , and it only remained to find whether the least quadruplet could be reached with the greatly increased computer power available since 1957 .
That cubic doublets and triplets could be found " to order " with parametric formulae , which were already known to Euler4 and Werebrusow , 5 respectively , does not of course solve the problem of finding the least solutions of ( * ) for given r.
It was indeed Leech2 who first identified the five least cubic triplets t 1 - t 5 , and thus disproved Gerardin 's5 conjecture published in 1908 that
" ... 5603 + 703 = 5523 + 1983 = 5253 + 3153
was " probably " the least triplet in positive integers . . . "
It was in fact Leech 's fourth - least triplet t 4 which he reported was the only one that had been listed by Dickson5 in 1920 .
It was later included in Beiler 's6 popular tract on Number Theory , while Leech 's least positive triplet t 1 was duly recorded by Wells7 in 1986 .
Our own investigations
We decided to extend Leech ' s2 results further by searching for least cubic quadruplets , i.e. , we had identified our PROJECT as :
Finding the location of the least cubic positive quadruplet s q1 and of as many more s q as computer power would permit .
This project would also provide independent confirmation for the first five cubic triple solutions claimed by Leech2 in 1957 just referred to .
At the same time there had evolved the particular algorithm first conceived by J. A. Dardis which was , while undergoing many refinements in the course of our investigations , to be the instrument enabling the completion of the project .
Its main features were as follows .
( a) Starting from s = 1729 as the first lower bound it computed all " singlet " sums of two cubes s = x3 + y3 between lower and upper bounds that would essentially depend on the storage capacity of the individual computer .
( b) It then arranged the resulting sums s in ascending order by means of a suitable sorting subroutine .
(c) It identified and listed those sums which appeared more than once , i.e. , doublets , triplets , completing thus the first " block , "
(d) Finally it set a new lower bound for the next block to be equal to the previous upper bound and another upper bound , again depending on storage capacity , but also chosen in such a way that there would be neither a gap between nor an overlap of these bounds .
There is little point in reporting the actual codings that were used .
Clearly we found much scope for improvements , reflected in faster and faster runs as the project progressed .
It was important to monitor the various subsections of each program in order to identify those parts where unnecessary but time - consuming calculations occurred , e.g. , while computing and storing lists of cubes , or during the different sorting routines which were tried .
Amongst simple number - theoretical limitations on x and y were for instance that always x ≠ y , since otherwise doublets would exist as s d = 2y3 = z3 + w3 ( using the notation of the Introduction ) , but this is impossible from the proven analogue of the famous conjecture known as Fermat 's last Theorem .
8
At this stage C. R. Rosenstiel joined the project and , using a Philips P3202 PC - AT compatible microcomputer , he succeeded after many months of first interpreted and then steadily improved compiled BASIC programs in finding s q l .
In a list of all positive integers representable as cubic triplets s t up to 7 x 1012 , the least solution of ( ** ) was found thus :
s 558 = 6 963 472 309 248
= 13 3223 + 16 6303 = 5 4363 + 18 9483 = 10 2003 + 18 0723 s 559 =6 963 472 309 248
= 5 4363 + 18 9483 = 10 2003 + 18 0723 = 2 4213 + 19 0833 ,
hence
s q l = 6 963 472 309 248
= 2 4213 + 19 0833 = 5 4363 + 18 9483 = 10 2003 + 18 0723 = 13 3223 + 16 6303
which resulted from combining the 558th and 559th triplets .
The program was such that the other two triplets which also could be combined to form s q l were not listed .
If this had been the case , it would show that the program contained unnecessary redundancies , making it slower and less efficient .
After many more refinements and by using the most up - to - date Quick - Basic compiler versions as they became available , C. R. Rosenstiel repeated in a rerun lasting only 243 hours the computations for the above claimed least solution s q l of ( ** ) , which he found after a total of 97 792 doublets .
He then extended the rerun past the 704/705th , the 862/863rd and the 941/942nd triplets which combined into the next larger quadruplets :
s q 2 = 12 625 136 269 928
= 4 2753 + 23 2373 = 7 0683 + 23 0663 = 10 3623 + 22 5803 = 12 9393 + 21 8693 s q 3 = 21 131 226 514 944
= 1 5393 + 27 6453 = 8 6643 + 27 3603 = 11 7723 + 26 9163 = 17 1763 + 25 2323 s q 4 = 26 059 452 841 000
= 4 1703 + 29 6203 = 12 9003 + 28 8103 = 14 5773 + 28 4233 = 21 9303 + 24 9403
This run was finally taken to all sums under 50 694 081 101 000 when , having found a total of 236 771 doublets and 1224 triplets , the program had reached the practical limits of whole number manipulations in Quick Basic , requiring entirely new ideas to extend the run farther .
All these results were later confirmed by J. A. Dardis using a compiled Turbo Pascal program .
Summary
A recent review by Churchhouse9 gave many examples of problems in number theory which are still awaiting solutions by number - theoretical methods , but which have meanwhile been disposed of by the methods of enumeration that have become possible since the arrival of electronic computers .
Our investigations have applied these methods to some further problems in the area of Diophantine Equations concerned with the representation of integers by sums of two positive equal powers in more than one way .
A claim made for the solution of the least cubic triplet problem in 19085 was shown by Leech2 to be false , who thus was one of the first to apply the new method of enumeration by computer to problems awaiting answers since the 17th and 18th century .
The " least cubic quadruplet " problem here presented would seem to be even more intractable to solve by " ordinary " number - theoretical methods .
We noted three apparently unconnected facts .
(a) The number of doublets preceding the least triplet was similar in magnitude to the number of triplets preceding the least quadruplet .
( b) When the logarithms of the cumulative numbers of cubic doublets ( or triplets ) were plotted against the logarithms of the respective sums of these doublets ( or triplets ) , a striking linearity was seen in both cases , ( and also in the case of fourth power doublets which will be mentioned in the next section ) .
( c) There is the Theorem 412 from Hardy and Wright3 [ referred to earlier on as ( * ) ] .
These three items may well have a discoverable connection , but it is felt that this is a problem well outside the scope of the project here presented .
Survey of related problems yet unsolved
Similar , but seemingly even harder , challenges arise when one is seeking answers to corresponding problems involving sums of two fourth powers .
Parametric solutions of
s d = x4 + y4 = z4 + w4
were already given by Euler , and these , together with more recent , simplified versions , are discussed in Hardy and Wright.10
These versions easily furnish the numeric solution
635318657 = 1334 + 1344 = 594 + 1584 (***)
found by Euler .
However , the proof that this is indeed the least fourth power doublet did not appear until over 200 years later in the paper by Leech2 already quoted .
This result was confirmed by J. A. Dardis while he sought solutions to two unsolved problems .
(a) No fourth power triplets are known , and , during a search for the least of these , 1269 doublets including ( ***) were computed without finding it .
The sums were calculated to just past 4.61 x 1018 ( the limit of integer arithmetic with the Turbo Pascal compiler used ) , and the last result was
s 1269 = 4 608 535 738 441 446 497
= 1 9184 + 46 3334 = 35 6514 + 41 5944 .
Although no fourth power triplet was found , this search established that the first number representable as the sum of two positive fourth powers in three essentially different ways must , if it exists , have at least 19 digits .
It is noted here that there is no equivalent known of Hardy and Wright 's3 Theorem 412 ( the one which guarantees the existence of cubic doublets , triplets , quadruplets etc. ) which is valid for any powers higher than three !
( b) A search for the least fifth power doublet soon outran the computer power available without adding to the Summing Up given by Hardy and Wright3 more than 30 years ago , namely that not even doublets are known for higher than fourth powers , i.e. , only for 2nd , 3rd and 4th powers have integers been found which can be expressed as the sum of two equal and positive powers in more than one way .
This leaves open the possibility of further projects , as and when yet more powerful computers with suitable algorithms can be applied to these remaining unsolved problems .
For Vincent Bugliosi , one of America 's foremost prosecutors and authors , George W. Bush 's purposeful crime of misleading America into war is a vile , despicable and prosecutable act .
It angers Bugliosi deeply .
So much so that he 's written a new book , " The Prosecution Of George W. Bush For Murder . "
To be clear , this is not a partisan effort .
Not Republican v. Democrat or an assault on political ideology .
It 's a legally binding and provable case for murder , that Bugliosi - an American patriot - would bring against any president regardless of any and all affiliation .
In Vincent Bugliosi's own words :
" I want to state that in writing this book my motivation was not political .
Whether I 'm giving a final summation to the jury or writing one of my true crime books , credibility has always meant everything to me .
Therefore , my only master - my only mistress - are the facts and objectivity .
And this is why I can give you a 100 % guarantee that if a Democratic president had done what George W. Bush did , I would have written the same exact book . "
It was obvious from his heartfelt delivery and palpable anger , that Bugliosi was telling the truth .
The actions of George W. Bush have enraged him .
Were Bush a Democrat , Bugliosi 's wrath would have been the same .
First and foremost Bugliosi is a patriot , seeking justice for his nation - which will come in the form of a conviction .
Bugliosi's presentation blew the roof off the venue at the Los Angeles ' Great Mind series , hosted by Progressive Democrats of America , and co-sponsored by CODEPINK , LAProgressive.com and several grassroots groups .
Bugliosi held the audience spellbound as he guided it down the twisted path of Bush 's hedonism and criminality .
In true prosecutorial style , this master of law made his audience believe - and understand - that George Bush was guilty of murder .
True , the audience was principally progressive and already on Bugliosi 's side .
Nonetheless , the evidence was overwhelming that Bush took this nation to war knowing there were NO weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
And despite the thousands upon thousands of deaths that he caused , George Bush was n't bothered in the least .
In fact , while young Americans and Iraqis were dying , George Bush was having fun .
Bugliosi describes it this way :
" There 's no way to dispute it .
The evidence is overwhelming that throughout the hell on earth that George Bush created in Iraq with over 100,000 people dying horrible , violent deaths and hundreds of thousands of their survivors crying out hysterically and having nightmares over what happened to their loved ones , George Bush smiled - smiled through it all .
In fact you can look at a photograph of George Bush with 6 or 7 people in it smiling .
And who 's got the biggest smile on his face ?
George Bush !
The evidence is very clear that while young American soldiers - 18 and 19 year old kids - who never had a chance to live out their dreams - were being blown to pieces by road side bombs in Iraq , George Bush was having a lot of fun and enjoying life to the fullest .
I 'm talking about running , bicycling , joking with friends , slapping backs , dancing and swirling his hips like Elvis ... almost always seeming to be in the very best of spirits .
Oh I know the White House press people say he takes the loss of American lives hard and he suffers - but that 's just pure moonshine !...
Suffering on one hand and having fun , joking around and enjoying life on the other , ARE SIMPLY INCOMPATIBLE . "
The audience , mainly comprised of American patriots angry at Congress for not impeaching Bush , erupted in a thunderous , albeit bittersweet response - messaging to Bugliosi that his observations were shared .
Seated in the audience were many attorneys - each in possession of a newly purchased book that they fanned furiously from footnote to text as they followed Bugliosi along .
To say this audience was riveted is an understatement .
In a nation demoralized by an unconstrained President and a spineless constrained Congress , Vincent Bugliosi offers the promise and potential for the justice that Congress failed to provide .
The momentum is building .
Two weeks ago when I interviewed Bugliosi at his home in California , he told me he'd just gotten off the phone with an unnamed State Attorney General who 'd called to inquire about the basis for his case against Bush .
Interest from the legal and government communities had begun .
Since that time , it has grown significantly stronger .
In the following clip , Vince describes his recent conversation with an unnamed conservative Republican Congressman , who after listening to the audio of Vince 's book , tells Vince he has come to believe that Congress was misled into war :
In the next clip , we witness an exchange between Vince and an audience member in which Vince reveals his recent conversation with Congressman John Conyers and Conyers ' support for Vince .
For the record , Congressman Conyers , we all support what Vince is doing !!
We wish we could say the same for you !
Of course , Vince did have his share of challenges last night as fellow attorneys took him on .
Several lively exchanges occurred - but in each situation the challenging attorney publicly committed to working with Vince to move Bush 's prosecution along .
Here 's a clip of Los Angeles attorney Peter Thottam engaging in a little lawyerly love .
I 've titled it : " Pinocchio Revealed . "
You 'll figure it out , I 'm sure ...
Thankfully , as you will see , Vince and Peter have a meeting of minds - and Pinocchio - I mean Peter - graciously agrees to come on board .
Thank you , Peter !!
And thank you , Vince , for showing what a great prosecutor you are and for being so gentle with Peter !
Finally , as I reported in my first article on Vince Bugliosi 's new book , The Prosecution Of George W. Bush For Murder , ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-milazzo/a-call-to-heroes-my-sit-d_b_108496.html), corporate media - which Vince refers to as mainstream or national media - has completely blacked out the book .
There is a bright side however , in that Vince believes a major newspaper may soon feature an article stating the book should not be blacked out !
In any event , the patriotic blogosphere continues to push Vince 's book up the list just as it did with Jeremy Scahill 's " Blackwater . "
As Vince says in the following clip , the book is now at # 12 on the New York Times Bestseller list - thanks to all of YOU !
Here 's the clip of Vince describing his experience with a frightened , spineless - in his words , " mainstream media . " :
We 're on our way to # 1 .
Buy the book .
Justice is on the way !!
Thanks to you Vincent Bugliosi - and to your fabulous wife and partner , Gail !!
A huge and heartfelt thank you to Dennis Whipple for allowing me to take his beautifully shot full length video , cut it into little clips , and rebroadcast it in much poorer quality .
Dennis - you 're a patriot and a hero !!

One reason election officials around the country have given for purchasing touch - screen voting machines is that they say the systems save money – both in the cost of printing paper ballots and in storing them after an election .
Officials have made this claim , despite the fact that the machines carry a steep price tag ( about $ 3,000 per machine ) .
So SaveOurVotes ( .pdf ) , a voting integrity group in Maryland , decided to see if the 19,000 touch - screen machines their state purchased really did save money .
The results are n't really a surprise – the machines are wildly more expensive than anyone anticipated .
But just how expensive they are makes their analysis mandatory reading for any legislators and state or county budget committees that approve voting equipment purchases .
Maryland uses one system statewide – touch - screen machines made by Diebold Election Systems – which it purchased in batches in 2002 and 2003 .
A loan of about $ 67 million was taken out from the state treasury to pay Diebold for the machines , which counties are still paying off .
They 'll continue to pay for the machines through 2014 , even though the state has since decided to scrap the touch - screen machines , due to security concerns , and change to optical - scan machines by 2010 .
Nonetheless , according to SaveOurVotes ' figures , by the end of the presidential election this year , Maryland will have spent more than $ 97.5 million on the machines it 's abandoning , but only about half of that can be attributed to the actual cost of purchasing the machines .
At least $ 44 million of it went to Diebold just for operation and maintenance of the machines , which covered repairs ( the cost of which increases as machines age ) , storage of the machines as well as programming , testing and transporting them to precincts on election days .
In the case of transportation , the state contracts with Diebold to deliver the machines from warehouses , but Diebold does n't do the deliveries itself ; instead it subcontracts the service to other vendors ( see this story about one of the delivery companies Diebold hired whose owner is the former chair of Maryland 's state Republican Party ) .
Diebold has also been paid to train workers to use the machines as well as do voter outreach to familiarize voters with the equipment – and in the process essentially selling voters on the merits of their machines .
Rebecca Wilson , co-director of SaveOurVotes , says , " I think people do n't understand that e-voting is a bad idea not just because of its insecurities but because it 's really bad public policy to have these really expensive machines .
The cost never goes down .
In fact the cost only goes up as the machines age and need more parts and upgrading .
" They take up huge amounts of warehouse space in warehouses that need to be air - conditioned , " she continues .
" They have to recharge the batteries every six months .
And ( yet ) we only haul them out about once a year ( for elections ) . "
Prior to purchasing the touch - screen machines , about 19 of Maryland 's 24 voting districts used optical - scan machines ( yes , the state 's recent decision to scrap touch - screen machines means that counties that were forced in 2003 to scrap their optical - scan machines and purchase new touch - screen machines are now being told they have to go back to optical - scan machines ) .
SaveOurVotes examined those counties and compared the cost of the optical - scan equipment they previously used to the touch - screen machines they were forced to buy .
The cost for most counties in this category increased 179 percent per voter on average .
In at least one county , the cost increased 866 percent per voter – from a total cost of about $ 22,000 in 2001 to $ 266,000 in 2007 .
Optical - scan machines , which use a paper ballot that is run through a scanner , are less expensive because counties need fewer of them .
A county can opt for one scanner per precinct ( at a cost of about $ 4,000 per unit ) or use several dozen central - based scanners at the county election headquarters to do the task .
Counties that use touch - screen machines , however , have to buy between 5 and 10 machines per precinct ( at a cost of between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 per precinct ) .
This explains in part why voting machine companies have heavily marketed their touch - screen machines over their optical - scan products and have only recently been pushing their optical - scan machines since states have begun to ban touch - screen machines due to security and reliability concerns .

Occult symbol appears the world over – what is its significance ?
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Wednesday , August 6 , 2008
During a visit to a breathtaking , beautiful and ornate Christian cathedral in Lucerne , Switzerland last week , I was taken aback by the sight of something that seemed completely out of context and out of place – a baleful and evil - looking Illuminati eye staring out over a representation of the crucified Jesus .
Why do similar depictions infest Christian churches the world over ?
The Church of St. Leodegar , popularly called the Hofkirche , in the bustling town of Lucerne in northern Switzerland , was originally built in 735 and the present structure was erected in 1633 in the late Renaissance style .
The cathedral ’s distinctive twin needles were part of the original structure .
The church is opulently decorated with awe - inspiring golden statues and vibrant paintings depicting stories from the bible .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
But when one reaches the front of the church and looks up at a statue of the crucified Jesus , looming over it in a window near the roof is a depiction of a single eye inside a pyramid with yellow and orange sun rays emanating from behind .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
This occult symbol is completely not inkeeping with the rest of the style of the church and the cathedral ’s literature makes no mention of why it was placed there or what its significance is supposed to be .
CLICK IMAGE FOR ENLARGEMENT .
The eye can be seen in the background above the Swiss flag .
CLICK IMAGE FOR ENLARGEMENT .
Close up of the eye .
Here ’s another example of the depiction of the eye in the pyramid that Steve Watson photographed while visiting Piazza del Popolo in Rome this past June .
The video below showcases the Illuminati eye as seen in dozens of churches and cathedrals around the world .
The author attributes the eye to a representation of Dajjal or “ The Impostor - Christ , ” an evil figure in Islamic eschatology who will supposedly return as a false prophet before Judgment Day .
According to one description , “ It is said that he will have one eye damaged and the other will be working . ”
According to Wikipedia , “ The belief is based around the events prior to the Day of Judgment around the Second Coming of The Christ , when ad - Dajjal who is blind in his right eye , shall gather an army of those he has deceived and lead them in a war against Jesus , who shall be accompanied by an army of the righteous . ”
If that is so then why on earth do we see the eye placed above the crucified Jesus in the Lucerne cathedral and in hundreds of other Christian churches around the world ?
The eye in the pyramid has been adopted by many different esoteric entities throughout history , including the eye of Osiris in Egypt , and the All - Seeing Eye in Freemasonry .
It also famously appears on the back of the U.S. dollar bill .
Henry Wallace , who was instrumental in having the seal placed on the dollar bill in 1935 , had deep occult connections
As this website documents , the eye in the pyramid can be seen in the corporate logos of companies such as AOL , CBS and also appears in the window of many Starbucks coffee outlets .
As the Illuminati Conspiracy Archive details , occultists have long expressed pride in the symbol and cherished its signifiance , which denotes top down control by an elite harboring secret knowledge .
“ Our beautiful seal is an expression of Freemasonry , an expression of occult ideas , ” wrote H.S. Wyckoff in a piece for the Rosicrucian Magazine entitled The Great American Seal .
The Bavarian Illuminati , founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776 , also adopted the eye in the pyramid as their motif , which begs the question , why does a symbol that was used by an occult organization who stated their goal was to destroy organized religion appear in Christian churches across the world ?
As Texe Marrs writes , “ In his classic textbook , Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism , describing the Illuminist plot in France , Abbe Barruel affirms that , “ The grand object of this conspiracy was to overturn every altar where Christ was adored . ”
Theirs , Barruel wrote , was an “ unrelenting hatred for Christ and kings . ”
So if the Illuminati , symbolized by the eye in the pyramid , wanted to “ overturn every altar where Christ was adored , ” then why does their motif still appear above the depiction of Christ ’s crucifixion in Lucerne , as well as in Christian churches throughout Europe and America ?

Comment on this article
The stakes in this year 's presidential campaign are high .
But that 's nothing new .
There have been many other pivotal presidential elections in our history , some that set an entirely new course for the United States and a few that were crucial to the very survival of the republic .
To put the current campaign in perspective , U.S. News 's White House Correspondent Kenneth T. Walsh , author of four books on the presidency , examines the 10 most consequential elections in American history — the races that produced the biggest change and had the most lasting impact .
An installment of this 10 - part series will run on the U.S. News website each Wednesday through September .
This is the eighth in the series .
In the fall of 1929 , the stock market crashed , factories slashed production , companies made deep cuts in jobs , salaries plummeted , and the nation seemed to be in the middle of a nervous breakdown .
As the months wore on , wage earners grew desperate .
Many did n't have enough money for food and rent , and more businesses contracted , producing further cuts in jobs and wages .
Charities could n't care for the millions of people who needed help , and Americans increasingly looked to the government for relief .
But President Herbert Hoover argued that " rugged individualism " would prevail and that it was not the government 's job to intervene aggressively in the economy .
By the end of his term , Hoover , a Republican , relented and tried to use the federal government to help those in need .
But , by then , it seemed too late for limited measures , and his credibility was shattered .
To challenge him , the Democrats nominated New York Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt , a wealthy American aristocrat and fifth cousin of former President Theodore Roosevelt .
His platform called for unemployment assistance , old - age insurance under state laws , legislation to protect labor , assistance for farmers , development of power plants , a repeal of Prohibition , and a balanced budget .
He promised a " New Deal " for the American people and this became the slogan for FDR 's campaign and , later , his administration .
He won the 1932 election in a landslide with 22.8 million votes to Hoover 's 15.7 million .
Roosevelt carried 42 states to Hoover 's six .
Journalist William Allen
White said FDR 's victory showed " a firm desire on the part of the American people to use government as an agency for human welfare . "
The electorate had , in effect , taken nearly 150 years of tradition upholding limited government and , in their anxiety and anger , thrown it out the window .
In his inaugural address , carried to millions on the radio , the new president said , " This great nation will endure as it has endured , will revive and will prosper .
So , first of all , let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror , which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance . "
His prescription was clear and heartening : " This nation asks for action , and action now .
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work .
I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require . "
What followed was an unprecedented accretion of federal power .
It did n't take long for FDR to jettison one of his major campaign promises — to balance the budget .
He felt the pledge was outweighed by the need for government activism , and he began a new era of vast deficit spending .
His approach was pragmatic , designed to get results and rebuild hope for the future .
FDR proceeded to win congressional approval for a wave of expensive social and economic programs .
In the first 100 days , many new federal agencies were created to alleviate the nation 's plight , including the Federal Emergency Relief Administration to channel money through the states to the unemployed , the Civil Works Administration to create jobs ; later , the Works Progress Administration to build long - term projects and create more jobs , and the Public Works Administration to build power plants , hospitals , schools , and other long - term projects with federal funds .
The National Recovery
Act gave the government broad powers to increase industrial production and help workers , such as by requiring a minimum wage of 40 cents an hour and giving labor the right to organize and strike .
This was only the start of a fundamental restructuring of government to create a social safety net and assist those in need .
FDR also understood the need to communicate effectively with the country .
He dominated the media of his time — newspapers and especially radio — and connected directly with everyday people .
One of his most powerful tools was the " fireside chat " on the radio in which he talked in a folksy , approachable way about the problems of the country and what he was doing about them .
Millions of Americans tuned in , and his voice became one of the most recognizable in history .
Most important , his jaunty optimism proved infectious .
Eventually , the economy would again stall and Roosevelt 's opponents would slow his programs .
He would be accused of overreaching and betraying the American values of self - reliance and free market capitalism .
But the election of 1932 had changed America forever .
' FDR would go on to win three more terms and lead America to victory in World War II .
In the process , he became one of the nation 's most beloved presidents and built a vast and powerful governing coalition .
It consisted in part of working - class whites , union members , immigrants , African Americans , Southern whites , Catholics , Jewish voters , and city dwellers .
This coalition dominated American politics for more than a generation — another key part of FDR 's legacy .
Conservatives like Malkin will go to the ends of the earth to blame brown people for all the problems in the world .
It 's no coincidence that most of the areas hardest hit by the foreclosure wave - Loudoun County , Va. , California 's Inland Empire , Stockton and San Joaquin Valley , and Las Vegas and Phoenix , for starters - also happen to be some of the nation 's largest illegal - alien sanctuaries .
Half of the mortgages to Hispanics are subprime ( the accursed species of loan to borrowers with the shadiest credit histories ) .
A quarter of all those subprime loans are in default and foreclosure .
Regional reports across the country have decried the subprime meltdown 's impact on illegal - immigrant " victims . "
A July report showed that in seven of the ten metro areas with the highest foreclosure rates , Hispanics represented at least one third of the population ; in two of those areas - Merced and Salinas - Monterey , Calif . - Hispanics comprised half the population .
The amnesty - promoting National Council of La Raza and its Development Fund have received millions in federal funds to " counsel " their constituents on obtaining mortgages with little to no money down ; the group almost succeeded in attaching a $ 10 - million earmark for itself in one of the housing bills past this spring ... read on

Cinderella , Snow White and Mickey Mouse arrested as police clash with staff at Disneyland
Mickey Mouse had his tail between his legs yesterday - after being arrested by police and led away in handcuffs .
Also taken into custody outside Disneyland in Anaheim , Los Angeles , were Cinderella , Snow White , and Tinkerbell .
It happened as workers at the theme park - dubbed the Happiest Place on Earth - staged a demonstration over pay and conditions .
Mickey in irons : A protesting hotel employee dressed as Mickey Mouse outside Disneyland in California
The arrest of 32 costumed protesters came at the end of an hour - long march from one of three Disney - owned hotels .
Cartoon capers : Snow
White is taken away by an officer
Bewildered tourists looked on as the cartoon characters were led to two police vans while hundreds of fellow employees cheered and chanted .
The dispute involves 2,300 maids , bellhops , cooks and dishwashers at three Disney - owned hotels .
Protest : Mickey in action before his arrest
Their contract expired in February and their union says Disney 's latest proposal makes health care unaffordable and creates an unfair two - tier wage system .
Roundup : Peter Pan also felt the long arm of the law
Disney said it is in negotiations with the union and nothing has been finalised .
Before the arrests , the picketers marched and chanted outside Paradise Pier , holding signs that read , ' Disney is unfaithful , ' and ' Mickey , shame on you . '
They were joined by community activists and religious leaders from local churches .
Anger : Protesters are furious about new work contracts
Luz Vasquez , who works in the bakery at Disneyland Hotel , said she can't afford to lose many of her benefits .
' Disneyland is being unfair with us because we 're fighting for our health care and they 're trying to take it away , ' said Vasquez , 45 .
' They 're trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority . '

Some , mostly Hillary Clinton supporters , will argue that Joe Biden was not the best choice to be Barack Obama ’s running mate , but below are five reasons why he was the best choice for the Obama ticket .
1 ) . Biden is Neutral – Once he got out of the race , Joe Biden never endorsed Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
He was more concerned with supporting the Democratic Party , but since he never sided with either camp in the political civil war known as the primary , his selection eliminated the dilemma of selecting either an Obama supporter or a Clinton supporter .
He is a choice that both camps can get behind .
2 ) . Knowledge of Policy – I do n’t think any other Democrat is more well rounded in terms of domestic and foreign policy than Joe Biden .
Hillary Clinton is strong on domestic policy .
Bill Richardson is strong on foreign policy .
Joe Biden is strong on both .
His foreign policy record will get all of the attention , but Biden also wrote the crime bill in the mid-1990 ’s that put 100,000 new policemen on the street .
Biden is also outstanding on education and healthcare .
Advertisements
3 ) . Limited Baggage –
The problem that Obama faced in making his choice is that except for Biden the Democrats that are baggage free are boring , dull , Evan Bayh types .
I am a firm believer that it was Bill Clinton and his shady presidential library fundraising , among other scandals that cost Mrs. Clinton the VP slot .
Obama did not want the Clinton baggage , but finding a top tier running mate that has no baggage at all is tough .
Biden ’s biggest problem is his own mouth .
Otherwise , he has a moving personal story , and fits the Obama mode as a good family man .
4 ) . Energy and Passion –
The negative attacks on him seem to have taken Obama a bit off his game lately .
This has been a long campaign , and Obama looks like he could use a shot of energy .
Nobody will argue more passionately on Barack Obama ’s behalf than Joe Biden will .
Biden is energetic passionate , and his oratorical gifts rival Obama ’s .
Biden may be a bit of a loose cannon , but as long as he is aimed at the Republicans , he will be a powerful weapon .
5 ) . Presidential Ambitions – Joe Biden has wanted to be president for at least the last 20 years , but now at age 65 , he seems to realize that the vice presidency would be a fine end to his political career .
If Obama wins two terms , I do n’t see a then 73 year old Biden running for president , which means that door will be wide open for the then 68 year old Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic nominee .
Because of his age , Biden will be able to campaign as the experienced advisor to Obama , which makes this is a win - win - win for Obama , Biden , and Clinton .
Amy Goodman , host of the independent news program " Democracy Now ! , " was among hundreds who were arrested in St. Paul Minnesota today .
Also detained were Goodman 's producers , Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
The three were covering the protests at the Republican National Convention , but the Minneapolis Police Department charged them with conspiracy to riot .
Goodman has since been released , but her colleagues are still being held at the time of this blog post .
Video embedded above from Rick Rowley and Brandon Jourdan .
Democracy
Now 's news release about the incident is here .
( via @kenyatta )
More on the story : Editor and Publisher , San Francisco Chronicle , and Washington Post , snip below :
" I was down on the convention floor interviewing delegates when I heard that two of our producers had been arrested , " said Goodman .
" I ran down to Jackson and 7th Street , where the police had moved in . "
Goodman said that when she ran up to find out what was going on , she was also arrested .
" They seriously manhandled me and handcuffed my hands behind my back .
The top ID [ at the convention ] is to get on the floor and the Secret Service ripped that off me .
I had my Democracy Now !
ID too .
I was clearly a reporter . "
Goodman , who was released after being charged with a misdemeanor , said that Salazar had been hurt in the face , while Kouddous had been thrown up against a wall and hurt his elbow .
" Nicole told me that as they moved in on three sides , she asked them ' How do I get away from this ? ' and they jumped on her . "
You know how John McCain told his supporters Friday night that he was returning to Washington to join the negotiations on the bailout bill ?
The McCain campaign just sent out an email to supporters that highlights his return to DC tonight to “ to resume negotiations with the Administration and Congressional leaders from both parties to forge a bipartisan solution to our economic crisis . ”
Yeah , um , that would be a lie .
McCain spent Saturday loafing around at his apartment .
So much for returning to DC to focus like a laser on the bailout .
ThinkProgress has more :
After declaring he ’d return to Washington to help with the bailout negotiations immediately after last night ’s debate , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) never went to Capitol Hill today .
In fact , McCain stayed largely holed up in his Arlington apartment , leaving only to go to his campaign headquarters just around the block , the New York Times reports : Asked why Mr. McCain did not go to Capitol Hill after coming back to Washington to help with negotiations , [ McCain adviser ]
Mr. Salter replied that “ he can effectively do what he needs to do by phone . ’’
Did you catch that ?
McCain claimed he suspended his campaign ( he did n’t ) in order to rush back to Washington ( he did n’t ) so that he could attend the bailout talks .
Then McCain said he could do it all by phone , which means he did n’t have to return to Washington at all .
Okay , stay with me here .
Because , while yesterday , McCain was supposed to be working the phones , he apparently was n’t .
Because , today , Think Progress reports ( with video ) that both McCain and his sidekick , Lindsey Graham , said you ca n’t phone into something like this .
In the true drama queen language you ’d expect from Lindsey , he said , “ Thank God John came back . ”
So , if McCain was n’t on the phone , since this was something you ca n’t phone in , and he was n’t actually at the meetings , what was he doing ?
It gets better because we now know what McCain was doing last night .
While key members of Congress were working at the Capitol on Saturday night , McCain went out for dinner at one of Washington ’s swankiest hotels with Joe Lieberman .
Politico provided the details :

Update ( 12:37 a.m. ) :
It 's a secret deal !
Until they get it down on paper overnight , we wo n't know what they agreed to .
Except , except .
We imagine that that the staff members and lawmakers will quickly be leaking details to reporters .
( Leak it to us ! Clusterstock@gmail.com or 646-526-FEAR )
Update ( 12:35 a.m. ) : Nancy Pelosi speaks first .
She says we have a deal .
Harry Reid is up next .
He credits Pelosi with coming up with a new idea in the final hour but does n't even hint at what that is !
Are the Republicans going to let Pelosi claim the credit ?
Or are they convinced it 's a terrible idea and want her to take the blame ?
What the heck is this brilliant new idea anyway ?
Hank Paulson sounds less reassuring , mentioning that there is lots of work left to be done and concluding " so far , so good . "
Gregg just sounds glad to be able to go to bed .
Roy Blunt admits he has n't talked to the House Republicans but seems confident .
Blather from Dodd about how " unpleasant " having to " go through all this " has been .
Barney Frank says he 's looking forward to not having to speak to all the lawmakers around him .
They all agree .
Chuckles all around .
Old Barney 's always good for a moment of levity .
Update ( 12:27 a.m. ) :
They 're walking toward the microphones together .
Looks like we have a deal because they 're all together .
Nancy Pelosi in front , followed by Chuck Schumer , Chris Dodd , Judd Gregg , Hank Paulson , Roy Blunt , Harry Reid .
Democrats , Republicans , Senators , House members , Treasury Department .
That sure looks like a deal .
Update ( 12:22 a.m. ) :
The meeting has broken up , and some kind of announcement is apparently imminent .
Update ( 12:15 a.m. ) :
A person familiar with the progress of the negotiations says describes the progress over the last hour as " significant . "
Most negotiating plan to announce something shortly .
The person warns , however , the there may be a bit of " room fatigue " setting in , as negotiators drop objections out of exhaustion , making an agreement seem closer than it actually is .
Many lawmakers , particularly GOP
House members , who are not taking part in the talks will still need to be consulted .
Remember :

Update ( 12:00 a.m. ) : Still no deal reached !
So much for the much anticipated midnight agreement .
CNN just reported that Warren Buffett told lawmakers that if they do n't reach a deal soon we 'll face " the biggest meltdown in American history .
Update ( 11:30 p.m. ) :
The WSJ reveals that the negotiators have been calling so - called financial experts around the country for advice .
That 's right : they 've chose to use the " dial a friend " option .
" We 've had Warren Buffett on the phone tonight , other experts that we 've been consulting , " Senator Kent Conrad said .
He added that there were only a " handful of issues " left .
Is that true ?
It seems like we 've had bucket fulls of new issues arise tonight .
Can the negotiators really have cleared all these new issues with there House and Senate colleagues ?
Remember , these are the same people who told us we had a deal days ago .
We 're now nearing the 10th hour of negotiations .
Update ( 10:00 p.m. ) :
Despite the happy talk about getting closer to a deal , all the new proposals we keep hearing about suggests the opposite .
Rich Lowry , the editor of National Review , thinks things are falling apart on Capitol Hill : " Just talked to a friend who is plugged - in to all this who wants a deal and has tended to think all along that there will be a deal .
Now he ’s not so sure .
He thinks the wheels are coming off .
House Republicans want their insurance as a mandatory thing rather than an option , while the House Democratic caucus is imploding and pulling the deal far to the left .
It ’s getting ugly . "
Update ( 9:45 p.m. ) : Politico reports that there is growing interest in imposing a financial company transaction fee to pay for the bailout .
Paulson is said to be open to the idea , although exactly which transaction would be subject to what kind of fees remains vague .
On a lighter note , we have more details on who is eating what .
Democratic staffers ordered burgers from Five Guys .
Paulson 's crew , which is set up in in othe offices of Minority Leader John A. Boehner , across the hall from Pelosi 's office , ordered pizza .
An aide to Pelosi collected BlackBerrys from the staffers meeting in her office so that no details would leak out .
Update ( 9:20 p.m. ) :
No wonder why things keep getting more complicated !
The New York Times is reporting that nine Democrats showed up to the negotiations , surprising Republicans who sent only Rep. Roy Blunt and Senator Judd Gregg .
At one point Democratic Sentor Max Bacchus started shouting at Paulson over executive pay caps .
( Paulson is presumably smart enough to know this would mean Wall Street executives would n't play ball . )
Latest word from the NYT : " lawmakers said they hoped to reach an agreement by Sunday night , in time for the opening of the markets in Asia . "
Hoping , of course , is not a strategy .
Update ( 9:10 p.m. ) : The Wall Street Journal reports that the mood is optimistic .
But do n't expect anything soon .
Cosi just delivered a bunch of food to Nancy Pelosi 's office .
The key sticking point seems to be the Republican insurance program .
Several previously unheard of provisions are under consideration , according to the Journal .
Financial Stability Fund .
Modelled on the commercial banking industries support for the FDIC , this would involve firms that are deemed ' too big to fail ' paying into an insurance pool which could be used to rescue troubled financial firms .
Taxing ' Excessive ' Salaries .
In what seems to be a compromise move on executive salaries , this would eliminate the tax deductions for companies on executive compensation for top officers that is above $ 400,000 .
This would allow companies to continue to pay large salaries and eliminate the incentive for executives to avoid participating in the rescue .
It would , of course , cost firms and taxpayers more .
Meanwhile , the Treasury is reportedly pushing back on attempts to stagger the rescue funds into three tranches .
Paulson and his buddies want at least $ 500 billion in the initial tranche .
Update ( 8:40 p.m. ) :
The meeting on Capitol Hill reconviened this evening but the situation is becoming more complicated not less .
Senator Kent Conrad , who runs the Senate Budget Committee , emerged from the meeting and told reporters that " We 've got several big issues " that have not been resolved .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has added a twist to the negotiations by introducing a new proposal that would allow the government to ' recoup ' losses from securities or mortgage bought from financial firms by charging the firms some kind of fee .
We described this proposal , which originated with conservative Democrats , earlier today .
( See below . )
The provision could be highly problematic as it adds complexity and unpredictability to the deal , leaving financial firms on the hook for the downside of the assets that have been dragging them down for the past year .
Update ( 5:40 p.m. ) :
The point man for the Republican House members , Roy Blunt , just left House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's office .
He walked right past the waiting press hordes without offering any comment .
The official word is that those meeting , including Barney Frank , Senators Chris Dodd and Judd Gregg , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , Blunt and Pelosi , are taking a break .
Apparently , it 's not just a break because it 's dinner time .
House Democrats are meeting in the basement of the Capitol building .
Blunt will be speaking with Eric Cantor , who has been taking the measure of the House Republican rank and file .
Gregg is presumably briefing fellow Republican Senators , while Dodd meets with Democratic Senators .
Paulson is probably on the phone with Robert Steele , his former deputy at Treasury who is now the head of Wachovia , cursing the fact that he has to deal with all this damned poliiticians while another U.S. bank teeters on the edge of failure .
The meeting is scheduled to resume within an hour .
Earlier : Negotiations over the Wall Street bailout proposal continue this afternoon on Capitol Hill .
After the staffers worked through most the night , leading Republicans and Democrats say they hope to arrive at an agreement by tomorrow for a vote on Monday .
It is increasingly likely , however , that markets around the world will open with only the promise of a bailout agreement but without actual legislative approval .
Here ’s a rundown of recent developments .
Last Night Was A Late One On Capitol Hill .
The Congress was supposed to adjourn , with lawmakers heading home to campaign for re-election .
Instead , staffers worked through the night and Senators and House members are meeting this afternoon .
Senate staffers worked until 3 am , while House staffers knocked off before 2 am .
John McCain returned from his Oxford , Mississippi debate against Barack Obama at 4:30 am .
He ’s expected to take part in negotiations today but will stay behind the scenes , away from Capitol Hill at his Arlington , VA campaign headquarters .
Closer My Bailout To Thee ?
The bitter partisan fighting that broke out late last week has been tempered and its dimensions have changed .
Let ’s review the politics so far .
Democrats lard bailout with leftist earmarks .
Originally , Democrats reacted to the Treasury Department ’s demand for a simple grant of unchecked authority to expend $ 700 billion to rescue financial institutions by attaching a number of restrictions as well as pet projects to the proposal .
Two of these were regarded as poison pills by the Republicans — namely , the requirement that the government use profits from the sale of securities to fund what the GOP regard as left - wing housing groups and broadening judicial discretion to modify mortgages in bankruptcy cases to make things easier for debtors .

Pro-Labor Provisions .
Some pro-labor Democrats also began maneuvers to include a role for organized labor in the oversight of the financial firms benefiting from the bailout .
Labor unions would be guaranteed seats on the independent oversight board and seats of corporate boards of firms taking government money , positions which would empower them to make demands on the management of financial institutions .
These could include restrictions on financing corporate buyouts that result in layoffs , pro-labor covenants in credit agreements and a host of other things on the labor union wish - list that have largely been defeated in the now ailing ‘ shareholder democracy ’ movement .

Fear of a Democratic Bailout .
The Democrats , who control both the House and the Senate , could have passed their bill without a single Republican vote .
A filibuster was never in the cards , and Bush would likely have signed the bill into law despite the objectionable Democratic additions .
Democrats , however , knew the bailout is very unpopular with voters — recent polls show only 30 % support for the bailout — and feared passing it without Republican support .
If the rescue plan failed , it could be blamed on the Democrats .
If it worked , the public might still continue to regard it as an unconscionable subsidy — a bailout for billionaires .

Republicans See An Opening .
Republican lawmakers saw little political upside to supporting the legislation , especially since Democrats such as Barney Frank and Chris Dodd were poised to claim credit for any success of the bailout .
At best , Republicans would simply provide political cover for the Democrats while gaining nothing .
On the other hand , opposing the bailout put the Republicans in the enviable position of siding with “ Main Street ” against “ Wall Street . ”
For a party often accused of being the handmaiden of “ big business ” this was irresistible .

Free -Market Objections .
Republicans had more than cold political calculation at stake in considering whether to support the bailout .
It offended free - market types who fear the government assistance could deepen the financial crisis by further obscuring market pricing processes .
Many also believed that the bailout would set a precedent for further bailouts of the automakers , airlines and troubled manufacturers .
The bailout itself seemed to lend credence to the Democratic position that markets cannot operate efficiently without strong government oversight and support .
With the addition of the Democrat 's favorite provisions to the bill , Republican resistance grew .

A Choice Not An Echo .
Despite all this , Republicans were still fearful of being seen as the “ Just Say No ” party .
Many remembered the party being blamed for shutting down the government in 1995 — although , contrary to media report , the government continued to function throughout the affair — and feared being blamed for shutting down the financial system .
Eric Cantor , the number three Republican in the House , proposed a Republican alternative to the bailout — offering government insurance for troubled mortgage based assets in exchange for a fee from financial firms .

Bush Faces The Nation .
George Bush ’s decision to deliver a national address on the bailout was largely intended to alleviate Democratic fear of being credit or blamed entirely for the bailout .
Bush was essentially writing the Democrats a CYA mash - note by addressing the nation .
What ’s more , Democrats believed that Republican resistance would wither with George Bush as the public face of the bailout .
They underestimated the depth of ill - will towards the lame - duck Bush administration among many Republican lawmakers , however .
The next morning , Republicans on Capitol Hill began to show signs they were n’t going to go along with the Democrat and White House proposal .

A Democratic Clawback Propsoal .
Conservative Democrats on Capitol Hill added confusion to the mix by proposing that the bailout include a right for the Treasury to “ recoup ” any losses from buying troubled assets from financial firms .
Firms that sell loss - making assets to the Treasury would be subject to a 2 % recoupment tax .
This proposal does not have widespread report , and would probably make any financial firm hesitant to participate in the plan .
From a shareholder perspective , it would create a ongoing risk of 2 % drag on after - tax earnings .
It would be a short - seller ’s dream , as the shorts worked to figure which firms were more likely to get hit by the penalty .

A False Start Consensus .
Democrats rushed to avoid Republican maneuvers against the deal that had been worked out between themselves and the White House by announcing a bipartisan consensus .
The Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House initially appeared to support this agreement , only backing away when they realized the depth of the opposition among the rank - and - file .

The Return of John McCain .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain ’s return to Washington DC played a critical role in derailing the proposal .
The political calculation was all too apparent to the McCain campaign .
He encouraged fellow Republicans to drop their support for the bailout .
The plan , from the beginning , was to have the Republicans appear to defeat the “ Wall Street bailout ” and yet still rescue Wall Street with a plan originated by Republicans .

A Partisan Call For Bipartisanship .
This lead to the odd situation late in the week , with Democrats siding with the Bush administration .
Democrats found themselves giving voice to bitter partisan attacks on Republican lawmakers and John McCain .
Republicans bristled at being pushed to accept the bill , and the Republican leadership grew angry at not being shown the proper amount of deference by Democrats and the Senate .
Increasingly the Republicans responded that if the Democrats wanted this so bad , they should just vote for the bailout without Republican support .

Republicans Return To The Table .
On Friday , Republicans began to receive polling data indicating that perhaps they had gone too far in their resistance .
The fear of being blamed for the failure to rescue the financial system was becoming a reality .
Republicans decided to return to the negotiating table while also mounting a public relations campaign to persuade voters that they were rescuing the rescue with a bill that would better protect taxpayers .
Roy Blunt , the number two Republican in the House , was assigned to lead negotiations .
Although there was talk of reaching an agreement by midnight on Friday , that was never in the cards .
No agreement would be possible before Saturday night , at the earliest , most involved believed .

A Day Of Bipartisanship .
Staffers worked deep into the night on Capitol Hill last night , and the talk was mainly friendly .
All sides had been given orders to work toward a deal , hopefully one that could be announced on “ Paulson time ” — that is , before the Asian markets opened Sunday night .
Today , the elected officials — in Beltway speak they call them “ the principals ” — began meeting to put together a final proposal .

Republican Senators Pressure House Members .
Remarks from Republican Senators today appeared to be an attempt to pressure House Republicans into supporting the bailout , an indication that the Republican rank - and - file resistance continues .
Earlier today , Senator Robert Bennett gave dire warnings about the likely failure of another bank if a bailout is proposed immediately .
His words are being interpreted as an effort to pressure holdout Republicans in the House to come around to a deal .
New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg also made dire predictions about financial crisis hitting early next week if an agreement on a bailout is not reached .

Democrats Accept Insurance Proposal But GOP Still Balks .
As we reported earlier this afternoon , Democrats appear to have agreed to include the Republican insurance proposal first put forth by Eric Cantor .
This seems to have left the Republicans dissatisfied , however .
The Democrats would allow the insurance as an option for the Treasury Department while the conservative members in the House want the insurance proposal to be at the core of the bailout .
So where do things stand now ?
First , the authority to buy troubled assets — the Troubled Assets Relief Program — remains at the heart of the proposal .
Instead of a blank check for $ 700 billion , however , Capitol Hill is prepared to issue funds in increments .
It seems likely that there will be a initial tranche of $ 350 billion , followed by another tranche of $ 250 billion which would be issued automatically unless both the Senate and the House call for a halt .
The final $ 100 billion would require affirmative approval by congress .
At each step , lawmakers will maintain oversight and the right to prevent the next increment .
From the perspective of financial firms , the incremental process will add uncertainty .
From the perspective of lobbying firms , it will be a bonanza .
Congress will maintain oversight of the program , requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to regularly brief lawmakers on the bailout .
An independent inspector general is likely as well .
The government will apparently be authorized to take equity stakes in firms taking the bailout .
This will give the government some upside security in buying troubled assets .
If firms make windfall profits by selling bad assets at above market prices , the government will benefit as well .
This could , however , drive away shareholders who would face even more dilution .
Executives may feel pressure to signal that they will not participate in any asset sales granting the government equity , which could sap the effectiveness of the bailout and increase systemic risk .
Ironically , the least workable provision under consideration enjoys the most widespread support .
We ’re talking , of course , about executive compensation limits .
Both Republicans and Democrats , conservatives and liberals , support the proposal to limit executive pay for firms that participate in the bailout .
How to reach such limits remains a bit of a mystery , with some lawmakers giving discretionary authority to the Treasury Department to judge whether compensation is “ excessive . ”
If this provision winds up mostly symbolic and toothless , that would be for the best .
Serious limits on compensation would result in most firms declining to take part in the bailout .
The Democrats have apparently agreed to include Eric Cantor ’s insurance plan in the bailout but Republican House members continue to push for more .
The Democrats imagine giving this as one option for the Treasury Department to use .
Republicans fear it will be shelved .
The insurance program forms the core of Republican plans to claim credit for creating an improved bailout that protects taxpayer interests .
Democrats appear to have dropped their plans to fund left - wing housing activist groups , modify bankruptcy laws or mandate union seats on boards of directors .
Phew .
We ’ll keep you posted as we hear more .
LET ’S say you and your spouse have n’t had sex in so long that you ca n’t remember the last time you did .
Not the day .
Not the month .
Maybe not even the season .
Would you look for gratification elsewhere ?
Would you file for divorce ?
Or would you turn to your mate and say , “ Honey , you know , I ’ve been thinking .
Why do n’t we do it for the next 365 days in a row ? ”
That ’s more or less what happened to Charla and Brad Muller .
And in another example of an erotic adventure supplanting married ennui , a second couple , Annie and Douglas Brown , embarked on a similar , if abbreviated journey : 101 straight days of post - nuptial sex .
Both couples document their exploits in books published this month , the latest entries in what is almost a mini - genre of books offering advice about the “ sex - starved marriage . ”
The couples , though , are hardly similar .
The Mullers are Bible - studying steak - eating Republicans from Charlotte , N.C. The Browns are backpacking multigrain northerners who moved to Boulder , Colo .
The Mullers ’ book , “ 365 Nights , ” is rather modest and circumspect in its details .
The Browns ’ book , “ Just Do It , ” almost makes the reader feel part of a threesome , sharing everything they used to stimulate sexual desire ( it ’s hard to visualize and even harder to explain ) .
To many spouses , “ married sex ” may sound like an oxymoron .
And “ married - with - children sex ” may sound like that elusive antimatter .
Indeed , reigniting a couple ’s desire for each other has fueled an entire therapeutic industry  from Kinsey to Dr. Ruth to Redbook .
According to a 2004 study , “ American Sexual Behavior , ” by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , married couples have intercourse about 66 times a year .
But that number is skewed by young marrieds , as young as 18 , who couple , on average , 109 times a year .
Question number one for any v.p. vetter should be :
Are you involved in any scandals ?
And , the second question is :
Who is your legal counsel for that scandal ?
It ’s hard to understand how the McCain campaign ignored the answer to question number one — if it was ever even asked of Sarah Palin , who is involved in a major scandal .
The answer to question number two should have raised some eyebrows .
She did n’t even have a lawyer in a case that could ultimately result in impeachment — until recently .
The Anchorage Daily News broke that news late today :
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — Republican John McCain ’s pick for vice president — now has a private lawyer representing her and others in the governor ’s office in an investigation into the firing of her public safety commissioner .
John McCain keeps touting Palin ’s reform credentials — starting with her courageous work at the PTA .
Will Sarah Palin cooperate with the investigation — or will Palin , the McCain campaign and her new lawyer try to stonewall the investigation ?
Real reformers answer questions , I ’d say .
More from the ADN :
[ Special Counsel Steve ] Branchflower is still trying to interview Palin .
He made a request on Thursday morning , but has n’t heard back .
Palin was in Arizona with McCain on Thursday talking to him about the vice president ’s slot .
McCain announced on Friday in Ohio that Palin was his pick .
“ Clearly the Governor ’s new political role will make it more challenging for her to make time for this investigation , ” [ State Senator Hollis ] French wrote .
“ Nevertheless , her repeated promises to cooperate fully with the investigation , as well as statements that her new role as the Republican vice presidential nominee will not interfere with the day - to - day functioning of state business , should result in a concrete willingness to schedule and conclude her deposition . ”
This is a test for McCain .
Remember , John McCain had six months to pick a running mate .
This was the most important decision McCain has made so far .
He had plenty of time to think it through and vet the potential picks .
Instead , McCain made a rash , uninformed , impulsive choice .
With each passing hour , the McCain campaign ’s claims of thorough vetting sound less and less plausible .
Again , McCain had six months to get this right , but his campaign was too busy bashing Obama to worry about important matters like choosing the person who could potentially be a leader of the free world .
Reckless .
Impulsive .
Erratic .
That ’s the kind of leadership McCain would give America .
McCain is willing to gamble with our safety and security .
This whole mess really is about John McCain .
( But , as so many pundits and reporters noted on Friday , McCain did “ win ” the media for the day .
Look where that got him . )
PRINCETON , NJ -- The Sept. 14-16 Gallup Poll Daily tracking update shows Barack Obama regaining a slight , although not statistically significant , edge over John McCain , 47 % to 45 % , among registered voters , marking the first time since the week of the Republican National Convention that McCain has not held at least a one percentage point margin over Obama .
From a broad perspective , the race remains a statistical tie .
But there has been a general drift towards Obama since McCain moved to a five - point lead over Obama through the weekend after the GOP convention .
Today 's report includes two days of interviewing conducted after reports of the collapse of Wall Street financial institutions and changes in the stock market began to dominate the news on Monday .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking data show that in each of these individual days ( Monday and Tuesday ) consumer ratings of the U.S. economy have become more negative .
Similarly , in each of these individual days ' interviewing , Obama has led McCain in election tracking .
There is thus a correlation between the bad financial news and Obama 's gains , although the data do not allow us to conclude definitively that there is a causal connection between the two .
Throughout the campaign , Obama has generally held an edge over McCain when voters are asked who could best handle the U.S. economy , although McCain gained on the economic dimension in polling conducted immediately after the GOP convention .

It is also worth noting that Gallup tracking shows the percentage of Americans who report being happy without a lot of stress has now fallen to the lowest level measured this year .

TOKYO  Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda announced on Monday night that he would resign , abruptly ending his chronically unpopular government after just a year and leaving Japan ’s governing party scrambling to find fresh leadership ahead of crucial national elections .
Mr. Fukuda ’s surprise announcement , made at a hastily called news conference , startled Japan and appeared to plunge the world ’s second largest economy into further political confusion .
Last year , Mr. Fukuda ’s predecessor , the rightist Shinzo Abe , made an equally sudden resignation .
Mr. Fukuda ’s decision was particularly unexpected because he took office last September as a veteran political insider widely counted on , after Mr. Abe ’s hasty departure , to bring stability and restore the Liberal Democratic Party ’s tarnished credibility .
In the end , Mr. Fukuda , 72 , lasted about as long as Mr. Abe , roughly a year .
His resignation was also surprising to many because it came just a month after he had reshuffled his cabinet , and just days after he unveiled a $ 17 billion economic stimulus package .
The province 's Special Investigation Unit has " lost its way " and needs to be completely overhauled if it hopes to be an effective police watchdog agency , according to Ontario 's ombudsman .
Andre Marin released a scathing review on the SIU Tuesday afternoon , telling reporters the agency is a " toothless tiger " and " muzzled watchdog " that suffers from a faulty infrastructure , a lack of resources and a mandate that lacks clarity .
He slammed the civilian group for keeping their reports from public view and said SIU officials are being kept on a short leash by the ministry of the attorney general .
In addition , investigators with the SIU -- many of them former police officers -- are loyal to a " police culture " that has no place in the agency , he said .
" We need to root out the police culture among the staff , " he said .
" The wearing of police rings by SIU investigators should not be tolerated .
Some of them wore the rings in interviews with us . "
The SIU , a provincial body that is called in to probe incidents where civilians are gravely or fatally injured in the presence of police officers , has responded favourably to the ombudsman 's recommendations , Marin said .
However , he said the SIU has so far only made " vague " commitments , " he added .
" I will be watching closely , because the SIU 's commitments were couched in vague and vapid generalities , while the ministry 's promise to consult with Ontarians on new legislation was rather amorphous . "
The SIU has not commented publicly on the report .
Investigative mistakes
Among the more serious accusations Marin made against the SIU is that the agency 's detectives often bungled investigations .
The law states that police must notify the SIU instantly if a civilian is injured in their presence .
Marin 's review found that often times the SIU was being called in more than an hour after the incident occurred .
" Any investigator will tell you that the first hour is crucial in any investigation , " said Marin .
" Police rarely notify the SIU as quickly as is mandated by law .
The SIU fails to respond with rigour and intensity . "
Marin said it is impossible to know if the outcomes of SIU probes would have been different if the investigation had been conducted in a proper way .
" There may have and there may not have ( been different outcomes ) but the mistakes throughout the investigative process are so glaring that it 's impossible for us to know if they made a mistake in the outcome , " he said .
Marin , who once headed the SIU , said he began his review of the agency after he noticed an increasing number of complaints .
There were 46 recommendations in his report .
Among them is a request to make police co-operation with the SIU mandatory through legislation .
He also recommends that the SIU investigate why the police have routinely not co-operated with the agency 's regulations .
" The SIU has become so timid and fearful in its watchdog job role , that police oversight has hit rock bottom in Ontario , " Marin said as he released the report .
" It has preferred to focus its energy on an introspective , esoteric , pie - in - the - sky journey that has little to do with holding police accountable . "
For all of you out there that use the Internet for that comfortable veil of anonymity to post horrible things that you would be absolutely ashamed of saying in your everyday personal interactions , there are a few powerful people you may want to think twice about before you photoshop a giant purple pterodactyl giving Oprah a flyby mushroom stamp right on her awful forehead .

This guy of all guys is the easiest target .

What can you take from a man who has nothing to lose ?
He obviously gave up his soul long before the American Idol game .
Does anyone else find it ironic that this soulless sack if shit hosts a show where people compete to give their souls away for their fifteen minutes of fame .
This is what makes this guy so dangerous , in the year 2011 , when this guy snaps and goes on a three week meth binge , you do n't want to be on the wrong side of his 2008 mac book when he starts googling himself to remember the " Good Times . "
# 4 Scientologists
The wealthiest and most powerful celebrities unite with the idea that the great master alien Xenu killed millions of people by dropping them in various volcanoes around the earth and then releasing hydrogen bombs on top of them just in case the fucking volcano did n't do the trick .
Now these poor ancient alien souls are trying to fuck our shit up .
In order to shake the 2,000 souls that cloud your judgement and make your starbucks barista give you whole milk instead of non-fat , you have to go through various levels of costly and lengthy audit sessions .
Why did n't I think of this shit ?
These people are obviously bat shit crazy .
Numerous stories abound on the internet of people getting fired from their jobs for having anti-scientology sites , or websites being shut down all together for various legal reasons .
These guys have the money , numbers , and the desire to bring down all those that oppose the MIGHTY XENU !

# 1 Oprah Winfrey
We all realize at this point that Oprah is one of the most influential people in America today .
Her opinions infect millions of her loyal housewives that watch her TV show , or read her magazine , or watch her whole fucking television channel , or listen to her whole fucking XM radio channel .
Does this bitch know how to network or what ?
The fact that she has completely infiltrated all of our major communications systems is not what we should be worried about here .
What we should be afraid of is those deep , horrible skeletons she has hiding in her closet .
The day those babies rear their ugly head , total apocalypse .
Why does n't the media ever have anything negative to say about Oprah .
Because Oprah does n't fuck around .
You bring me down , motherfucker , we all go down .
Oprah 's got her finger on the button and she 's just waiting for you to say something .
Do it , she wants you to .
Pussy .
That 's like taking a long hard look into The Bucket Of Truth and I do n't think any of you have the cojones to handle pure unmitigated , unadulterated , immutable truth .
Your cart is empty .
Meaningless .
It currently has no purpose .
As summer vacation ends and children head back to class , they might need a new school supply : face masks .
About one third of American schools are within an “ air pollution danger zone ” near major highways and the pollutants that stream from cars and trucks , a new study finds .
Previous research , including the UC Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study ( CCAAPS ) , has shown that exposure of school - age children to traffic pollutants near main roads is associated with a greater risk of developing asthma and other respiratory problems later in life .
" This is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development , transportation planning and environmental policies , " said study leader Sergey Grinshpun of the University of Cincinnati .
Other research has also shown that children are exposed to pollution on school buses and that one way to reduce their exposure is to stop idling the buses as they wait for their charges to board .
While past research on highway - related air pollution exposure has focused on residences , Grinshpun pointed out that children spend more than 30 percent of their day on school grounds .
For the new findings , Grinshpun 's team conducted a survey of major metropolitan areas from every large geographic region of the United States , including Atlanta , Boston , Denver , Philadelphia , Los Angeles and Minneapolis .
More than 8,800 schools representing 6 million students were included .
The study 's findings appear in the September issue of the Journal of Environmental Planning and Management .
The survey was funded by the UC Center for Sustainable Urban Engineering and the National Institute of Environmental Sciences .
Urban sprawl has contributed to the problem , as rapid expansion of metropolitan areas seems to be associated with building schools near highways , the researchers said .
Grinshpun and his colleagues advocate revising urban planning practices so that schools are built further away from highways .
California has already implemented such a law and New Jersey is currently considering legislation to move highway exit ramps further from schools .
In the meantime , " existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students ' exposure to traffic pollutants , " Grinshpun said .

While media accuses China of blacklisting sensitive information , censorship is taking place right here at home
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Monday , August 4 , 2008
While establishment media outlets in the UK spent most of last week reporting on China ’s censorship of political websites in anticipation of the Olympic games , they ignored the fact that London ’s St. Pancras International , one of the biggest transport hubs in the west , has already implemented stringent filters that block users of their wi-fi service from accessing even mildly political websites .
Traveling through St. Pancras in order to board the Eurostar on my way to Switzerland , I had an extra couple of hours that I thought I would fill by checking in on some of my favorite alternative news websites .
Upon clicking on my favorites menu and selecting prison planet.com , I was quickly met with a white screen and bold black text informing me that the website in question was blocked and could not be accessed .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Was this some kind of a technical error ?
No , as I was soon to discover that all websites affiliated with Alex Jones are blocked in St. Pancras .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Not only that , but even far milder left - leaning commentary websites like thinkprogress.org were on the same blacklist .
In fact , every non-mainstream news website was inaccessible .
By the way , when I visited Communist China last summer , which filters every website through a government blacklist , prison planet.com was not blocked and neither were any other English language alternative news websites .
Internet censorship of alternative news websites is worse in London than it is in Communist China .
The hypocrisy was painfully evident as I sat reading newspaper headlines about how evil China is for censoring anti-government material while London ’s biggest transport network , which recently underwent a £ 300 million regeneration , did exactly the same thing with not so much of a peep out of London ’s broadsheets or tabloids .
St. Pancras connects to Kings Cross station and the London Underground .
Perhaps it was our exposé of the fraud of the official story behind the 2005 London bombings that irked the censors , yet there is little explanation for also blocking a website like thinkprogress.org , which does n’t even cover UK - related issues .
This is another precursor to Internet 2 , where only government - approved websites that have obtained permission by means of an accepted registration application are allowed to be seen by web users .
It ’s also a stark reminder about how our media has diverted all attention concerning Internet censorship towards what is happening in China when the exact same control measures are being put in place right here at home .

Testing Your Approximate Number Sense
Humans use two distinct number systems , one learned and one intuitive .
Computation , such as taking a square root , is an abstract process that is uniquely human .
But the nonverbal process of approximating numbers is a system we share with infants and many other animals .

WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - Banks transferred funds out of the United States and into Europe in the first three months of 2008 as they turned to safer assets amid the global credit crunch , the Bank for International Settlements said .
“ In the first quarter of 2008 , reporting banks continued their net transfer of funds out of the United States , a trend evident since the onset of the financial turmoil in mid-2007 , ” the Swiss - based BIS said in its quarterly review of financial markets and banking activity , published on Monday .
It said European banks had cut dollar loans booked by their U.S. offices , resulting in a net outflow from those offices of $ 259 billion during the first quarter of year , following a net outflow of $ 238 billion during the second half of 2007 .
The BIS said banks stepped up their holdings in public sector debt , while their outstanding debt securities claims in the non -bank sector fell for the first time since 2001 .
“ This fall in debt securities claims seemed to coincide with a broader shift in bank balance sheets away from the U.S. non-bank private sector , at least for some banking systems , ” it said .
The New York Times
The New York Times outdid themselves with their beat down of John McCain and his campaign .
They have put out an excellent article about McCain and Team and their ties to the Gambling Industry .
Here are some excerpts .
Senator John McCain was on a roll .
In a room reserved for high - stakes gamblers at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut , he tossed $ 100 chips around a hot craps table .
When the marathon session ended around 2:30 a.m. , the Arizona senator and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings .
A lifelong gambler , Mr. McCain takes risks , both on and off the craps table .
He was throwing dice that night not long after his failed 2000 presidential bid , in which he was skewered by the Republican Party ’s evangelical base , opponents of gambling .
Mr. McCain was betting at a casino he oversaw as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , and he was doing so with the lobbyist who represents that casino , according to three associates of Mr. McCain .
This spellbinding piece talks about Indian gambling , its history , and the lobbying that went on .
The visit had been arranged by the lobbyist , Scott Reed , who works for the Mashantucket Pequot , a tribe that has contributed heavily to Mr. McCain ’s campaigns and built Foxwoods into the world ’s second - largest casino .
Joining them was Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s current campaign manager .
Their night of good fortune epitomized not just Mr. McCain ’s affection for gambling , but also the close relationship he has built with the gambling industry and its lobbyists during his 25 - year career in Congress .
As a two - time chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee , Mr. McCain has done more than any other member of Congress to shape the laws governing America ’s casinos , helping to transform the once - sleepy Indian gambling business into a $ 26 - billion - a - year behemoth with 423 casinos across the country .
He has won praise as a champion of economic development and self - governance on reservations .
“ One of the founding fathers of Indian gaming ” is what Steven Light , a University of North Dakota professor and a leading Indian gambling expert , called Mr. McCain .
It also tells the intriguing story of government , John McCain and his involvement .
As factions of the ferociously competitive gambling industry have vied for an edge , they have found it advantageous to cultivate a relationship with Mr. McCain or hire someone who has one , according to an examination based on more than 70 interviews and thousands of pages of documents .
Mr. McCain portrays himself as a Washington maverick unswayed by special interests , referring recently to lobbyists as “ birds of prey . ”
Yet in his current campaign , more than 40 fund - raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests – including tribal and Las Vegas casinos , lottery companies and online poker purveyors .
When rules being considered by Congress threatened a California tribe ’s planned casino in 2005 , Mr. McCain helped spare the tribe .
Its lobbyist , who had no prior experience in the gambling industry , had a nearly 20 - year friendship with Mr. McCain .
In Connecticut that year , when a tribe was looking to open the state ’s third casino , staff members on the Indian Affairs Committee provided guidance to lobbyists representing those fighting the casino , e-mail messages and interviews show .
The proposed casino , which would have cut into the Pequots ’ market share , was opposed by Mr. McCain ’s colleagues in Connecticut .
Of course , Tucker Bound ’s tries his best to protect McCain from the tangled webs he weaves .
Mr. McCain ’s spokesman , Tucker Bounds , would not discuss the senator ’s night of gambling at Foxwoods , saying : “ Your paper has repeatedly attempted to insinuate impropriety on the part of Senator McCain where none exists – and it reveals that your publication is desperately willing to gamble away what little credibility it still has . ”
But he has rarely wavered in his loyalty to Las Vegas , where he counts casino executives among his close friends and most prolific fund - raisers .
“ Beyond just his support for gaming , Nevada supports John McCain because he ’s one of us , a Westerner at heart , ” said Sig Rogich , a Nevada Republican kingmaker who raised nearly $ 2 million for McCain at an event at his home in June .
Only six members of Congress have received more money from the gambling industry than McCain , and five hail from the casino hubs of Nevada and New Jersey , according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics dating back to 1989 .
In the presidential race , Senator Barack Obama has also received money from the industry ; McCain has raised almost twice as much .
In May 2007 , as McCain ’s presidential bid was floundering , he spent a weekend at the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas strip .
A fund - raiser hosted by J. Terrence Lanni , the casino ’s top executive and a longtime friend of the senator , raised $ 400,000 for his campaign .
Afterward , McCain attended a boxing match and hit the craps tables .
That “ Maverick ” image is getting tarnished .
McCain was twice voted to give casinos tax breaks that are estimated to have cost the government over $ 326 million over the years .
The second tax break he gave casinos was a tribal casino called Foxwoods with the help of a Pequots ’ lobbyist by the name of Scott Reed .
I highly recommend you read the whole article by Jo Becker and Don Van Natta Jr. - they did a fantastic job of investigation on this piece .
It just proves that McCain really has n’t changed at all from the Keating 5 days .
He just tries to cover it up better …

The problem , according to David Freedman , a statistician at the University of California , Berkeley , who studies the design and analysis of medical studies , is not so much the differences that are known .
Instead , it is the differences that scientists are not aware of .
Cynthia Pearson , executive director of the National Women ’s Health Network , has a favorite example of how easy it is to be fooled .
Study after study found that women taking estrogen had less heart disease than women who did not .
But , Ms. Pearson says , it turns out that women who faithfully take any medication for years  even a sugar pill  are different from women who do n’t .
The compliant pill - takers tend to be healthier , perhaps because they follow doctor ’s orders .
So when scientists said they were comparing two equal populations , the estrogen users and the nonestrogen users , they may have actually been comparing the health of the sort of women who conscientiously take pills with that of the sort of women who do n’t or who do so less rigorously .
The advantage of randomized clinical trials is that you have to worry a lot less about whether your groups are alike .
You assign them treatments by the statistical equivalent of a toss of the coin , the idea being that differences among individuals will be randomly allocated in the groups .
Faithful pill takers will be as likely to show up in the beta carotene group , for example , as in the placebo group .
The second basic principle is that the bigger the group studied , the more reliable the conclusions .
That ’s because the real result of a study is not a single number , like a 20 percent reduction in risk .
Instead , it ’s a range of numbers that represent a so - called margin of error , like a 5 to 35 percent reduction in risk .
The larger the sample size , the smaller the margin of error .
Small studies have large uncertainties in results , making it difficult to know where the truth lies .
Also , in a small study , randomization may not balance things well .
The third principle , Dr. Goodman says , “ is often off the radar of even many scientists . ”
But it can be a deciding factor in whether a result can be believed .
It ’s a principle that comes from statistics , called Bayes ’ theorem .
As Dr. Goodman explains it ,
“ What is the strength of all the supporting evidence separate from the study at hand ? ”
A clinical trial that randomly assigns groups to an intervention , like beta carotene or a placebo , Dr. Goodman notes , “ is typically at the top of a pyramid of research . ”
Large and definitive clinical trials can be hugely expensive and take years , so they usually are undertaken only after a large body of evidence indicates that a claim is plausible enough to be worth the investment .
Supporting evidence can include laboratory studies indicating a biological reason for the effect , animal studies , observational studies of human populations and even other clinical trials .
But if one clinical trial tests something that is plausible , with a lot of supporting evidence to back it up , and another tests something implausible , the trial testing a plausible hypothesis is more credible even if the two studies are similar in size , design and results .
The guiding principle , Dr. Goodman says , is that “ things that have a good reason to be true and that have good supporting evidence are likely to be true . ”
Now she focuses on the pleasure of eating fresh , home - cooked food .
She has started cooking with olive oil and occasionally butter , and has increased her consumption of nuts and peanut butter .
She even got to know her grocer to find out which fruits and vegetables are in season and grown locally .
The market research firm NPD Group gets a glimpse of national eating habits through the food diaries it has collected from 5,000 consumers since 1980 .
The percentage of those consumers who are on a diet is lower than at any time since information on dieting was first collected in 1985 .
At the peak in 1990 , 39 percent of the women and 29 percent of the men were dieting .
Today , that number has dropped to 26 percent of women and 16 percent of men .
The diarists also report eating more organic foods and whole grains , said Harry Balzer , an NPD vice president .
“ Instead of trying to avoid things , they ’ve started adding things , ” Mr. Balzer said .
Even the Calorie Control Council , which represents makers of commercial diet foods , notes the percentage of people who are dieting has declined  to 29 percent in 2007 from 33 percent in 2004 .

And there are other indicators of a shift in eating habits .
In May , the market research firm Information Resources reported that 53 percent of consumers say they are cooking from scratch more than they did just six months ago , in part , no doubt , because of the rising cost of prepared foods .
Paul McDonald , who has been wonderful in working closely with me to make sure that the Singularity web site got up and running on Google App Engine last week , announced on the Google App Engine Blog on Thursday that they had released a new version of the Google App Engine SDK .
Version 1.1.1 includes several small updates and I just upgraded to it without issues .
That said , Issue 401 is still unpatched , so if you 're running Python 2.5 ( not 2.5.1 + ) , you will need to apply the patch .
Along with Thursday 's release , Google has also upped the number of applications that you can create with a single account to ten .
That 's great news .
Due to the 1,000 file / blob limit on projects , it makes sense to split your applications up over several different applications .
I actually like this limitation as it forces me to think more modularly about my applications .
For the new Singularity web site , for example , I set up opencountrycodes as an API for handling ISO Alpha - 2 country codes .
And I just added the FAMFAMFAM country flag icons to it .
There are 140 + flag images in there so it was causing the main app to reach its 1,000 file limit .
Now , anyone can access them from opencountrycodes ( e.g. , http://opencountrycodes.appspot.com/images/flags/gb.png = ) and my main app is nowhere near its file limit .
Ten applications give you 10,000 files to play with .
Which should be fine for most people ( and if you legitimately need more , well , you can always set up another account . )
The Google Appengine team has also improved the Dashboard usage graphs ( you can now zoom in to 24 , 12 , and 6 hour graphs ) and you can download your logs in plain text .
( This gives me hope that some sort of datastore backup may be next . )
Another huge change is that you can now send email as the currently - logged - in user .
Previously , you could only send email from the administrator account which was a severe limitation for any sort of social application .
OpenID time for App Engine ?
I have n't had a chance to see if Issue 404 and Issue 363 , which were reported as fixed in notes to the issue tracker and which are essential to getting OpenID to work on Google App Engine have been incorporated into this release .
If these fixes have been included , we should be able to get Appengine apps to consume OpenID .
Google has backed a venture to use satellites to bring high - speed Internet to three billion people in Africa and other developing markets around the equator .
Today Google announced a partnership with cable operator Liberty Global and bank HSBC .
Their partnership is called O3 b Networks —
O3 b stands for " other 3 billion , " a reference to the world 's population that still can't access the Internet [ The New York Times ] .
The group announced an order for 16 satellites as the first stage in the $ 750 million project , which will provide cheap , fast Internet access to companies that sell internet service via mobile phones or wireless networks .
The move is being greeted as a clever technological solution , a boon for the developing world , and a smart business move .
" Google has an interest in boosting the Internet all over the world to reach new masses , " said [ business analyst ] Wim Zwanenburg ....
" The growth market for Internet and mobile phones is in emerging countries " [ Bloomberg ] .
The satellites , which should be operational by the end of 2010 , will circle the globe in a relatively low orbit in order to speed data transmission time .
The satellite system avoids the problem of the lack of fiber optic cables in the developing world , where Internet companies have n't had a financial incentive to invest in such infrastructure .
Larry Alder , product manager in Google ’s alternative access group , said the [ satellite ] project could bring the cost of bandwidth in such markets down by 95 per cent [ Financial Times ] .
Internet access over satellite has a poor record - the speed of deployment has often seen ground - based alternatives surpass orbiting connection speeds ....
O3b is n't planning to cover the world , which simplifies things hugely , and its aggressive deployment schedule and targeted demographic means their service is unlikely to be supplanted by anything ground - based - so it just remains to be seen if the disconnected three billion really want high - speed data [ The Register ] .
Google has also patented the plans for a data center floating in the ocean , powered by wave action and / or wind power .

WASHINGTON 
More than 90 percent of nursing homes were cited for violations of federal health and safety standards last year , and for - profit homes were more likely to have problems than other types of nursing homes , federal investigators say in a report issued on Monday .
About 17 percent of nursing homes had deficiencies that caused “ actual harm or immediate jeopardy ” to patients , said the report , by Daniel R. Levinson , the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services .
Problems included infected bedsores , medication mix-ups , poor nutrition , and abuse and neglect of patients .
Inspectors received 37,150 complaints about conditions in nursing homes last year , and they substantiated 39 percent of them , the report said .
About one - fifth of the complaints verified by federal and state authorities involved the abuse or neglect of patients .

Philip Pullman has revealed he was delighted to discover his novel Northern Lights was one of the most " challenged " titles of the year in America , with numerous calls made to have it removed from libraries .
Pullman 's children 's novel , which is sold as The Golden Compass in the US , was the fourth most challenged book in 2007 , according to the American Library Association , which received 420 formally submitted complaints to libraries or schools over " inappropriate content and subject matter " last year .
Writing for theguardian.com this morning , Pullman said his immediate response on hearing the latest figures from the ALA was " glee " .
" Firstly , I had obviously annoyed a lot of censorious people , and secondly , any ban would provoke interested readers to move from the library , where they could n't get hold of my novel , to the bookshops , where they could , " Pullman said , pointing to previous objections to the film of The Golden Compass , which he said resulted in soaring book sales .
It 's a point given added weight by a promotion featuring censored books currently running at Borders bookshops .
According to one of the chain 's buyers , Rob Hughes , it has been " very successful " , generating considerable interest in books which have been banned around the world in the past .
" It 's a way of measuring the morals of today against those of yesterday , " he said , adding that Borders have no plans to include books by Philip Pullman in the promotion .
Northern Lights , the first in Pullman 's bestselling Dark Materials trilogy , came in on the ALA list behind Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell 's And Tango Makes Three , Robert Cormier 's The Chocolate War and Kevin Henkes ' Olive 's Ocean .
Northern Lights was challenged over its " religious viewpoint " , the ALA said .
Pullman said that banning a book on religious grounds was " the worst reason of the lot " .
" Religion grants its adherents malign , intoxicating and morally corrosive sensations .
Destroying intellectual freedom is always evil , but only religion makes doing evil feel quite so good , " he said .
This week marks the ALA 's 27th annual Banned Books Week , which sees libraries and bookshops across the US running events intended to raise awareness of book censorship .
It 's hard to take anthropogenic global warming seriously when so much of the bashing is directed at the country where the consequences of policies are actually moving in the direction desired by the critics :
... The G - 8 also agreed that any meaningful climate program would have to involve industrializing nations like China and India .
For the first time , too , the G - 8 agreed that real progress will depend on technological advancements .
And it agreed that the putative benefits had to justify any brakes on economic growth .
In other words , the G - 8 signed on to what has been the White House approach since 2002 .
The U.S. has relied on the arc of domestic energy programs now in place , like fuel - economy standards and efficiency regulations , along with billions in subsidies for low - carbon technology .
Europe threw in with the central planning of the Kyoto Protocol -- and the contrast is instructive .
Between 2000 and 2006 , U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions fell 3 % .
Of the 17 largest world - wide emitters , only France reduced by more .
So despite environmentalist sanctimony about the urgent need for President Bush and the U.S. to " take the lead " on global warming , his program has done better than most everybody else's .
That wo n't make the evening news ...
Here are two situations you have probably found yourself in if you ( a ) have a penis , and ( b ) are / were not in a fraternity :
Number one :
While at a friend 's generally lame party ( he just played Journey ) , you meet a girl who looks as bored as you .
She 's beautiful , and that smile !
Before long , you discover she not only likes football and your favorite team but also loves just about every band you 've got in your car 's six - disc CD changer at that very moment .
Convinced nothing could go wrong , you ask her what the last concert she went to was and , with an earnest smile , she answers , " Dave Matthews Band . "
You , of course , blink .
Then wait .
Then , with an awkward half - smirk , you ask , " You 're joking , right ? "
But she 's not , and at that point , this beautiful , once - perfect woman you wanted to elope with begins to tell you all the ways Dave Matthews has moved her .
That , in fact , his music is like an expression of her soul .
In other words , Dave Matthews knows her better than you ever could .
After a few minutes of this , you ask , " Do you want another beer ? " but slip out the back door and drive away .
Info Dave Matthews Band Cricket Wireless Pavilion Dave Matthews Band , and Robert Earl Keen are scheduled to perform on Saturday , August 23 .
Number two :
After 20 minutes of making out and serious groping , you 're fairly convinced you will have sex with your date tonight .
But then , just as you begin to work her shirt off , she springs to her feet , as if the most amazing idea just popped into her head .
You hope it involves rope and maybe butter ( but not hot wax ) .
Instead she asks , with unbridled enthusiasm , " Want to listen to some music ? "
When the acoustic guitar pours out of her speakers , your erection vanishes .
She begins dancing nevertheless .
She runs her hands over her sweater - wrapped breasts and hips , like a stripper might if she were stupid enough to perform to something Dave Matthews recorded .
Your erection actually begins to invert , if that 's possible .
After the song , she falls on top of you and declares that Dave Matthews gets her so fucking hot .
She wants to fucking fuck you , man .
You go on to try , but ca n't get Dave Matthews out of your head and , after 20 minutes of her twiddling with your flaccid member , agree it 's best you leave .
She later tells everyone you know about your " problem , " and you decide to move to another country that does n't care for Dave Matthews and his idea of music .
This is all Dave Matthews is good for : cock blocking .
Unless , of course , you wear a ball cap , shop at Abercrombie & Fitch , and belong to a fraternity .
If that 's the case , you love Dave Matthews because you 've figured out that , simply by bringing him up , college girls will have sex with you .
In fact , the scientific journal Nature Nature Nature discovered that 89 percent of all unwanted , beer - soaked college pregnancies were the result of Dave Matthews .
Another surprising revelation : Dave Matthews ' high - pitched , whiny voice was the soundtrack to 79 percent of all fraternity gangbangs .
Normal men , however , have morals .
Normal men know Dave Matthews ' music is like Milwaukee 's Best :
It sucks , but women can use it as an excuse to do whatever they want without feeling guilty later .
• 2008-09 predictions : East | West | Awards | Finals | Champs | Team Turmoil
When it comes to expansion and franchise movement in the NBA , there are two tracks to watch : domestic and international .
First , commissioner David Stern is considering a world plan that would place a five - team division in Europe within a decade .
Once the seven - hour leap ( non-supersonic transport ) across the Atlantic from the Eastern U.S. is made , then the road trip in Europe is not too arduous .
Seems feasible .
Then there 's the possibility of growth in the Americas .
Several cities , which were once home to NBA teams , are now looking for a second chance .
So which city is most likely to be a part of the NBA by 2018 ?
We asked 25 ESPN writers , editors and contributors that question .
( Experts were given the choice of answering " none " or naming one to five cities .
Three members of our panel saw no expansion at all in the next decade . )
Here 's how they voted :
Seattle ( 14 votes )
He'd be real happy if Seattle had a team again .

Pros :
The 14th - biggest TV market , home to a metropolitan area of over 4 million people and Bill and Melinda Gates ' billions .
An NBA city since 1967 , looking for a team that can hang those retired Gus Williams , Lenny Wilkens , Nate McMillan , Fred Brown , Jack Sikma and Spencer Haywood jerseys and the 1978 - 79 NBA championship banner .
Also working for Seattle is the prospect of lightening Thunder owner Clay Bennett 's pockets .
He and the other OKC owners will have to pay $ 30 million to Seattle in 2013 if Washington 's state legislature approves at least $ 75 million in public funding before 2010 to renovate KeyArena and Seattle does not obtain an NBA franchise by 2013 .
Cons : Local fans might need some time for tread marks on back to heal after the Sonics ' departure .
Building new arena to draw relocation or expansion team might be hard sell to local taxpayers who coughed up $ 74 million for a Key upgrade done in 1995 .
Sonics were in bottom 10 in attendance the last five seasons , though Key often averaged over 90 percent full .
David Stern says : " Given the lead times associated with any franchise acquisition or relocation and with a construction project as complex as a KeyArena renovation , authorization of the public funding needs to occur by the end of 2009 in order for there to be any chance for the NBA to return to Seattle within the next five years . "
Las Vegas ( 9 votes )
Pros : State - of - the - art 20,000 - seat venue to be built by arena giant Anschutz Entertainment Group planned for The Strip .
A growing market of 2 million residents , and a steady stream of people willing to part with their money .
City is the last temptation of Charles Barkley .
Cons : Mortgage crisis pummeling the locals .
Legal wagering on NBA games not remotely a deal - breaker , but in post - Donaghy world , a shadow of sorts .
Loving this game is just one of many entertainment options there .
City is the last temptation of Charles Barkley .
David Stern says : " We want Las Vegas to be a successful major league sports market .
The NBA Summer League has been very successful And we expect to continue to do business with Las Vegas across the board . "
London ( 4 votes )
Nets star Vince Carter shows the youth of London a thing or two about the game .

Pros :
What 's not to love ?

Jagdish Bhagwati is one of the world 's most distinguished economists .
Currently a university professor at Columbia , Mr. Bhagwati is a rare academic who has the great ability to communicate his ideas to a more general audience .
In works such as his recent book , " In Defense of Globalization , " Mr. Bhagwati has become famous as a persuasive and articulate proponent of expanding world trade to help improve the lot of the poor .
In " Termites in the Trading System , " Mr. Bhagwati argues that not all trade deserves our equal support , however , and mounts a brisk and spirited attack on preferential , so - called " free trade " agreements that are , in his view , leading the world trading system astray .
Wait a minute :
Are n't these agreements  such as NAFTA  almost invariably opposed by anti-trade groups precisely because they open up markets ?
Why is one of the world 's staunchest supporters of free trade protesting so passionately against this method of reducing trade barriers ?
The problem , Mr. Bhagwati shows , is that not all trade agreements are created equal .
The right way to reduce trade barriers , he explains , is on a multilateral basis and in a nondiscriminatory way .
After World War II , America led the world in creating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , which did just that , by encouraging the reduction of tariffs and liberalization of other import restrictions .
In recent years , however , countries have increasingly bypassed this system .
Now , it is common for two or more countries to agree to eliminate tariffs and reduce other trade barriers for each other , but not for others , as is the case with NAFTA .
Such agreements have been in vogue around the world , particularly with the current Bush administration : Under Bush , America has concluded a major trade agreement with Central American countries ( CAFTA ) and a series of bilateral agreements with countries ranging from Oman to Australia , and  most recently and controversially  Colombia .
The main problem with these bilateral and regional agreements is that they exclude other countries .
In Mr. Bhagwati 's view , they are more accurately called " preferential " trade agreements because they discriminate against non-participating countries .
This is a violation , Mr. Bhagwati suggests , of the principle of nondiscriminatory trade liberalization that served as the cornerstone of the tremendously successful post - World War II trading system under the GATT ( and now the WTO ) .
By introducing discriminatory treatment into the trading system , the movement toward preferential trade agreements sacrifices economic efficiency and , perhaps more troublingly , throws the carefully constructed postwar system into disorder .
Instead of having one common multilateral system , we now have a bewildering array of complex and overlapping bilateral and regional agreements , each with conflicting and contradictory provisions regarding trade in goods and services .
Mr. Bhagwati , always quick with an illuminating metaphor , has referred to this as the " spaghetti bowl " system , in which these agreements create a tangled mess of restrictions and regulations , ultimately disrupting rather than promoting free trade .
Thus , Mr. Bhagwati is by no means anti-trade or anti-trade agreements ; instead , he makes a strong case for opening trade much more aggressively at the multilateral level  with all - inclusive and nondiscriminatory agreements .
( Curiously , however , he says little about unilateral moves toward freer trade , a topic of great importance on which he has written elsewhere .
After all , if free trade is so good , countries should be willing to move in that direction by themselves without waiting for international cooperation . )
There is little doubt that Mr. Bhagwati is right in his preference for multilateral and universal agreements , but he does not resolve the problem faced by those who support free trade but lack his sophisticated and nuanced understanding of economics  and who may need to take a position on bilateral agreements that serve to promote certain kinds of trade but only by discriminating against others .
For example , how should one think about the America - Colombia Free Trade Agreement that is currently being held in the House of Representatives ?
Mr. Bhagwati would presumably oppose this preferential trade agreement on the principled grounds that it will have a small but corrosive effect on the multilateral WTO system .
But the main opponents object to it simply because they object to almost any measure to reduce trade barriers .
Should one join with the anti-trade left and oppose the agreement on the basis of Mr. Bhagwati 's arguments ?
Or should one support the agreement as a way of helping President Alvaro Uribe in his government 's efforts to strengthen the economy and fight the corrupting influence of drug lords and meddling by Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez ?
As the Colombian example suggests , many " free trade " agreements are motivated by foreign policy considerations .
Mr. Bhagwati writes that countries continue to pursue preferential trade agreements because there is " widespread intellectual failure to understand the critical distinction between freeing trade in discriminatory and nondiscriminatory ways , " and because politicians , he says , have an " imperviousness to reason . "
An alternative hypothesis is that politicians are not seeking to enhance economic efficiency or improve the world trading system , but have other , political objectives in mind .
In the end , Mr. Bhagwati concedes that " halting the formation of [ preferential trade agreements ] is no longer a possibility . "
He pins his hopes on mitigating their adverse effects on trade by reducing overall trade barriers to such an extent that preferences and discrimination do not matter all that much .
That in turn depends upon future unilateral efforts at trade liberalization and further progress at the WTO .
Mr. Bhagwati's concise book of just 100 pages of text should be read by all who care about the world trading system today .
" Termites " may be a bit challenging for those new to the trade policy debate , but it is written with a light touch , with many amusing stories , examples , and effective argumentation that make it , above and beyond its policy significance , a genuine pleasure to read .

An Alaskan reader writes :
Thanks for your thoughtful insights on our Governor -- you and a handful of responsible journalists have brought to light what many of us already knew and what the mainstream media in Alaska failed to cover .
If you want to dig more deeply into Sarah Palin 's economic theory -- or lack thereof -- I think you will find that while she espouses the free market , she has adopted a quasi- socialist and populist belief in the commons .
One of her champions is former Gov. Walter Hickel , who has argued that commonly owned resources should be developed for the maximum benefit of the people -- and that this system of economic organization represents a new paradigm for states and nations .
The Register reporter Steve Goddard is admitting today that his article last week on melting Arctic Sea Ice ( Arctic ice refuses to melt as ordered ) is incorrect .
Too bad the damage has already been done .
In his article , Goddard claimed that National Snow and Ice Data Center plot of Arctic Sea Ice Extent was wrong and that ,
“ The Arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by NSIDC and the Norwegian Polar Year Secretariat .
It did n't even come close .
Additionally , some current graphs and press releases from NSIDC seem less than conservative .
There appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to Arctic ice loss . ”
Today , Goddard is retracting the claim :
“ … it is clear that the NSIDC graph is correct , and that 2008 Arctic ice is barely 10 % above last year - just as NSIDC had stated . ”
But as Joe Romm at ClimateProgress points out it may be too little too late .
Goddard 's article has already caught fire in the climate denier - sphere with over 70 references to the story according to blog search engine Technorati , with titles like :
Arctic Ice Grows 30 Per Cent In a Year
The Global Warming
Theory takes a hit
Fishy Data From the Government
Here ’s another installment about the silliness of “ global warming ” as posited by politicians and “ environmentalists ” .
Cooking the Books to Cook the Ice
Global Warming is about global government and depopulation
Unless Goddard , or intrepid DeSmog readers , have the time to go out and urge bloggers to correct this latest misinformation , it will be popping up as yet another false piece of information on the true state of our planet and the realities of global warming for some time to come .
And as the old adage goes , “ If you repeat something long enough it eventually becomes true . ”

Students that receive notices from the RIAA accusing them of illegal filesharing do n't have many options .
Innocent or not , their choices are limited to either paying the $ 3000 - $ 5000 settlement , or going to court — where the RIAA 's deep pockets guarantee an outrageously expensive legal battle .
But universities themselves do have ways to fight the RIAA 's strong arm tactics , and more and more of them are choosing to quietly fight back .
The Chronicle of Higher Education reports this week that schools are growing resentful of the constant stream of pre-litigation letters from the RIAA , and the costly investigations that come with them :
Responding to RIAA notices used to be part - time work for one person , said William C. Dougherty , assistant director for systems support at Virginia Tech .
" Now he 's doing it full time and has an assistant , " he said .
" Our attorneys are also involved on almost a daily basis , as am I . "
The article describes several ways universities are resisting the RIAA .
Some are refusing to forward the RIAA 's letters to students , claiming that doing so conflicts with their responsibilities under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act .
Others are trying to quash subpoenas for the identity of students linked with a given IP address by claiming such requests place an " undue burden " on the school .
These shifts in policy , made with little fanfare or press coverage , are commendable .
But it would have been better if schools had avoided getting entangled in the RIAA 's losing battle from the start .
As the Chronicle article notes , the RIAA response to university non-cooperation is to cite earlier willingness to forward pre-litigation letters and respond to subpoenas .
As EFF 's Senior Staff Attorney Fred Von Lohmann wrote in an editorial way back in 2003 , universities would be better off if they refused to keep track of IP numbers :
Campus computer networks ... do not have to keep track of who has what IP number at any given time .
By properly configuring their campus networks , colleges and universities can shuffle IP numbers among different individuals on a regular basis , a common practice among ISPs .
That way , when the subpoena arrives , the administrators can honestly say that they have no identifying information to provide .
Institutions of higher education have an important job , and that job is to educate their students — not to play along with the RIAA 's intimidation game .
By protecting their students ' privacy , universities can focus on their mission and avoid the unnecessary headaches and legal problems that the recording industry seems bent on creating .
A time capsule of the greatest financial mania in the history of mankind , told in real - time by regular folks and patriots .

Some of the most important issues of the 2008 Presidential campaign revolve around alternative energy and breaking our dependence on foreign oil .
Â
Thanks to our current energy crunch , Americans have had to deal with much higher prices for gasoline and energy , and are likely to face record high heating bills this winter .
On top of the economic pain , it ’s hard to deny that the green movement is in full effect .
Â
Since it ’s pretty hard to deny the link between our use of fossil fuels and our current environmental problems – most notably , global warming – an alternative energy plan predicated on carbon neutral resources is extremely important to a lot of voters .
So , which candidate won over the most Americans with his energy plan ?
Â
Right now , it ’s kind of hard to tell .
According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , most Americans are torn over whether either , neither , or both Presidential candidates will be able to implement a solid alternative energy plan .
Here ’s how over 200 readers responded when asked :
Do you think either Presidential candidate will implement an effective alternative energy policy ? :
42 % believe only Obama will be able to do so
will be able to do so 27 % believe neither candidate will be able to do so
will be able to do so 24 % believe only McCain will be able to do so
will be able to do so 7 % believe both candidates will be able to do so
The most likely reason Obama has such as large “ lead ” in this poll is because of the fact McCain was a very early and adamant proponent of offshore drilling as a means to help ease the current energy crunch .
Â
On the flip side , Obama has been relatively critical of offshore drilling , and has said that we would be better off not drilling and just making sure our tires are properly inflated .
While this might seem like a relatively small thing , because it was one of the first times the candidates clashed over energy , it has sort of resonated with voters ever since .
In an effort to shed a little more light on each candidate ’s energy plan , I ’ve listed some key points for their plans :
BARACK OBAMA’S ENERGY PLAN :
Enact a windfall tax on Big Oil , and use money to provide an Energy Rebate to Americans
Get 1 million plug - in hybrids on the road by 2015 , and provide a tax credit for buying these cars
Ensure 25 % of our energy comes from clean , renewable sources by 2025
Implement cap programs aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions 80 % by 2050
Click here to see a full breakdown of Obama ’s energy plan .
JOHN MCCAIN’S ENERGY PLAN :
Expand domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production
Focus on wholesale reform of the transportation sector , and enforce current CAFE standards
Expand “ clean coal ” programs , and build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030
Implement programs aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions by 66 % by 2050
Click here to see a full breakdown of McCain ’s energy plan .
Each plan has pros and cons , so if this is an important issue for you regarding who gets your vote this November , please take advantage of every opportunity to do more research .
Two hours of surveillance video showed no contact at between undercover NYPD officers and the four men they had arrested on drug charges .
( CBS )
NEW YORK ( CBS ) ―
Undercover police officers who arrested four men on drug charges are under investigation after surveillance video proved the men they arrested committed no crime .
Drug charges against brothers Jose Colon and Maximo Colon , along with two of their friends have been dropped .
The undercover NYPD officers are seen on video dancing in the street , then attempting to frame four innocent men .
" I asked police officer why are you arresting me , " said Maximo Colon .
" Never did I get an answer . "
The investigators swore under oath they bought drugs from the four men .
Jose and Maximo colon say that did n't happen .
" The cops are supposed to help us , " said a shaken Jose Colon .
Defense lawyers say the surveillance cameras proved their clients were framed .
" It was nauseating , " said defense lawyer Rochelle Berliner .
Two hours of video showed no contact at all between the four men arrested and undercover officers - proof that lead prosecutors to drop charges against the four men , and even declare in court the men did not commit the crime .
Defense lawyers say it 's disturbing but not uncommon .
" As defense attorneys you know it exists more often than government wants you to believe , " said Brad Wolk .
In the 6 months it took to clear the Colon brothers names , they lost their business and their savings .
As a result of his ordeal , Maximo Colon has lost trust in police officers .
The two men are now involved in a civil suit against the city and hope to one day rebuild their lives .
The NYPD is investigating the officers involved in this incident .
Two of the officers are reportedly on modified duty .

New Economist says big day for co-op fans :
For Chris Dillow and other advocates of employee ownership , the last few days have been heady indeed .
On Saturday it was revealed that the boards of the UK's two biggest co-operatives have agreed the terms of a merger that would form the world 's largest consumer co-operative group , with a combined workforce of more than 87,000 staff and more than 4,500 sites .
On Sunday The Observer reported that John Lewis plans massive expansion :
John Lewis Partnership is embarking on a highly aggressive expansion strategy which will see the employee - owned business create 35,000 new jobs and double its turnover to £ 12bn .
... A 10 - year business plan , signed off by the partnership board in recent days , will see the retail concern boost its total workforce to 100,000 by 2017 .
The plan envisages John Lewis significantly increasing its 26 department stores and 184 Waitrose supermarkets .

DALIAN , China --
Eight years ago , Lopez Lomong did n't even have a country .
Now he 'll be carrying the flag for his adopted nation , leading the U.S. Olympic team at opening ceremonies Friday night .
Lomong , one of the Lost Boys of Sudan , won a vote of team captains Wednesday to earn the honor of leading America 's contingent into the 90,000 - seat Bird 's Nest Stadium .
The 1,500 - meter track runner will be the flagbearer only 13 months after becoming a U.S. citizen .
" It 's more than a dream , " Lomong said in an interview with The Associated Press moments after he got the news .
" I keep saying , I 'm not sure if this is true or not true .
I 'm making the team and now I 'm the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag .
There are no words to describe it . "
He was born in Sudan , separated from his parents at the point of a gun at age 6 , and with the help of friends , he escaped confinement and made it to a refugee camp in Kenya .
In 2001 , he was brought to America as part of a program to relocate lost children from war - torn Sudan .
Earlier this week , Lomong , 23 , said he was mounting a campaign to be nominated by the track and field team for the flagbearer 's position .
He said the honor would be memorable , but he also was thrilled to be part of the democratic process that might get him there .
" In America , everyone has a chance to do all these things , " Lomong said .
" You follow the rules , people will choose , and if I 'm blessed to get that opportunity , I 'll get it . "
In 2004 , Dawn Staley did the flagbearer 's honors .
In 2000 , they went to kayaker Cliff Meidl , who survived a 30,000 - volt jolt of electricity in a construction accident and became an Olympian .
Lomong 's story is every bit as inspiring .
Lopez Lomong came to America in 2001 as one of the Lost Boys of Sudan .
Seven years later , he 'll carry the Stars and Stripes into the Olympics opening ceremony .

He knew nothing of the Olympics in 2000 , when his friends at the refugee camp in Kenya talked him into running five miles and paying five shillings to watch Michael Johnson on a black - and - white TV set with a fuzzy screen .
At that point , Lomong knew he wanted to be an Olympic runner .
He earned his spot at the Olympic trials on July 6 , exactly one year after he gained his U.S. citizenship .
All three Americans in the 1,500 are naturalized citizens -- Lomong , Bernard Lagat ( Kenya ) and Leo Manzano ( Mexico ) .
" I feel great , " Lomong said Wednesday night .
" I feel happy , honored .
I 'm feeling so blessed to get an opportunity to present the United States of America , to present the United States flag in front of my team . "
A new recycling plant will soon recover uranium from the ashes of radioactive garbage to be recycled back into nuclear fuel using an efficient , environmentally friendly technology inspired by decaffeinated coffee .
The technique ’s future may even hold the key to recycling the most dangerous forms of radioactive waste .
Over the course of 20 years , Chien Wai , a University of Idaho chemistry professor , has developed a process that uses supercritical fluids to dissolve toxic metals .
When coupled with a purifying process developed in partnership with Sydney Koegler , an engineer with nuclear industry leader AREVA and University of Idaho alumnus , enriched uranium can be recovered from the ashes of contaminated materials .
On Wednesday , Aug. 20 , representatives from the company and the university will sign an agreement to share the technologies and pave the way for the recycling plant ’s construction .
“ Radioactive waste is a big problem facing the United States and the entire world , ” said Wai .
“ We need new , innovative technology , and I think supercritical fluid is one such technology that will play an important role in the very near future . ”
A supercritical fluid — in this case carbon dioxide — is any substance raised to a temperature and pressure at which it exhibits properties of both a gas and a liquid .
When supercritical , the substance can move directly into a solid like a gas and yet dissolve compounds like a liquid .
For example , says Wai , supercritical carbon dioxide has directly dissolved and removed caffeine from whole coffee beans for decades .
When the carbon dioxide ’s pressure is returned to normal , it becomes a gas and evaporates , leaving behind only the extracted metals .
No solvents required , no acids applied , and no organic waste left behind .
“ That ’s why decaffeinated coffee tastes so good , ” said Wai , while chuckling at the beauty and simplicity of the process .
“ There is no solvent used , and so no solvent left behind . ”
Because the technology is so simple , cost - effective and environmentally friendly , AREVA is eager to test its first full - scale use on 32 tons of incinerator ash in Richland , Wash .
advertisement
The existing plant in Richland fabricates fuel for commercial nuclear power plants from raw enriched uranium supplied by utility customers as uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) .
During normal operation , common items including filters , rags , paper wipes , and gloves become contaminated with uranium .
The waste is burned to reduce its volume and increase its uranium content , making it easier to recover the uranium .
Nearly 10 percent of the ash ’s weight is usable enriched uranium , worth about $ 900 dollars per pound on today ’s market .
This means about $ 5 million dollars is currently sitting in the garbage waiting to be recovered .
The process may even become the basis of the next generation of plants designed to recover useful materials from spent fuel .
“ This agreement and technology is something Idaho should be very proud of , ” said Wai of the supercritical fluid technology transfer .
“ We have developed something special .
And to me , that something is important to Idaho and to the U.S. , particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future . ”
The new recycling plant is expected to be operational in 2009 and will take about a year to process AREVA ’s ash inventory .
When finished , much of its operating time can be devoted to ash received from other sites .
The technology licensing agreement that will be signed by the university and AREVA will allow AREVA to use several of Wai ’s discoveries to extract the metals from the ash .
AREVA provided funding and will gain rights to the University of Idaho ’s share of a joint University of Idaho and AREVA patent developed in cooperation with Wai over the past four years that further separates the enriched uranium from the extracted metals .
advertisement
“ This process has been extremely collaborative — it ’s one of those that you just love , ” said Gene Merrell , the university ’s chief technology transfer officer and assistant vice president for research .
“ It ’s going to be a great deal that will benefit the University of Idaho , AREVA and the entire world . ”
Technology transfer is a process common to research universities .
Rights to patents are sold to companies , or used to create new start - up companies , and benefit all parties involved .
Not only do the technology ’s profits benefit the university and future research , it allows the university to ensure its technology is being used in a useful and efficient way .
But for Wai , this technology transfer is only the beginning .
He is now working to make the technology even more environmentally friendly and also to recycle different forms of radioactive waste .
The key to Wai ’s research is to find a soluble chemical compound to bind with the uranium .
Because carbon dioxide cannot directly dissolve metals such as uranium , a binding agent called a ligand is introduced to the equation .
Once the ligand is applied , the supercritical carbon dioxide flows through the waste , dissolving both the ligand and the metals bounded to it .
Dissolving and extracting any desired metal — possibly even radioactive material from high - level radioactive waste — simply requires finding a binding agent that works .
Wai predicts supercritical fluids will be used in the not - too - distant - future to recycle even higher levels of radioactive waste .
“ To me , accomplishing that is important to Idaho and to the United States , particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future . ” said Wai .
“ I believe nuclear energy will play a very large role , and that it can be done in a very environmentally safe and sustainable way . ”
Early on a late September morning , if all goes according to plan , 1 million Mormons , Catholics , Jews , Muslims , evangelical Christians , Sikhs and Hindus will open their front doors , march down their front walks and plant “ Yes on Proposition 8 " signs in their yards to show they support repealing same - sex marriage in California .
It is a bold idea , one that may be difficult to pull off .
But whether or not 1 million lawn signs are planted in unison , the plan underscores what some observers say is one of the most ambitious interfaith political organizing efforts ever attempted in the state .
Moreover , political analysts say , the alliances across religious boundaries could herald new ways of building coalitions around political issues in California .
“ Pan-religious , faith - based political action strategies . . .
I think we are going to see a lot more of [ this ] in the future , ” said Gaston Espinosa , a professor of religious studies at Claremont McKenna College .
The greatest involvement in the campaign has come from Mormons , Catholics and evangelical Christians , who say they are working together much more closely than they did eight years ago when a similar measure , Proposition 22 , was on the ballot .

Mark Jansson , a Mormon who is a member of the Protect Marriage Coalition , said members of his group are also reaching out to Jews , Muslims , Sikhs and Hindus .
Organizers say the groups turned to each other because of the California Supreme Court ’s ruling in May allowing same - sex marriages to be performed in the state .
Thousands of gay couples have wed in the state since June 17 , the first day same - sex marriages became legal .
“ This is a rising up over a 5,000 - year - old institution that is being hammered right now , ” said Jim Garlow , pastor of Skyline Church , an evangelical congregation in La Mesa .
Garlow said that , while he supported Proposition 22 , he was not nearly as involved as this time around , when he has helped organize 3,400 - person conference calls across denominations to coordinate campaign support for the proposed constitutional amendment .
“ What binds us together is one common obsession : . . . marriage , ” Garlow said .

He added that many people of faith , regardless of their religion , believe that “ if Proposition 8 fails , there is an inevitable loss of religious freedom . ”
Other religious leaders vehemently disagree with Garlow and are working just as furiously to defeat Proposition 8 .
But their efforts have not been as carefully orchestrated as those of the initiative ’s religious supporters .
Susan Russell , a priest at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , a liberal congregation that has long supported the rights of gays and lesbians to marry , said “ fair - minded Californians ” should be concerned about some of the tactics and arguments of faith leaders on the other side .
“ I will defend to my last breath the right of any of those folks to exercise their religion as they believe they are called to do it , ” she added .
“ But I ’ll resist to my last breath , vote , e-mail and blog their right to inflict their religious beliefs on the Constitution of the state of California . ”

Russell said that the idea that the court ’s decision infringed on religious liberty was a “ red herring . ”
Divorce is legal in California , she said , but that does n’t mean that Roman Catholic priests have to perform marriages for people who have been divorced .
As the campaign intensifies this fall , both sides in the fight over Proposition 8 say they expect religious leaders and their congregations to continue to play a big role .
To demonstrate that there is significant clergy support for same - sex marriage , the group California Faith for Equality has produced a video of priests , reverends and rabbis talking about why they support gay marriage .
In one , as Pachelbel ’s Canon plays in the background , the Rev. Neil Thomas , a minister at Metropolitan Community Church in Los Angeles , looks at the camera and declares : “ I absolutely think that Jesus would support the freedom to marry , and because of that , as a follower of Jesus , it is absolutely incumbent upon me to support the freedom to marry as well . ”

Adds Rabbi Zach Shapiro of Temple Akiba in Culver City : “ My faith supports the freedom to marry because , as a Jew , I have a responsibility to fight for what is right . . . and to help bring goodness into the world . ”
There are plans in the works to make another video that includes Muslim leaders as well as Spanish - speaking religious leaders .
Kerry Chaplin , interfaith organizing director of California Faith for Equality , also said her group plans to work with churches to encourage parishioners to talk to their friends and neighbors about why they should oppose Proposition 8 .
On the other side , Garlow said pastors are planning a 40 - day fast leading up to the election .
He is also planning several rallies , including one that he hopes will include 300,000 youths .

Catholics and Mormons , meanwhile , are organizing their own congregations to try to sway voters , make contributions and get out the vote .
The Knights of Columbus , a Catholic group , recently donated $ 1 million to the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign .
Ned Dolejsi , executive director of the California Catholic Conference , the public policy arm of the Catholic Church , said it was too early to say whether the coalitions being built around Proposition 8 would carry over into other issues .
But , he added : “ It ’s an interesting time to get to know each other in different ways . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Lawmakers questioned whether the White House had a long - term solution to the problems facing Wall Street after President Bush on Thursday declared the government 's actions to shore up crumbling financial institutions necessary to avoid a " severe disruption " to financial markets .
President Bush said his administration is ready to act to head off market disruptions .
The criticism of the president was bipartisan , but Democrats faulted Bush for not explaining the crisis to the American people .
Deputy White House Press Secretary Tony Fratto said Thursday that Bush met with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson this afternoon for about 40 minutes along with Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and SEC head Chris Cox .
After the meeting the president said the government had taken " extraordinary measures " to help stabilize the markets , including the takeover of American International Group Inc .
Later Thursday leaders from both the House and the Senate were briefed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Afterward , Paulson announced that the federal government would seek to take a more central role in resolving the credit crisis by providing a way for banks to get rid of mortgage - related assets that have been hard to value and harder to trade .
Bush spoke for less than two minutes outside of the Oval Office .
" The American people needed a fireside chat .
Instead they received fast talk and a quick exit .
...
It can not give reassurance to the American people that this administration has really come to grips with the problem that faces our nation today , " Sen . Dick Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate said .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also blasted Bush , saying , " After seven years and almost nine months , his philosophy of non-government has come back to haunt him .
So , I can't blame him for only wanting to speak for two minutes . "
Republican lawmakers , on the other hand , questioned why taxpayer dollars are being used to bail out private firms and howled that the administration had not consulted with them before making billions of dollars in loans .
As part of a deal to rescue the insurance giant , the government took 80 percent of AIG 's equity in exchange for an $ 85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve .
Bush said Tuesday 's AIG takeover was necessary to prevent " a severe disruption in our financial markets and threatened other sectors of the economy . "
Watch as Bush says he 's closely monitoring the situation »
He also said the federal takeover of two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was necessary to " help promote market stability and to ensure they can continue to play a role in helping our housing market recover . "
The government also has pledged up to $ 200 billion in credit to the mortgage giants to ensure that the mortgage industry would continue to function .
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday night also took steps , in coordination with central banks around the world , to provide additional liquidity to U.S. markets .
Despite the government 's takeover of AIG , the Dow Jones industrial average fell 449 points Wednesday in its second worst session of the year .
The market bounced back somewhat Thursday morning , with the Dow in positive territory on the news that the central banks had injected more funds into the U.S. economy .
" These actions are necessary and important , and the markets are adjusting to them , " Bush said .
Bush 's comments , however , did not satisfy House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who criticized him for not doing more to explain the crisis to the American people .
Bush had not fielded questions about the economic upheaval this week .
" We wondered if he was ever going to come out of hiding on the subject .
He came out in one minute and said very little , " Pelosi , D - California , said .
She said the Bush administration was to blame for failing to intervene before the problems developed .
" It 's not a free market when you can run wild , anything goes , privatize the gain , nationalize the risk and , when you fail , the middle class bails you out , " Pelosi said .
" It 's just not fair .
It 's just not right . "
She said the appropriate committees would investigate the " mismanagement of the financial market regulation " and ask where the money for AIG was coming from and whether it would increase the federal deficit .

What are you giving up ?
Democrats were not alone in criticizing the administration .
House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said Republicans were n't informed about the AIG bailout until afterward , and he demanded that the administration consult with lawmakers before moving ahead with similar deals in the future .
Watch how the AIG bailout affects taxpayers »
" It 's not for me to judge in the middle of a crisis , to second - guess them or to judge what could have been , " he said , but " I and all of my colleagues on the Hill are concerned about the lack of information , the lack of consultation . "
He added , " We are a separate branch of our government , and members are entitled to information . "
Earlier , other Republicans had gone further in their criticism .
" Once again the Fed has put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars to bail out an institution that put greed ahead of responsibility and used their good name to take risky bets that did not pay off , " said Sen.
Jim Bunning , R - Kentucky , a member of the Senate Banking Committee .
And Rep. Roy Blunt , R- Missouri , said House Republicans are struggling to " understand a coherent strategy " about which firms get rescued and which ones do n't .
A group of conservative House Republicans on Thursday sent a letter to Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urging them to refrain from any further bailouts .
" Our heads are spinning right now with the bailout mania .
First , we were told that Bear Stearns was too big to fail , then we were told that Freddie , Fannie were too big to fail , then we were told that AIG was too big to fail .
What 's next -- Starbucks too big to fail ? " asked Rep. Michelle Bachman , R- Minnesota .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino defended the quick action by the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department .
" There were fast - moving developments , and I believe that the Treasury Department tried as hard as they could to get information up to members of Congress as quickly as possible , " Perino said .
When asked by reporters what steps the Federal Reserve , the Treasury Department and other agencies may take , Perino said she could not comment but said the administration would " continue to assess the situation and take any necessary steps , if there are necessary steps that need to be taken . "
CNN's Scott J. Anderson , Ted Barrett , Deirdre Walsh , Lesa Jansen and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report .
All About American International Group Inc. • George W. Bush
The ability to intuitively estimate the number objects you can see is known as automatic number sense and has been widely studied in the scientific literature , but is usually thought to be separate from the formal and precise maths abilities we learn at school .
A new study just published online in Nature suggests that these abilities are more intertwined than we might think , as the better the number sense of 14 year - olds , the better their formal maths ability .
The researchers , led by psychologist Justin Halberda , flashed up a series of dot patterns to a group of 14 year - old students .
Just like the one in the picture .
The kids were asked to indicate the ratio of blue and yellow dots but because the patterns flashed up so quickly , for only one fifth of a second , the kids did n’t have time to count them .
They had to rely on a guestimate – their number sense – to give their answer .
After a whole set of these , the researchers calculated each kid ’s accuracy , to give a measure of their overall number sense ability .
This in itself is n’t particularly interesting , as number sense has been widely tested and researched in the scientific literature .
However , in the past , it ’s often been considered a fuzzy , perhaps more ‘ primitive ’ , ability unrelated to formal maths skills .
Owing to the fact that the researchers had access to the children ’s maths achievement test scores , all the way back to kindergarten , they tested whether number sense and maths skills were related .
It turns out they were , and automatic number sense accounted for almost a third of the scores on formal maths tests .
This was even after controlling for the fact that some children were generally brighter or quicker than others .
What is not clear is whether just being better at maths means you develop a better number sense , or whether a better number sense encourages better maths skills .
The fact that they are related at all is interesting , however , as it suggest that intuition plays a part in the practice of mathematics – the most logical of pursuits .

Few people know the facts about the singular event that helped spark what ultimately became known as World War II - the international Jewish declaration of war on Germany shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power and well before any official German government sanctions or reprisals against Jews were carried out .
The March 24 , 1933 issue of The Daily Express of London ( shown above ) described how Jewish leaders , in combination with powerful international Jewish financial interests , had launched a boycott of Germany for the express purpose of crippling her already precarious economy in the hope of bringing down the new Hitler regime .
It was only then that Germany struck back in response .
Thus , if truth be told , it was the worldwide Jewish leadership - not the Third Reich - that effectively fired the first shot in the Second World War .
Prominent New York attorney Samuel Untermyer ( above right ) was one of the leading agitators in the war against Germany , describing the Jewish campaign as nothing less than a " holy war . "
Long before the Hitler government began restricting the rights of the German Jews , the leaders of the worldwide Jewish community formally declared war on the " New Germany " at a time when the U.S. government and even the Jewish leaders in Germany were urging caution in dealing with the new Hitler regime .
The war by the international Jewish leadership on Germany not only sparked definite reprisals by the German government but also set the stage for a little - known economic and political alliance between the Hitler government and the leaders of the Zionist movement who hoped that the tension between the Germans and the Jews would lead to massive emigration to Palestine .
In short , the result was a tactical alliance between the Nazis and the founders of the modern - day state of Israel - a fact that many today would prefer be forgotten .
To this day , it is generally ( although incorrectly ) believed that when Adolf Hitler was appointed German chancellor in January of 1933 , the German government began policies to suppress the Jews of Germany , including rounding up of Jews and putting them in concentration camps and launching campaigns of terror and violence against the domestic Jewish population .
While there were sporadic eruptions of violence against Jews in Germany after Hitler came to power , this was not officially sanctioned or encouraged .
And the truth is that anti-Jewish sentiments in Germany ( or elsewhere in Europe ) were actually nothing new .
As all Jewish historians attest with much fervor , anti-Semitic uprisings of various degrees had been ever - present in European history .
In any case , in early 1933 , Hitler was not the undisputed leader of Germany , nor did he have full command of the armed forces .
Hitler was a major figure in a coalition government , but he was far from being the government himself .
That was the result of a process of consolidation which evolved later .
Even Germany 's Jewish Central Association , known as the Verein , contested the suggestion ( made by some Jewish leaders outside Germany ) that the new government was deliberately provoking anti-Jewish uprisings .
The Verein issued a statement that " the responsible government authorities [ i.e. the Hitler regime ] are unaware of the threatening situation , " saying , " we do not believe our German fellow citizens will let themselves be carried away into committing excesses against the Jews . "
Despite this , Jewish leaders in the United States and Britain determined on their own that it was necessary to launch a war against the Hitler government .
On March 12 , 1933 the American Jewish Congress announced a massive protest at Madison Square Gardens for March 27 .
At that time the commander in chief of the Jewish War Veterans called for an American boycott of German goods .
In the meantime , on March 23 , 20,000 Jews protested at New York 's City Hall as rallies were staged outside the North German Lloyd and Hamburg - American shipping lines and boycotts were mounted against German goods throughout shops and businesses in New York City .
According to The Daily Express of London of March 24 , 1933 , the Jews had already launched their boycott against Germany and her elected government .
The headline read " Judea Declares War on Germany - Jews of All the World Unite - Boycott of German Goods - Mass Demonstrations . "
The article described a forthcoming " holy war " and went on to implore Jews everywhere to boycott German goods and engage in mass demonstrations against German economic interests .
According to the Express :
The whole of Israel throughout the world is uniting to declare an economic and financial war on Germany .
The appearance of the Swastika as the symbol of the new Germany has revived the old war symbol of Judas to new life .
Fourteen million Jews scattered over the entire world are tight to each other as if one man , in order to declare war against the German persecutors of their fellow believers .
The Jewish wholesaler will quit his house , the banker his stock exchange , the merchant his business , and the beggar his humble hut , in order to join the holy war against Hitler 's people .
The Express said that Germany was " now confronted with an international boycott of its trade , its finances , and its industry ....
In London , New York , Paris and Warsaw , Jewish businessmen are united to go on an economic crusade . "
The article said " worldwide preparations are being made to organize protest demonstrations , " and reported that " the old and reunited nation of Israel gets in formation with new and modern weapons to fight out its age old battle against its persecutors . "
This truly could be described as " the first shot fired in the Second World War . "
In a similar vein , the Jewish newspaper Natscha Retsch wrote :
The war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities , conferences , congresses ... by every individual Jew .
Thereby the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests , which require that Germany be wholly destroyed .
The danger for us Jews lies in the whole German people , in Germany as a whole as well as individually .
It must be rendered harmless for all time ....
In this war we Jews have to participate , and this with all the strength and might we have at our disposal .
However , note well that the Zionist Association of Germany put out a telegram on the 26th of March rejecting many of the allegations made against the National Socialists as " propaganda , " " mendacious " and " sensational . "
In fact , the Zionist faction had every reason to ensure the permanence of National Socialist ideology in Germany .
Klaus Polkehn , writing in the Journal of Palestine Studies ( " The Secret Contacts : Zionism and Nazi Germany , 1933 - 1941 " ; JPS v. 3/4 , spring / summer 1976 ) , claims that the moderate attitude of the Zionists was due to their vested interest in seeing the financial victory of National Socialism to force immigration to Palestine .
This little - known factor would ultimately come to play a pivotal part in the relationship between Nazi Germany and the Jews .
In the meantime , though , German Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath complained of the " vilification campaign " and said :
As concerns Jews , I can only say that their propagandists abroad are rendering their co-religionists in Germany no service by giving the German public , through their distorted and untruthful news about persecution and torture of Jews , the impression that they actually halt at nothing , not even at lies and calumny , to fight the present German government .
The fledgling Hitler government itself was clearly trying to contain the growing tension - both within Germany and without .
In the United States , even U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wired Rabbi Stephen Wise of the American Jewish Congress and urged caution :
Whereas there was for a short time considerable physical mistreatment of Jews , this phase may be considered virtually terminated ....
A stabilization appears to have been reached in the field of personal mistreatment ....
I feel hopeful that the situation which has caused such widespread concern throughout this country will soon revert to normal .
This New York Daily
News front page headline hailed the massive anti-German protest rally held in Madison Square Garden on March 27 , 1933 .
Despite efforts by the German government to alleviate tensions and prevent the escalation of name - calling and threats by the international Jewish leadership , the rally was held as scheduled .
Similar rallies and protest marches were also being held in other cities during the same time frame .
The intensity of the Jewish campaign against Germany was such that the Hitler government vowed that if the campaign did not stop , there would be a one - day boycott in Germany of Jewish - owned stores .
Despite this , the hate campaign continued , forcing Germany to take defensive measures that created a situation wherein the Jews of Germany became increasingly marginalized .
The truth about the Jewish war on Germany has been suppressed by most histories of the period .
Despite all this , the leaders of the Jewish community refused to relent .
On March 27 there were simultaneous protest rallies at Madison Square Garden , in Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Cleveland and 70 other locations .
The New York rally was broadcast worldwide .
The bottom line is that " the New Germany " was declared to be an enemy of Jewish interests and thus needed to be economically strangled .
This was before Hitler decided to boycott Jewish goods .
It was in direct response to this that the German government announced a one - day boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany on April 1 .
German Propaganda Minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels announced that if , after the one - day boycott , there were no further attacks on Germany , the boycott would be stopped .
Hitler himself responded to the Jewish boycott and the threats in a speech on March 28 - four days after the original Jewish declaration of war - saying :
Now that the domestic enemies of the nation have been eliminated by the Volk itself , what we have long been waiting for will not come to pass .
The Communist and Marxist criminals and their Jewish - intellectual instigators , who , having made off with their capital stocks across the border in the nick of time , are now unfolding an unscrupulous , treasonous campaign of agitation against the German Volk as a whole from there ....
Lies and slander of positively hair - raising perversity are being launched about Germany .
Horror stories of dismembered Jewish corpses , gouged out eyes and hacked off hands are circulating for the purpose of defaming the German Volk in the world for the second time , just as they had succeeded in doing once before in 1914 .
Thus , the fact - one conveniently left out of nearly all history on the subject - is that Hitler 's March 28 , 1933 boycott order was in direct response to the declaration of war on Germany by the worldwide Jewish leadership just four days earlier .
Today , Hitler 's boycott order is described as a naked act of aggression , yet the full circumstances leading up to his order are seldom described in even the most ponderous and detailed histories of " the Holocaust " .
Not even Saul Friedlander in his otherwise comprehensive overview of German policy , Nazi Germany and the Jews , mentions the fact that the Jewish declaration of war and boycott preceded Hitler 's speech of March 28 , 1933 .
Discerning readers would be wise to ask why Friedlander felt this item of history so irrelevant .
The simple fact is that it was organized Jewry as a political entity - and not even the German Jewish community per se - that actually initiated the first shot in the war with Germany .
Placard text :
" Germans !
Defend yourselves !
Do n't shop at Jewish stores ! "

Germany 's response was a defensive - not an offensive - measure .
Were that fact widely known today , it would cast new light on the subsequent events that ultimately led to the world - wide conflagration that followed .
To understand Hitler 's reaction to the Jewish declaration of war , it is vital to understand the critical state of the German economy at the time .
In 1933 , the German economy was in a shambles .
Some 3 million Germans were on public assistance with a total of 6 million unemployed .
Hyper-inflation had destroyed the economic vitality of the German nation .
Furthermore , the anti-German propaganda pouring out of the global press strengthened the resolve of Germany 's enemies , especially the Poles and their hawkish military high command .
The Jewish leaders were not bluffing .
The boycott was an act of war not solely in metaphor : it was a means , well crafted , to destroy Germany as a political , social and economic entity .
The long term purpose of the Jewish boycott against Germany was to bankrupt her with respect to the reparation payments imposed on Germany after World War I and to keep Germany demilitarized and vulnerable .
The boycott , in fact , was quite crippling to Germany .
Jewish scholars such as Edwin Black have reported that , in response to the boycott , German exports were cut by 10 percent , and that many were demanding seizing German assets in foreign countries ( Edwin Black , The Transfer Agreement - The Untold Story of the Secret Pact between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine , New York , 1984 ) .
The attacks on Germany did not cease .
The worldwide Jewish leadership became ever the more belligerent and worked itself into a frenzy .
An International Jewish Boycott Conference was held in Amsterdam to coordinate the ongoing boycott campaign .
It was held under the auspices of the self - styled World Jewish Economic Federation , of which famous New York City attorney and longtime political power broker , Samuel Untermyer , was elected president .
Upon returning to the United States in the wake of the conference , Untermyer delivered a speech over WABC Radio ( New York ) , a transcript of which was printed in The New York Times on August 7 , 1933 .
Untermyer 's inflammatory oratory called for a " sacred war " against Germany , making the flat - out allegation that Germany was engaged in a plan to " exterminate the Jews . "
He said ( in part ) : ... Germany [ has ] been converted from a nation of culture into a veritable hell of cruel and savage beasts .
We owe it not only to our persecuted brethren but to the entire world to now strike in self - defense a blow that will free humanity from a repetition of this incredible outrage ....
Now or never must all the nations of the earth make common cause against the ... slaughter , starvation and annihilation ... fiendish torture , cruelty and persecution that are being inflicted day by day upon these men , women and children ....
When the tale is told ... the world will confront a picture so fearful in its barbarous cruelty that the hell of war and the alleged Belgian atrocities pale into insignificance as compared to this devilishly , deliberately , cold - bloodedly planned and already partially executed campaign for the extermination of a proud , gentle , loyal , law - abiding people ...
The Jews are the aristocrats of the world .
From time immemorial they have been persecuted and have seen their persecutors come and go .
They alone have survived .
And so will history repeat itself , but that furnishes no reason why we should permit this reversion of a once great nation to the Dark Ages or fail to rescue these 600,000 human souls from the tortures of hell ....
... What we are proposing and have already gone far toward doing , is to prosecute a purely defensive economic boycott that will undermine the Hitler regime and bring the German people to their senses by destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends .
... We propose to and are organizing world opinion to express itself in the only way Germany can be made to understand ....
Untermyer then proceeded to provide his listeners with a wholly fraudulent history of the circumstances of the German boycott and how it originated .
He also proclaimed that the Germans were bent on a plan to " exterminate the Jews " :
The Hitler regime originated and are fiendishly prosecuting their boycott to exterminate the Jews by placarding Jewish shops , warning Germans against dealing with them , by imprisoning Jewish shopkeepers and parading them through the streets by the hundreds under guard of Nazi troops for the sole crime of being Jews , by ejecting them from the learned professions in which many of them had attained eminence , by excluding their children from the schools , their men from the labor unions , closing against them every avenue of livelihood , locking them in vile concentration camps and starving and torturing them without cause and resorting to every other conceivable form of torture , inhuman beyond conception , until suicide has become their only means of escape , and all solely because they are or their remote ancestors were Jews , and all with the avowed object of exterminating them .
Untermyer concluded his largely fantastic and hysterical address by declaring that with the support of " Christian friends ... we will drive the last nail in the coffin of bigotry and fanaticism .... "
The Biggest Secret of WWII ?
Why Germany Began Rounding Up Jews
and Deporting
Them to the East Why did the Germans begin rounding up the Jews and interning them in the concentration camps to begin with ?
Contrary to popular myth , the Jews remained " free " inside Germany - albeit subject to laws which did restrict certain of their privileges - prior to the outbreak of World War II .
Yet , the other little - known fact is that just before the war began , the leadership of the world Jewish community formally declared war on Germany - above and beyond the ongoing six - year - long economic boycott launched by the worldwide Jewish community when the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 .
As a consequence of the formal declaration of war , the German authorities thus deemed Jews to be potential enemy agents .
Here 's the story behind the story : Chaim Weizmann ( above ) , president of both the international " Jewish Agency " and of the World Zionist Organization ( and later Israel 's first president ) , told British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in a letter published in The London Times on September 6 , 1939 that :
I wish to confirm , in the most explicit manner , the declarations which I and my colleagues have made during the last month , and especially in the last week , that the Jews stand by Great Britain and will fight on the side of the democracies .
Our urgent desire is to give effect to these declarations [ against Germany ] .
We wish to do so in a way entirely consonant with the general scheme of British action , and therefore would place ourselves , in matters big and small , under the coordinating direction of His Majesty 's Government .
The Jewish Agency is ready to enter into immediate arrangements for utilizing Jewish manpower , technical ability , resources , etc .
[ Emphasis in red added by The Scriptorium . ]
That his allegations against Germany were made long before even Jewish historians today claim there were any gas chambers or even a plan to " exterminate " the Jews , displays the nature of the propaganda campaign confronting Germany .
However , during this same period there were some unusual developments at work :
The spring of 1933 also witnessed the beginning of a period of private cooperation between the German government and the Zionist movement in Germany and Palestine ( and actually worldwide ) to increase the flow of German - Jewish immigrants and capital to Palestine .
The modern - day supporters of Zionist Israel and many historians have succeeded in keeping this Nazi - Zionist pact a secret to the general public for decades and while most Americans have no concept of the possibility that there could have been outright collaboration between the Nazi leadership and the founders of what became the state of Israel , the truth has begun to emerge .
Dissident Jewish writer Lenni Brennar 's Zionism
In the Age of the Dictators , published by a small press and not given the publicity it deserves by the so - called " mainstream " media ( which is otherwise obsessed with the Holocaust era ) , was perhaps the first major endeavor in this realm .
In response to Brennar and others , the Zionist reaction has usually consisted of declarations that their collaboration with Nazi Germany was undertaken solely to save the lives of Jews .
But the collaboration was all the more remarkable because it took place at a time when many Jews and Jewish organizations demanded a boycott of Germany .
To the Zionist leaders , Hitler 's assumption of power held out the possibility of a flow of immigrants to Palestine .
Previously , the majority of German Jews , who identified themselves as Germans , had little sympathy with the Zionist cause of promoting the ingathering of world Jewry to Palestine .
But the Zionists saw that only the anti-Semitic Hitler was likely to push the anti-Zionist German Jews into the arms of Zionism .
For all the modern - day wailing by worldwide supporters of Israel ( not to mention the Israelis themselves ) about " the Holocaust " , they neglect to mention that making the situation in Germany as uncomfortable for the Jews as possible - in cooperation with German National Socialism - was part of the plan .
Note to readers of this article who can also read German : a booklet discussing the emigration of Jews from Third Reich Germany , and the Transfer Agreement that facilitated their emigration , may be found here !
This was the genesis of the so - called Transfer Agreement , the agreement between Zionist Jews and the National Socialist government to transfer German Jewry to Palestine .
According to Jewish historian Walter Laqueur and many others , German Jews were far from convinced that immigration to Palestine was the answer .
Furthermore , although the majority of German Jews refused to consider the Zionists as their political leaders , it is clear that Hitler protected and cooperated with the Zionists for the purposes of implementing the final solution : the mass transfer of Jews to the Middle East .
Edwin Black , in his massive tome The Transfer Agreement ( Macmillan , 1984 ) , stated that although most Jews did not want to flee to Palestine at all , due to the Zionist movement 's influence within Nazi Germany a Jew 's best chance of getting out of Germany was by emigrating to Palestine .
In other words , the Transfer Agreement itself mandated that Jewish capital could only to go Palestine .
Thus , according to the Zionists , a Jew could leave Germany only if he went to the Levant .
The primary difficulty with the Transfer Agreement ( or even the idea of such an agreement ) was that the English [!!! ; Scriptorium ] were demanding , as a condition of immigration , that each immigrant pay 1,000 pounds sterling upon arrival in Haifa or elsewhere .
The difficulty was that such hard currency was nearly impossible to come by in a cash - strapped and radically inflationary Germany .
This was the main idea behind the final Transfer Agreement .
Laqueur writes :
A large German bank would freeze funds paid in by immigrants in blocked accounts for German exporters , while a bank in Palestine would control the sale of German goods to Palestine , thereby providing the immigrants with the necessary foreign currency on the spot .
Sam Cohen , co-owner of Hanoaiah Ltd. and initiator of the transfer endeavors , was however subjected to long - lasting objections from his own people and finally had to concede that such a transfer agreement could only be concluded on a much higher level with a bank of its own rather than that of a private company .
The renowned Anglo - Palestine Bank in London would be included in this transfer deal and create a trust company for [ this ] purpose .
Of course , this is of major historical importance in dealing with the relationship between Zionism and National Socialism in Germany in the 1930s .
The relationship was not one merely of mutual interest and political favoritism on the part of Hitler , but a close financial relationship with German banking families and financial institutions as well .
Black writes :
It was one thing for the Zionists to subvert the anti-Nazi boycott .
Zionism needed to transfer out the capital of German Jews , and merchandise was the only available medium .
But soon Zionist leaders understood that the success of the future Jewish Palestinian economy would be inextricably bound up with the survival of the Nazi economy .
So the Zionist leadership was compelled to go further .
The German economy would have to be safeguarded , stabilized , and if necessary reinforced .
Hence , the Nazi party and the Zionist organizers shared a common stake in the recovery of Germany .
Thus one sees a radical fissure in world Jewry around 1933 and beyond .
There were , first , the non-Zionist Jews ( specifically the World Jewish Congress founded in 1933 ) , who , on the one hand , demanded the boycott and eventual destruction of Germany .
Black notes that many of these people were not just in New York and Amsterdam , but a major source for this also came from Palestine proper .
On the other hand , one can see the judicious use of such feelings by the Zionists for the sake of eventual resettlement in Palestine .
In other words , it can be said ( and Black does hint at this ) that Zionism believed that , since Jews would be moving to the Levant , capital flight would be necessary for any new economy to function .
The result was the understanding that Zionism would have to ally itself with National Socialism , so that the German government would not impede the flow of Jewish capital out of the country .
It served the Zionist interests at the time that Jews be loud in their denunciations of German practices against the Jews to scare them into the Levant , but , on the other hand , Laqueur states that " The Zionists became motivated not to jeopardize the German economy or currency . "
In other words , the Zionist leadership of the Jewish Diaspora was one of subterfuge and underhandedness , with only the advent of German hostility towards Jewry convincing the world 's Jews that immigration was the only escape .
The fact is that the ultimate establishment of the state of Israel was based on fraud .
The Zionists did not represent anything more than a small minority of German Jews in 1933 .
On the one hand , the Zionist fathers of Israel wanted loud denunciations of Germany 's " cruelties " to the world 's Jews while at the same time demanding moderation so that the National Socialist government would remain stable , financially and politically .
Thus Zionism boycotted the boycott .
For all intents and purposes , the National Socialist government was the best thing to happen to Zionism in its history , for it " proved " to many Jews that Europeans were irredeemably anti-Jewish and that Palestine was the only answer : Zionism came to represent the overwhelming majority of Jews solely by trickery and cooperation with Adolf Hitler .
For the Zionists , both the denunciations of German policies towards Jews ( to keep Jews frightened ) , plus the reinvigoration of the German economy ( for the sake of final resettlement ) was imperative for the Zionist movement .
Ironically , today the Zionist leaders of Israel complain bitterly about the horrific and inhuman regime of the National Socialists .
So the fraud continues .

Okay , I did the unthinkable .
I actually went and saw STAR WARS : CLONE WARS .
My eight and a half year old step - son wanted to see it , and I guess I was n’t as vehemently opposed as many others were .
There has been a lot of negative press and discussion around this movie .
Last week it was even a topic of discussion over on THE UNIQUE GEEK .
Going into the movie I was curious as to whether it was really that awful , or had just gotten a bad rap thanks to all the Lucas hatred out there .
To be honest , after watching the movie I did n’t think it was really that bad .
I know several reviewers have given it a “ D ” or “ F ” , but I do n’t think those grades are merited .
I believe those reviews were influenced by many peoples general dissatisfaction with Lucas ’ more recent Star Wars efforts .
Was it a fantastic film ?
No .
Was it 98 minutes of entertainment that I was willing to pay for ?
Yes .
Would I go see it again ?
Probably .
I find it interesting that the Cartoon Network “ Clone Wars ” from 2003 is beloved by many fans .
Yet this incarnation of “ Clone Wars ” has earned severe indignation from the masses .
I ’m not really sure why .
This version of “ Clone Wars ” actually picks up the previous “ Clone Wars ” storyline and continues it .
I think that if someone enjoyed the 2003 “ Clone Wars ” then there is a reasonable chance they will enjoy this version too .
If the dissatisfaction for this movie stems from fans disgust of George Lucas , then that ’s not really fair either .
George Lucas did not write or direct this movie .
He ’s listed as “ Executive Producer ” , but that ’s it .
IMDB does list him as a writer , but he does not appear in the actual credits of the film ( and IMDB is notorious for errors ) .
I ’ve been a big proponent for sometime that the Star Wars universe is now better shepherded in others hands , rather than George’s .
So I definitely think these creators deserve a chance to improve the Star Wars universe .
This movie is clearly targeted at a younger audience than the main Star Wars films ( hence the young Padawan and the Hutt baby ) .
Additionally , it definitely had the feel of a pilot for the upcoming TV series .
However , there were some really great moments .
For example , Obi-Wan Kenobi is totally freakin’ bad ass in combat .
Additionally , Commander Rex ( an ARC trooper ) is my favorite new Star Wars character .
He ’s in command of the 501st legion and he totally rocked !
Even Anakin ’s new Padawan , Ahsoka Tano , was interesting .
I liked the way she and Anakin interacted .
I ’ve already found myself wondering what happens to her down the line after the Jedi purge .
In regard to my step - son , here is an audio clip in which he provides his feedback on the movie and his thoughts on all the negative reviews it ’s been getting …
Audio clip : Adobe Flash Player ( version 9 or above ) is required to play this audio clip .
Download the latest version here .
You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser .
If you ca n’t use the embedded player , than you can find the audio file by clicking here .
Finally , after watching the movie my step - son was so inspired that he got out many of his Star Wars toys ( along with other toys ) and we had a Clone Wars skirmish of our own .
Here you can see the Republic army ready for battle ( yes , that ’s a Cobra Hiss tank substituting for a Republic tank ) , along with the Separatist army preparing an ambush .
So I would recommend you watch the movie and decide for yourself whether it ’s good or not .
Just because Lucas himself has lost his creativity , that does n’t mean others do n’t have worthwhile things to add to the legacy .
The gunfire built to a steady rhythm .
American soldiers in a Stryker armoured vehicle fired from one end of the block .
At the other end , two groups of Shia militiamen pounded back with machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades .
US helicopters circled above in the blue afternoon sky .
As a barrage erupted outside his parents ' house , Abu Mustafa al - Thahabi , adviser to the Mahdi army of Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , rushed through the gate to take shelter .
He had just spoken with a fighter by mobile phone .
' I told him not to use that weapon .
It 's not effective , ' he said , talking of the rocket - propelled grenade .
' I told him to use the IED , the Iranian one , ' he added , referring to an improvised explosive device .
' This is more effective . '
After nearly a year of relative calm , US troops and Shia militia engaged in pitched battles last week , underscoring how quickly order can give way to chaos in Iraq .
On this block in Sadr City , the cleric 's sprawling stronghold , armed men and boys came out from nearly every house to fight .
From Thursday afternoon to Friday morning , this correspondent spent 19 hours here , at times trapped by intense crossfire inside the house of Thahabi 's parents .
Fighters engaged US forces for seven hours .
They lost a comrade .
They launched rockets into the Green Zone .
Around the same time , rockets killed a US government employee , the second American killed there last week .
Between battles , fighters spoke about politics and war .
There was no sign of grief or fear .
Death was a short cut to some divine place .
As the two sides exchanged fire , Thahabi 's mother , Um Falah , clutched a Koran and began to pray to Imam Ali , Shia Islam 's most revered saint .
Her eldest son , Abu Hassan , is a Mahdi army commander .
Earlier that morning , Sadr City had been eerily quiet .
Cars moved slowly .
Residents ferried food and water , preparing for the worst .
Rubbish littered the charred streets .
On one road , two green Stryker vehicles were parked .
Outside Um Falah 's house , Mahdi fighters gathered , standing against the walls , peering down the street .
Clashes were unfolding on an adjacent road .
One group joined the fighting , but the others remained in place .
Their job was to protect their end of the block .
Um Falah continued her chores : ' I have got used to war , to all the battles in our lives . '
It was not the first time her son had gone to fight US troops and in her heart , she said , she knew it would not be the last .
' I have sent my son on the right path , ' she said .
In their living room , her husband and Abu Mustafa sat on red carpets set with colourful pillows .
The room was prepared for battle , with plastic windowpanes and drawn curtains .
On the wall hung tapestries depicting Imam Ali and other saints .
Thahabi , slim and gaunt - faced , said the Mahdi were not fighting only the Americans but also their Shia rivals - the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the ruling Dawa party .
Thahabi believes the government launched an offensive in Basra last Monday to weaken the Sadrist forces ahead of provincial elections scheduled for this year .
He thought Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , who leads the Dawa party , was taking advantage of a ceasefire imposed by Sadr last August .
Iraq 's government said it began the offensive to wipe out Basra 's Shia militias and criminal gangs .
' They know the Sadrists will win the elections , ' Thahabi said .
' So they are using the Americans against the Mahdi army .
People have reached a point that they will sell their refrigerator to buy a rocket launcher to kill Americans . '
At around 2 pm , three solemn - faced fighters entered the room , fresh from battle .
' Akeel , son of Riad , just got killed , ' said Abu Zainab al - Kabi .
The room fell silent .
Kabi , 34 , said Akeel had been planting a roadside bomb when he was shot several times by a US soldier .
Akeel was 22 and had followed his father and uncle into the Mahdi army when he was 17 .
The fighters took his body to the hospital mortuary .
If they could break away from the battle , they planned to carry it on Friday to the southern holy city of Najaf , where the Mahdi has built a cemetery for their dead , their martyrs .
' We are proud that he died , ' said Abu Moussa al - Sadr , 31 .
' Whenever one of us dies , it raises our morale . '
' It intensifies our fighting .
If we defeat them , we win , ' Kabi said .
' If we die , we win . '
Signs of sorrow for Akeel soon vanished ; they wanted to eat lunch .
Over a spartan meal of bread , tomato paste and vegetables , they said they had woken before dawn to make sure all their fighters were in position .
They ordered their men to check all the IEDs they had set and shared intelligence with commanders in other sections of Sadr City .
Suddenly , they heard mortar rounds being launched outside with a boom like the sound of a wrecking ball .
' This is to the Green Zone , ' said Kabi .
' These are gifts to Maliki 's government . '
He and Abu Moussa al - Sadr both work for Iraq 's Ministry of Interior , which runs the police and is viewed as infiltrated by the Mahdi army .
They said many police officers had defected and were now fighting with the Mahdi army .
The fighters also said they received neither support nor training from Iran , as American military commanders allege .
Their Iranian weapons , they said , were bought from smugglers .
They said they had been fighting only Americans and had not engaged with any Iraqi forces and insisted they were still obeying Sadr 's cease - fire and would stop fighting if he gave the order .
' We are allowed to defend ourselves , ' said fighter Abu Nargis .
Around 3 pm , it was time to leave .
' We 're going to the hospital to see Akeel 's body , ' Abu Moussa al - Sadr said .
' Then we are going back to fight . '
An hour later , another group were fighting US troops .
Militiamen jumped into the street , then quickly vanished .
The quick movements were a tactic .
Outside his parents ' house , Thahabi explained that fighters would direct a barrage of bullets at the Stryker to distract the soldiers while another group tried to slip a bomb under the vehicle .
A father of four who studied psychology in college , Thahabi looked more like a professor than a militia adviser .
He clutched three mobile phones , each using a different network .
When the Americans drive by , they jam the signals of the main network provider to neutralise the use of phones as detonators .
The fighters ' larger strategy , Thahabi said , was to draw pressure away from the Mahdi army in Basra .
Many Iraqi soldiers fighting in Basra had families in Sadr City .
' They will be worried for their families .
They will fear what will happen to them .
It 's about reducing morale . '
Thahabi received a phone call .
' The whole block has been surrounded by the Americans , ' he said .
Targeting the Green Zone , at 5.25 pm , the Mahdi army fired at least 10 rockets from near the house .
Within 20 minutes , four more were launched .
The rocket launches were followed by heavy gunfire at the Stryker .
' We have to keep the Americans nervous , on their edge , ' Thahabi said .
' We can't make it easy for them . '
Someone told him that there was a sniper on a nearby roof .
After a silent pause , fighters sprayed a burst of gunfire at a roof ; bullets tore into the wall .
Then silence again .
A few minutes later , gunfire was returned in the direction of the fighters .
The Americans were still around .
' They are facing heavy resistance , " said Abu Nargis .
He carried his baby daughter .
' They will raid the area tonight . '
By 7 pm , the Stryker had left .
At 9.05 pm , Abu Nargis received a phone call .
He said he had been told that a police commander with 500 men would stop working with the government and join the Mahdi .
At 9.09 pm , screams tore through the street .
A woman in a black abaya was walking toward the hospital wailing : ' My mother !
My mother !'
Her house had been hit , it was not clear by whom .
Ambulances and police vehicles drove past the house as an unmanned US drone flew by .
The vehicles drove back , carrying dead and injured .
At 10:35 pm , Abu Nargis received another phone call .
' The Americans are gone .
Even the snipers , ' he said .
' I have to go and check on my daughter .
She 's afraid of the gunfire . '
Next morning , Kabi was standing on a nearby street with a group of fighters , including two boys who looked no older than 13 .
They were getting instructions from an older fighter , who clutched an AK - 47 assault rifle .
They looked weary .
At the edge of Sadr City , four Strykers rolled by .
A white car waited patiently for the convoy to pass , then drove out , a wooden coffin strapped to the top .

We Are Change
May 19 , 2008
Members of WeAreChange were physically removed from Louisville Exposition Center on Sunday after confronting Iran Contra figure Oliver North .
Members questioned North on his involvement with Continuity of Government , the new 9/11 investigation and concentration camps in America .
Lt. Colonel Oliver North , a FOX News host , was confronted by a combination of activists from WeAreChange Ohio , and Kentuckiana Change .
Cody Deeds stood up during a question and answer session and asked North to explain exactly what the Continuity of Government was , at which point North went into his involvement with REX 84 during the Reagan Administration .
North explained that at the time it was a plan to continue government in the event of a Soviet attack .
As a follow up question , Deeds asked a question “ Given the knowledge of secondary devices in [ World Trade Center ] building 7 , would you support a new investigation of 9/11 . ”
North initially scoffed at the notion of government involvement , but Deeds reiterated that he had not mentioned the government and only wanted know if given knowledge of secondary devices , would he support a new investigation .
At which point , North replied , “ Investigate everything . ”
On North ’s way out of the forum , Sam Logulo asked ; “ North about the Iran Contra hearings and the presence of concentration camps in America . ”
North claimed “ The only concentration camps were shut down after World War II . ”
Logulo replied , “ Some of them are being reopened . ”
North said “ show me the proof . ”
Logulo said , “ Indiana , a suburb of Indianapolis , ” a reference to Beech Grove .
North told Logulo to send the evidence to his email address .
On the way out , the members gave a variety of DVDs including TerrorStorm and Blueprint for Truth to North .
In addition the members gave a Patriots Question 9/11 flier to North and an article about ex-Congressman Daniel Hamburg about evidence that the U.S. government created Al - Qaeda and were involved with 9/11 .
Later , Logulo told North that he would send him the information on the camps , but at this point , police surrounded the WeAreChange members .
At which point the officers told the members to shut off their cameras .
Adam Covington from Kentuckiana Change asked an officer , “ Why ca n’t I record this when I have a press pass , and this is a second and first amendment venue ? ”
Despite the lack of explanation from the police , the members shut off their devices and proceeded to walk out of the building .
While escorted out , a plainclothes officer yelled “ Give me your camera , ” and tried to snatch Logulo ’s camera from behind .
Four officers tackled Logulo , and drove him to the ground .
One officer put Logulo into a headlock .
“ Easy , easy , easy ! ” Logulo exclaimed .
“ I ’m not resisting . ”
As Logulo was being assaulted , Deeds was filming his fellow WeAreChange member in order to record the abuse .
He was told stop filming at which point he didnt comply and continued filming anyway .
“ Get him ! ” yelled a plainclothes officer as he ran at Deeds .
Three officers took Deeds down to his knees as they ripped the camera out of his hand .
Deeds tried to take the memory stick out of his camera , and was accused of “ tampering with evidence ” a Class D felony according to officer Rehm .
Deeds later explained , “ The footage was my only defense . ”
The police confiscated four memory cards , two battery packs , two sets of batteries , and a disc .
Throughout the 30 min ordeal the members of change were interrogated , harassed , and searched .
To prevent further harassment at future events we would appreciate any attourneys that would provide their support please contact Cody Deeds at WeAreChangeOhio.com .

Researchers have shown that immune - defense cells influenced by embryonic stem cell - derived cells can help prevent the rejection of hearts transplanted into mice , all without the use of immunosuppressive drugs .
The University of Iowa and the Iowa City Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Medical Center finding has implications for possible improvements in organ and bone marrow transplantation for humans .
People who need bone marrow or solid organ transplantation must take immunosuppressive drugs that can cause side effects nearly as severe as the disease they have .
They also can experience graft - versus - host disease , which can cause death .
These problems are spurring researchers to develop methods to reduce transplantation rejection , said the study 's principal investigator Nicholas Zavazava , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of internal medicine and director of transplant research at the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine .
" The idea behind the study is to ' prep ' a recipient 's immune system to make it receptive to the eventual organ or bone marrow donor 's genetic make - up , " said Zavazava , who also is a researcher and staff physician with the Iowa City VA Medical Center .
" The approach involves taking embryonic stem cells with the same genetic background as the donor from which the organ or bone marrow ultimately will come and adapting them into another type of stem cell that can be injected into the recipient . "
Specifically , the team treated mouse embryonic stem cells with a " cocktail " of growth factors , causing them to become blood stem cells .
These cells express very low levels of so - called " transplantation antigens " and are therefore protected from immunological rejection .

The researchers then injected the blood stem cells into the recipient mouse 's blood circulation .
These stem cells found their way into the recipient mouse 's thymus , where , as happens in humans , the recipient 's own bone marrow cells typically migrate and develop into immune - defense cells known as T - cells .
With the donor - related blood stem cells now present in the thymus , the mouse recipient 's own T - cells learned to recognize them as part of itself and therefore caused no rejection .
These now ' donor - friendly '
T - cells then circulated within the recipient mouse 's blood , Zavazava explained .
" When we then transplanted into the recipient mouse a donor mouse heart that had the same genetic make - up as the previously injected stem cells , the T - cells did n't reject the heart because they recognized it as compatible , " Zavazava said .
" If we could eventually use this approach for organ transplantation in humans , it would be a huge advantage over the method we 're currently using , " he added .
In addition to its potential for organ transplantation treatment , the embryonic stem cell - based method might also have implications for treating bone marrow diseases such as leukemia .
Because a mouse is so small , it was not possible in the study to remove the animal 's existing heart and replace it with another .
Thus , to test for transplant success , the study approach involved leaving the original heart intact , transplanting a second functional heart into the abdomen and then linking the transplanted heart to the aorta .
The UI study built on previous research led by Zavazava that focused on the concept of using embryonic stem cells as an alternative source of cells for traditional bone marrow transplantations .

English Grammar 101 : All You Need to Know By Daniel Scocco
Just ask a friend what is the role of prepositions within sentences , or what are the four moods of verbs , and I am sure that you will see a puzzled look on his face .
Understanding the basic grammar rules is essential for communicating efficiently , but most of us have forgotten those concepts years ago .
In order to solve this problem we decided to put together all the basic rules on a single page , so that you can use it as a refresher , or print it out for future reference .
Enjoy !
Sentences
Sentences are made of two parts : the subject and the predicate .
The subject is the person or thing that acts or is described in the sentence .
The predicate , on the other hand , is that action or description .
Complete sentences need both the subject and the predicate .
Clauses
Sentences can be broken down into clauses .
For example :
The boy is going to the school , and he is going to eat there .
This is a complete sentence composed of two clauses .
There are mainly two types of clauses : independent clauses and subordinate clauses .
Independent clauses act as complete sentences , while subordinate clauses cannot stand alone and need another clause to complete their meaning .
For example :
Independent clause example :
The boy went to the school .
Subordinate clause example :
After the boy went to the school …
Phrases
A group of two or more grammatically linked words that do not have subject and predicate is a phrase .
Example of a complete sentence :
The girl is at home , and tomorrow she is going to the amusement park .
Example of a clause :
The girl is at home
Example of a phrase :
The girl
You can see that “ the girl ” is a phrase located in the first clause of the complete sentence above .
Phrases act like parts of speech inside clauses .
That is , they can act as nouns , adjectives , adverbs and so on .
Parts of Speech
A word is a “ part of speech ” only when it is used in a sentence .
The function the word serves in a sentence is what makes it whatever part of speech it is .
For example , the word “ run ” can be used as more than one part of speech : .
Sammy hit a home run .
Run is a noun , direct object of hit .
You must n’t run near the swimming pool .
Run is a verb , part of the verb phrase must ( not ) run .
Traditional grammar classifies words based on eight parts of speech : the noun , the pronoun , the adjective , the verb , the adverb , the preposition , the conjunction , and the interjection .
We are going to cover them individually below .
Nouns
A noun is a word used to describe a person , place , thing , event , idea , and so on .
Nouns represent one of the main elements of sentences , along with verbs , adjectives , prepositions and articles .
Nouns usually function as subjects or objects within sentences , although they can also act as adjectives and adverbs .
Here is a list with the different types of nouns :
1. Proper nouns
Used to describe a unique person or thing , proper nouns always start with a capital letter .
Examples include Mary , India , and Manchester United .
2. Common nouns
Common nouns are used to describe persons or things in general .
Examples include girl , country , and team
3. Concrete nouns
Nouns that can be perceived through the five senses are called concrete nouns .
Examples include ball , rainbow and melody .
4. Abstract nouns
Nouns that cannot be perceived through the five senses are called abstract nouns .
Examples include love , courage , and childhood .
5. Countable nouns
Countable nouns can be counted .
They also have both a singular and a plural form .
Examples include toys , children and books .
6. Non-countable nouns
These nouns ( usually ) can not be counted , and they do n’t have a plural form .
Examples include sympathy , laughter and oxygen .
7. Collective nouns
Collective nouns are used to describe groups of things .
Examples include flock , committee and murder .
Plural Form of Nouns
The English language has both regular and irregular plural forms of nouns .
The most common case is when you need to add -s to the noun .
For example one car and two cars .
The other two cases of the regular plural form are :
nouns that end with s , x , ch or sh , where you add - es ( e.g. , one box , two boxes ) nouns that end with consonant + y , where you change the y with i and add - es ( e.g. , one enemy , two enemies )
On the irregular plural form of nouns there are basically eight cases :
nouns that end with -o , where you add - es ( e.g. , one potato , two potatoes ) nouns ending with - is , where you change - is to -es ( e.g. , one crisis , two crises ) nouns ending with -f , where you change –f to -v and add - es ( e.g. , one wolf , two wolves ) nouns ending with - fe , where you change -f to -v and add -s ( e.g. , one life , two lives ) nouns ending with - us , where you change - us to - i ( e.g. , one fungus , two fungi ) nouns that contain - oo , change - oo to -ee ( e.g. , one foot , two feet ) nouns that end with - on , where you change - on with - a ( e.g. , phenomenon , phenomena ) nouns that do n’t change ( e.g. , sheep , offspring , series )
It might appear overwhelming , but after using these nouns a couple of times you will be able to memorize their plural form easily .
Pronouns
Pronouns are used to replace nouns within sentences , making them less repetitive and mechanic .
For example , saying “ Mary did n’t go to school because Mary was sick ” does n’t sound very good .
Instead , if you say “ Mary did n’t go to school because she was sick ” it will make the sentence flow better .
There are several types of pronouns , below you will find the most common ones :
1. Subjective personal pronouns .
As the name implies , subjective pronouns act as subjects within sentences .
They are : I , you , he , she , we , they , and it .
Example : I am going to the bank while he is going to the market .
2. Objective personal pronouns .
These pronouns act as the object of verbs within sentences .
They are : me , you , him , her , us , them and it .
Example :
The ball was going to hit me in the face .
3. Possessive personal pronouns .
These pronouns are used to indicate possession , and they are placed after the object in question ( as opposed to possessive adjectives like my and your , which are placed before the object ) .
They are : mine , yours , his , hers , ours , theirs and its .
Example of possessive adjective :
This is my car .
Example of possessive pronoun :
This car is mine .
4. Reflexive pronouns .
This special class of pronouns is used when the object is the same as the subject on the sentence .
They are myself , yourself , himself , herself , ourselves , themselves and itself .
Example : I managed to cut myself in the kitchen .
5. Interrogative pronouns .
As you probably guessed these pronouns are used to ask questions .
They are what , which , who , whom and whose .
Example : What are the odds ?
6. Demonstrative pronouns .
These pronouns are used to indicate a noun and distinguish it from other entities .
Notice that demonstrative pronouns replace the noun ( while demonstrative determiners modify them ) .
They are : this , that , these , those .
Example of a demonstrative determiner :
This house is ugly .
Example of a demonstrative pronoun :
This is the right one .
7. Indefinite pronouns .
As the name implies , indefinite pronouns do not refer to a specific thing , place or person .
There are many of them , including anyone , anywhere , everyone , none , someone and so on .
Example : Everyone is going to the party .
Adjectives
An adjective is a word that describes a noun .
There are two kinds : attributive and predicative .
An adjective is used attributively when it stands next to a noun and describes it .
For example :
The black cat climbed a tree .
Notice that the verb participle forms can be used as adjectives :
The man felt a paralyzing fear .
Flavored oatmeal tastes better than plain oatmeal .
The usual place of the adjective in English is in front of the noun .
You can have a whole string of adjectives if you like :
The tall thin evil - looking cowboy roped the short , fat , inoffensive calf .
Sometimes , for rhetorical or poetic effect , the adjective can come after the noun :
Sarah Plain and Tall ( book title )
This is the forest primeval .
An adjective is used predicatively when a verb separates it from the noun or pronoun it describes :
The umpire was wrong .
The crowd was furious .
She seems tired today .
This soup tastes bad .
The dog ’s coat feels smooth .
The verbs that can be completed by predicate adjectives are called being verbs or copulative verbs .
They include all the forms of to be and sensing verbs like seem , feel , and taste .
Adjective Classifications
qualitative : good , bad , happy , blue , French
: good , bad , happy , blue , French possessive : my , thy , his , her , its , our , your , their
: my , thy , his , her , its , our , your , their relative and interrogative : which , what , whatever , etc .
: which , what , whatever , etc. numeral : one , two , second , single , etc .
: one , two , second , single , etc. indefinite : some , any , much , few , every , etc .
: some , any , much , few , every , etc. demonstrative : this , that , the , a ( an ) , such
The demonstrative adjectives the and a ( an ) are so important in English that they have a special name : articles .
They are discussed separately below .
Articles
The words a , an , and the are generally called articles and sometimes classed as a separate part of speech .
In function , however , they can be grouped with the demonstrative adjectives that are used to point things out rather than describe them .
Definite Article
The is called the definite article because it points out a particular object or class .
This is the book I was talking about .
The dodo bird is extinct .
Indefinite Article
A is called the indefinite article because it points out an object , but not any particular specimen .
a book , a dog , a lawn mower
The indefinite article has two forms :
A is used before words beginning with a consonant sound or an aspirated h :
a car , a lamb , a hope , a habit , a hotel
An is used before words beginning with a vowel sound :
an ape , an image , an untruth , an honorable man
Verbs
English has three kinds of Verbs : transitive , intransitive , and incomplete .
1. Transitive Verbs
A verb is transitive when the action is carried across to a receiver :
The farmer grows potatoes .
Elvis sang ballads .
The receiver is called the direct object .
It answers the question “ What ? ” or “ Whom ? after the verb .
Grows what ?
Potatoes .
Sang what ?
Ballads .
2. Intransitive Verbs
A verb is intransitive when the action stays with the verb .
It is not carried across to a receiver :
Corn grows .
Elvis sang .
Adding a prepositional phrase to modify the verb does not change the fact that the action remains with the subject :
Corn grows in the fields .
Elvis sang all over the world .
Both transitive and intransitive verbs are action verbs .
3. Incomplete Verbs
There are three types of incomplete verbs :
i. being verbs – also called linking or copulative verbs
to be , seem , become , taste , smell , sound , feel
Tip : Some of these verbs can also be used transitively .
If in doubt , substitute a form of to be for the verb .
If the sentence still makes sense , the verb is being used as a copulative verb :
He feels depressed .
He is depressed .
He feels the wall .
He is the wall .
ii . auxiliary verbs – also called helping verbs
be , have , shall , will , do , and may .
He could have gone earlier .
iii .
semi-auxiliary verbs
must , can , ought , dare , need .
You must not go .
You dare not go .
Verbs Voice
English verbs are said to have two voices : active and passive .
Active Voice : the subject of the sentence performs the action :
His son catches fly balls .
Creative children often dream in class .
Note : Verbs in the active voice may be either transitive or intransitive .
Passive Voice : the subject receives the action :
The ball was caught by the first baseman .
The duty is performed by the new recruits .
The dough was beaten by the mixer .
The mailman was bitten by the dog .
Only transitive verbs can be used in the passive voice .
What would be the direct object of the verb in the active voice becomes the subject of the verb in the passive voice :
Active voice :
The dog bit the mailman .
“ bit ” is a transitive verb .
The receiver / direct object is “ mailman . ”
Passive voice :
The mailman was bitten by the dog .
“ bit ” is now in the passive voice .
The “ receiver ” has become the subject of the verb .
A passive verb in either present or past tense will always have two parts : some form of the verb to be ( am , is , are , was , were ) , and a past participle ( verb form ending in - ed , - en , or any form used with have when forming a perfect tense ) .
Note :
The mere presence of the verb to be does not indicate that a verb is in the passive voice .
The test of a verb in the passive voice is the two - part question :
Is the subject performing the action of the verb or is the subject receiving the action of the verb ?
If the subject is receiving the action , then the verb is in passive voice .
Sometimes the passive voice is the best way to express a thought .
Used carelessly , however , passive voice can produce a ponderous , inexact writing style .
Verbs Mood
English verbs have four moods : indicative , imperative , subjunctive , and infinitive .
Mood is the form of the verb that shows the mode or manner in which a thought is expressed .
1. Indicative Mood : expresses an assertion , denial , or question :
Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas .
Ostriches cannot fly .
Have you finished your homework ?
2. Imperative Mood : expresses command , prohibition , entreaty , or advice :
Do n’t smoke in this building .
Be careful !
Do n’t drown that puppy !
3. Subjunctive Mood : expresses doubt or something contrary to fact .
Modern English speakers use indicative mood most of the time , resorting to a kind of “ mixed subjunctive ” that makes use of helping verbs :
If I should see him , I will tell him .
Americans are more likely to say :
If I see him , I will tell him .
The verb may can be used to express a wish :
May you have many more birthdays .
May you live long and prosper .
The verb were can also indicate the use of the subjunctive :
If I were you , I would n’t keep driving on those tires .
If he were governor , we ’d be in better fiscal shape .
4. Infinitive Mood : expresses an action or state without reference to any subject .
It can be the source of sentence fragments when the writer mistakenly thinks the infinitive form is a fully - functioning verb .
When we speak of the English infinitive , we usually mean the basic form of the verb with “ to ” in front of it : to go , to sing , to walk , to speak .
Verbs said to be in the infinitive mood can include participle forms ending in - ed and - ing .
Verbs in the infinitive mood are not being used as verbs , but as other parts of speech :
To err is human ; to forgive , divine .
Here , to err and to forgive are used as nouns .
He is a man to be admired .
Here , to be admired is an adjective , the equivalent of admirable .
It describes the noun man .
He came to see you .
Here , to see you is used as an adverb to tell why he came .
Verbs Tense
Modern English has six tenses , each of which has a corresponding continuous tense .
The first three tenses , present , past , and future , present few problems .
Only third person singular in the present tense differs in form :
Present tense of regular ( weak ) verbs :
Today I walk .
Today he walks .
Yesterday I walked .
Tomorrow I shall / will walk .
The dwindling class of irregular ( strong ) verbs must be learned individually .
Today I go .
Today he goes .
Yesterday I went .
Tomorrow I shall / will go .
The other three tenses , perfect , pluperfect , and future perfect , are formed with the helping verbs have , has , and had .
perfect : used to express an event that has just finished , and to describe an event which , although in the past , has effects that continue into the present .
Queen Elizabeth has reigned for 56 years .
pluperfect ( past perfect ) : used to express an event that took place before another action , also in the past .
I had driven all the way to Oklahoma when I realized my mistake .
future perfect : used to express an event that will have taken place at some time in the future .
As of February 26 , I shall have been in this job six years .
For complete conjugation tables of weak and strong English verbs , see the Wikipedia article .
Adverbs
Adverbs are used to describe or modify a verb , adjective , clause , or another adverb .
Basically , they modify everything except nouns and pronouns ( which are modified by adjectives ) .
Example of an adverb modifying a verb :
He was running fast .
( fast modifies running )
Example of an adverb modifying an adjective :
She took a very small piece of the cake .
( very modifies small )
Example of an adverb modifying a sentence : Strangely , the man left the room .
( strangely modifies the whole sentence )
Usually adverbs answer to the questions “ When ? ” ( adverbs of time ) , “ Where ? ” ( adverbs of place ) , and “ How ? ” ( adverbs of manner ) .
Adverbs can also be used to connect clauses and sentences ( in this case they are called conjunctive adverbs ) .
For example :
It was dark .
Therefore , we needed the torch .
( therefore connects the two sentences )
Prepositions
Prepositions are used to link nouns and pronouns to other words within a sentence .
The words linked to are called objects .
Usually prepositions show a spatial or temporal relationship between the noun and the object , like in the example below :
The cat is under the table .
Cat is the noun .
Under is the preposition .
Table is the object .
Here is a list with the most common prepositions : about , above , after , among , around , along , at , before , behind , beneath , beside , between , by , down , from , in , into , like , near , of , off , on , out , over , through , to , up , upon , under , and with .
Notice that you can also have a prepositional phrase , which is formed by the preposition and its object .
A preposition phrase can function as adverb , adjective or noun .
For example :
The dog was running under the rain .
The prepositional phrase “ under the rain ” acts as an adverb , specifying where the dog was running .
Conjunctions
A conjunction joins words and groups of words .
There are two classes of conjunction : co-ordinate or coordinating and subordinate or subordinating .
Co-ordinate conjunctions : and , but , either…or , neither …nor .
Subordinate conjunctions : that , as , after , before , since , when , where , unless , if .
Mother and Father are driving me to New Orleans .
( and is a coordinate conjunction joining words of equal significance in the sentence .
I painted the walls but Jack painted the woodwork .
( but is a coordinate conjunction joining clauses of equal significance in the sentence .
Either clause could stand alone as a sentence . )
Since you ca n’t get away , we ’ll go without you .
( Since is a subordinate conjunction joining a less important thought to a more important thought .
The main clause , we ’ll go without you , can stand alone as a complete thought .
The subordinate clause , Since you ca n’t get away , is an incomplete thought .
It is dependent upon the main clause for meaning . )
Note :
The relative pronouns who , whom , which , and that are used in the same way that subordinate conjunctions are .
The difference is that the relative pronouns serve three purposes at once :
1 ) they stand for a noun in the main clause
2 ) they connect the clauses
3 ) they serve as a subject or object word in the subordinate clause :
He is the man who invented the hula hoop .
( who stands for man and is the subject of invented )
Charles is the boy whom the other children tease .
( whom stands for boy and is the object of tease )
Give me the piece of string that is waxed .
( that stands for string and is the subject of is waxed )
There goes the horse which won the Derby .
( which refers to horse and is the subject of won )
The possessive adjective whose can also be used to join clauses :
That ’s the bird whose plumage I admire .
( whose refers to bird and describes plumage )
Interjections
Interjection comes from from a Latin word that means “ throw between . ”
It ’s a word or phrase that is thrown into a sentence to express an emotion :
Goodness , how you ’ve grown !
Darn , I forgot my lunch !
Alas , will he never return ?
All the impolite expressions that we call expletives are interjections .
Strictly speaking , an interjection is not a part of speech .
It serves no grammatical function but is rather “ a noisy utterance like the cry of an animal ” ( F.J. Rahtz ) .
Interjections express feeling or emotion , not thought and have been called “ the miserable refuge of the speechless . ”
If you ’ve ever stood lunch duty on a high school campus , you know just how vapid conversation can be when larded with meaningless interjections .

9:46 PT - JS : Hi everyone .
I 'm Macworld Editorial Director Jason Snell , and I 'm here with Macworld Associate Editor Dan Moren .
Together we 'll be liveblogging the event from the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco , just next to the Moscone Center .
Also here for Macworld are Senior Editors Dan Frakes and Chris Breen .
Stay tuned for live coverage and photos of the event , as it happens .
9:48 PT - DM :
As promised , we are indeed " rocking out " , right now to Credence Clearwater Revival — Fortunate Son , for the curious — and other classic rock tunes .
9:49 PT - JS :
As we entered , they were playing " Sunshine of Your Love " by Cream .
I can't hear that one without imagining Ray Liotta scanning the skies for police helicopters .
But maybe that 's just me .
9:50 PT - DM : Now we 're onto the Stones , " Gimme Shelter . "
Maybe someone 's just playing Rock Band backstage .
10:00 PT - DM :
The lights are going down , so we 're about ready to go here .
And ... silence .
And Steve Jobs hits the stage .
Unsurprisingly , it 's the standard black turtleneck and jeans .
10:00 PT - DM : " We 've got some really exciting stuff to share with you . " before we do , " The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated . "
That gets a nice laugh and a round of applause .
" Enough said . "
The real topic of this morning is music .
10:01 PT - DM : We 'll start with iTunes .
Now over 8.5 million songs .
Started off with just 200,000 .
Over 125,000 podcasts .
Over 35,000 TV shows , 2,600 Hollywood movies .
Over 3,000 apps for iPhone / iPod touch .
10:02 PT - JS : What an excellent way to start .
Bat down any rumors and questions without actually revealing any personal information .
Just address it and move on .
I 'm sure some people wo n't like it , but it 's a very Apple thing to do and I 'm glad that Jobs addressed it , however briefly .
10:02 PT - DM : Over 65,000,000 accounts in iTunes .
That 's a whole lot of credit cards .
They 've climbed to the top of the music distributor chain , in any format .
Topping Walmart , Best Buy , Amazon , and Target .
10:03 PT - DM : Adding new content .
HD television shows are the first thing .
You can buy SD shows for $ 1.99 ; HD shows will be $ 2.99 and you can watch them on your computer ( as opposed to on your fireplace ? ) .
And NBC is coming back to iTunes too .
They 're bringing all their shows back :
The Office , Monk , Battlestar Galactica , 30 Rock , Heroes , etc .
And they 'll be in HD .
Wonder what kind of deal they made with NBC to get that ?
10:05 PT - JS : I 'll note that they are charging more for HD .
I wonder if that was something to help NBC feel better about the store .
Also , come on , NBC wants the money and Apple wants the content .
I wonder how much pride was what stood in the way of the deal .
But it 's back in time for the fall season !
Hurrah !
10:04 PT - DM : iTunes 8 is coming out today .
A ton of new stuff in it .
Here are the few main pieces : HD TV shows , as mentioned , accessibility .
Built - in VoiceOver and other accessibility technologies .
There are some new browsing options and something called " Genius . "
10:04 PT - DM : Steve 's showing off album browsing , but it 's not so space efficient , especially for when you have few tracks per album .
Adding ability to look at albums by album cover , and you can also look at albums by artist ( just like in iPhoto , you can skim them ) .
And it works with movies , TV shows , including unwatched episodes , podcasts , etc .
10:06 PT - DM : Genius .
A new feature that lets you automatically make playlists from songs in your music library that " go great together - with just one click . "
There 's a button in the bottom right corner that lets you make a Genius playlist .
It 's got a drop down for track limit .
A genius sidebar makes recommendations from the iTunes store that might match the Genius playlist .
10:08 PT - JS : Just a funny note from the event .
We are surrounded by the sound of fast , furious typing fingers .
Is the entire world liveblogging this event ?
I suspect it is .
They 're all here .
10:07 PT - DM : How 's it work ?
The iTunes Store is up in the cloud and they added " Genius algorithms " that they 've developed .
You can turn it on and it'll send info to iTunes about your music library : track names , play counts , ratings , playlists ( seems like a good way to build a huge library of information ) .
It 's all anonymous ; your IDs are not kept around .
Not just info from one person , obviously : they combined it with all the other iTunes users as well .
As more people send up their information , Genius gets smarter and smarter , and the results start .
( Dan Frakes comments to me that this is how Skynet starts .
Come with Steve if you want to live ! )
10:09 PT - DM : Here 's a demo of Genius .
The browsing interface looks a lot like iPhoto .
He 's playing " Respect " by Aretha Franklin ; classy choice .
It works in Genre too , with little placeholder icons for the different music types .
Can also scan albums by composer , which is nice for Classical fans .
We 're going to take a look at an HD TV show — The Office .
I think he 's actually showed this clip before .
10:11 PT - JS : Lots of applause for that clip .
Honestly , I think the clapping was more for Jim once again frustrating Dwight ( this time by pairing his bluetooth headset with Dwight 's phone ) than about the HD quality .
But it did look good .
10:11 PT - DM : And now Steve 's playing John Mayer .
We knew he had to show up in some form , right ?
So , he 's made a playlist of songs that go with Mayer 's piece .
Coldplay , for example .
Here 's another one , with Elvis .
He picks Heartbreak Hotel .
Make a playlist out of that and it adds Buddy Holly , Roy Orbison , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley and more .
Bringing out the sidebar shows some Elvis albums that Steve 's missing and some other artists like Jerry Lee Lewis , Fats Domino , and others .
10:13 PT - JS : I think it 's safe to say that we are officially rocking .
Right , Dan ?
Are we rocking now ?
10:13 PT - DM : iTunes 8 is available today as a free download at apple.com .
And yes , Jason , we are indeed proverbially " rocking . "
10:14 PT - DM : Now on to the iPod.
NPD Data shows iPod with 73.4 % market share in U.S. Number two is actually " other " — no name brands aggregated together — with 15 % .
SanDisk is # 3 with 8.6 and # 4 is Microsoft with 2.6 % .
Around 5,000 iPod accessories .
" They announce products even before we want them to .
It 's , uh , funny . " 90 % of U.S. cars offer iPod integration .
Cumulative iPod sales over 160 million .
10:15 PT - DM :
Here are some updates and new products for holiday season .
iPod classic is first up : thick and thin versions .
Almost everybody has one of the thin ones , not the thick ones , so they 're discontinuing the thick one .
The 80 GB jumps to 120GB for the same $ 249 .
Started with 1,000 songs in your pocket ; now 30,000 songs .
10:16 PT - DM : iPod nano .
Shipped the first nano in 2005 .
Second generation in 2006 , third - gen in 2007 .
Only three years .
But we have a new iPod nano for this holiday season .
And it looks a lot like the spyshots that have been going around : much taller with a larger screen .
" Best of both worlds . "
Portrait aspect ratio and same display in portrait mode .
Thinnest iPod they 've ever made .
Looks to be about the same height as the 1G and 2G .
He 's got one in his pocket .
Nice looking screen .
Pretty darn thin ; it 's got an oval cross-section .
( Is it just me , or does Steve 's shirt have a seam down the front of it ? )
10:17 PT - JS :
Is this the last update ever for the classic iPod ?
I suspect it may be .
10:18 PT - DM : New curved aluminum design , and curved glass over the display .
Thinnest iPod ever built , enhanced user interface , and it's got the iPhone / iPod touch 's accelerometer .
And you can create Genius playlists right on the nano .
The new interface looks a lot like the interface introduced with the 3G nano / iPod classic .
Full - sized album art , and it inserts album covers at the bottom .
And , of course , you can flip it into landscape mode .
Holding down center button brings up a pop-up menu , browse albums , artist , build genius playlist all from the playing .
Voice Recording program built - in , along with all the other standard additions ( clock , timer , etc. )
10:22 PT - JS :
It 's interesting , Apple is rolling in features that used to be more advanced or only available with add - ons , right into the product .
The nano is basically the mainstream iPod now , if it was n't already .
10:20 PT - DM : Demo time .
We 're playing Beck and Steve flips the iPod sideways and it goes into Cover Flow .
Now he 's flipping through and picking Bob Dylan and listening to a new song .
Pushing down the center button lets him start a Genius playlist based on the Dylan song .
Holy crap , if you shake the iPod , it 'll shuffle your songs .
" I did n't really want to tell you that I had Dean Martin on my iPod . "
A quick look at photos .
Tilt it and you go to landscape .
" Just works really , really well . "
And that 's the iPod nano .
10:23 PT - JS :
He shakes that nano a second time and it's John Mayer .
That dude is everywhere !
Is he getting royalties ?
Free Apple computers for life ?
10:23 PT - DM :
The nano gets a pretty nice round of applause from the audience .
They 've also got improved battery life : 24 hours of music and 4 hours of video .
They also want to be environmentally conscious : we have an internal environmental checklist that we use on everything .
The new iPods 's have arsenic - free glasss , BFR - free , Mercury - free , PVC - free and highly recyclable materials .
" There 's more we 're going to do in the future , but these are the cleanest , toxic - free iPods we 've ever built . "
10:25 PT - DM : Nano-chromatic .
They come in " the best colors we 've ever done . "
And yes , Steve Jobs has put rainbows in the iPod , at long last .
Purple , blue , green , yellow , orange , red , pink , and silver .
And the prices : $ 149 for 8 GB ; $ 199 for 16GB .
Both are shipping today ; 8 GB 's shipping today , 16GB should be in stock by the weekend .
10:26 PT - DM : Let 's talk accessories : armband .
New headphones have a built - in remote : pause / play , goes to the next song , and triple click it goes to previous song , and there 's volume up / down controls .
That 's pretty sweet .
And there 's even a mic built - in for the Voice Recording app .
If only I actually liked the iPod headphones .
Headphones will ship for $ 29 next month .
10:27 PT - JS : Score !
The nano comes with headphones with a built - in inline remote , with volume controls as well as next / previous .
Of course , you have to use Apple 's headphones .
Some of us love them , some of us hate them , but that 's pretty cool .
10:28 PT - DM : New in - ear headphones .
" We think we 've finally got these right . "
Ship with three sets of earbuds , 2 drivers ( woofer and tweeter ) in each side .
Sell for $ 79 in October .
And here 's the new ad .
" If you 'd like to see it , I 'd love to show it for you . "
Nobody ever says " no " to that , huh ?
There 's apparently a black nano .
Sounds like Feist , not sure .
And they show the colors bleeding of all of them — that 's actually a little creepy .
10:29 PT - DM : Let 's move on to the iPod touch .
For this holiday season , we 're making the iPod touch even better .
It looks a lot like the iPhone .
Same tapered back .
Looks like it has external volume control .
And it 's apparently even thinner than the last .
Same 3.5 " display ; integrated volume controls , which was the # 1 request they got ( including Mr. Frakes ) ; accelerometer ; wireless network ; built - in speaker ( really hard with something this thin —
" It 's for casual listening ; this is not for audiophiles . " ) ;
Genius playlist creation ; and the App Store built - in .
Demo time ( saw a quick flash of a Nike + iPod app ) .
10:31 PT - JS :
This is great to see .
This basically brings some of the most important missing features from the iPod touch -- which made it difficult for it to use some iPhone software with it .
If the nano is now the mainstream iPod , the iPod touch is fast on its heels .
10:31 PT - DM : Slight UI tweaks .
They 've built in Nike +
iPod in to the iPod touch .
And the iPod touch does n't even need the little receiver to plug into the dock - connector port .

Here 's something that John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and even longtime Washingtonian Joe Biden probably do n't know .
Not to mention Bob Barr , Ralph Nader and Ron Paul , who usually knows everything .
It 's a fascinating footnote to the economic and political bailout debate that 's kept so many people from more properly focusing on the pennant races and the Colts ' problems in the last week .
( Incidentally , do you think we'd have had this big fight if President Bush had called it a " rescue " plan instead ? )
Our buddy from two lifetimes ago , Carl Lavin over at Forbes.com , points out a fascinating paragraph buried in a story on his website late last week by Brian Wingfield and Josh Zumbrun .
You know , this $ 700 - billion figure that exploded into ev eryday political parlance almost as fast as Sarah ?
The $ 700 - billion " cost " of resolving the financial crisis and restoring confidence and liquidity in the credit markets starting this morning ?
The $ 700 - billion figure that Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid first said he could really use McCain 's help with , but then the Arizonan took him up on it and Reid suddenly said the Republican would only get in the way and anyway , Reid said , he already had a done deal , except he did n't and the Nevadan ended up being the embarrassed one ?
The $ 700 - billion figure that dominated the first part of the first presidential debate of the 2008 general election season between McCain and Obama ?
The $ 700 - billion figure that wo n't really end up being anywhere near the actual cost because no one knows what all those mortgaged properties are really worth now anyway ?
Which is the whole problem in the first place because the institutions holding that paper do n't know the value of what they 're holding either , which is why everyone suddenly got so frightened ?
That $ 700 - billion figure that wo n't really last because eventually the feds will sell off what they 're buying and might even make a profit in the end as they did with the Chrysler bailout warrants years ago ?
You know where that very important $ 700 - billion figure came from ?
Here 's a quote from that Forbes story :
" It 's not based on any particular data point , " a Treasury spokeswoman told Forbes.com Tuesday .
" We just wanted to choose a really large number . "
They made it up to be sufficiently ginormous to frighten everyone into rapid action .
And it worked .

Climate Reality Eludes the Business Press
For the Wall Street Journal 's editors , fear of a bigger
government outweighs the fear of a warmer planet .
By John Miller
This article is from the July / August 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the July / August 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
Cap and Spend .
As the Senate opens debate on its mammoth carbon regulation program this week , the phrase of the hour is " cap and trade . "
This sounds innocuous enough .
But anyone who looks at the legislative details will quickly see that a better description is cap and spend .
This is easily the largest income redistribution scheme since the income tax .
— Wall Street Journal editorial , June 2 , 2008
Climate Reality Bites .
Cap and trade is a tax imposed on business , disguising the true costs and thus making it more politically palatable .
In reality , firms will merely pass on these costs to customers .
... politicians like cap and trade ... because it gives them a cut of the action and the ability to pick winners and losers .
Some of the allowances would be given away , at least at the start , while the rest would be auctioned off , with the share of auctions increasing over time .
This is a giant revenue grab .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this meddling would cause a cumulative reduction in the growth of GDP by between 0.9 % and 3.8 % by 2030 . — Wall Street Journal editorial , May 27 , 2008
The Wall Street Journal 's editors are celebrating having dodged a big - government bullet when the cap - and - trade global warming bill sponsored by Joe Lieberman and John Warner , as amended by Barbara Boxer , went down to defeat this June in the Senate .
But the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 was a fairly low caliber munition in the fight against global warming .
While undoubtedly the most comprehensive global warming bill ever to reach the Senate floor , its emission reductions fell well short of those called for by environmental groups or by the Clinton and Obama campaigns .
Inside Cap-and - Trade
" Cap - and - trade , " introduced in the 1990 Clean Air Act to regulate sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) emissions or acid rain , is now the favorite form of environmental regulation for politicians and big business .
They find it far preferable to either command - and - control regulation , such as federal directives ordering electrical power plants to install smokestack scrubbers , or emissions taxes , such as a broad - based carbon tax .
Cap - and - trade , referred to variously as incentive - based regulation or market - based regulation , works this way .
The federal government sets a mandatory , nationwide cap on carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions that it gradually reduces .
At the same time the government requires companies , or any emitter , to hold allowances for their emissions .
Typically each allowance entitles a company to emit one ton of CO 2 .
After the government either auctions off allowances or issues them to companies based on their energy output or usage , holders are free to buy and sell them .
Companies that can reduce emissions cheaply , usually those with newer plants , will likely cut their emissions below the standard for their industry and sell their unused allowances ( or , if allowances are auctioned rather than issued for free , buy fewer of them ) , reducing their abatement costs .
Companies with relatively high abatement costs , usually those with older plants , can be expected to buy additional permits ( either from other companies or the government ) at a price well below their cost of abatement so that they can reduce emissions by less than the industry standard .
The flexibility , or " non-uniform abatement , " afforded by permit trading allows the least costly abatements to be carried out first , lowering the overall cost of meeting any given environmental target .
The Climate Security Act would have required the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to establish a cap - and - trade program to cover U.S. electrical power , transportation , manufacturing , and natural gas sources that together account for 87 % of U.S greenhouse - gas emissions .
Beginning in 2012 , the EPA would steadily reduce the cap on total emissions , down to 71 % below their 2005 level by 2050 .
Over the life of the program the EPA would auction off the majority of allowances , but initially about 40 % would be given away , ostensibly to help industries make the transition to lower emissions .
Revenue from the auctions , estimated at $ 5.6 trillion over the life of the bill , would be used to finance some relief for the poor to offset increases in utility bills , training and assistance for workers , deficit reduction , research on clean - energy technologies , and an array of subsidies for electric and gas utilities , the coal industry , auto manufacturers , oil refiners , and the nuclear industry .
Big but Not Big Enough
That is the giant revenue grab the Journal 's editors protest .
Still , it 's over the top to compare $ 5.6 trillion over four decades — that 's $ 147 billion a year , or less than 6 % of current federal government revenue — to the income tax , which increased government revenue nearly eightfold when it became a broad - based tax during World War II .
And today , the $ 869.6 billion collected in payroll taxes in 2007 and redistributed through the Social Security system dwarfs the revenues that would be collected by this cap - and - trade proposal .
Alas , as big as the editors say it is , the Lieberman - Warner plan would not have brought about the 80 % emissions reduction ( below 1990 levels ) the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) says is necessary by 2050 to avoid the worst effects of climate change .
Next year 's new president will be more favorably disposed to regulating greenhouse gases than the Bush administration , which threatened to veto the Lieberman - Warner bill .
Barack Obama favors a cap - and - trade system that would reduce carbon emissions to " 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 " and would " require all pollution credits to be auctioned . "
John McCain supports what could best be described as " cap - and - trade lite . "
His plan would set limits on greenhouse gases at 66 % below 2005 levels , not so different from the Lieberman - Warner proposal , but well short of the level recommended by the IPCC .
It would issue permits to polluters for free , at least initially , then convene a commission to determine what share of future allowances would be provided for free versus auctioned .
McCain opposed the Climate Security
Act because in his view it did not offer enough aid to the nuclear industry .
While the support for nukes in the Lieberman - Warner bill was not explicit , it was quite generous .
Karl Grossman , host of the nationally syndicated TV program " Enviro Close - Up , " estimates that $ 544 billion in subsidies for the development of new nuclear power plants were buried in the bill .
The bill would have effectively doubled government subsidies for the nuclear industry , already the single most subsidized industry in the energy sector — but that was not enough for McCain .
Auction or Issue ?
Besides this alleged revenue grab , what has got the Wall Street Journal editors in a lather is that the Senate bill would have auctioned off the majority of its permits instead of giving them away free .
For environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth , the " polluter pays " principle demands that 100 % of pollution permits be auctioned .
The amended Lieberman - Warner plan fell well short of that standard .
The 40 % of permits it would have given away in the initial phase went well beyond the 15 % level the Congressional Budget Office estimates affected companies would need to compensate their shareholders for any decline in the value of their stock caused by a drop in demand for energy and energy - intensive products following regulation .
In fact , the CBO worries that the bill 's permit giveaways could end up as " windfall profits " for oil , gas , coal , and other polluting industries .
Even mainstream , conservative economists disagree with the editors .
Greg Mankiw , former chair of Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers , headed the list of hundreds of economists who signed the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy ( SACE ) Economist Statement urging that permits be auctioned off , not given away .
As the SACE statement made clear , whether permits are issued or auctioned will not affect energy prices or deter corporations from passing on the cost of abatement to consumers through higher prices .
In either case , market forces of supply and demand will determine those price changes for any particular product .
Giving away permits to polluters will not protect families and businesses from higher energy prices .
Indeed , higher energy prices carry a benefit : they prompt energy conservation .
That is already evident this summer in the United States , where rising gas prices have driven spending on energy as a share of wage income above 6 % — higher than during the 1974 - 75 and 1990 - 91 oil price shocks .
Cars now outsell SUVs by the largest margin since 1996 , GM is preparing to sell off its Hummer brand , mass transit ridership has increased , and bicycle sales are up .
For an economist , auctions are superior to allocations not because they prevent higher prices but because they ensure the government has the resources necessary to offset those higher costs .
How the government spends the auction revenue determines who bears the burden of the cost of cutting CO 2 emissions .
Energy price increases are regressive , hitting low - income consumers hardest .
The CBO estimates that a 15 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , the goal of the Lieberman - Warner bill for 2020 , would cost the poorest fifth of families 3.3 % of their after - tax income , but only about half that ( 1.7 % ) for the richest fifth of families .
But using only about 14 % of the total value of the permits , lawmakers could fund a rebate program that would erase the bill 's impact on the poorest 20 % of households and provide significant relief to those in the next poorest fifth , according to a recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) .
Unfortunately , the Lieberman - Warner bill would have allotted low - income consumers only about half of what the CBPP recommends , and it would have delivered those benefits via a hodgepodge of mechanisms as opposed to the straightforward climate tax credit the center proposed .
Other proposals would devote most or all of the revenue from allowance auctions to compensating consumers for the higher energy costs they would face following new CO 2 regulations .
For instance , the " sky trust " plan is modeled after the Alaska Permanent Fund , which pays out an annual share of oil earnings to each resident of the state .
A sky trust would use the revenue from auctioning off CO 2 permits to issue an annual dividend check to every U.S. resident .
How much compensation would such a plan provide ?
The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model estimates that a cap - and - trade program that cuts carbon emissions to 50 % below 1990s levels by 2050 , somewhat less stringent than the amended Lieberman - Warner bill , would generate $ 392 billion in auction revenues in 2020 .
That sum would finance dividend checks of $ 963 per person — enough to compensate all but the most well - to - do households for the higher energy costs they would face if the Lieberman - Warner emissions goal for 2020 were met , according to the CBO .
But these results are predicated on auctioning off 100 % of initial allowances and on a political willingness to devote the revenues generated by cap - and - trade regulation to promoting economic justice .
Strangely enough , both of these policies should be popular with the Wall Street Journal set .
Auctioning all permits would eliminate corporations ' incentive to lobby for favorable treatment ( i.e. , the free permits ) .
In addition , distributing every dollar of auction revenue to the public in the form of dividends would drain Washington 's coffers of the money that the federal government might otherwise use to finance the kind of industrial policy adventure that so concerns the Journal editors .
How Fast Will We Grow ?
Lawmakers could also devote allowance revenues from a cap - and - trade program to reducing the cost to corporations of meeting the new emissions targets , in an effort to sustain economic growth .
Would the Lieberman - Warner plan , or even a more aggressive cap - and - trade policy , slow economic growth ?
How much ?
The answer is not altogether clear and depends heavily on the responsiveness of innovation to higher carbon or energy prices .
The EPA estimates suggesting that cap - and - trade will cause a cumulative reduction in GDP growth of between 0.9 % and 3.8 % by 2030 reported by the editors are quite alarming .
But those estimates need to be examined critically and put into context .
First , the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) described the upper range of the EPA 's estimates as an outlier , quite different from the estimates produced by the seven other models the CRS examined .
Among the other models , 2.7 % was the largest projected decline in GDP , and five of the seven models projected a loss of 1 % of GDP or less .
On top of that , the models ' predictions of U.S. GDP in the year 2030 under business as usual ( i.e. , without cap - and - trade ) vary far more than their projections of the economic impact of a carbon cap .
When Nathaniel Keohane and Peter Goldmark of the Environmental Defense Fund examined these same studies , they found that each of them projects average U.S. economic growth of 2.5 % to 3 % a year over this period , and each predicts the U.S. economy will be more than twice as large in 2030 as it was in 2005 even after taking into account whatever dampening effect cap - and - trade has on economic growth .
As they put it , these economic models predict that U.S. GDP will reach $ 26 trillion around January of 2030 under business as usual .
With a carbon cap , it will get there by April .
While not cost free , cap - and - trade regulation is " surprisingly affordable " according to Keohane and Goldmark .
Plus , the size of U.S. GDP two or four decades from now will depend more on other macroeconomic conditions than on the cost of curbing carbon emissions .
A Green Industrial Policy
Along with a partial cap - and - dividend program or a rebate for low - income consumers , there is a case to be made for spending much of the revenue from auctioning permits on an environmental industrial policy to dramatically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels .
Pioneering environmental scientist and activist Barry Commoner insists that public policy needs " to confront the corporate domain at its most powerful and guarded point — the exclusive right to govern the systems of production " if it is to transform the environment and the economy .
" If managed properly , ending dependence on fossil fuels and building a clean energy economy could generate millions of good jobs , " argues economist Robert Pollin , co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute .
Pollin estimates that investments in conservation and renewable energy to match a 25 % cut in spending on fossil fuels over a 20 - year period would produce a net increase of about 2.5 million jobs .
Sadly , that is not what the Climate Security Act of 2008 was about .
It devoted more monies to fossil fuel and coal than to promoting renewable energy , clean technology , and mass transit .
But fixing the climate , as Commoner has always said , will not happen with half - measures that reward corporate America .

Enlarge By Mandel Ngan , AFP / Getty Images Sen. Patrick Leahy , left , welcomes FBI chief Robert Mueller on Wednesday at the Judiciary panel hearing .
WASHINGTON  Senate leaders on Wednesday expressed serious doubts about the FBI 's assertion that Army scientist Bruce Ivins was the lone attacker in the 2001 anthrax assaults that killed five people and sickened 17 others .
A day after FBI Director Robert Mueller said he was confident in the agency 's case , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , one of the two senators targeted in the attacks , said he believes there are " others who could be charged with murder . "
" I do not believe in any way , shape or manner that he was the only one involved , " Leahy told Mueller at a committee hearing .
Ivins , an anthrax scientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md. , committed suicide in July as federal investigators built their case against him .
Paul Kemp , Ivins ' attorney , says the scientist was innocent .
Mueller defended the case Tuesday in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , saying that investigators had made a " clear identification , " tracing the deadly anthrax contained in a series of letters to the substance in a vial that Ivins controlled at the Maryland laboratory .
Sen .
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the committee 's top Republican , said he also has " grave doubts " about Ivins ' guilt and suggested that Congress launch its own review of the evidence .
At one point , Specter asked Mueller whether he had personally reviewed the evidence and was convinced " beyond a reasonable doubt " of Ivins ' guilt .
" Yes , " Mueller said , adding that the National Academy of Sciences will review the scientific methodology used in the inquiry .
The director 's repeated assurances , however , did not settle the matter .
" It was my impression that they felt their scientists were authoritative and yet they are still seeking affirmation of their theories even though they have told us the ' case is closed , ' " Kemp said .
" If further study is needed , then nothing is finally resolved . "
" Dozens and dozens of serious questions remain unanswered , " said Sen.
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , said .
" If this case truly has been solved , then there has to be a process capable of ensuring that the FBI got it right . "

I just read this excellent article ( hat tip : Pharyngula ) about the last century ’s trends in religiosy and , for a non - theist like me , it certainly perks up the ol ’ optimism .
Even though theists in the recent years have been claiming that theism is on the comeback while secularism and irreligiousness was just a passing fad , the cold hard data once again , forms the proverbial thorn in their soft underbelly of wishful thinking .
While this post is partly to advertise the article , I also wanted to comment on part of it that triggered a long standing wish of mine , which is to start talking about my own philosophy of life , but I ’ll try to avoid getting into specific labels at this point .
In the article then , it is explained how religion ’s drop in popularity is more closely related to socioeconomic reasons rather than being the result of proselytisation from the “ New Atheists ” .
It is shown how most European countries see their religious population percentage drop with a positive correlation to socialism or socialistic policies .
Indeed , some of the more socialistic Countries of Europe seem to have , for the first time , a majority or non-religious people .
I will not go into detail on this , as the article makes the case much better than I ever could , however it did raise a very interesting point .
That US high religiosity has much to do with the lack of a social net for the population , and the easy way with which one can go bankrupt and never recover .
Indeed this constant fear that the population lives with , is what drives so many people turn to religion or spiritualism for comfort .
It is no wonder that the larger percentage of religious people resides in the poorer rural areas .
Of course this is a result of the rabid anti-socialism that is prevalent in the American society ever since the First Red Scare .
Because of the huge negative emotions and reactions that being labeled “ left ” carries , socialist policies like universal health care , have failed to become reality which , among others , rightly earns U.S. their label as the aberrant example of a developed nation .
But what does this have to do with my own philosophy ?
Well , the correlation between non-theism and social safety reminded my of one of the building blocks for it , Epicurism .
As a philosophy , Epicurism was one of the first who explicitly espoused materialism and a form of deism as a method to reduce fear and personal suffering .
Especially because this kind of materialism instructed a radical reduction of human needs to the bare necessities , it allowed people to reduce their anxiety and fear which further chipped away at their theism .
It strikes me as brilliant then , that in the U.S. , where the exact opposite of this materialism is promoted , ( namely crass commercialism ) the fear and anxiety increases and leads to even stronger theism .
Indeed , theism itself quite often wraps itself around commercialism ( or is it the other way around ? ) and takes away a sizable amount of money from the “ flock ” in exchange for blissful uncertainty .
It ’s like a drug who ’s withdrawal symptom is fear .
I ca n’t help but wonder at the masterful mental construction this has created in the minds of U.S. Americans today .
Greed → Commercialism / Consumerism .
Consumerism → Fear .
( “ You have to buy more stuff , or the society will collapse “ )
Commercialism → Fear .
( Lack , or reduced , social security keeping people scared of sudden mishaps )
Fear → Greed .
( “ You have to have wealth or power to be happy “ )
Fear ↔ Traditionalism / Conservatism .
( “ We must return to our old values to save our society “ )
Fear ↔ Nationalism / Xenophobia .
( “ We must protect the homeland in order to survive and prosper “ )
Fear ↔ Authoritarianism .
( “ We need to reduce freedom in order to prevent societal problems and terrorism “ )
Fear ↔
Theism .
( I do n’t think I need to explain this . )
It ’s a vicious cycle .
It is no wonder that all these values and beliefs go together most of the time and generally , if someone has one , it is quite probable that he will have at least some of the others as well .
All of them feed the fear , and fear feeds them all .
Does it surprise anyone that most Clergy have authority ?
Does it surprise anyone that most Clergy are conservative and most Conservatives crave authority ?
Does it surprise anyone that pure capitalists tend to be religious .
Finally , does it surprise anyone that fascism embodies all of these together in a nice round package ?
Fear is the common denominator , and any philosophy that is designed to reduce fear is bound to reduce the person ’s attachment to these values .
This is why so many atheists seem confident , progressive , liberal and socialistic .
They all lack the necessary levels of fear to be anything else .
What we need to do , is not attempt to convert people to atheism or non-theism .
What we need to be doing is to change the society in ways that reduce fear .
As that happens , slowly these values will start retreating due to lack of empowerment .

US President George W Bush has accused Russia of " bullying and intimidation " in its military actions inside Georgia .
Mr Bush demanded that Moscow respect Georgia 's territorial integrity and withdraw the troops it sent in a week ago - or risk international isolation .
The crisis began when Georgia attacked the breakaway region of South Ossetia , sparking Russian intervention .
Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili said he had signed a ceasefire deal - but that it was not a final settlement .
The six - point ceasefire agreement was brokered by France , and was presented by the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , in Tbilisi .
See map of the region
It includes a pledge to pull all troops back to their pre-conflict positions , and a plan to begin international talks about the future status of South Ossetia and a second breakaway region , Abkhazia .
PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops to return to pre-conflict positions International talks about future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia
Georgians rally behind leader
In a joint news conference with Ms Rice following nearly five hours of talks , Mr Saakashvili said he would never accept any part of his country being occupied .
He gave an emotional address , referring to Russia as " cold - blooded killers " and " barbarians " , and he said that Georgia was now " looking evil directly in the eye " .
But Mr Saakashvili also criticised the West for failing to react strongly enough to previous Russian military moves and for not granting his country Nato membership earlier this year .
Ms Rice said that Russia had to accept Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and demanded a withdrawal of all Russia military from Georgia " at once " .
But as the pair spoke , there were reports of Russian anti-personnel carriers moving closer towards the Georgian capital , setting up a new checkpoint about 35 km ( 22 miles ) outside Tbilisi .
Earlier , the Russian President , Dmitry Medvedev , demanded that Georgia sign the deal immediately - but said only Russia could guarantee peace in the region .
' Guarantor ' of security
In a statement at the White House , Mr Bush accused Russia of " bullying and intimidation " , saying it was an unacceptable " way to conduct foreign policy in the 21st Century " .

" Only Russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation . "
Meanwhile , after talks with President Medvedev in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the Russian response as " disproportionate " .
But Mr Medvedev said Russia was the " guarantor " of the interests and lives of those in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
He said they trusted Russian troops , and that this had to be taken into account .
' Peacekeeping mandate '
Mr Medvedev said he did not want to damage relations with other countries but that Russia had to fulfil its peacekeeping mandate , and that it would respond in the same way to any future attack .
He added that a new deal to base part of a US missile defence system on Polish soil was aimed at the Russian federation .
Washington - which says the timing is not linked to the Georgian crisis - insists that the shield is to protect against " rogue states " such as Iran .
Russia in control and on move Eyewitness : Gori 's combustible mix
In pictures : Georgia tension Day - by - day : Georgia - Russia crisis Russia angry at US missile deal But , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington , the US is now likely to be less worried about Russian objections and more anxious to send signals to European allies like Poland that it is prepared to guarantee their protection .
Moscow 's troops continue to operate deep inside the Caucasus republic .
The BBC's Richard Galpin , in the Georgian port of Poti , says Russian forces have taken control of the naval dockyard - with the apparent intent to destroy or remove Georgian military and naval equipment .
Russian forces still control Gori , which lies some 15 km ( 10 miles ) from South Ossetia and on a key route to Tbilisi , and there is also a major contingent near the town of Senaki , our correspondent says .
At a news conference , the Russian army earlier said it had seized a large depot of American - made arms near Senaki .
The crisis began when Georgia attacked South Ossetia on 7 August , sparking Russian retaliation .
Scores of people have died in the fighting .

" Jon 's clearly out of touch , " a Fox spokesman told Kurtz Tuesday in reply , " citing a Pew Research Center study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news , 39 percent Republicans and 33 percent Democrats . "
Kurtz let the spokesman speak anonymously , and did not offer a reason for doing so , writing only that the spokesman " was authorized to give the network 's response to Stewart 's comments but declined to be named . "
Out of touch , however , was n't the worst of it .
The spokesman also went on to blast Stewart for his ratings at the Oscars .
" But being out of touch with mainstream America is nothing new to Jon , " the anonymous Fox employee quipped , " as evidenced by the crash - and - burn ratings of this year 's Oscars telecast . "
Fox News enjoys high ratings itself .
But in the past year , the network has lagged in growth , with CNN seeing an increase in viewership of 67 % , MSNBC 59 % and Fox 14 % .
Stewart 's Daily Show ratings declined 15 percent in the last quarter of 2007 , likely due to the show 's writers being on furlough ; Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert edged up 11 percent .
Stewart did n't save his attacks only for Fox .
He also called the 24 hour cable networks in general a " brutish , slow - witted beast . "
" I 'm stunned to see Karl Rove on a news network as an analyst , " he remarked .
" Stewart , who is doing his nightly show from both conventions , declared his love for newspapers as a better source of political coverage but said they are fighting " a losing battle because they 're getting overshadowed . "
He pronounced the network evening newscasts ' obsolete ' because of the growing speed of news , " Kurtz opined .
" The Comedy Central funnyman touched a nerve when he criticized journalists for having off - the - record dinners with politicians , such as a barbecue in March at John McCain 's Arizona ranch .
' That colors your vision of them so clearly and so profoundly , ' he said .
17.000 Verbraucher von Abzocke bedroht : Bankdaten illegal gehandelt
Eine Firma in Nordrhein - Westfalen hat offenbar die Kontodaten tausender Verbraucher verscherbelt .
Datenschützer vermuten einen Zusammenhang zu illegalen Abbuchungen .
In Deutschland werden offenbar die Bankdaten tausender Verbraucher illegal gehandelt .
Der Verbraucherzentrale Schleswig - Holstein sowie dem dortigen Datenschutzbeauftragten wurde am Montag von einem ehemaligen Mitarbeiter eines Callcenters eine CD mit den Daten von 17.000 Bürgern zugespielt .
Die Firma des Informanten heißt nach taz - Informationen Eurochance und sitzt im nordrhein - westfälischen Viersen .
Sie soll die Angaben an andere Callcenter verkauft haben .
Auf der CD sind neben Namen , Geburtsdaten , Adressen und Telefonnummern auch die jeweiligen Kontoverbindungen gespeichert .
Die Datenstruktur weise darauf hin , dass die Angaben ursprünglich von Lottofirmen wie der Süddeutschen Klassenlotterie SKL stammen , hieß es in Kiel .
" Das ist ein erschreckender Fall von Datenmissbrauch " , sagte der Datenschutzbeauftragte Schleswig - Holsteins , Thilo Weichert , der taz .
" Wir ahnten , dass solche Daten im Umlauf sind .
Jetzt haben wir es schwarz auf weiß . "
Die CD sei an die Staatsanwaltschaft Mönchengladbach weitergeleitet worden .
Die Ermittlungen dürften sich auf Eurochance konzentrieren .
Deren Name tauchte bereits Ende letzter Woche im Onlineverbraucherportal Antispam .de auf .
Ein Nutzer , der sich dort als Mitarbeiter des Unternehmens ausgab , beklagte den Datenhandel seines Arbeitgebers und kündigte im Forum ein Treffen mit der Verbraucherzentrale in Schleswig - Holstein an , um die Praxis öffentlich zu machen .
Klären muss die Staatsanwaltschaft auch , wem die Firma die Daten verkauft haben könnte und ob ein Zusammenhang zu jüngsten Missbrauchsfällen von Glücksspielanbietern besteht .
Verbraucherzentralen in ganz Deutschland hatten in den letzten Wochen einen rapiden Anstieg an Beschwerden registriert .
Der Sprecher der Zweigstelle in Schleswig- Holstein , Thomas Hagen , sagte : " Uns sind die ersten Fälle bekannt , in denen von Konten der betroffenen Verbraucher abgebucht wurde , obwohl diese unmissverständlich jegliche Teilnahme an einem Glücksspiel ablehnten . "
Laut den Verbraucherzentralen Brandenburg und Hessen sind bundesweit rund 500 Fälle solcher illegalen " cold calls " bekannt .
Fast alle Proteste richteten sich gegen die Firma LottoTeam aus Köln , sagte der Sprecher der Zentrale in Brandenburg , Hartmut Müller .
In allen Fällen hätten die Betroffenen berichtet , ihnen seien nach einem Werbeanruf der Lotto - Firma Beträge abgebucht worden , obwohl sie ihre Kontodaten nicht angegeben hatten .
Man habe deshalb bereits eigene Schritte gegen LottoTeam eingeleitet .
" Wir haben die Firma gestern abgemahnt " , berichtete Müller .
" Die Beschwerden haben in den letzten Wochen deutlich zugenommen " , sagte auch die Sprecherin der Zweigstelle in Hessen , Ute Klaus .
Das Kölner Unternehmen wie auch die SKL hätten sich jedoch umgehend in Kiel gemeldet , betonte Datenschützer Weichert : " Beide haben uns ihre Kooperation zugesichert , um schnellstmögliche Klärung zu erreichen . "
In einer Erklärung versicherte die SKL am Nachmittag , man habe " nie Daten von ihren Kunden an Dritte weitergegeben " .
Weichert riet Verbrauchern , Kontoauszüge regelmäßig zu prüfen .
Bei nicht zuzuordnenden Transaktionen solle man sofort widersprechen .
" Wir fordern auch die Betroffenen auf , sich bei uns Datenschützern , bei Verbraucherschützern , Polizei und Staatsanwaltschaft zu melden . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Unless you work in the oil , gas or related mining industries , the job market is unlikely to look brighter in the fourth quarter , and even retailers are glum about hiring for the upcoming holiday season , according to the latest Manpower Employment Outlook Survey .
The Milwaukee firm 's quarterly survey of hiring plans found that a net 9 % of firms expect to hire in the fourth quarter , down from 12 % in the previous quarter , and 18 % for the fourth quarter a year ago .
This fourth quarter outlook is the tenth consecutive quarter of declining employer sentiment in the survey -- the longest such retreat in more than 20 years .
Manpower 's seasonally adjusted net - employment numbers , based on a survey of 14,000 U.S. companies , measure the percentage of firms planning to hire minus those intending layoffs .
Manpower does n't measure the number of jobs .
The survey 's margin of error is +/- 0.8 % .
Among retailers , even the upcoming holiday season does n't seem to offer much hope : Just 8 % of employers in wholesale and retail trade expect to hire in the upcoming fourth quarter , the lowest figure for that sector in 17 years , said Jonas Prising , president of Manpower North America .
That category includes department stores , gas stations , restaurants , discount retailers , computer stores and wholesalers , among others .
The industry 's " hiring intentions are the lowest we 've seen in the last 17 years .
That tells you something about what they feel about end - of - year shopping sprees , " Prising said .
The sector " has n't been this pessimistic for a long time . "
Retailers are n't alone in their pessimism .
Overall , this is the tenth consecutive quarter of declines in employers ' hiring plans , the longest such retreat since 1986 , Prising said .
" The decline has been gradual and is looking very , very different from what we saw in 2000 , 2001 , " Prising said .
" That was much shorter and sharper . "
See related story on recent jobs data .
If it ensues that employers ' outlook for the first quarter of 2009 is equally grim , that would mean a new record for the Manpower survey .
" The Employment Outlook Survey in the last 25 years [ has not seen ] more than 10 consecutive quarters of seasonally - adjusted decline , " Prising said .
The survey has been conducted for about 40 years but the seasonally adjusted measurement is about 25 years old , Prising said .
Bright spot
One sector is doing well , however : Mining , which the Manpower survey describes as any company involved in extracting resources , including metal and coal mining companies , petroleum and natural gas extraction , stone , sand and gravel quarries , as well as related positions in those industries , such as engineering .
Twenty - six percent of companies in the mining industry expect to hire in the fourth quarter , up from 24 % in the third quarter and 21 % a year ago .
But other industries are seeing significant drops in hiring expectations , particularly when compared to the fourth quarter a year ago :
Net employment outlook , seasonally adjusted , by industry Fourth Quarter 2008 Third Quarter 2008 Fourth Quarter 2007 Construction 2 % 2 % 15 % Education 10 % 10 % 16 % Finance , Insurance & Real Estate 5 % 7 % 15 % Manufacturing - Durables 9 % 12 % 18 % Manufacturing - Nondurables 6 % 10 % 17 % Mining 26 % 24 % 21 % Public Administration 8 % 10 % 21 % Services 14 % 19 % 22 % Transportation & Public Utilities 10 % 14 % 13 % Wholesale & Retail Trade 8 % 10 % 17 %

Politico Arena — Palin edition
Editors ' Note : Politico has invited more than a hundred notables to participate in a continuing conversation through the campaign and into the transition .
Soon Politico Arena will have its own page at Politico.com .
In the meantime , starting today , we ’ll be publishing their responses to important developments as they come up .
First up , they take on McCain 's surprise pick as his running mate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , House Minority Whip

Talk about shaking up the Republican landscape .
By choosing [ Alaska ] Gov. [ Sarah ] Palin , John McCain made a bold choice that generates enthusiasm and excitement going into Minneapolis .
Democrats beware — calling her inexperienced only highlights their own nominee 's inexperience .
And Barack Obama is running for president — Sarah Palin is not .
Watching her performance yesterday , she is going to defy all expectations .
Groundbreaking decision that only John McCain could make .
Rep. Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , House Majority Leader
This decision shows McCain is desperate .
It is a Hail Mary pass that is going to be fumbled .
He just destroyed his No. 1 talking point — experience .
Voters will not be comfortable with having a small - town mayor with about a year 's experience as governor a heartbeat away from the presidency .
This choice will , at best , not help the Republican ticket .
Tom C. Korologos , veteran Washington adviser to presidents and former ambassador
My reaction : Mother of five , moose hunter , NRA life member , husband belongs to a union , wears skirts , God-fearing new - generation pro-life woman , 80 percent governor approval rating and most conservative candidate on any ticket since Ronald Reagan .
I hope McCain is n't a drag on the ticket .
Tom Daschle , former Democratic Senate leader and an Obama campaign adviser
I agree with those who have called it one of the most risky decisions in American political history .
Three questions :
With absolutely no experience , are we ready , if necessary , to place our future in her hands as commander in chief and our premier negotiator with other world leaders ?
Are we comfortable in having a VP who represents the extreme right wing , including the advocacy of creationism and a denial of any human responsibility in climate change ?
What happens if Gov. Palin is found to have abused her office in the firing of a police officer ?
Stephen Hess , senior fellow emeritus in governance studies at The Brookings Institution
The question has been whether Obama is experienced enough to be president .
Experience , one gains with time .
Palin also lacks experience .
But what we must now try to learn about her is whether she is qualified to be president .
There ’s a lot we need to know .
Her temperament is worth examining .
Joe Lockhart , former Clinton White House press secretary
A recurring theme at the Democratic convention was : John McCain is well - intentioned but out of touch .
There is no better example than his VP pick .
John McCain knows he needs to appeal to women to win this election .
Picking a woman as your VP seems logical toward that end , logical until you look at her record .
Palin is pro-life , most assuredly a principled position but at odds with a large majority of women in America .
Her views that there should be no restrictions on assault weapons and cop killer bullets is an anathema to most women in America .
Finally , experience .
2004 showed us that women would vote for the candidate they thought could protect this country in a time of crisis .
Gov. Palin may have those qualities , but to think that women would vote for her just because she is a woman and without her demonstrating those abilities is naive .
John McCain was right to seek out a woman to expand his appeal .
I think the woman he picked , however , showed how out of touch he is .
Norm Ornstein , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research
I am troubled by it , not the least because of the way it was done — last minute , impulsive , with the presidential candidate barely knowing his choice and without an extensive vetting done well in advance .
The ethical issue is also troublesome , just from what we know on the record .
Gov. Palin is by all accounts honest when it comes to money and taxpayer dollars , but either she or her close subordinates used government power to try to settle a personal vendetta — if she did not do it , but her subordinate did ( from the audio tape on record ) , she clearly should have fired him and did not .
Given the Patriot Act , the enhanced surveillance and other powers being exercised by the federal government , having someone willing to use or tolerate the use of the power of the state for personal vengeance is pretty unsettling .
Ron Bonjean , top strategist for Senate and House Republicans
The brilliant choice of Gov. Palin is that is has energized the conservative base while appealing to independents , working moms , disaffected Hillary voters and those who want change brought to Washington .
It was smart , outside - the - box thinking to shake up the Obama momentum and has turned the media upside down on news coverage .
Sen .
Obama 's inexperience is actually being amplified through McCain 's choice .
The more Obama 's campaign and its surrogates attack Gov. Palin on her positive track record , the more damage they do to Obama 's brand .
Their attacks have a boomerang effect because it allows McCain 's team to remind voters that Obama does n't have strong leadership credentials .
Gov.
Palin's challenge will be to perform flawlessly over the next 60 days , because any mistake or misfire can quickly shape her image among voters who are still absorbing this choice .
Diane Ravitch , research professor of education at New York University and a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution and the Hoover Institution
I am a registered independent and have not decided for whom I will vote in this election .
McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin was a brilliant stroke .
In a close race — as it has been until now — it would have been far safer to choose one of the obvious contenders .
Instead he defied the conventional wisdom and picked someone that almost no one had thought of .
McCain recognizes , it seems , that we live in a media - saturated culture , where appearances count for more than substance .
Perhaps Palin has the substance too , but on first look she sure wins on the appearance scale .
She is beautiful , radiates warmth and sincerity , and seems self - assured but not arrogant .
Her family picture — a successful mother with five children ( one with Down syndrome ) , a happy wife , an accomplished athlete and a cheerful demeanor — is almost too good to be true .
Her political persona as corruption - buster plays well , too .
Independents may be turned off by her social conservatism , or they may be wowed by McCain 's show of independence from the party elders .
With her choice , he has demonstrated that he is still the maverick that we once knew .
If he wins , the commentariat will look at Palin as the game - changer .
If he loses , it will not be because of her , but because 2008 was always slated to be a Democratic year .
Gary Bauer , president of American Values
The choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is a historic moment for women and for the Republican Party as well as a choice guaranteed to energize values voters .
This is a grand slam home run for John McCain .
I believe we now have the most pro-life ticket in history running on the most pro-life platform in history .
Gov. Palin ’s credentials as a leader include taking on political corruption and reducing spending .
But her promises of change were not just words ; they became actions .
And her concern for country has been passed down to her five children .
Her oldest son , Track , joined the Army last year on the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and is serving his country .
All conservatives should be proud to support this historic ticket of proven reformers with records of self - sacrifice for their country and their families .
Celinda Lake , president of Lake Research Partners and a leading Democratic strategist
She is an audacious choice .
She clearly shows they are targeting women .
Voters , however , will have major questions as they get to know her , about her lack of experience and her support of McCain - Bush economics .
Cass Sunstein , Harvard Law School professor serving as an informal adviser to the Obama campaign
It is extremely puzzling that , in 2008 , the presumptive Republican nominee has chosen someone who rejects the proposition that human activity has contributed to climate change .
In an interview published on Aug. 29 , 2008 , Gov. Palin said this : " A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state , because of our location .
I 'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made . "
This was not an isolated statement .
At least since 2005 , Gov. Palin has said that she is unconvinced that human activity is responsible for global warming .
Reasonable people can differ about many issues relating to climate change , including the timing and extent of emissions reductions .
But the scientific evidence of a significant human contribution is overwhelming — as has been recognized not only by specialists all over the world , but also by countless business leaders , Sen. McCain , the Environmental Protection Agency ( under President George W. Bush ) and President Bush himself ( who used the word " obviously " when asked , in 2005 , whether climate change is " man-made ) . "
Gov. Palin 's stunning claim — " I 'm not one though who would attribute it to being man- made " — is exceedingly important , not only because it suggests her opinion about one of the leading issues of our time , but also because it offers a more general signal about how she apparently thinks and the circles in which she apparently travels .
Mickey Edwards , former Republican member of Congress now at Princeton University
I ’ve been in Minneapolis for the past week , surrounded by Republicans who , though they were supporting the party and McCain , were far from enthusiastic .
When Palin 's selection was announced , the entire mood of the room I was in changed , and changed visibly and loudly .
For the first time , there was real excitement .
It ’s too early to know what effect the nomination will have on the nation as a whole , but it has certainly energized Republicans and , in particular , conservatives .
Palin brings something important to the ticket .
Her vulnerability is her lack of experience , but that 's hardly fatal since the Democrats have nominated a candidate whom even other Democrats had criticized for being inexperienced .
On the other hand , Palin does enhance McCain ’s image as a reformer and trumps Obama ’s " Yes , we can " with " Yes , we have . "
This is a woman who took on the entire state establishment , including the heavyweight powers in her own party , and won enormous public support for doing so .
By choosing Joe Biden ( a good choice , by the way ) , Obama presented the country with a ticket drawn entirely from the Eastern half of the United States .
Palin is a Westerner whose values , style and demeanor will play well in Colorado , New Mexico , Montana and other states where Obama has been trying to make headway .
Since McCain only has to win the states Bush won , and Obama has to turn some of the previous " red " states , Palin 's spot on the ticket presents the Democrats with some obvious problems .
We can count on Sarah Palin 's travel schedule including a heavy dose of Western and Southern states and making it much more difficult for Obama to bring them into his column .
She brings Romney ’s conservative credentials , but without the suspicion that she adopted her positions at the last minute , for political purposes .
She brings Pawlenty 's credentials but adds a gender card .
It ’s doubtful that she alone can carry McCain over the finish line — George W. Bush is a heavy weight around McCain ’s neck — but it's also doubtful that McCain could have chosen a better No. 2 on the ticket for political purposes .
As for being qualified to be president , well , the Democrats have already decided that lack of experience is not a fatal flaw .
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - Wis . )
A real test of a presidential candidate ’s judgment is his choice of a running mate — the person who is next in line to become the commander in chief .
As we face serious global challenges and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , John McCain has chosen someone with virtually no national security or foreign policy experience .
This choice calls into question both Sen.
McCain ’s judgment and a McCain administration ’s ability to lead a nation in crisis .
To the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of Hillary Clinton 's historic candidacy , McCain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy .
It was Sen . Clinton 's experience , skill and commitment to change , especially in the areas of health care and energy policy , that drew such strong support .
Sarah Palin 's opposition to Roe v. Wade and her support of Big Oil will not draw Democrats from the Obama - Biden ticket .
Ken Goldstein , political science professor , University of Wisconsin
With apologies for my lack of nuance — I think John McCain 's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate was phenomenally stupid .
It also demonstrated that John McCain really did not believe the race was as close as the polls suggested before the Democratic convention .
The fundamental factors of party identification and the nature of the times clearly give the Democrats a great advantage this year .
That said , Barack Obama still needs to reach a threshold level of credibility and support from key blocs of voters ( independents and weak Democrats ) .
That is why this campaign is and has been about Barack Obama — the Obama campaign saying quite simply that he is ready to be president and the McCain campaign forcefully arguing that he is not .
Picking a vice presidential nominee with such scant experience obviously undercuts McCain 's arguments about the importance of experience .
As much as McCain likes to talk of being a maverick , his main strength as a presidential candidate this fall was that he was ready to be president — that you could close your eyes and imagine John McCain in the Oval Office .
He was running in essence as the " competent conservative " — one who would not bungle a response to Hurricane Katrina or nominate a Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court .
Put simply , this choice makes it more difficult to attack Obama as not ready for the presidency .
And , it shows that McCain did not really believe the GOP base was with him and the polls were really that close .
Vic Fazio , Washington attorney and former Democratic congressman from California
The selection of Sarah Palin is breathtakingly risky and historic in that John McCain has bet his candidacy on a vice presidential nominee almost devoid of any significant public , let alone national security , experience .
But as with any big risk , the reward could be great as well .
Depending on how well she performs over the next two months , the McCain campaign can be confident that they have re-energized their base and perhaps improved their chances of carrying the blue - collar vote from Pennsylvania to Missouri , with particular focus on women .
Most pundits assume that once again , the vice presidential nominee will have no impact on the election outcome .
That premise will be tested by a potential presidency of the oldest person ever sworn into the office at age 72 .
The odds are that Palin is more likely to assume the top job than anyone who has preceded her .
As a mayor of a town of 8,000 and a governor of a state the size of a congressional district for not even two years , there is little chance that she is ready to serve as president .
She may be a great asset to the ticket , even an effective debate opponent for Joe Biden , but it 's entirely possible that the voters will surprise us by deciding that after sober reflection , the risk of putting her in the White House is too great .
David Marin , a principal at the Podesta Group and a Republican congressional strategist
“ I ’m offended , ” says my friend the Hillary supporter .
“ As if women vote for women because they ’re women . ”
“ I ’m ecstatic , ” says my friend who ( still ) hearts Huckabee .
“ She ’s one of us ! ”
I ’m perplexed .
Maybe the choice is pure genius .
Maybe McCain has energized the base , re-established his maverick credentials , re-emphasized his reform agenda , and added historic new cracks to the odious glass ceiling , all with a single decision .
Maybe Palin will amaze us all and be able to stand toe - to - toe with Biden .
Maybe she ’ll add some much - needed sizzle .
But I thought the McCain campaign was about experience at a time of national crisis .
And I thought he understood the outcome will ultimately rest with independents , with “ post partisans . ”
I guess it ’s a good thing most people vote for president , not VP , because , right now at least , this has Bentsen - Quayle written all over it .
Dan Schnur , Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and Republican strategist
John McCain made a trade .
He gave away the experience argument in order to have a better shot at those working - class Clinton voters .
Palin keeps
Republicans from making the case that Obama is too inexperienced to be president , but she can talk to blue - collar socially conservative voters better than either McCain or Obama .
I read that Palin drives her family 's Jetta to work every day .
McCain 's campaign should make that Jetta the most famous car in America .
Everyone 's talking about how this choice motivates the conservative base .
But it also gives McCain more leeway to reach out to the center .
Those convention - goers are going to be able to handle Schwarzenegger and Giuliani and Lieberman a lot better knowing that Palin's on the ticket .
McCain 's best issue at this point — even better than terrorism — is oil drilling .
Palin helps him reinforce that message better than just about anyone else in the party .
McCain 's campaign has been heading in the right direction over the last several weeks , but it 's a very conventional campaign .
If he had to choose , McCain would rather be a president than a maverick .
But you have to believe he'd like to do both .
Jared Bernstein , director of the Living Standards program at the Economic Policy Institute and an Obama campaign adviser
Like many other Americans , I know infinitely more about Sarah Palin now than I did last Friday morning .
But , alas , not enough to offer much insight into what she ’s really about .
Many of her views — anti-choice , pro-creationism , drilling in ANWR — are polar opposite to my own and worrisome to me .
It ’s not just that I think these views are wrong .
It ’s also that because we face pressing and urgent challenges in so many key areas — the economy , health care , climate change , war — we simply can’t afford the time to argue about choice and evolution .
Our political time and capital need to be spent on rebuilding competent , pragmatic government , not on ideological arguments .
On the other hand , she seems to have a reformer ’s streak that ’s attractive and needed in high office .
Also , I ’ve got 8 - and 6 - year - old daughters who are for the first time paying attention to this stuff .
To them , there ’s nothing unusual about women to be competing for high office , and that is very satisfying to see .
What ’s disturbing about the choice of Palin is what it says about McCain and his team .
Many critics , both right and left , have raised the point that this choice is n’t about what ’s best for the country , it ’s about capturing needed votes and killing Obama ’s post - convention bounce .
Is there anyone out there who really believes Palin is ready to play backup to a 72 - year - old president ?
This critique sounds both compelling and a little naive .
Presidential candidates always choose their veeps along a “ what do they bring to the table ? ” continuum that has votes at one end and governing prowess on the other .
But the fact that McCain went so far to the “ votes ” end of that continuum evinces a cynical , serious error in judgment .
Palin brings youth , gender , and hard right ideology to a ticket that needs much more substantive heft in economics and , should anything happen to the president , foreign policy .
In that regard , I can only hope the majority of the electorate finds this choice as scary as I do .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt . )
McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin was brilliant , and successfully accomplished one of its primary goals .
As was to be expected , the corporate media , far more interested in process than substance , abruptly ended its coverage of Obama 's informative and inspiring convention speech , and began its never - ending discussion regarding the political wisdom of McCain 's surprise VP choice .
For the McCain campaign , deflecting attention away from the real issues was a mission accomplished !
Meanwhile , in the real world of Vermont and America , working families want to know why over the last eight years the middle class has been collapsing while the richest people have seen a huge increase in their wealth , and what can be done to create decent paying jobs for ordinary people .
They want to know why , under Bush , health care costs have soared , why 7 million more Americans have lost their health insurance and why the United States is the only major country on earth not to have universal health care .
They want to know why we continue to spend over $ 10 billion a month on Iraq , while our infrastructure disintegrates , schools are underfunded and millions of young people can't afford a college education .
In the final analysis , they want to know if the government of our country is capable of representing anyone who is not a millionaire or the head of a large corporation .
My own guess is that the American people will see through the hypocrisy , irresponsibility and opportunism of McCain 's selection of Palin .
After attacking Obama for months saying that he does n't have the experience to be president , McCain , who would be the oldest first - term president in American history and who has had bouts with cancer , selects the least - experienced VP nominee to ever represent a major party .
Barack Obama will win this election because the American people do not want four more years of Bush 's disastrous right - wing policies .
They want change .
Despite the corporate media 's coverage of this election as if it were a football game , a soap opera or an Academy Award ceremony , the American people want to move America in a very different direction than Bush - McCain policies have taken us .
And , within that context , McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin will make little difference .
Steven G. Calabresi , professor of law at Northwestern University and one of many unpaid members of Sen. McCain ’s Judicial Advisory Committee
The Sarah Palin pick , like any other pick Senator McCain might have made , comes with pros and cons .
Today , I will mention the pros and in a later post I will respond to the cons .
First , Gov. Palin appeals to both economic and social conservatives .
She thus reunites the winning Reagan coalition bringing many Reagan Democrats back to the fold .
Gov. Palin appeals to economic conservatives because she killed the Bridge to Nowhere at the state level after it had received federal funding .
And , she has advocated substantial spending and tax restraint exercising the biggest line item veto ever in Alaska history .
Gov. Palin appeals to social conservatives because she is a pro-life mother of five children the most recent of whom has Down syndrome .
Gov. Palin will appeal to the voters who used to be called Reagan Democrats because her husband is a union member , she comes from a modest background , rather than from Harvard Law School , and she is manifestly a person who " clings " to guns and religion without a trace of bitterness .
She may also appeal to independent and Republican leaning women who would like to finally smash that glass ceiling with 18 million cracks in it .
Second , Gov. Palin knows more about the energy issue than either Sen. Biden or Sen. Obama .
Her husband works in the energy extraction business , and she hails from a state with enormous energy reserves which she wants to develop .
Gov. Palin got approval for the building of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 which will do more in the short term to cut our dependence on foreign oil than anything Sen.
Biden has done in his 35 years in the Senate .
If you believe , as I do , that energy independence and prices are a key issue this fall , that alone is reason to cheer the selection of Gov. Palin .
Gov. Palin has a proven record of accomplishment .
What has Barack Obama ever done that is as important as launching a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 ?
Gov. Palin ran a city and state while Barack Obama ran a Senate subcommittee that never held any hearings !
Third , there is a consensus in both parties that our politics is broken — that as Sen .
Obama has put it , we need to get beyond and transcend the cultural wars of the baby boom generation .
Gov. Palin is a fresh face who rose to power in Alaska by opposing the state 's pork - barreling Republican establishment of Ted Stevens , Frank Murkowski and Don Young .
Gov. Palin is a radical change candidate .
Sen . Biden , however , is the ultimate anti-change candidate .
He has served in Washington as a legislator for 35 years and has talked at length but has never actually run anything .
Biden is a talker — Palin is a doer .
The one thing Biden has famously done is run the confirmation hearings of Judge Robert H. Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas , and those hearings were a national disaster — a disaster that produced the very broken politics that Sen.
Obama claimed he wants to fix !
McCain and Obama 's vice presidential picks shows that it is the maverick John McCain who is the real agent of change in this election while Obama clings to the inside the Beltway politics of Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , Ted Kennedy and now their talkative , long - serving sidekick — Joe Biden .
Red Canyon Aesthetics Medical Spa Plane Crash in Utah ( Photos )
Director , of the Red Canyon Aesthetics Medical Spa of Cedar City , Utah died in a plane crash near Moab , Utah on Friday evening .
The pilot , Dr. Ellsworth and his staff of 8 all perished in the flames that erupted upon impact .
The group was traveling on a twin - engine King Air A - 100 , which had taken off from Moab and experienced problems that caused it to ' pancake ' and skid along the ground two miles from the Canyonlands Field airport , 18 miles northwest of Moab and not far from Arches National Park in southeastern Utah .
Moab is 245 miles southeast of Salt Lake City .
Dr. Ellsworth owned seven dermatology clinics in Utah , two in Nevada and one in Page , Arizona .
His medical group focused on preventing and treating skin cancer in smaller communities .
Ellsworth had a time - share agreement allowing the doctor to regularly schedule the use of the plane to transport his staff to clinics throughout the three state area .
Grand County Sheriff James
Nyland indicated that all 10 people perished aboard the flight .
The NTSB and FAA were on the scene as of Saturday morning to begin their investigation .
They have indicated that a preliminary report will be available in 5 - 10 days .
The photo above was provided by the Grand County Sheriff 's Office and shows the grim aftermath of the fatal plane crash .

Second Life , the virtual reality site , is reaching out to a new audience : businesses .
SL is seeing an uptick in traffic for business meetings , conference calls and classes — and that ’s welcome news for a site that has long struggled to retain users .

How much of your traffic is business and education users ?
Our estimate is it ’s in the 15 to 20 percent range right now of overall usage .
But it ’s very hard to say because the world is this very open environment and it ’s difficult for us to survey it .
Second Life right now is just a little under a million hours of use per day and a little bit more than 200,000 different people using it .
When we talk about those percentages , I guess that means tens of thousands of people using it for business and education .
Which companies are using it ?
IBM and Cisco are both heavy users or virtual worlds , and specifically Second Life .
IBM in particular has been a real innovation leader , using Second Life aggressively for a couple of years now .
On the order of a thousand people came to a multi day virtual event in which Sam Palmisano , their CEO , spoke from a recreation of the Forbidden City in Beijing .
Obviously , with the concern about the ecological impact of business travel today , as well as increasing fuel costs , the savings are very substantial for businesses to have meetings in Second Life .
What makes the virtual world attractive to business users ?
There are two features we ’ve added in the last year that has made Second Life attractive to both business and education .
The first one was the ability to use 3D voice .
If someone is on your left and someone else is on your right , you hear them on your left and on your right .
You ca n’t do this with a speakerphone , you ca n’t do it with most videoconferencing systems and you ca n’t do it with Skype .
advertisement
The second thing we did is add richer features that enables people to browse the Web .
You can sit around the table in Second Life with a bunch of colleagues from remote offices and one of you can show a presentation , a PowerPoint or a Web page , up on the wall in the virtual meeting room .
The virtual world creates a sense of realism that ’s way beyond what you can do with two - dimensional whiteboarding or a Web conferencing application .
Admittedly , it ’s a little harder to get set up , and that ’s our challenge .
One of the criticisms of Second Life is that people visit out of curiosity , get bored and go away .
Is this a way to draw more users ?
We are still very early in the functionality and adoption of virtual environments in general .
The majority of people who try out virtual worlds — and Second Life is definitely the leader in that overall category — do n’t stay .
They try it for a short time and they ’re either unable to get started , or they do n’t find the kind of experiences they ’re interested in and they do n’t come back .
But that ’s the same thing that happened with the Internet during its early years when , for example , search did n’t work as well as it does today .
People would give up before they found the content they were looking for .
What we tend to see in Second Life is a very small number of people staying .
But when they find something interesting — like for example they ’re able to use it for business meetings — they really enjoy what they ’re doing and tend to aggressively stay .
What is the percentage that actually stays ?
advertisement
Less than 10 percent of the people who sign up are sticking around and participating in the virtual world .
There ’s lots we can do about it but it takes time .
We have to evolve the market as it evolves .
The good news is this is such a global phenomenon and there ’s such a large number of people signing up in the aggregate that it still nets out to be a profitable and growing business for us , and also for the people using it .
In June , there were 59,000 people who appeared to be cash flow positive , meaning they ’re doing something in Second Life that allows them to make money rather than pay money .
Is attracting small and medium businesses ( SMBs ) one of things you can do to increase retention ?
We ’re really thinking about how to aggressively present Second Life to SMBs so they can effectively use it at a higher rate of participation .
We ’re working on that quietly right now and thinking about what kind of things we can do to support that use .
The SMB use of Second Life thus far has been organic .
It ’s been more user - driven .
We ’re taking a look at it and saying , “ Ok , how can we organize ourselves and how can we change the product to really support that use ? ”
That ’s been our strategy .
Imagine we ’re business colleagues .
How would this interview be different in the virtual world ?
We could have had three or four people on the call without having to use a 1 - 800 number .
We ’d just show up at a park somewhere in Second Life .
Audio quality would be better than the telephone and you would hear the nuances of the voice better .
If I wanted to show you a prototype of a new product , I ’d just pull it out of my pocket and rez it — meaning it would just show up and float in front of you .
If we were working on cellphones , I could show you a big 3D model of our newest cellphone and we could play with it .
If you put people in an immersive space that ’s also somewhat novel — in Second Life you can actually rent tiki huts on a beach — I guarantee you that you would remember the content of this conversation better than you would driving in your car and talking on the phone .
I guarantee you would have laughed once or twice when I put on a funny hat or changed clothes with my avatar .

The applications just make it more fun to do business .
We ’re in a creative economy now and people have choices about where they work and how they work .
Being able to do your work in a virtual workspace that makes it fun and reduces your travel time is a tremendous benefit to a company .
Here at Linden lab , obviously we ’re eaters of our own dog food , I ’m literally looking around my office right now and I can see several people who are in meetings with other Linden team members in world .
We do virtually all our meetings in world — in many cases we do an in world meeting even when we all are located in the same building .
How does the relationship change ?
Anecdotally , the virtual meeting space allows people to establish friendships in business context and get closer to one another .
You do n’t have real eye contact .
And meetings are significantly less threatening .
The sense of threat we have in real world meetings just is n’t there in the virtual environment .
Earlier this year , you stepped down as CEO .
Why ?
I am fundamentally a product and design guy and technology is my background .
We ’re a profitable company , growing quickly and closing in on 300 people .
That ’s a big business and I did n’t feel I could do it better than anyone in the world .
If you looked at my contributions to designing virtual worlds , I think they ’re second to none .
I ’m one of the best guys on the planet to help a company do that .
But if you look at the kind of organizational leadership you need going from 300 to 3,000 people , I do n’t think I ’d be in the top 100 .
We ’re a very unique , well - positioned , interesting and compelling company that deserves to have the best people in the world in every role .
advertisement
I ’ve been leading this company as CEO since it began in 1999 .
I think I ’ve done a good job but I ’m ready to change and get myself more focused on product design technology .
We have to do a tremendous amount of innovation and product work and technology work to grow beyond where we are now .
I think it ’s best for the company if I reserve a large amount of my time to contribute there .
What ’s your next big idea ?
There are a couple of things that need to become radically different about virtual worlds and specifically Second Life .
One is usability .
No one has figured out an easy way to use a virtual world , to make the software intuitive , and make the experience fast and fun and appealing to everyone .
I think it ’s doable .
There are incremental changes that we can make to the technology to make it as palatable as a Web browser — perhaps even more so .
We ’ve got issues around scalability .
I think this whole thing is going to grow by about two orders of magnitude , a factor of 100 , in the next 10 years .
A lot of architecture is going to have to work right to make that happen .
Second Life needs an intuitive interface and good search and discovery .
When you try to browse the virtual world today , it still takes a bunch of time to find live music , a classroom or a teacher .
Google figured out how to organize information on the Web and we need to figure out how to do the same thing in the virtual world .
I think that ’s a worthy challenge to take on as a technologist .
I love it .
As Ford ( F ) races to import some small cars in time for the 2010 selling season , its designers are hard at work on ... another SUV .
Demand for SUVs and trucks -- and anything that looks like an SUV or truck -- has cratered .
So Ford 's response is to call its new SUV something else .
Ford is designing a " crossover ' luxury car based on the design of its Ford Flex .
The three - row lincoln MKT will feature a sleeker design than the Flex ( pictured to the right ) and is currently being billed as the " Learjet of the road . "
It looks more like a 767 .
WSJ :
Among its competitors would be the Acura MDX , the Audi Q7 and the Mercedes R class , people familiar with the matter said .
But the MKT is not designed to be a large production run .
The company expects annual sales in the range of the mid-20,000 vehicles .
... Despite a flood of new models in the segment , sales of crossovers -- car - based wagons designed to look and function like sport-utility vehicles but with modestly better fuel economy -- were down 11 % in July compared with July 2007 , according to Autodata Corp. , representing the third straight month of sharp declines amid a wider downturn in the overall market .
This stubbornness is part of why Ford stock is down 69 % since 2004 - - to $ 5 .
The new model sounds suspiciously like the " Canyonero , " a fictional SUV lambasted in a classic episode of the Simpsons .

I recently conducted a study into the helpfulness ( or lack thereof ) of zebra striping — the shading of alternate rows in a table or form .
The study measured performance as users completed a series of tasks and found no statistically significant improvement in accuracy — and very little statistically significant improvement in speed when zebra stripes were implemented .
Article Continues Below
These results were a surprise to many readers of the corresponding article , published in A List Apart in May , 2008 .
I think it ’s fair to say that the vast majority of us , myself included , expected to see that zebra striping helped a lot .
Because of these surprising results , I decided to conduct two more studies into the value of zebra striping .
These studies aimed to test design elements deliberately excluded from the first study , and to address some of the issues raised by the results of the first study .
This article represents a summary of my research , presenting the findings of these two further studies and providing a recommendation on future use of zebra striping .
Is zebra striping research really necessary ?
# section2
Before jumping into the findings of the new studies , I would like to take a moment to reflect on whether research on this topic is actually a “ waste of time , ” because the usefulness of zebra striping is “ obvious . ”
Many years of conducting user research have taught me that what seems like an obvious choice to one person is disliked by another , and often for good reason .
In the case of zebra striping , the benefit ( i.e. , of leading the eye ) seemed likely , but I had a niggling concern about possible downsides ( e.g. , additional visual noise interfering with cognitive processing ) .
Interestingly , since writing the first article , many people have told me that they often debate the use of zebra striping in their work teams .
These debates actually provided my original motivation — I expected the first study to find a clear benefit from zebra striping and therefore provide a statistic that could support such discussions .
Instead , these original results made the picture less , rather than more , clear !
To me , this suggests that more research was warranted .
Directing research energies #section3
The experimental data produced by the initial study did n’t support a strong argument for zebra striping .
Yet a single experiment is not sufficient to disprove a theory : maybe zebra striping had little effect because of that experiment ’s particular design .
Sure , zebra stripes may not help much when you are presenting a table like the one from that study — which is in fact something worth knowing , all by itself — but what if the table was longer , the stripes were a different color , or the task was harder ?
This was a concern that my readers and I shared .
In an ideal world , I would conduct a study for every possible design attribute that could influence whether zebra striping helped or not .
However , these attributes are likely to include at least the following :
number of rows and / or columns ,
density of the text ,
amount of white space between rows and / or columns ,
how high the rows / wide the columns are ,
how many colors are used for the striping ,
which color(s ) is / are used for the striping ,
the degree of contrast between the striped and non-striped colors ,
whether rows are shaded in groups or singly , and if the former , how many rows are in a group ,
what other styles of tables the user has been exposed to in the past ,
how much time the user spends with the table ,
how much the user has to switch between using the table and other tasks ,
the degree of pressure on the user when they are working with the table ,
the type of data that the table contains ( e.g. , text or figures ) ,
whether the user has a pointing device ( e.g. , mouse or electronic pen ) , and
how important the task is to the user .
For a small business owner such as myself , it ’s just not feasible to conduct all this research .
But I did want to follow up on one aspect of the initial study design that particularly bothered me : the lack of real pressure experienced by people when participating .
To my mind , if you give someone an unlimited amount of time to perform a task , they will use that time to perform the task well , especially if they believe accuracy matters .
To put it another way , the initial study may have had a low number of errors because participants were being careful to get the answer right , so the benefit of this added attention outshone the benefit of zebra striping .
The second study : an alternate examination of performance #section4
As such , I felt it was important to conduct another study : one that limited the amount of time participants had to answer and created a bit of pressure around the task .
I also felt it was important to make the task itself harder .
These principles guided the design of the follow - up study that was linked to at the bottom of the original ALA article ( and elsewhere ) .
Like the first study , the follow - up study asked participants to answer eight questions using a table of unfamiliar information ( see figure below ) .
Differently from the first study , users were presented with the questions in a random order , and the style of table ( plain , lined , or striped ) that accompanied each question was also randomly chosen .
A timer in the top right hand corner of the screen helped create a sense of pressure .
Participants had 15 seconds to answer each question : when the time elapsed a message was displayed and the participant was taken to the next question .
Any answer that the participant had entered by the time the 15 seconds elapsed , even if partial , was captured ; participants could also commit their answer before the time elapsed , by using a “ submit ” button .
To add to the difficulty of the task , the table included blank cells and a greater number of rows , so that vertical scrolling was likely to be needed .
In this sense , the table was similar to an online banking statement ( a common use of tables online ) .
A whopping 3,674 browser sessions were begun for this follow - up study , which was conducted April 29 – June 15 , 2008 .
From these , I removed sessions in which more or less than eight questions had been answered .
I also removed all but one session ( chosen at random ) when multiple sessions were submitted from the same IP address .
( This sledgehammer approach was the only way to eliminate duplicates .
It will have also meant the loss of some valid data , but we were concerned to prevent any bias from repeat participation . )
These measures left 2,276 clean survey sessions that could be used for analysis .
Answers were classified as either correct or incorrect , so that accuracy could be analyzed .
An answer was considered correct if it was at least partially correct ( e.g. , “ philli ” or “ Philipins ” for “ Philippines ” ) .
This was done so that people were not as disadvantaged by their typing speed , if they had found the right answer but not entered it fully when the time expired .
This table of information was used in the second study on the benefits of zebra striping .
Participants were asked to answer eight questions using this information , with 15 seconds given for each response .
The table was presented either plain , lined , or zebra striped ; the striped version is shown .
Despite there being only eight questions and three styles , this follow - up study has yielded an incredibly large amount of data .
I have n’t analyzed it all — and probably will never have time to — so if you ’re interested in getting a copy of the data set and running your own analysis , feel free to contact me .
The key results , however , are shown below .
Yellow highlighting indicates cases in which the better performance with the striped version of the table are statistically significant based on Pearson ’s Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit tests .
( These tests adjust for the different sample sizes each table style had . )
Orange highlighting indicates the case that is extremely close to being statistically significant ( p=0.0545 ) .
The results of the second study showed that zebra striping improved accuracy on three of the eight questions asked .
The table shows that for three of the eight questions , the striped version yielded a more accurate response than did the plain and lined versions .
A fourth question comes very close to being statistically significant .
For the remaining four questions , the difference in accuracy between all three styles is so small that it cannot be statistically separated from random noise .
In these cases , performance with zebra striping is just as good as — and certainly no worse than — the plain or lined version .
This means that , in this study at least , zebra striping does n’t harm performance — and in many cases , it actually leads to an improvement .
The third study : user preference #section5
A second issue raised by a number of readers was that the value of zebra striping is related to aesthetics and / or subjective preference as much as actual improvement in performance .
This is a solid argument and one that I made at the end of the original article : if users like zebra striping , then it ’s almost a moot point whether it actually helps them read tables more easily ( provided it does n’t make reading tables harder ) .
In order to use preference as an argument for implementing zebra striping , we need a statistic that shows that the majority of the user audience prefers it .
For this third study , I chose the general public as the user audience , so that the results were as broadly applicable as possible ( i.e. , not just derived predominantly from the web developer community ) .
With the generous support of Newspoll , I was able to ask a question about preference on one of their National Online Omnibus studies .
The National Online Omnibus is a web - based survey of just over 1,200 Australians aged 18 - 64 .
The survey contains different questions every fortnight — organizations buy one or more questions for inclusion .
The survey participants are members of Newspoll ’s rigorously maintained market research panel , and the results are weighted to produce estimates for the Australian population .
Therefore , we can be confident in the representativeness of these results , for the Australian population at least ( and probably also for the populations of other similar countries , such as the United States , Canada , New Zealand , and Britain ) .
Participants were shown the following image [ 1 ] — which presented the same table six times , each using a different style of formatting — and text :
The tables of information used to measure user preference for plain , lined , and variations of zebra striped tables .
The tables were accompanied by the following instructions :
Thinking now about the design of tables .
The above picture shows a table presented in six different styles .
Please rank these different table styles in order of preference from one to six .
Your first choice should be the style that you think does the most to make the table easy to read and use .
Your sixth ( and last ) choice should be the style that you think does the least to make the table easy to read and use .
Obviously , there are many other styles ( e.g. , three color or mix of lined and striped ) that could be tested , but a technical limitation meant the number of styles could be no more than six .
In choosing these six styles out of all the styles possible , we took into account the following factors :
The desire to definitively answer the question : “ Do people prefer zebra striped tables when compared explicitly to plain and lined tables ? ”
Certain alternatives to plain , lined , or single - color , single - row seemed to be popular amongst readers of the original ALA article ( e.g. , two color , single row ) .
article ( e.g. , two color , single row ) .
That gray is neutral and therefore should be able to be used for zebra striping in most cases ( e.g. , regardless of corporate branding constraints and monitor type ) .
That green is easy on the eye ( we have more green receptors than red and blue ones ) and is considered in many cases to be calming .
The need to avoid styles that are likely to create too much visual noise ( and thus make readability worse rather than better ) .
To minimize order effects , it would have been preferable for the order in which the tables appeared in the image to be random , but unfortunately this was not possible .
As a “ next best thing , ” similar styles were physically separated , to make the order appear random .
Also , the style that was thought to be least favored ( plain ) was put in the position that eye tracking studies tell us receives the most attention ( the top left - hand corner ) .
This way , if there was a preference away from this style , this finding could n’t be discounted as a result of the poor location of the table .
The results of this third study are shown in the graph below .
The typical zebra striping approach ( single - color , single - row ) is the most preferred : 31 % of participants rated it as the table that helps the most and only 4 % rated it as the table that helps the least .
( Note that the maximum margin of error on these estimates is 2.8 % . )
The third study showed participants preferred single - row , single - color , zebra striped tables .
The two - color , single - row approach seems to divide the population , with 23 % of the population considering it the best approach but 15 % considering it the worst approach .
These results make sense : we can imagine the use of two different colors could constitute extra visual cues for some but extra visual noise for others .
Interestingly , at 20 % , the lined version is preferred almost as much as the two - color , single - row version .
It also has — like the single - color , single - row version — only a small proportion of people who dislike it , at 4 % .
The other interesting result is the poor outcome for double and triple - striped , each being preferred by less than 10 % .
Triple - striped is also the least preferred option for almost a third of the population ( 28 % ) .
While this may be a reflection of a true dislike for these approaches , the size of the tables used in the survey could be a factor .
Because of space limitations , the tables could only have seven rows , potentially making it less clear that the double and triple striping was a pattern that would be repeated throughout the table .
I personally think the rationale behind it — that it provides more visual information than single row striping , via “ chunking ” of data — makes a lot of sense .
However , it is possible that people just do n’t like it as much as the other styles .
The recommendation #section6
The results of the three studies conducted to date suggest that the safest option is to shade the alternating , individual rows of your table with a single color .
Taking this approach is likely to ensure that :
task performance is better , or at least no worse , than with other table styles , and
the aesthetic sensibilities and subjective preferences of the majority of your users are catered for .
If zebra striping of this type cannot be done easily , then ruling a line between each row may be the next best option .
One door closes and another one opens #section7
It feels as if we are getting somewhere in terms of having reliable and valid statistical data to back up our choice of zebra striping for tabular data online .
However it continues to be possible to punch holes in the studies yielding this data .
For example , maybe people have a subjective preference for single - color , single - row striping because it ’s what they ’re used to ( like using blue underlining for hyperlinks ) .
Familiarity could also explain the lack of support for double and triple striping , approaches that may well improve task performance significantly .
What are we to do ?
I think the answer is twofold .
Firstly , if , in your particular circumstance , the cost associated with implementing single - color , single - row zebra striping is acceptable — and I have been told of several cases where this is not the case — then this should be done .
Otherwise , stick with a plain or lined design .
Secondly , if you are designing an application or website that contains data tables , do n’t let personal preference , habit , or the ( untested ) status quo drive your design decisions — go out there and get some user data .
Run some tests using your preferred approach and one or more of the alternatives described here .
And if you can , share your results with us , so our knowledge of the efficacy or otherwise , of different styles of tabular data , can grow .

For more than 300 years we thought Saturn was the only body in the solar system with rings .
But by 1989 , after ground - based measurements and flybys from Voyagers 1 and 2 , we had discovered rings around the other three gas giants — Jupiter , Uranus , and Neptune .
Now the Cassini spacecraft appears to have found a ring system around Saturn ’s second - largest moon , Rhea .
The discovery took astronomers by surprise .
Just what is a ring doing around a moon , especially one that is significantly smaller than our own ?
Normally a ring forms when two things are present : space debris , either from a collision with a small body or left over from the solar system ’s formation , and sufficient gravity to attract the debris and hold it in place .
While the gas giants all have what it takes to hold a ring system in place , “ a ring system around a moon comes as a surprise because the parent planet ’s gravity should destabilize any ring system that might form , ” says Richard P. Binzel , a professor of planetary science at MIT .
That leaves two possible explanations for Rhea ’s ring .
It may be that the debris was kicked off recently enough that Saturn has not yet had a chance to destabilize it .
But it is more likely that Rhea is uniquely suited to hold debris in orbit .
Simulations indicate that , given Rhea ’s size and distant orbit around Saturn , this moon could potentially hang on to a ring for millions of years or more before the planet ’s pull overcomes Rhea ’s hold .
Whatever the case , the mission scientists are eager to gather more data when Cassini returns to Rhea in 2010 .

Tropical storm Gustav began pounding Jamaica Thursday , prompting evacuations and relief efforts as the strengthening storm continued a collision course with the Gulf of Mexico , where officials in Mississippi and Louisiana were already on high alert ..
After barreling through Haiti and the Dominican Republic with hurricane - force winds and rain earlier in the week , Gustav was somewhere shy of 80 miles off the coast of east Jamaica on Thursday and gaining steam .
Heavy rains that signaled its arrival led Jamaican officials to open shelters and warn residents to seek cover .
Forecasters said the storm had winds of roughly 70 miles per hour , but would accelerate toward Category 3 speeds of 111 mph as it continued west toward the Gulf .
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 , with Category 1 storms reaching winds of 74 mph and Category 5 storms exceeding speeds of 155 mph .
Forecasters said Gustav would grow to a hurricane by the end of the day .
Emergency preparations for the storm along the Gulf Coast come almost three years to the day that Hurricane Katrina slammed New Orleans , destroying levees , flooding 80 percent of the city , and killing nearly 1,500 people .
If Gustav were to strike the region , it would be the first major hurricane to threaten the Gulf since 2005 .
In June , the Vancouver City Council unanimously approved the adoption the the highest green standards for private sector development in North America .
Effective immediately , all new re-zonings for development in Vancouver will be required to achieve or exceed the level of LEED Silver , and they will have to achieve LEED Gold on January 1st , 2010 .
The City of Vancouver already had a green building requirement for its new City - owned buildings but the EcoDensity Charter is much broader in its scope because it applies to privately - owned developments , which make up virtually the entire building industry .
The new requirements are part of the hotly debated EcoDensity Charter that the city adopted .
See more details about the debate in this Vancouver Courier article .
The charter is part of the city ’s larger goal is a carbon - neutral city by 2030 .
Green buildings cost only 3 % more to build at the time of construction , and that cost is usually recouped in the first year , because of the building ’s lower heating / cooling costs .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska lawmakers investigating Gov. Sarah Palin 's firing of the state 's public safety commissioner put off a Friday hearing after most of the witnesses they subpoenaed last week failed to show up .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is being investigated for the possibly improper firing of a state official .
Subpoenas were never served on seven of the 13 people after Alaska 's attorney general scuttled a deal with legislative leaders to arrange for their statement , state Sen .
Hollis French , the investigation 's manager , said Friday .
Two aides to the governor -- now the Republican vice presidential candidate -- were served and refused to comply , and Palin 's husband , Todd , was among the no-shows .
But French said Stephen Branchflower , the special counsel conducting the investigation , still plans to complete it by early October .

" I have spoken to Mr. Branchflower this morning .
He is continuing to gather information and expects to complete his investigation by October 10 , " he said .
French , a Democrat , has become a lightning rod for allies of the Alaska governor , who have accused him of turning the investigation in a " partisan circus . "
Palin has halted her cooperation with the investigation , which was commissioned by a bipartisan committee of the Legislature before she became Sen.

" It 's become a full - contact sport with no rules of engagement .
It 's very disgusting .
People have a right to be disgusted , as they try to refrain their gag reflex . "
The resistance has been fueled by remarks made in early September by French , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
In an interview with ABC News , French said the investigation -- which had been scheduled to wrap up at the end of October -- could present an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
Lawmakers have little recourse when witnesses refuse to show up .
The Senate could vote to cite them for contempt , but it does not convene until January , Judiciary Committee member Bill Wielechowski said Thursday .
Wielechowski , a Democrat , said the McCain campaign is trying to " stonewall " the investigation .
But Palin and her lawyers argue that the state Personnel Board is the proper venue for the investigation and have asked that three - member panel to look into her July firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
Since his firing , Monegan has accused Palin of trying to pressure him into firing her former brother - in - law , a state trooper who had been involved in an acrimonious divorce from the governor 's sister .
Palin has consistently denied any wrongdoing and said Monegan , who oversaw the state trooper force , was sacked over budget disagreements .
She initially denied anyone in her administration or family had pressed for action against her ex-brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , whom she has branded a " rogue trooper " who threatened her family .
But in mid-August , she acknowledged that aides had contacted Monegan 's office nearly two dozen times about Wooten .
She put Frank Bailey , her boards and commissions director , on paid leave after disclosing that he had tape - recorded discussing Wooten 's job application records and a workers ' compensation claim with a state police lieutenant in February .
French said Bailey gave a sworn statement to his committee through Palin 's lawyer , and Branchflower had obtained Bailey 's phone records through one of the subpoenas issued last week .
Wooten and Palin 's sister , Molly McCann , began divorce proceedings in 2005 .
Wooten was suspended for five days in March 2006 after state police commanders determined that he had used a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity ; " had driven his patrol car while drinking beer and had illegally shot a moose using his wife 's hunting permit -- complaints raised by Palin 's family .
Of the 13 people subpoenaed , only one -- former Palin aide John Bitney -- had given a statement by Friday .
But French said Branchflower was scheduled to interview Murlene Wilkes , a state contractor who handles workers ' compensation claims , Friday afternoon .
Branchflower told French 's committee last week that an employee of Wilkes ' firm reported being pressured to deny a claim by Wooten , and Todd Palin had been circulating a picture of Wooten riding a snowmobile on a day when he was supposed to have been out on workers ' compensation .
But the state attorney general 's office has reported the claim was handled normally , he said .
Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein argued Thursday that Todd Palin did not have to comply with a subpoena because Alaska state law bars ethics investigations of people running for elected office .
Though the law appears to apply only to candidates for state office , a McCain - Palin spokesman said the subpoenas violate " the spirit of the law , if not the letter . "

WASHINGTON  The White House predicted Monday that President Bush would leave a record $ 482 billion deficit to his successor , a sobering turnabout in the nation ’s fiscal condition from 2001 , when Mr. Bush took office after three consecutive years of budget surpluses .
The worst may be yet to come .
The deficit announced by Jim Nussle , the White House budget director , does not reflect the full cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , the potential $ 50 billion cost of another economic stimulus package , or the possibility of steeper losses in tax revenues if individual income or corporate profits decline .
The new deficit numbers also do not account for any drains on the national treasury that might result from further declines in the housing market .
The White House forecast was prepared before passage of the huge housing assistance package that Mr. Bush has promised to sign .
That legislation would put taxpayer money at risk in numerous ways , especially if housing prices continue to decline .
Hurricane Gustav gave the state of Louisiana a test for which it had three years to prepare .
There were thousands of poor , sick , disabled and elderly people who could not get out on their own .
They needed to be rescued with dispatch , and sheltered in safety and dignity .
One simple test .
The state flunked .
Three years to the week after Hurricane Katrina ’s landfall , Louisiana executed a fundamentally unfair evacuation plan and did it badly .
It relied on dividing the population into separate streams : People with their own cars were directed to shelters run by parishes , churches and the Red Cross .
People with medical problems not requiring hospitalization were taken to special shelters .
Sex offenders had a shelter to themselves .
All those without a car or a ride were taken on state buses to four state - run warehouses .
It was in these shelters , including two abandoned stores , a Wal - Mart and a Sam ’s Club , that thousands of working - poor New Orleanians got a sickening reminder of Katrina .
Evacuees said they had had no idea where they were going ; bus drivers would not tell them .
When they arrived , there were not enough portable toilets , and no showers .
For five days there was no way to bathe , except with bottled water in filthy outdoor toilets .
Privacy in the vast open space  1,000 people to a warehouse , shoulder - to - shoulder on cots  was nonexistent .
The mood among evacuees was grim , surrounded as they were by police officers and the National Guard , with no visitors or reporters allowed .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia announced plans on Tuesday to station about 7,600 troops in Georgia ’s separatist regions , more than twice the number based there before last month ’s war and a level likely to alarm the West .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said troops would stay in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for a long time to prevent any “ repeat of Georgian aggression ” .
Moscow ’s intervention in Georgia last month , in which its forces crushed an attempt by Tbilisi to retake South Ossetia , drew widespread international condemnation and prompted concern over the security of energy supplies .
Russia agreed on Monday to withdraw its soldiers from areas outside South Ossetia , and the second breakaway region of Abkhazia , within a month , but troops inside the two regions were not explicitly mentioned in the French - brokered deal .
Briefing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on talks with the separatist leaders , Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said : “ We have already agreed on the contingent -- in the region of 3,800 men in each republic -- its structure and location . ”
Russia angered the West last month by recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which threw off Tbilisi ’s rule in separatist wars in the 1990s , as independent states .
Nicaragua is the only other state to have recognized their independence .
Lavrov also met the two separatist regions ’ foreign ministers on Tuesday to formally establish diplomatic ties , a step likely to further irritate Western governments .
Asked at a news conference how long Russian forces would stay in South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Lavrov said : “ They will be there for a long time , at least for the foreseeable period .
That is necessary to not allow a repeat of Georgian aggression . ”
PEACEKEEPING FORCE
Russia has said it was morally obliged to send in its military last month to prevent what it called a genocide in the separatist regions by an aggressive Georgian government .
Before fighting broke out in Georgia last month , Russia had a peacekeeping force of 1,000 servicemen in South Ossetia and a contingent of about 2,500 in Abkhazia .
They were operating under a peacekeeping mandate dating back to the 1990s .
Russia has welcomed the European Union ’s role as a mediator over Georgia but in sharp contrast , it has accused the United States of contributing to the conflict by arming Georgia and failing to rein in its leadership .
Russia ’s Foreign Ministry said the White House ’s decision to rescind a draft agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation with Russia was “ mistaken and politicized . ”

U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , who visited Georgia last week to show solidarity with the ex-Soviet state , said in Rome on Tuesday that the international community was united in deploring Russia ’s military action .
LIMITED RESPONSE
Both the European Union and the United States have warned Russia it could face serious consequences over its actions in Georgia , but the scope for punitive measures is limited .
Slideshow ( 18 images )
Europe depends on Russia for more than a quarter of its gas supplies and Washington needs Russia ’s cooperation in efforts to curb Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
After four hours of talks outside Moscow on Monday , Medvedev and EU leaders led by French President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed that Russian forces in buffer zones outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia would pull back within a month .
They are to be replaced with an international monitoring force which will include a 200 - strong EU contingent .
Questions remain about Russia ’s dominant role inside the two separatist regions , where most residents hold Russian passports .
The fighting in Georgia worried energy markets because it was waged near the route of an oil pipeline that can pump up to 1 million barrels of crude per day from the Caspian Sea .
The pipeline is favored by the West because it bypasses Russia .
The International Court of Justice in the Hague , the highest United Nations court , this week began hearing Georgian allegations that Russian violated the human rights of ethnic Georgians in the separatist regions .
Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy head of the Russian military ’s General Staff , said Russia had nothing to hide .
“ At this trial , our position is calm and dignified , ” he told foreign military attachees .
“ I am firmly convinced that the Russian Federation took the only right decision . ”
In the 11th Report on Carcinogens , the US government added Hepatitis C , Hepatitis B , and certain papilloma viruses to their list of substances known to be carcinogenic .
This represented the first time ever that viruses were included .
At the sixth annual International Conference of the American Association for Cancer Research , Dr. Andrew J. Dannenberg stated , “ I believe that , conservatively , 15 to 20 % of all cancer is caused by infections , however , the number could be larger , maybe double . ”
Dr. Dannenberg is director of the Cancer Center at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
He went on to say , “ Unfortunately , the public , as well as many health - care workers , are unaware of the significance of chronic infection as a potentially preventable cause of cancer . ”
Some examples he gave were liver cancer , caused by chronic Hepatitis B and C , and MALT lymphoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach caused by Helicobacter pylori bacteria .
Also , schistosome parasite infection has been implicated in bladder cancer ( transitional cell carcinoma ) .
Probably the most well known example is HPV , or human papilloma virus , known to cause genital warts and now known to be the major cause of cervical cancer .
According to the National Cancer Institute , 11,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2007 , and nearly 4,000 of these would die from it .
Oropharyngeal cancer is also thought to be caused , in some cases , by HPV infection and past HPV exposure .
The FDA approved Gardasil vaccination in 2006 to prevent infection against high - risk HPV ’s known to cause cervical cancers and genital warts .
Gardasil is approved for use in girls only , and can be given as young as nine years of age .
This has led to some questions as to why the vaccine is not offered to boys if it is known that HPV causes oropharyngeal cancer as well as vaginal cancer .
This may be because the vaccine is expensive and oropharyngeal is rare in comparison to cervical cancer .
What does the future hold for virus research ?
Likely much more research will be done to attempt to identify which viruses are associated with certain types of cancer .
If this can be accomplished , perhaps the key to fighting cancer in the future will be to prevent people from getting cancer in the first place .
If scientists can create a vaccine like Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer , it is not out of the realm of possibility to hope that some day they will come up with a vaccine for all cancers .
One can always hope .

A GOP congressional leader who was wavering on giving President Bush the authority to wage war in late 2002 said Vice President Dick Cheney misled him by saying that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had direct personal ties to Al Qaeda terrorists and was making rapid progress toward a suitcase nuclear weapon , according to a new book by Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman .
Cheney ’s accusations , described by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas , came in a classified one - on - one briefing in the vice president ’s office in the Capitol .
The threat Cheney described went far beyond public statements that have been criticized for relying on “ cherry - picked ” intelligence of unknown reliability .
There was no intelligence to support the vice president ’s private assertions , Gellman reports .
Armey had spoken out against the coming war , and his opposition gave cover to Democrats who feared the political costs of appearing weak .
Armey reversed his position after Cheney told him , he said , that the threat from Iraq was “ more imminent than we want to portray to the public at large . ”

Cheney said , according to Armey , that Iraq ’s “ ability to miniaturize weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear , ” had been “ substantially refined since the first Gulf War . ”
Cheney linked that threat to Hussein ’s alleged ties to Al Qaeda , Armey said , explaining “ we now know they have the ability to develop these weapons in a very portable fashion , and they have a delivery system in their relationship with organizations such as Al Qaeda . ”
“ Did Dick Cheney . . . purposely tell me things he knew to be untrue ? ”
Armey said .
“ I seriously feel that may be the case .
. . .
Had I known or believed then what I believe now , I would have publicly opposed [ the war ] resolution right to the bitter end . ”
I ’ve seen several articles over the weekend arguing that Barack Obama ’s recent move up in the polls is due to the renewed attention on the economy , particularly the financial crisis which has taken on a renewed urgency over the last ten days .
I do n’t doubt this is true to a substantial degree .
But looking at the arc of the tracking polls , particularly the second half of last week , I ’m wondering if a big part of the gap is n’t due to McCain ’s increasingly erratic and craven behavior — the now almost legendary campaign ‘ suspension ’ non-suspension being the best example .
The campaigners spent 30 hours on the power station site Six Greenpeace activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage during a protest over coal - fired power .
The activists were charged with causing £ 30,000 of damage after they scaled Kingsnorth power station in Hoo , Kent .
At Maidstone Crown Court Judge David Caddick said the jury had to examine whether protesters had a lawful excuse .
The defendants said the protest was lawful because it aimed to prevent damaging emissions .
Energy firm E.ON said lives had been put at risk .
Five people who scaled the chimney - Huw Williams , 41 , of Nottingham ; Ben Stewart , 34 , of Lyminge , Kent ; Kevin Drake , 44 , of Westbury , Wiltshire ; Will Rose , 29 , of London ; and Emily Hall , 34 , from New Zealand - were all charged with causing criminal damage .
' Gordon , bin it '
Tim Hewke , 48 , from Ulcombe , Kent , accused by the prosecution of organising the protest from the ground , also faced the same charge .
Jurors heard how protesters painted the name " Gordon " on the 200 m ( 650 ft ) chimney on 8 October last year , in a political protest against the redevelopment of the plant as a coal - burning unit .
They had planned to daub the words " Gordon , bin it " on the stack in a reference to Prime Minister Gordon Brown , but were threatened with a High Court injunction and arrested .
The campaigners painted the name " Gordon " on the chimney After the hearing , E.ON spokeswoman Emily Highmore said the firm , which is planning to build a coal - fired unit at the plant , was " hugely disappointed " .
She said : " We respect people 's right to protest , but what Greenpeace did was hugely irresponsible .
It put people 's lives at risk and that is clearly completely unacceptable . "
Ms Highmore called for an " open and honest debate " about the challenges of energy and climate change , but added : " That 's a debate that should n't be taking place at the top of a chimney stack . "
She added : " Our men and women who work at Kingsnorth have a right to go to work to do their lawful business and to do it safely , so we 're very concerned indeed about today 's outcome . "
This is a huge blow for ministers and their plans for new coal - fired power stations
Ben Stewart
Outside the court , activist Mr Stewart said the verdict was " a tipping point for the climate change movement " .
He said : " When 12 normal people say it is legitimate for a direct action group to shut down a coal - fired power station because of the harm it does to our planet then where does that leave government energy policy ? "
Mr Stewart called for " clean technologies " to be used instead of coal .
And he said : " This is a huge blow for ministers and their plans for new coal - fired power stations . "
There has been no government response to the verdict .

While being interviewed on CNN by Wolf Blitzer , Ron Paul was asked if he would consider endorsing Libertarian Party presidential candidate Bob Barr .
Here is what Dr. Paul said :
“ I think [ Bob Barr ] is running a very important race , and I ’m encouraging him .
I have n’t endorsed him , but he ’s saying the kind of things I like to hear said , and I hope he does real well . ”
But Paul was quick to add : “ But we also have Chuck Baldwin , who runs on the Constitution Party .
His views are very very close to mine , and he worked very hard in my campaign , so for me to pick one over the other is not easy .
I hope they both , together , get a lot of votes . ”
When asked if a good turnout for Barr and Baldwin would hurt John McCain , Paul said that many of his young supporters are torn between Ron Paul and Barack Obama .
Ron Paul also said that he will not vote for or endorse John McCain unless McCain changes his positions on foreign policy and the Federal Reserve .
In response to a viewer question , Paul said he almost definitely would not be willing to serve as McCain ’s VP , even in the unlikely event that he was chosen or nominated from the floor .

When I asked my students to look at Starbucks ' entry into Australia , I expected them to point out some of the challenges but was quite shocked at how overwhelmingly negative their assessment was .
At the time , I attributed this to the negative publicity the company was getting from their opposition to the trademarking of Ethiopian coffee .
While I pointed out to my students that Starbucks did quite a lot of good work with growers in Central America , they saw the company 's actions as an attempt to keep the cost of supply down and that , just like many other big companies , it had lost sight of its original vision .
Perhaps they were right .
When they look at Starbucks , students tend to marvel at how rapidly the business expanded .
Good students also quickly notice the limitations to the business model .
Starbucks has always had a limited product line and has few opportunities to achieve extra revenue for existing customers .
Once you have sold someone some coffee beans , a CD and a two - litre coffee , there is n't much more you can do for them and it is hard to shoo them away without ruining the image of the " third place " .
In my view , the key reason that they have been so unsuccessful in Australia is their inability to adjust to local market conditions .
While the company 's British and Asia expansion took it to markets without strong coffee traditions , Australia , with its history of European immigration , was always going to be a test .
Starbucks has been trying to sell a watered down product in one of the most sophisticated and lively coffee markets in the world .
As one of my students ( who , incidentally , had worked at a Starbucks ) put it , " why would you want to sit around a pretend lounge room drinking a weak and expensive coffee , when you can go around the corner and have the real thing ? "
Ironically , it seems that the thing that made Starbucks successful in the first place , its ability to adjust the original ( European ) business model to local ( US ) conditions , is the thing that let it down the most .
It is interesting to compare the fate of Starbucks with Krispy Kreme doughnuts .
Like Starbucks , Krispy Kreme was successful at taking a cult product from a single outlet and turning it into a national phenomenon .
Like Starbucks , Krispy Kreme has had major problems in the US market , nicely illustrating the dangers of growing too quickly ( and shifts in consumer preferences , in Krispy Kreme 's case the Atkins Diet ) .
But the fate of the two businesses in Australia has been dramatically different .
Unlike Starbucks Australia , which is a wholly - owned subsidiary of its US parent , Krispy Kreme Australia is Australian owned .
This means that local investors , with a good sense of the local market , have put their own money into the business and are taking an active role in running it and shaping its direction .
Unlike Starbucks , which entered the Australian market by buying a whole lot of sites , Krispy Kreme , which now has 49 outlets in four states , expanded slowly from its original base in western Sydney .
And unlike Starbucks , through selling doughnuts to not - for - profit organisations for fund - raising , it has successfully embedded itself in the daily lives of its consumers .

Trek fan knows that there ’s matter and antimatter .
But why is there apparently so much more matter than antimatter .
Scientific American ’s JR Minkel : “ Two recent experiments show something interesting is going on in a subatomic particle called the Bs ( B - sub - S ) meson .
It flips between its matter and antimatter forms 3 trillion times a second .
But the flipping is n’t quite matching up with the predictions of the standard model of particle physics .
We think that in the very early universe there were almost equal parts matter and antimatter .
“ And the universe back then was acting like a giant cauldron spewing particles .
Lot of energy , lot of particles being made , but a slightly higher chance that the particles would be matter and not antimatter — which the standard model does n’t explain .
Now , the odd behavior of the Bs meson could be giving us some clues about why matter won out over antimatter .
When the Large Hadron Collider goes online in Europe this year we may finally be able to observe conditions that would really show us what happened in the early universe to make it the way it is today . ”

In their infinite wisdom , customs officials in Hong Kong have arrested a child for sharing music on the Internet .
The 14 year old boy , who is too young to be named , is alleged to have uploaded Chinese language pop songs , known as Cantopop , for others to download for free .
In order to better understand the position of this teenager and the craziness of today ’s society , I ’m reading this news through my memory of what it was like to be 14 again .
School , friends , acne , the opposite sex – and computers , I loved them , in all their 8 - bit glory .
So , customs officials in Hong Kong have arrested a 14 year old boy .
The boy is suspected to have uploaded 2,000 Chinese - language pop songs onto the Internet .
I ’d love to be able to tell you this kid ’s name , but ( un ) fortunately the law says he ’s too young to be named .
I ’m sure kids today are much smarter and advanced than I was , so hopefully he ’s not too young to understand what ’s happening to him .
The ‘ not knowing ’ would add considerably to his ordeal .
According to customs spokesman Michael Kwan , the teenager had been sharing Cantonese pop songs , known locally as Cantopop .
When I was 14 , I had cassette tapes filled with pop music too , all of it copied from anyone who had a copy .
I doubt I had 2000 tracks , but I certainly had an impressive arsenal of jam - packed C90’s , and I happily copied them for anyone with a blank tape .
In fact , faced with no money but a thirst for pop music , all my friends copied off each other , and the recipients of those copies all shared those with everyone else .
It never crossed our minds that we would be arrested for it .
Not once , since arrests seemed to be reserved for the glue - sniffing vandals who my parents warned me to stay away from , which I did , happily .
Copyright infringements in Hong Kong apparently carry a maximum penalty of four years in jail and a fine of HK $ 50,000 ( US $ 6,400 ) for every item violated .
A worrying amount for an adult , even ones who have the means to raise the cash .
I once ran up a $ 30 telephone bill for my parents through my generous use of a 1200 / 75 modem .
Through my kid ’s vision it seemed like the end of the world , even though the phone company was the boogeyman , not the police or entertainment companies .
Mr Kwan , a head at Hong Kong ’s Copyright Investigation Division , told at a press conference that the boy made a post on a forum indicating he had the songs for download .
A press conference ?
For a 14 year old kid sharing music ?
Could I have imagined being arrested at 14 for taping music , taken away and then be the subject of discussion at a government press conference ?
Hardly .
But maybe I should ’ve been – they say standards are slipping in society , maybe the police and media companies coming down hard on children is the solution ?
The Kid With No Name has been set free on a bail of 2,000 Hong Kong dollars , roughly US $ 260 , and has not been charged while the police make further inquiries .
Hopefully the investigation wo n’t interfere too much with his school work and revision at this crucial point in his education .
Or maybe any diversion away from school work is cool in the eyes of a hormonal teenager ?
I think I ’d have been happy to have a few disrupted maths lessons , but there again , in hindsight I did n’t understand how important they were .
After all , I was just a kid .
But of course , eventually all kids grow up .
We leave school and start earning our own money and start making those important decisions about where to spend it , which are probably shaped by previous life experiences and dreams for the future .
We also decide who to vote for .
I did n’t grow up in a ‘ lock up pirates and throw away the key ’ environment yet i’m still disturbed and concerned at how copyright enforcement is heading .
Going to war against today ’s potential customers seems foolish .
Punishing and polarizing children – tomorrow ’s customers – at the behest of big - business , is in a completely different league .

McCain ad questioned as word ' HANG ' appears over image of Barack Obama John Byrne
Published : Thursday August 28 , 2008
Print This Email This A McCain ad aired on Fox News channel with the words " HANG " in the background along with a photograph of Barack Obama has sparked outrage after being noticed by a reporter at a local Fox television affiliate .
The words " HIGHER TAXES " are transposed on an image of Obama standing in front of a crowd .
The background is blurred at the edges so that the words from Obama 's signature theme -- change -- has been cut down to the word " HANG . "
The shot appears for about a second .
You can watch the ad in its entirety below .
Asked about the image , the McCain camp said , " We 're not even validating such an outrageous and preposterous claim with a comment . "
Strikingly , the image of Obama with the word hang in the background is blurred far more heavily on the side where the C would have been , suggesting the decision was intentional .
The company that produced the ad refused to comment when the local Fox affiliate inquired .
Not everyone is buying the claim the transposition is deliberate .
Even at the liberal blog Daily Kos , an informal poll indicated 76 percent thought the image was deliberate , with 23 percent saying it was a coincidence .
" Is this a coincidence ? " one diarist wrote .
" People spend hours and hours editing political ads , I really do n't see how this could go unnoticed by the editors .
Maybe they saw it and thought it was n't noticeable or maybe they thought it was n't important . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal prosecutor formally declared Army biological researcher Bruce Ivins the sole person responsible for creating and mailing the bacterial spores that killed five people in the 2001 anthrax attacks .
Officials said biodefense researcher Bruce E. Ivins , seen here in 2003 , committed suicide .
" We believe , based on the evidence we collected , that we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt , " Jeffrey Taylor , the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , told reporters at a news conference Wednesday afternoon .
Taylor presented an overview of the case against Ivins , 62 , after the Justice Department released documents detailing the scientist 's role in what Taylor called " the worst act of bioterrorism in U.S. history . "
The anthrax - laced letters sickened 15 and killed two Washington postal workers , a New York hospital worker , a National Enquirer photo editor in Florida and a 94 - year - old woman in Connecticut .
In a statement issued after the news conference , Ivins ' lawyers continued to proclaim their client 's innocence and said the government 's documents and statements fell short of " concrete evidence . "
" The government 's press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements , heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence -- all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by Dr. Ivins , " attorneys Paul Kemp and Thomas M. DeGonia said .
Anthrax Probe
The FBI investigation into anthrax - tainted letters that killed 5 people spanned almost 7 years .
get the backstory »
Authorities took the unusual step of laying out the case to the public after FBI Director Robert Mueller earlier Wednesday briefed survivors and relatives of victims of the attacks on the investigation .
Taylor said Ivins committed suicide last week as federal prosecutors prepared for a meeting with his lawyers to lay out the findings .
Watch Taylor outline the case against Ivins »
" We were able to identify in early 2005 the genetically unique parent material of the anthrax spores used in the mailings , " Taylor said .
" The parent material of the anthrax spores used in the attacks was a single flask of spores , known as RMR - 1029 , that was created and solely maintained by Dr. Ivins . "
Ivins spent 28 years as a civilian microbiologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick , Maryland , where he was trying to develop a vaccine against anthrax .
But Taylor said Ivins ' deteriorating mental state was compounded by fears that his vaccine program was in jeopardy , leading him to create a " murder weapon " in the form of a flask of purified anthrax spores in his lab .
" Dr. Ivins was a troubled individual , " Taylor said , referring to his documented history of mental illness .
Ivins had been under " significant stress in both his home and work life " around the time of the attacks , an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant states .
About two weeks after the attacks , one co-worker told a former colleague that " Bruce has been an absolute manic basket case the last few days , " the affidavit said .
" One theory is that , by launching these attacks , he creates a situation , a scenario , where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine , " Taylor said .
Investigators also traced the envelopes that contained the spore - laced letters to the Frederick , Maryland , area where Ivins lived , Taylor said .
The handwritten letters bore a Trenton , New Jersey , postmark and the date " 9-11-01 . "
They ended with " Death to America .
Death to Israel .
Allah is Great . "
Ivins sent an e-mail to a colleague a few days before the attacks that contained similar language , writing that " bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas " and have " just decreed death to all Jews and all Americans , " according to the affidavit .
Authorities began focusing on Ivins in 2007 , but he was unable to give investigators an " adequate explanation " when questioned by authorities about the long hours he had spent at the lab around the time of the attacks , according to the affidavit , which also said Ivins tried to mislead FBI agents by giving them false samples of the bacteria from his lab for analysis .
But Ivins ' attorney said the search warrants and the affidavits used to support them could not be considered " smoking guns . "
" The government would have the American people believe that after seven years and more than $ 15 million of taxpayer money , they have found the individual responsible for the heinous attacks of the fall of 2001 , " Kemp said .
" Nothing could be farther from the truth . "
At the time of his death , Ivins was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions .
Just a few weeks before his death , Ivins had been hospitalized for psychiatric examination after threatening to kill co-workers , investigators " and other individuals who had wronged him , " and agents found body armor , three pistols and several boxes of ammunition in his home when they searched it , the affidavit states .
Wednesday 's announcement comes six years to the day after then - Attorney General John Ashcroft publicly declared another Fort Detrick scientist , Steven Hatfill , a " person of interest " in the attacks .
Hatfill was not charged and sued over the matter , a case the government settled in June .
His case has fueled skepticism about the allegations against Ivins , and experts in the field have disputed some details that have emerged from the investigation .
Taylor said Ivins was one of few people at Fort Detrick who knew how to operate a lyophilizer , which converts wet anthrax into the kind of dry powder that was used in the attacks .
But Richard Spertzel , a former colleague of Ivins at Fort Detrick , said no one working at a U.S. government lab could have produced such high - quality anthrax in secret .

Changes 15 minutes ahead of naming Palin by the same people who were updating McCain ’s entry ?
When you have a non-existent record , I guess this is the only option to make someone sound qualified .
An op - ed in today 's New York Times questions the Veterans Administration 's policy that bans nonpartisan voter registration drives from federally - financed veterans sites .
NYT :
WHAT is the secretary of Veterans Affairs thinking ?
On May 5 , the department led by James B . Peake issued a directive that bans nonpartisan voter registration drives at federally financed nursing homes , rehabilitation centers and shelters for homeless veterans .
As a result , too many of our most patriotic American citizens — our injured and ill military veterans — may not be able to vote this November .
The federal government should be doing everything it can to support our nation ’s veterans who have served us so courageously .
There can be no justification for any barrier that impedes the ability of veterans to participate in democracy ’s most fundamental act , the vote .
So let me get this straight :
We ask these brave young men and women to risk their lives in order to protect our rights and freedoms -- most important of which is the right to vote -- and then we make it harder for them to exercise that right when they return ?
Why is Bush so afraid to have our veterans register and vote ?

U.S. drug manufacturers are reaping a windfall from taxpayers because Medicare ’s privately administered prescription drug benefit program pays more than other government programs for the same medicines , a House committee charged in a report Thursday .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that taxpayers are paying up to 30 % more for prescription drugs under Medicare ’s privatized Part D program for seniors and the disabled than under the government ’s Medicaid program for the poor .
“ Medicare Part D has given the major drug companies a taxpayer - funded windfall worth billions of dollars , ” said committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) .
Waxman said he would introduce legislation to guarantee that federal taxpayers would not be charged higher prices under Medicare Part D than under Medicaid .

“ This is an enormous giveaway .
And it has absolutely no justification , ” he said .
Under Medicaid , drug companies have to sell prescription drugs to the government at discounted prices .
When Medicare Part D was enacted in January 2006 , drug companies were no longer obliged to cut rates for their products .
In the two years Medicare Part D has been in effect , drug manufacturers have taken in $ 3.7 billion more than they would have through prices under the Medicaid program , committee investigators found .
“ The drug companies are making the same drugs .
They are being used by the same beneficiaries .
Yet because the drugs are being bought through Medicare Part D instead of Medicaid , the prices paid by the taxpayers have ballooned by billions of dollars , ” Waxman said .

He said Bristol - Myers made an additional $ 400 million from higher prices for a single drug , the stroke medication Plavix .
The committee ’s report and a hearing on Thursday echoed the battle over a Medicare bill last week .
That debate centered , in part , on privatization of the Medicare system , which many Republicans support and many Democrats oppose .
The privatization of programs such as Medicare has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign , with Republican candidate John McCain calling for a change in the way Social Security is funded .
Congress last week overwhelmingly overrode President Bush ’s veto of the Medicare bill , which will take funds from private insurers that run Medicare Advantage plans to reimburse doctors who see Medicare patients .

On Thursday , the ranking Republican on the oversight committee , Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia , said that the cost of Medicare Part D had come in nearly 40 % lower than original estimates and that seniors using the program were satisfied .
“ More economically disadvantaged seniors have access to the drugs their doctors prescribe than ever before in American history , ” Davis said in a statement .
“ They ’ve learned to love Part D . ”
A report by the committee ’s Republican staff said Democrats were asking the wrong questions about Medicare Part D. Federal price controls for Medicaid result in prices below those available in the free market , but the difference does not amount to a “ windfall ” for drug companies , Republicans said .
Richard Smith , a vice president with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , the leading drug industry group , warned in a statement to the committee against government interference in Medicare Part D .

“ It is primarily the effective operation of the competitive market that has driven down Part D costs for beneficiaries and taxpayers compared to previous estimates , ” Smith said .

Convicted Queensland paedophile Dennis Ferguson has been awarded $ 2,250 in compensation after being run out of Ipswich three years ago .
Ferguson claimed he had suffered stress after being forced to leave the area .
Pensioner Noel Watterson was found guilty of threatening him and was sued by Ferguson for damages .
Acting Premier Paul Lucas says the justice system is there to protect everyone .
" The legal system is there for you and me and unfortunately also for people like Dennis Ferguson , " he said .
" I say to people over and over again , do not take the law into your own hands , and now the consequence is of course that there has been this compensation award in favour of Dennis Ferguson .
" But frankly I 'm more focused on the victims of Dennis Ferguson . "
Mr Waterson says he does not have the money .
The court heard that Collins , who has been seeing Howard for five years , came up with the plan after the tycoon , who she said frequented prostitutes and swingers clubs , made unreasonable demands on her including that she become involved in " stranger sex " .
Mr Talansky raised thousands of dollars at meetings in New York A US businessman has testified he gave envelopes full of cash to Israel 's prime minister but said he did not seek or receive any favours in return .
Morris Talansky told an Israeli court he did not know how the money was spent , but linked it to Ehud Olmert 's " love " of " expensive " luxury goods .
Police are investigating whether the PM took up to $ 500,000 ( £ 250,000 ) in bribes or illegal campaign donations .
Mr Olmert says sums from Mr Talansky were legal campaign contributions .
Mr Talansky made his claim during testimony under oath at the request of prosecutors , before his expected return to the United States .
" I gave [ Mr Olmert ] cash in envelopes , " the millionaire campaign fundraiser said , according to a transcript of the hearing .
" I asked him why I could n't write a cheque and he said it 's because of the way the money is channelled . "
When asked how the money was spent by Mr Olmert , Mr Talansky said : " I only know that he loved expensive cigars .
I know he loved pens , watches .
I found it strange . "
Criticism Mr Talansky has already said that he gave Mr Olmert money for more than 10 years before he became Israeli prime minister .
I never had any personal benefits from this relationship whatsoever
Morris Talansky Correspondents say the revelations are likely to damage further Mr Olmert 's already low standing .
This is the fifth investigation that police have launched into the financial affairs of Mr Olmert , who also faced criticism about the handling of the 2006 war in Lebanon .
Mr Talansky told the hearing that the bulk of the money was raised in New York " parlour meetings " , where Mr Olmert would address US donors who would then leave contributions on their chairs .
" He was articulate , he was intelligent .
I felt that he would be a leader that I would have hoped to be if I had the talent , " Mr Talansky said .
He also said that he had given Mr Olmert loans of tens of thousands of dollars for foreign trips , but the money was not repaid .
" I had a very close relationship with him , but ...
I never expected anything personally .
I never had any personal benefits from this relationship whatsoever . "
Mr Olmert has twice been questioned by police in recent weeks , but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing .
He says he will resign if indicted .
Mr Talansky 's testimony is not part of a trial but was taken as a precaution in the event of a future legal case , as he resides in the US and might not return to Israel .
Investigators reportedly want to examine whether Mr Talansky 's donations were properly registered and if he received any favours as a result of the contributions .

What are these ?
The idea that the presidential debates are " high - risk TV " in which the candidates can be questioned " on any subject matter " is laughable ( 90 minutes in TV spotlight that will make or break candidates , September 26 ) .
The debates are profoundly undemocratic .
The " private " corporation that organises them , the Commission on Presidential Debates , was established by the Republican and Democratic national committees in 1986 and serves their interests .
Before the debates take place , the two - party organisations jointly draft debate " contracts " which define exactly what will happen during the " debate " .
This includes screening which topics will be discussed , who can attend the debates , who can ask questions , how long each candidate will have to answer and that there be no candidate - to - candidate questions , no rubuttals and no follow - up questions .
Moreover , the CPD has set criteria that deliberately exclude third - party candidates from taking part .
To join the debate , a third - party candidate must be able to demonstrate that they expect to receive 15 % of the public vote .
This is three times greater than the 5 % political parties must achieve to receive major party status and receive public funds .
The polls used to determine expected support are not required to list candidates other than those from the two main parties .
This stage management does not lead to a debate but a glorified press conference .

War in Georgia
At the beginning of the 20th century , Georgia was the victim of Russian aggression that led to 70 years of Soviet occupation .
In 1991 , Georgia regained its independence ; this was followed by political and economic instability caused by the Russian Federation .
Like other former Soviet Republics , Georgia�s newly declared independence was followed by ethnic and civil strife .
At the beginning of the 1990s , aggressive separatist movements �fueled and supported by the Russian Federation �triggered an armed confrontation in which military forces of the Russian Federation directly participated , together with local criminal groups .
This confrontation resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Georgians , a fact recognized by the United Nations , the Organization for Security and Co-operation ( OSCE ) in Europe , and the European Parliament .
Secessionists took control of parts of South Ossetia and most of Abkhazia prior to cease - fire agreements brokered in 1992 and 1994 , respectively .
Georgia began to stabilize in 1995 .
However , the separatist conflicts in Georgia 's regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain unresolved .
In order to infringe upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and to limit its free and democratic choice , in August 2008 the Russian Federation perpetrated a further military aggression , accompanied by a new wave of ethnic cleansing .
The unlawful actions of the Russian Federation are documented in the Report of the Independent International Fact - Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia , commissioned by the European Union .
The occupation of Georgian territories by the Russian Federation is recognized by a number of governments , as well as by international governmental and non-governmental organizations .
In an attempt to legalize the results of its military aggression , the Russian government , ignoring the principles of international law and the Ceasefire Agreement signed by the Russian Federation and Georgia on August 12 , 2008 , declared the occupied regions to be independent states and deployed new military forces and infrastructure in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region .
In addition , the Russian Federation appealed to other members of the international community to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region , placing political and economic pressure on certain countries to do so .
The military occupation of part of Georgian territory by the Russian Federation breaches the sovereignty of Georgia and is a factor that impedes its statehood and subverts its political , economic , and social development .
The intensive militarization of the occupied regions and the deployment of Russian ground , air , naval , and border forces breaches Georgia�s sovereignty and endangers security in the region as a whole .
Russia�s disrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states �and its attempts to change the European and Euro - Atlantic security architecture and restore principle of �spheres of influence ��endanger not only Georgia , but also all states that are neighbors of the Russian Federation as well as European security in general .
Russia�s military aggression in August 2008 not only aimed at the occupation of Georgian territories and the international recognition of the proxy regimes , but also sought to trigger a change on Georgia�s foreign policy and the violent overthrow of its democratically elected government .
The ruling political elite of the Russian Federation view an independent and democratic Georgia as an important threat .
Therefore , the Russian Federation aims to turn Georgia into a failed state , to hinder the realization of Georgia�s European and Euro - Atlantic choice , and to forcibly return Georgia to the Russian political orbit .
The presence of Russian military forces in the occupied Georgian territories , and the construction and strengthening of military bases there , create a staging - ground for provocations and a bridgehead for a possible renewed military aggression .
The Russian Federation is in breach of the fundamental norms of international law , fails to fulfill the Russian - Georgian Ceasefire Agreement of August 12 , 2008 , and refuses to pledge not to attack Georgia .
It blocks the work of the UN and OSCE missions in Georgia , resists the implementation of the European Union Monitoring Mission�s mandate in the occupied territories , and opposes the idea of creating an international peacekeeping / police mechanism .
Considering all this , there is a risk of renewed Russian aggression .
However , international support for Georgia , as well as the presence of the European Union Monitoring Mission on the ground , are important deterrents to possible aggression .
The EU Monitoring Mission ( EUMM ) was established in 2008 to help stabilise the situation in post - war Georgia and to monitor the compliance with the Six Point Plan of 12 August and the implementation of the Sarkozy - Medvedev agreement of 8 September .
The EUMM�s presence has been critical to preventing renewed conflict .
With the demise of the UNOMIG and OSCE missions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively , the 300 strong EU Monitoring Mission ( EUMM ) is the only remaining international observer mission in Georgia , although it does not have access to the separatist territories .
In September 2008 , the EU established a Special Representative ( EUSR ) for the Crisis in Georgia to ensure coordination and consistency of external EU actions in the region .
The EUSR plays a key role in the Geneva Talks ( which he co-chairs with the UN and OSCE ) , the only forum that brings Georgians , Russians , Abkhaz and South Ossetians together , and which treats Russia as a party to the conflict .
February and April 2010 agreements between Moscow and the de facto Abkhaz and de facto South Ossetian authorities , respectively , establishing Russian military bases in the separatist regions for 49 years , are inconsistent with the terms of the August 12 cease - fire agreement negotiated by French President Sarkozy and signed by Georgian President Saakashvili and Russian President Medvedev .
The cease - fire agreement calls for the parties to : refrain from resorting to the use of force , ensure a definitive halt to hostilities , provide free humanitarian access to the separatist regions , withdraw forces to their pre-conflict positions , and open international discussions on security and stability in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
In accordance with this agreement the EU , UN , and OSCE co-host ongoing Geneva - based talks on security and stability arrangements in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions .
The governments of Georgia , Russia , and the United States send representatives to participate in the talks , and de facto authorities from Abkhazia and South Ossetia also participate , as do representatives of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian governments - in - exile .
The talks have established Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms ( IPRMs ) designed to foster stability on the ground , including on the administrative boundary lines and in the conflict areas .
Other items on the agenda include security , unfettered access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia for international monitors and human rights groups , and the return of internally displaced persons and refugees .
On November 23 , 2010 , in addition to the pledge already made in the August 2008 cease - fire , President Saakashvili pledged a unilateral non-use of force at the EU Parliament .
The de facto authorities in Abkhazia continue to restrict the rights , primarily of ethnic Georgians , to vote , participate in the political process , and exercise basic rights such as property ownership , business registration , and travel .
Ethnic Georgians also have suffered harassment by Abkhaz and Russian forces , forced conscription in the Abkhaz " army , " a lack of funding for basic infrastructure maintenance , and limitations on Georgian - language instruction in the Gali district schools .
The mandate for the OSCE mission to monitor the 1992 cease - fire in South Ossetia and to facilitate negotiations between parties to the conflict expired in 2008 .
The UN Observer Mission in Georgia ( UNOMIG ) established to monitor compliance with the 1994 cease - fire agreement in Abkhazia came to an end in June 2009 .
Neither mandate was extended after Russia blocked consensus among participating member states in the OSCE and vetoed a Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of the UN mission .
The EU maintains a monitoring mission on the undisputed Georgian side of the administrative boundary lines between the separatist regions and undisputed Georgia , but is not allowed inside Abkhazia or South Ossetia by the separatists or occupying Russian forces .
On 21 September 2012 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia stated that " In recent weeks , the armed forces of the Russian Federation have been concentrating manpower and offensive equipment in the areas adjacent to the administrative borders of Georgia 's occupied provinces , which increases the risk of dangerous provocation .
This was confirmed today , as a helicopter of the Russian military made landing at in the area controlled by the central Georgian authorities , in proximity to Tskhinvali region .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs voices stark protest in relation to this incident and calls on the Russian Federation to desist from amassing manpower and military assets in the occupied regions .
As the Ministry has stated earlier , the large - scale military maneuvers of the Russian Armed Forces " Kavkaz - 2012 " have been purposefully rescheduled to coincide with the pre-election period in Georgia .
Our concerns for subsequent risks and provocations have also proven valid . "
The EU Monitoring Mission was intensively engaged in monitoring and assessing these reports with the deployment of extra patrols and checked the situation with the relevant authorities .
The Mission had not observed any evidence to support these claims .
However , EUMM has further increased its patrolling to actively monitor the situation on the ground .
The EUMM at the same time observed a build - up of Russian Federation armed personnel along the South Ossetian Administrative Boundary Line .
The Mission raised its concerns about this activity with the relevant Russian command structures .
The next time you come face to face with a dog wagging its tail , you can make a quick determination on whether to reach out and pet it or step back in deference : check the tail - wag bias .
If the wagging tail leans to the dog ’s right , you ’re safe ; if the tail leans to the dog ’s left , do n’t move .
This tail - wagging bias was documented in a 2007 article in the journal Current Biology by Italian neuroscientist Giorgio Vallortigara and his veterinarian colleagues at the University of Bari .
In an experiment , 30 mixed - breed dogs were each placed in a cage equipped with cameras that measured the asymmetrical bias ( left or right ) of tail wagging while the pooches were exposed to four stimuli : their owner , an unfamiliar human , a cat and an unfamiliar dominant dog .
Owners elicited a strong right bias in tail wagging , and unfamiliar humans and the cat triggered a slight right bias .
But the unfamiliar dominant dog ( a large Belgian Shepherd Malinois ) elicited a strong left bias in tail wagging .
Why ?
According to the researchers , because the left brain controls the right side of the body , and vice versa , the nerve signals cross the midline of the body and cause the dog ’s tail to wag more to the right when its left brain is experiencing a positive emotion .
This left - right distinction may be explained by the fact that birds , fish and frogs show left - brain / right - brain differences in approach - avoidance behavior , with the left brain associated with positive approach feelings and the right brain associated with negative avoidance feelings .
Closer to evolutionary home , when chimpanzees are experiencing negative emotions , they tend to scratch themselves on the left side of their bodies , and left - handed chimps , whose right brain is dominant , tend to be more fearful of novel stimuli than right - handed chimps .
In humans as well , experiments have revealed that the left brain is associated with positive emotions such as love , attachment , bonding and safety .
For example , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) studies of the brains of subjects who report positive emotions or are shown a funny video clip experience an increase in activity in the left frontal cortex , whereas reports of negative emotions and unpleasant video clips coincide with an increase in activity in the right frontal cortex .
In addition , brain scans of subjects who are viewing a photograph of a cute baby show increased activity in the same left frontal cortex area ; subjects looking at a photograph of a grotesquely deformed baby show increased activity in the same right frontal cortex area .
Finally , bombarding the left frontal cortex of the brain with a strong magnetic field elicits a positive mood in human subjects , and the reverse elicits a negative mood .
Why would the brain show such differences in neural networks associated with emotions ?
Employing evolutionary theory , I would like to suggest that emotions interact with our cognitive thought processes to guide our behaviors toward the goal of survival and reproduction .
University of Southern California neuroscientist Antonio R. Damasio , for example , has demonstrated the vital role that emotions play in decision making .
At low levels of stimulation , emotions appear to have an advisory role , interacting with the more reason - oriented cortical regions of the brain .
At medium levels of stimulation , conflicts can arise between these cortical reason centers and the brain ’s deeper and evolutionarily older emotion centers .
At high levels of stimulation , emotions can so overrun cortical cognitive processes that people can no longer reason their way to a decision and report feeling “ out of control . ”
But why should we have evolved emotions at all ?
Emotions are evolutionary proxies for getting us to act in ways that lead to an increase in reproductive success .
If we think of the feeling of hunger as a very basic emotion , for example , a little bit of hunger may be perceived as pleasant , motivating us to seek and find food , whereas too much hunger becomes an unpleasant emotion when it goes unmet .
In this homeostatic model , emotions act as a feedback mechanism to alert the brain when the body is out of balance .
Positive emotions help us build enduring personal resources , such as problem - solving skills , coordination and social resources .
Negative emotions , in contrast , help to protect us .
Fear causes us to pull back and retreat from risks .
Disgust directs us to push out and expel that which is bad for us .
Anger leads us to fight back or to signal displeasure at the violation of a social agreement .
Jealousy leads us to guard our mates against intruders in pair - bonded relationships .
Such studies indicate that often the evolutionary tail wags the emotional dog .
In Will Mainstream Users Ever Learn About The Browser 's Address Bar? , Marshall probes a bit into how people use the browser 's search box vs. the address bar .
A lot of people seem surprised to learn that tons of people every day are " searching " for ebay.com or aol.com or just " ebay " or " aol " even though they can type those things into their address bar and get exactly what they want .
I think part of the problem is the myth perpetuated by the search companies themselves .
They all know that the top search terms every year are not " britney spears " or " ipone " or whatever .
They 're domain names or domain names without the .com on the end of them .
Lots of people search Google every day for " yahoo . "
People search Yahoo for " google . "
And AOL .
And eBay .
And so on .
They all filter out those " navigational " queries when reporting those things .
I 'm not sure who they 're trying to protect by doing so , but I certainly could speculate .
Everyone in the search business seems to mostly get this .
The folks at those big destinations ( like eBay ) know this too .
They have logs .
But the rest of the techie population on - line seems to believe that normal people use the web the same we do .
They do n't .
And they never will .
Get it through your collective heads , please .
People do n't get DNS , domain names , or the difference between searching and direct navigation .
And since they all know what it means " to google " that 's exactly what they do .
You can either accept that or deny the truth .
That 's why you 're seeing numbers like this every quarter .
This ends today 's reality check .
Please go back to trying to change the world by explaining what the address bar is for . :-)
Oh , here 's a bonus tip : normal people can't tell the difference between AdSense style ads and all the other links on most web sites .
And almost the same number do n't know what " sponsored results " on the Search Results Page are either .
It 's just a page of links to them .
They click the ones that look like they 'll get them what they want .
It 's that simple .

Toggle Desktop Effects with Compiz - Switch January 07 , 2008
[ update ]
You may also be interested in Fusion - icon , which is what I ’ve been using lately .
Often you need to turn off Compiz desktop effects to play a game , run an incompatible application , or even to watch video on some Intel chipsets .
Previously I used the fusion - icon tray icon , which was not updated for newer versions of Ubuntu and Compiz .
Until today I used the Visual Effects tab of the Appearance Preferences dialog in Ubuntu 7.10 to start and stop Compiz .
Now there ’s a simpler solution .
Compiz - Switch does one of two things when it is run :
When Compiz is running , it switches to Metacity ( GNOME ) , Kwin ( KDE ) , or Xfwm ( Xfce ) .
When Compiz is not running , it turns it on .
Update : packages for Ubuntu are now available for download .
There ’s no need to compile it yourself anymore .
There is no package available for Compiz - Switch currently , but it ’s easy to create your own using checkinstall .
( Packages created with checkinstall should not be distributed . )
Open a terminal and run these commands :
Download the source and decompress it : wget http://blogage.de/files/1382/download?compiz-switch-0.2.0~source.tar.gz
- O- | tar - xzf - Change to the new folder : cd compiz - switch - 0.2.0~source
If you have not installed checkinstall , you need to do so now : sudo apt - get install checkinstall Run checkinstall to create and install the package : sudo checkinstall
You can remove the folder that was downloaded once the installation is complete .
Compiz - Switch can be uninstalled using the Synaptic package manager .

Fans have financed recent albums by paying up before studio sessions began Rock group Marillion are to make their new album available as a free download through file - sharing websites .
But a pop-up box will appear on computer screens when the tracks are first played , encouraging fans to give the band their e-mail address .
Keyboardist Mark Kelly said downloaders would be contacted with offers of gig tickets and other merchandise , to try to make some money back for the band .
" We 're willing to try new things and we want to see what happens , " he said .
" Everybody 's aware of the effect of peer - to - peer file - sharing on CD sales and the music industry in general , " he told the BBC News website .
" Up until recently we 've felt fairly immune to that because the fans have been really supportive of the band and , I suppose , because of the age demographic , they do tend to prefer CDs to downloads . "
People forget Radiohead were still number one in the album charts
Mark Kelly
Marillion keyboardist
Bands have been exploring new ways to release music in recent months , with Radiohead making their last album available online on a pay - what - you - like basis and Prince giving his most recent CD away with a newspaper .
Kelly acknowledged that making Marillion 's music available for free was against his natural instinct - " we come from a long tradition of selling it " .
But he still expected fans would buy the CD version of Happiness is the Road when it is released on 20 October .
" People forget Radiohead were still number one in the album charts , " he added .
" They also say they were n't very successful because they only got an average of £ 2 per download .
" But they would n't have got £ 2 per sale from [ record company ] EMI , so in those terms it was actually a big success , and they still sold CDs . "
' Loyal fanbase ' Paul Williams , who edits record industry publication Music Week , said Marillion had always been " pretty ground - breaking in terms of doing things differently and they have a very loyal fanbase " .
Taking that into consideration , he said , the download plan would " probably work for them quite successfully " .
Marillion have bypassed record companies in the past by asking fans to pay for albums before recording began , thereby securing funds for studio time .
" Most acts these days certainly do n't make their fortunes based on the traditional way of selling recorded music , " Mr Williams noted .
Matt Phillips , director of communications for the British Phonographic Industry , said : " There 's nothing unlawful about peer - to - peer technology per se , and it can be a powerful distribution platform for artists and labels .
" The issue arises when that technology is used unlawfully to avoid paying for the music you download - as it is in 99.9 % of cases .
" Ultimately it 's emerging acts that suffer most from illegal file - sharing since they do n't have a large fanbase or touring income to rely on , and they need the investment of music companies at the beginning of their careers .
" It may be the case that artists and labels are happy to give some music away for free from time to time , but like anyone else , creative people have the right to be paid for their work . "

Reading Serialized PHP Objects from Erlang
I started writing some Erlang recently .
The vast majority of data I need to access from Erlang resides in cached , serialized php objects .
Here 's what I came up with to turn a serialized php object into a sort of nested Erlang proplist thing .
<? php $s = array ( 123 , ' hello ' , 3.14 , array ( ' a ' => ' foo ' , ' b ' => ' bar ' ) ) ; print serialize ( $s ) ; ?>
This gives ( wrapped for clarity ) :
a:4:{i:0;i:123;i:1;s:5:" hello " ;i:2;d:3.14 ; i:3 ; a:2 : { s :1 : " a " ; s:3 : " foo " ; s:1 : " b " ; s:3 : " bar " ;}}
It 's not hard to see how the ( relatively undocumented ) PHP serialization format works .
Here 's what it becomes in Erlang :
php : unserialize ( " a:4:...snip ... " ) .
{ [ [ {0,123} , { 1 , < < " hello " > >} , { 2,3.14} , { 3 , [ {a , << " foo " > >} , { b , << " bar " >>}]} ] ] , [ ]}
Here 's what it does with objects :
<? php class ExampleClass { var $ id = 123 ; var $ name = " RJ " ; var $ languages = array ( ' php ' , ' erlang ' , ' etc ' ) ; } $s = new ExampleClass ( ) ; $ ser = serialize ( $s ) ; print serialize ( $ str ) ; ?>
php : unserialize ( " O:12 : \ " ExampleClass \ " :3:{s:2 : \ " id \ " ; i:123 ;s:4 : \ " name \ " ; s:2 : " " \ " RJ \ " ; s:9 : \ " languages \ " ; a:3:{i:0 ; s:3 : \ " php \ " ; i:1;s:6 : " " \ " erlang \ " ; i:2;s:3 : \ " etc \ " ; }} " ) . {[{ class , " ExampleClass " , [{ id , 123 } , { name , << " RJ " >> } , { languages , [{ 0 , << " php " >> } , { 1 , << " erlang " >> } , { 2 , << " etc " >> } ] }]} ] , [ ]}
Due to a combination of PHP's " relaxed " type system , an old database abstraction library , and munging things in and out of memcached , we sometimes end up with numeric properties , such as ' id ' , represented as strings by PHP .
To mitigate this , I ended up with some nasty code that forces certain properties to a predefined type ( " id " is always an int , etc . . ) .
Yuk .
Anyway , here 's the Erlang module :
Every act of civil disobedience is , by its very nature , a provocation .
The trick is to distinguish between those acts that genuinely express the unjustly ignored conscience of the provocateur and those that merely are provocative .
On Sunday , 33 evangelical Protestant pastors in 22 states will demand that the rest of us do precisely that , when they participate in a “ pulpit initiative ” conceived by an Arizona - based Christian legal organization -- the Alliance Defense Fund -- which hopes to overturn the Internal Revenue Code ’s 54 - year - old ban on political endorsements by tax - exempt organizations , including churches .
The lawyers and the pastors they ’ve recruited argue that the ban -- originally sponsored by then - Texas Sen.
Lyndon Johnson in 1954 -- violates the clergy ’s 1st Amendment rights to both free speech and free exercise of religion .
The pastors plan to endorse John McCain -- there ’s a surprise -- in hopes the IRS will come after their congregations ’ tax exemptions .
Alliance then intends to fight their cases all the way to the Supreme Court , whose conservative justices it hopes will hold the ban on endorsements unconstitutional .
Let ’s imagine that the Alliance Defense Fund and its clerical clients were to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn the Johnson amendment ’s ban on political endorsements from the pulpit .
At that point , what would prevent wealthy ideologues from making tax - exempt contributions to sympathetic pastors ’ churches for the express purpose of engaging in partisan electioneering ?
For that matter , what would prevent ambitious pastors from soliciting just such contributions and then using them to bind like - minded ministers into powerful political machines ?

Separation of church and state , as we know it , would be in shreds -- and the process would n’t stop there .
It ’s unreasonable to assume that the courts would long let stand a preference for political speech by churches over that of other nonprofit charities and schools .
In fact , if the Johnson amendment ’s prohibition were struck down for churches , it ’s a safe bet that every other sort of nonprofit would come roaring into court demanding equal treatment .
Just imagine for a second this sequence of events :
We ’re a few decades down the road and the trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- their original endowment supplemented by Warren Buffet ’s considerable fortune -- decide that whatever cause to which they ’re then devoted requires the endorsement of a particular candidate .
Presumably , they ’d be free to spend every cent at their disposal to publicize that endorsement in the most attractive possible way .
So much for the integrity of our democratic elections -- unless we recognize that the tax code , like the Constitution itself , is not a suicide pact .

Participants in the pulpit initiative also are wrong on their history .
From the founding it has been clear that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson , the architects of our notions of religious liberty , intended to prohibit the state from dictating the content of religious convictions .
Thus this preamble to the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom , which Jefferson drafted in 1777 : “ Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free ; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens , or by civil incapacitations , tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness ... that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money [ through taxation ] for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves , is sinful and tyrannical ; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion , is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern , and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness ... ”
That sounds a lot like the spirit of the current tax code , which makes funds available from our collective purse for pursuit of the common good , though not political advantage .
Jefferson confirmed that distinction in an exchange of letters with Sister Marie Therese Farjon , mother superior of the Ursuline convent of St. Xavier in New Orleans in March 1804 , shortly after the Louisiana Purchase .
The nuns , who operated an orphanage and school for foundlings , were concerned that the United States , whose jurisdiction they were now under , might not recognize France ’s gifts of property to support their work .
Jefferson replied with a statement of the government ’s support for the church ’s charitable role .
“ Whatever diversity ... may appear in the religious opinions of our fellow citizens , the charitable object of your institution cannot be indifferent to any ... [ and ] cannot fail to ensure it the patronage of the government it is under . ”
They were a shrewd , as well as eloquent , bunch , the founders ; we ignore them at our peril .

Requests for mercy had to be granted
Knights of old were either virtuous and honest men who lived according to a code of chivalry , or a bunch of marauding looters who were lucky to get a good write up in the history books .
Whatever the reality , are there some values associated with chivalry which could be applied today ?
We canvassed opinion among medieval experts .
1. Generosity was important .
Even though knights were of a certain status in society , with servants and followers , they were expected to be generous in handing out rewards .
For example , in battle a knight may take quite a lot of booty but would be expected to distribute that to followers in recognition of their service to him .
Lesson for children today - Share .
2. Mercy is one of the key concepts of chivalry .
Fighting with another knight , if one offers defeat then the other should exercise mercy and be gracious in victory .
The whole concept of ransoming was based on this .
A knight would honour and respect a fellow knight when fighting him or when holding him captive .
Lesson for today -
If you get in a tussle and win , go easy on the other kid .
3. Loyalty to the king or the nobles was absolutely crucial .
That would mean abiding by the rules and recognising that there 's a superior authority and in order to be chivalrous you have to be loyal to the person above you .
Lesson for today - Respect your elders .
4. Exercise power responsibly .
They did n't get rid of violence but they tried to limit it to justified causes .
Lesson for children today - Just because you 're the biggest in the class , do n't throw your weight around .
5 . Protect the weak .
There 's also a sense that the strong should protect the weak who are unable to look after themselves .
Lesson for today - Stand up to bullies and gangs who pick on other children .
The chief benefit of Knight School is the remarkable improvement in behaviour
Lincolnshire police spokesman
Knight School for children
Less for today - Fight for what 's right .
7. Humility .
Value first the contributions of others ; do not boast of your own accomplishments , let others do this for you .
Tell the deeds of others before your own , according them the renown rightfully earned through virtuous deeds .
Lesson for today - Give credit to your pals .
And a few lessons not to learn ...
8. Crusading , which is about fighting for the faith and against those who believe in Islam .
Lesson for today - Respect other religions .
9 . Wielding a very sharp implement .
Lesson for today : Do n't carry knives .
10 .
Courtly love , between champions and ladies , which is rather inapplicable to the modern world .
Lesson for today - Do n't think the girls will be impressed .

Paul Graham thinks that startup founders need to sell their companies to get freedom and security :
They want enough money that ( a ) they do n’t have to worry about running out of money and ( b ) they can spend their time how they want .
Running your own business offers neither .
You certainly do n’t have freedom : no boss is so demanding .
Nor do you have security , because if you stop paying attention to the company , its revenues go away , and with them your income .
I think he ’s wrong in general and I know he ’s wrong for me personally .
Fallacy # 1 : Owning a profitable company is like earning a salary
Getting your company to the point where you can pay yourself a decent salary is a great milestone .
You created something sustainable that does n’t rely on spending other people ’s money .
You deserve to pop a bottle and celebrate !
You certainly should n’t curb your ambitions because of that , though .
The real economic pay - off for taking the risk of starting a business is what comes after this .
That the company starts making enough money that you can take some and put away .
After a while , that coveted financial independence you thought would make your life perfect should be achieved ( and you ’ll realize that it did n’t make it perfect ) .
But I can see how this line of thought would arise .
If you ’re building to flip , then profits are n’t really that interesting .
If you can just get to break - even , you ’re probably doing better than the majority of other companies in your made - to - flip space .
So instead you focus on getting more eyeballs , more sign ups , or more of whatever you think an acquirer would place the highest premium on .
I would want to sell a company built like this too .
But there are other ways to build companies .
Lots of self - made millionaires made their money selling products for a profit .
So let ’s strike out the security claim .
Most successful business owners could walk away from their business tomorrow and still live very comfortable lives off the money they put away .
Fallacy # 2 : There ’s always something you ’d much rather do
You do n’t have to work 60 , 80 , or 100 hours per week just because you run your own business .
Many business owners do that , but if they ’re successful , it ’s usually because there ’s nothing they ’d rather be doing .
Look at the top tech CEOs .
None of them need to work , many of them are billionaires , but still Steve Jobs , Jeff Bezos , and others continue to helm their companies for decades because they love what they ’re doing .
I do n’t personally like to work 60 or more hours per week .
Even 40 hours is pushing it .
At 37 signals , we all try to work just four days a week .
That ’s a perk in addition to the fact that we do n’t count vacation days ( I probably spent 4 weeks last year ) and many of us often attend conferences and other out - of - the - daily - rhythm activities .
But when I actually do sit down to work , it ’s very often that there ’s nothing else I ’d rather do .
And I do n’t think that ’s really an uncommon phenomenon .
I think lots of people really like what they do and for bursts of the time consider it the most interesting thing they could be working on .
If you ’re building a company to flip , though , and feel like you have to put in endless hours to please investors and potential acquirers , I can certainly appreciate that there ’ll often be something you ’d much rather do .
And that it can feel like you ’re trapped trying to chase a prize that keeps moving .
I do n’t personally think that ’s a rewarding way to live , but to each his own .
For me , the secret has been to do many other things besides work on 37signals .
I enjoy working on Ruby on Rails and pursue a lot of hobbies .
When you work less than 40 hours per week on something you actually like doing , it does n’t feel very much like work at all .
It feels like I ’ve already retired and get to do a little of many things that I like so none of them really gets boring .
There ’s what I perceive to be healthy balance instead of a constant sprint .
This comes back to the earlier topic of early retirement as a false idol .
I ’ve talked to many entrepeneurs who ’ve thought that they could just sit back and live the sweet life of no work after selling out .
Most of them were right back working another idea after six months .
Often times , the second idea was n’t as good as the first one .
Bottom line is that you really should try to find something to work on that at least for substantial amounts of time constitutes that “ nothing I ’d rather do ” feeling .
I think it ’s hard to be truly happy if the only reason you work is to win a paycheck .
Whether it ’s as an employee or a business owner .
Government officials of this small , war - weary country invited a group of journalists for a 180 - mile trip aboard a Russian - made Mi-8 helicopter Monday to Georgia ’s western provinces to show the damage wrought by the recent Russian military incursion .
Instead , the 19 international journalists on a daylong tour found just a few signs of Russian destruction , not very evident amid the sleepy resort towns of the Black Sea coast and the lush inland valleys .
Just as Russians are suspected of having exaggerated the number of casualties and damage in the initial Georgian offensive that sparked the war in Georgia ’s breakaway region of South Ossetia , Georgians appear to have stretched the facts on the extent of destruction caused by the subsequent Russian attack , at least here in the country ’s west .
“ This conflict is very much about proving who is the bad guy , ” said a Western diplomat in Tbilisi , the Georgian capital , speaking on condition of anonymity .

Russians have damaged western bases of the Georgian army , which they accuse of launching the Aug. 7 assault on civilians in South Ossetia , about 125 miles east of here .
The Russians blew up about a dozen boats at the naval base here in the Black Sea port of Poti .
The mangled Georgian coast guard ships lay half sunk in the water , victims of bombs set by Russian soldiers , witnesses said .
The base itself was looted and several military personnel were killed in an airstrike on the facility , an official said .
The sunken ships have clogged the berths , in effect shutting the base .
Leaking boat fuel has fouled nearby waters .
The civilian section of the port was largely untouched , aside from minor damage to facilities and windows apparently broken by blast reverberations .
Advertisement
At least in western Georgia , the Russians appear to have used force minimally .
Communications function , and electricity is uninterrupted .
Civilian fatalities in Georgia proper have climbed at least into the double digits , but the Russians appear to have avoided any inadvertent high - profile attacks on civilian targets .
The Georgian Health Ministry reported two days ago that 67 civilians had been killed and about 157 hurt in the conflict .
The Russians appear to have carefully calibrated their intervention to cause minimum damage while exerting maximum political pressure .
In the city of Zugdidi , Russian soldiers have occupied a villa that locals said belonged to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , the flashy and outspoken 40 - year - old the Kremlin has demanded step aside .
The shirtless soldiers inside the villa could be seen hurrying off a deck where they were apparently sunbathing after the gaggle of journalists began taking photographs .
Advertisement
Zugdidi lies near Georgia ’s border with Abkhazia , another pro-Russian breakaway province .
Early in the conflict , Georgian officials in Tbilisi warned of an impending disaster as Russian tanks from Abkhazia massed at Zugdidi ’s edge .
But residents said there had been little or no damage to their town , though they were nervous about the increased presence of Russian troops .
“ We ’re afraid because of the situation , because of the Russians , ” said Irakli Gulava , a student in his 20s strolling through a park in downtown Zugdidi .
“ But the Russian soldiers were afraid also of meeting with the Georgians .
Eventually , they were asking the people to give them food , drinks and water . ”
Despite claims that Russia is destroying Georgia ’s civilian infrastructure , much of it remains intact in the country ’s west .
Residents said shops were full .
In the resort city of Batumi , residents could be seen swimming off the pebbly beaches of the Black Sea .
Advertisement
Residents said they worried that the effects would show up in coming years , as tourists shied away from what was becoming a thriving travel destination for Europeans .
“ We have food and water , ” scoffed Mazia Jwania , a 50 - year - old housewife walking with friends along a street in downtown Poti .
“ But in the last couple of years , life here was getting so much better .
Now it ’s going to go backward . ”

A PROPOSAL FOR THE DARTMOUTH SUMMER RESEARCH PROJECT ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
J. McCarthy , Dartmouth College
M. L. Minsky , Harvard University
N. Rochester , I.B.M. Corporation
C.E. Shannon , Bell Telephone Laboratories
August 31 , 1955
We propose that a 2 month , 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire .
The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it .
An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language , form abstractions and concepts , solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans , and improve themselves .
We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer .
The following are some aspects of the artificial intelligence problem :
1 Automatic Computers
If a machine can do a job , then an automatic calculator can be programmed to simulate the machine .
The speeds and memory capacities of present computers may be insufficient to simulate many of the higher functions of the human brain , but the major obstacle is not lack of machine capacity , but our inability to write programs taking full advantage of what we have .
2. How Can a Computer be Programmed to Use a Language
It may be speculated that a large part of human thought consists of manipulating words according to rules of reasoning and rules of conjecture .
From this point of view , forming a generalization consists of admitting a new word and some rules whereby sentences containing it imply and are implied by others .
This idea has never been very precisely formulated nor have examples been worked out .
3. Neuron Nets
How can a set of ( hypothetical ) neurons be arranged so as to form concepts .
Considerable theoretical and experimental work has been done on this problem by Uttley , Rashevsky and his group , Farley and Clark , Pitts and McCulloch , Minsky , Rochester and Holland , and others .
Partial results have been obtained but the problem needs more theoretical work .
4 . Theory of the Size of a Calculation
If we are given a well - defined problem ( one for which it is possible to test mechanically whether or not a proposed answer is a valid answer ) one way of solving it is to try all possible answers in order .
This method is inefficient , and to exclude it one must have some criterion for efficiency of calculation .
Some consideration will show that to get a measure of the efficiency of a calculation it is necessary to have on hand a method of measuring the complexity of calculating devices which in turn can be done if one has a theory of the complexity of functions .
Some partial results on this problem have been obtained by Shannon , and also by McCarthy .
5. Self - lmprovement
Probably a truly intelligent machine will carry out activities which may best be described as self - improvement .
Some schemes for doing this have been proposed and are worth further study .
It seems likely that this question can be studied abstractly as well .
6. Abstractions
A number of types of ``abstraction '' can be distinctly defined and several others less distinctly .
A direct attempt to classify these and to describe machine methods of forming abstractions from sensory and other data would seem worthwhile .
7. Randomness and Creativity
A fairly attractive and yet clearly incomplete conjecture is that the difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of a some randomness .
The randomness must be guided by intuition to be efficient .
In other words , the educated guess or the hunch include controlled randomness in otherwise orderly thinking .
In addition to the above collectively formulated problems for study , we have asked the individuals taking part to describe what they will work on .
Statements by the four originators of the project are attached .
We propose to organize the work of the group as follows .
Potential participants will be sent copies of this proposal and asked if they would like to work on the artificial intelligence problem in the group and if so what they would like to work on .
The invitations will be made by the organizing committee on the basis of its estimate of the individual 's potential contribution to the work of the group .
The members will circulate their previous work and their ideas for the problems to be attacked during the months preceding the working period of the group .
During the meeting there will be regular research seminars and opportunity for the members to work individually and in informal small groups .
The originators of this proposal are :
1. C. E. Shannon , Mathematician , Bell Telephone Laboratories .
Shannon developed the statistical theory of information , the application of propositional calculus to switching circuits , and has results on the efficient synthesis of switching circuits , the design of machines that learn , cryptography , and the theory of Turing machines .
He and J. McCarthy are co-editing an Annals of Mathematics Study on ``The Theory of Automata ' ' .
2. M. L. Minsky , Harvard Junior Fellow in Mathematics and Neurology .
Minsky has built a machine for simulating learning by nerve nets and has written a Princeton PhD thesis in mathematics entitled , ``Neural Nets and the Brain Model Problem ' ' which includes results in learning theory and the theory of random neural nets .
3. N. Rochester , Manager of Information Research , IBM Corporation , Poughkeepsie , New York .
Rochester was concerned with the development of radar for seven years and computing machinery for seven years .
He and another engineer were jointly responsible for the design of the IBM Type 701 which is a large scale automatic computer in wide use today .
He worked out some of the automatic programming techniques which are in wide use today and has been concerned with problems of how to get machines to do tasks which previously could be done only by people .
He has also worked on simulation of nerve nets with particular emphasis on using computers to test theories in neurophysiology .
4. J. McCarthy , Assistant Professor of Mathematics , Dartmouth College .
McCarthy has worked on a number of questions connected with the mathematical nature of the thought process including the theory of Turing machines , the speed of computers , the relation of a brain model to its environment , and the use of languages by machines .
Some results of this work are included in the forthcoming ``Annals Study '' edited by Shannon and McCarthy .
McCarthy 's other work has been in the field of differential equations .
The Rockefeller Foundation is being asked to provide financial support for the project on the following basis :
1. Salaries of $ 1200 for each faculty level participant who is not being supported by his own organization .
It is expected , for example , that the participants from Bell Laboratories and IBM Corporation will be supported by these organizations while those from Dartmouth and Harvard will require foundation support .
2. Salaries of $ 700 for up to two graduate students .
3. Railway fare for participants coming from a distance .
4 . Rent for people who are simultaneously renting elsewhere .
5. Secretarial expenses of $ 650 , $ 500 for a secretary and $ 150 for duplicating expenses .
6. Organization expenses of $ 200 .
( Includes expense of reproducing preliminary work by participants and travel necessary for organization purposes .
7. Expenses for two or three people visiting for a short time .
#& # Estimated Expenses 6 salaries of 1200 & $ 7200 2 salaries of 700 & 1400 8 traveling and rent expenses averaging 300 & 2400 Secretarial and organizational expense & 850 Additional traveling expenses & 600 Contingencies & 550 &---- & $ 13,500
I would like to devote my research to one or both of the topics listed below .
While I hope to do so , it is possible that because of personal considerations I may not be able to attend for the entire two months .
I , nevertheless , intend to be there for whatever time is possible .
1. Application of information theory concepts to computing machines and brain models .
A basic problem in information theory is that of transmitting information reliably over a noisy channel .
An analogous problem in computing machines is that of reliable computing using unreliable elements .
This problem has been studies by von Neumann for Sheffer stroke elements and by Shannon and Moore for relays ; but there are still many open questions .
The problem for several elements , the development of concepts similar to channel capacity , the sharper analysis of upper and lower bounds on the required redundancy , etc. are among the important issues .
Another question deals with the theory of information networks where information flows in many closed loops ( as contrasted with the simple one - way channel usually considered in communication theory ) .
Questions of delay become very important in the closed loop case , and a whole new approach seems necessary .
This would probably involve concepts such as partial entropies when a part of the past history of a message ensemble is known .
2 . The matched environment - brain model approach to automata .
In general a machine or animal can only adapt to or operate in a limited class of environments .
Even the complex human brain first adapts to the simpler aspects of its environment , and gradually builds up to the more complex features .
I propose to study the synthesis of brain models by the parallel development of a series of matched ( theoretical ) environments and corresponding brain models which adapt to them .
The emphasis here is on clarifying the environmental model , and representing it as a mathematical structure .
Often in discussing mechanized intelligence , we think of machines performing the most advanced human thought activities - proving theorems , writing music , or playing chess .
I am proposing here to start at the simple and when the environment is neither hostile ( merely indifferent ) nor complex , and to work up through a series of easy stages in the direction of these advanced activities .
It is not difficult to design a machine which exhibits the following type of learning .
The machine is provided with input and output channels and an internal means of providing varied output responses to inputs in such a way that the machine may be ``trained '' by a ``trial and error '' process to acquire one of a range of input - output functions .
Such a machine , when placed in an appropriate environment and given a criterior of ``success '' or ``failure '' can be trained to exhibit ``goal - seeking '' behavior .
Unless the machine is provided with , or is able to develop , a way of abstracting sensory material , it can progress through a complicated environment only through painfully slow steps , and in general will not reach a high level of behavior .
Now let the criterion of success be not merely the appearance of a desired activity pattern at the output channel of the machine , but rather the performance of a given manipulation in a given environment .
Then in certain ways the motor situation appears to be a dual of the sensory situation , and progress can be reasonably fast only if the machine is equally capable of assembling an ensemble of ``motor abstractions '' relating its output activity to changes in the environment .
Such ``motor abstractions '' can be valuable only if they relate to changes in the environment which can be detected by the machine as changes in the sensory situation , i.e. , if they are related , through the structure of the environrnent , to the sensory abstractions that the machine is using .
I have been studying such systems for some time and feel that if a machine can be designed in which the sensory and motor abstractions , as they are formed , can be made to satisfy certain relations , a high order of behavior may result .
These relations involve pairing , motor abstractions with sensory abstractions in such a way as to produce new sensory situations representing the changes in the environment that might be expected if the corresponding motor act actually took place .
The important result that would be looked for would be that the machine would tend to build up within itself an abstract model of the environment in which it is placed .
If it were given a problem , it could first explore solutions within the internal abstract model of the environment and then attempt external experiments .
Because of this preliminary internal study , these external experiments would appear to be rather clever , and the behavior would have to be regarded as rather ``imaginative ' '
A very tentative proposal of how this might be done is described in my dissertation and I intend to do further work in this direction .
I hope that by summer 1956 I wi11 have a model of such a machine fairly close to the stage of programming in a computer .
Originality in Machine Performance
In writing a program for an automatic calculator , one ordinarily provides the machine with a set of rules to cover each contingency which may arise and confront the machine .
One expects the machine to follow this set of rules slavishly and to exhibit no originality or common sense .
Furthermore one is annoyed only at himself when the machine gets confused because the rules he has provided for the machine are slightly contradictory .
Finally , in writing programs for machines , one sometimes must go at problems in a very laborious manner whereas , if the machine had just a little intuition or could make reasonable guesses , the solution of the problem could be quite direct .
This paper describes a conjecture as to how to make a machine behave in a somewhat more sophisticated manner in the general area suggested above .
The paper discusses a problem on which I have been working sporadically for about five years and which I wish to pursue further in the Artificial Intelligence Project next summer .
The Process of Invention or Discovery
Living in the environment of our culture provides us with procedures for solving many problems .
Just how these procedures work is not yet clear but I shall discuss this aspect of the problem in terms of a model suggested by Craik .
He suggests that mental action consists basically of constructing little engines inside the brain which can simulate and thus predict abstractions relating to environment .
Thus the solution of a problem which one already understands is done as follows :
The environment provides data from which certain abstractions are formed .
The abstractions together with certain internal habits or drives provide : A definition of a problem in terms of desired condition to be achieved in the future , a goal .
A suggested action to solve the problem .
Stimulation to arouse in the brain the engine which corresponds to this situation .
Then the engine operates to predict what this environmental situation and the proposed reaction will lead to .
If the prediction corresponds to the goal the individual proceeds to act as indicated .
The prediction will correspond to the goal if living in the environment of his culture has provided the individual with the solution to the problem .
Regarding the individual as a stored program calculator , the program contains rules to cover this particular contingency .
For a more complex situation the rules might be more complicated .
The rules might call for testing each of a set of possible actions to determine which provided the solution .
A still more complex set of rules might provide for uncertainty about the environment , as for example in playing tic tac toe one must not only consider his next move but the various possible moves of the environment ( his opponent ) .
Now consider a problem for which no individual in the culture has a solution and which has resisted efforts at solution .
This might be a typical current unsolved scientific problem .
The individual might try to solve it and find that every reasonable action led to failure .
In other words the stored program contains rules for the solution of this problem but the rules are slightly wrong .
In order to solve this problem the individual will have to do something which is unreasonable or unexpected as judged by the heritage of wisdom accumulated by the culture .
He could get such behavior by trying different things at random but such an approach would usually be too inefficient .
There are usually too many possible courses of action of which only a tiny fraction are acceptable .
The individual needs a hunch , something unexpected but not altogether reasonable .
Some problems , often those which are fairly new and have not resisted much effort , need just a little randomness .
Others , often those which have long resisted solution , need a really bizarre deviation from traditional methods .
A problem whose solution requires originality could yield to a method of solution which involved randomness .
In terms of Craik 's S model , the engine which should simulate the environment at first fails to simulate correctly .
Therefore , it is necessary to try various modifications of the engine until one is found that makes it do what is needed .
Instead of describing the problem in terms of an individual in his culture it could have been described in terms of the learning of an immature individual .
When the individual is presented with a problem outside the scope of his experience he must surmount it in a similar manner .
So far the nearest practical approach using this method in machine solution of problems is an extension of the Monte Carlo method .
In the usual problem which is appropriate for Monte Carlo there is a situation which is grossly misunderstood and which has too many possible factors and one is unable to decide which factors to ignore in working out analytical solution .
So the mathematician has the machine making a few thousand random experiments .
The results of these experiments provide a rough guess as to what the answer may be .
The extension of the Monte Carlo Method is to use these results as a guide to determine what to neglect in order to simplify the problem enough to obtain an approximate analytical solution .
It might be asked why the method should include randomness .
Why should n't the method be to try each possibility in the order of the probability that the present state of knowledge would predict for its success ?
For the scientist surrounded by the environment provided by his culture , it may be that one scientist alone would be unlikely to solve the problem in his life so the efforts of many are needed .
If they use randomness they could all work at once on it without complete duplication of effort .
If they used system they would require impossibly detailed communication .
For the individual maturing in competition with other individuals the requirements of mixed strategy ( using game theory terminology ) favor randomness .
For the machine , randomness will probably be needed to overcome the shortsightedness and prejudices of the programmer .
While the necessity for randomness has clearly not been proven , there is much evidence in its favor .
The Machine With Randomness
In order to write a program to make an automatic calculator use originality it will not do to introduce randomness without using forsight .
If , for example , one wrote a program so that once in every 10,000 steps the calculator generated a random number and executed it as an instruction the result would probably be chaos .
Then after a certain amount of chaos the machine would probably try something forbidden or execute a stop instruction and the experiment would be over .
Two approaches , however , appear to be reasonable .
One of these is to find how the brain manages to do this sort of thing and copy it .
The other is to take some class of real problems which require originality in their solution and attempt to find a way to write a program to solve them on an automatic calculator .
Either of these approaches would probably eventually succeed .
However , it is not clear which would be quicker nor how many years or generations it would take .
Most of my effort along these lines has so far been on the former approach because I felt that it would be best to master all relevant scientific knowledge in order to work on such a hard problem , and I already was quite aware of the current state of calculators and the art of programming them .
The control mechanism of the brain is clearly very different from the control mechanism in today 's calculators .
One symptom of the difference is the manner of failure .
A failure of a calculator characteristically produces something quite unreasonable .
An error in memory or in data transmission is as likely to be in the most significant digit as in the least .
An error in control can do nearly anything .
It might execute the wrong instruction or operate a wrong input - output unit .
On the other hand human errors in speech are apt to result in statements which almost make sense ( consider someone who is almost asleep , slightly drunk , or slightly feverish ) .
Perhaps the mechanism of the brain is such that a slight error in reasoning introduces randomness in just the right way .
Perhaps the mechanism that controls serial order in behavior guides the random factor so as to improve the efficiency of imaginative processes over pure randomness .
Some work has been done on simulating neuron nets on our automatic calculator .
One purpose was to see if it would be thereby possible to introduce randomness in an appropriate fashion .
It seems to have turned out that there are too many unknown links between the activity of neurons and problem solving for this approach to work quite yet .
The results have cast some light on the behavior of nets and neurons , but have not yielded a way to solve problems requiring originality .
An important aspect of this work has been an effort to make the machine form and manipulate concepts , abstractions , generalizations , and names .
An attempt was made to test a theory of how the brain does it .
The first set of experiments occasioned a revision of certain details of the theory .
The second set of experiments is now in progress .
By next summer this work will be finished and a final report will have been written .
My program is to try next to write a program to solve problems which are members of some limited class of problems that require originality in their solution .
It is too early to predict just what stage I will be in next summer , or just ; how I will then define the immediate problem .
However , the underlying problem which is described in this paper is what I intend to pursue .
In a single sentence the problem is : how can I make a machine which will exhibit originality in its solution of problems ?

During next year and during the Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence , I propose to study the relation of language to intelligence .
It seems clear that the direct application of trial and error methods to the relation between sensory data and motor activity will not lead to any very complicated behavior .
Rather it is necessary for the trial and error methods to be applied at a higher level of abstraction .
The human mind apparently uses language as its means of handling complicated phenomena .
The trial and error processes at a higher level frequently take the form of formulating conjectures and testing them .
The English language has a number of properties which every formal language described so far lacks .
1. Arguments in English supplemented by informal mathematics can be concise .
2. English is universal in the sense that it can set up any other language within English and then use that language where it is appropriate .
3 . The user of English can refer to himself in it and formulate statements regarding his progress in solving the problem he is working on .
4 . In addition to rules of proof , English if completely formulated would have rules of conjecture .
The logical languages so far formulated have either been instruction lists to make computers carry out calculations specified in advance or else formalization of parts of mathematics .
The latter have been constructed so as :
1. to be easily described in informal mathematics ,
2. to allow translation of statements from informal mathematics into the language ,
3. to make it easy to argue about whether proofs of ( ???)
No attempt has been made to make proofs in artificial languages as short as informal proofs .
It therefore seems to be desirable to attempt to construct an artificial language which a computer can be programmed to use on problems requiring conjecture and self - reference .
It should correspond to English in the sense that short English statements about the given subject matter should have short correspondents in the language and so should short arguments or conjectural arguments .
I hope to try to formulate a language having these properties and in addition to contain the notions of physical object , event , etc. , with the hope that using this language it will be possible to program a machine to learn to play games well and do other tasks .
The purpose of the list is to let those on it know who is interested in receiving documents on the problem .
The people on the 1ist wlll receive copies of the report of the Dartmouth Summer Project on Artificial Intelligence .

There was no report . ]
The list consists of people who particlpated in or visited the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificlal Intelligence , or who are known to be interested in the subject .
It is being sent to the people on the 1ist and to a few others .
For the present purpose the artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving .
A revised list will be issued soon , so that anyone else interested in getting on the list or anyone who wishes to change his address on it should write to :
1996 note : Not all of these people came to the Dartmouth conference .
They were people we thought might be interested in Artificial Intelligence .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
In one frenzied month Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke remade Wall Street .
Along the way they may also have recast American politics .
A month of historic government interventions shows signs of triggering a political version of climate change - unleashing a new era of class fury that could hurt U.S. companies , business leaders , and wealthy investors for years .
Will a bailout backlash batter corporate America ?
Tell us what you think .
" A potential calamity , " predicts Democratic pollster Doug Schoen .
" If the reactions we 're seeing hold , we could have real spasmodic anger directed at businesses and corporations . "
And the timing will have consequences , says financier and onetime GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney : " Unfortunately , politicians have seized on the politics of envy , " he told Fortune , " and they are stoking it this election year like I 've never seen in my lifetime . "
Compared to this , Enron was a warm - up exercise .
For all the public outrage over accounting scandals seven years ago , the result in Washington was limited to a financial reporting rule that most Americans have never heard of ( though many in the business community still consider Sarbanes - Oxley a destructive overreaction ) .
By contrast , the implosion of Wall Street , followed by Paulson 's escalating series of multibillion - dollar rescues , has fired up populist sentiments that were already building in American politics , promising to reshape legislative battles over everything from tax and trade policies to federal regulation .
Union leaders like the AFL - CIO 's John Sweeney suddenly sound as if they 're in the mainstream of public opinion with statements like this : " One thing is certain .
No one - no politician , no investment banker , no television commentator , no economist - should be able to say again with a straight face that here in the United States we just let markets do whatever markets do and everything works out for the best . "
Washington hath no fury like Middle America scorned - and there 's reason to think it will only get uglier .
The government 's massive new financial commitments will severely tie the next President 's hands in addressing middle - class concerns .
" The next President will have to temper expectations a lot , " says Middlebury College economist David Colander , " far beyond what either of the candidates has been willing to talk about . "
If that means Republican John McCain gives up on letting the upper middle class keep the Bush tax cuts , it also means that Democrats will have to stop promising ambitious spending programs .
Barack Obama rightly says it would be " irresponsible " not to review his spending menu - which includes making health care universal - in light of this new fiscal reality .
As for problems like Medicare and Social Security ?
They 'll have to wait .
***
On the cool fall morning that Paulson , Bernanke , and Vice President Dick Cheney first trekked to Capitol Hill to persuade a skeptical Congress to pass an unprecedented $ 700 billion federal buyout of troubled bank debt , White House spokesman Tony Fratto tried valiantly to get his message out to reporters : " This is a rescue plan for the American economy , " he insisted .
The crisis : A timeline
Despite the dire warnings of financial calamity from the White House and a few high - profile business leaders , much of Middle America was n't buying the story that their own livelihoods were linked to the fate of the rescue package .
Instead , average workers read the plan as the " big guys bailing out their friends , " says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who commissioned a bipartisan survey on the subject .
Gingrich 's poll - conducted by Schoen and Republican Kellyanne Conway - found that a majority of Americans do n't want Congress to use taxpayer dollars to bail out financial institutions , even if their collapse means a rocky ride for investors in the stock market .
The White House was knocked off - balance by potent blowback over the plan - not from the expected ( read : liberal ) quarters but from shopping - mall America .
Morning talk - show hosts like Regis and Kelly shook their heads in disgust .
Constituents in rural southern Illinois - a Republican district - phoned in their opposition to Congressman John Shimkus in a ratio of 200 to 1 .
While Senators grilled Paulson and Bernanke on one side of the Capitol , House members on the other side were offering colorful translations of their constituent views , calling the plan " socialist " and accusing Paulson of handing over " the keys to the liquor cabinet , " as Democratic Texan Lloyd Doggett put it .
Within three days more than 2,000 people had logged their mostly angry opinions on CNNMoney.com .
During the unveiling of the plan , Paulson and Bernanke had exuded confidence that everyone would understand the urgency and that Congress would approve it quickly .
" If it does not pass now , " Paulson intoned , " then heaven help us all . "
They banked on public fear of a financial crash ; instead , they ran into a fear from lawmakers who had to face down the folks back home angry at having to bail out Wall Street 's masters of the universe .
Capitol
Hill brimmed with calls for limits on pay for any executive who wanted taxpayer help .
Warren Buffett , with his $ 5 billion bet on Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , emerged as an example of what the government could do for taxpayers if it drove a harder bargain with the banks to collect a piece of the upside .
Bush 's team was already facing criticism for playing the fear card , but to get his package through , the President had to take to the airwaves to make concessions and warn his nation of doubters .
" We are in the midst of a serious financial crisis .
Our entire economy is in danger . "
A new report says that Big Oil enticed U.S. government employees with sex , drugs , and other “ improper ” gifts .
If any doubt was left about the complicit corruption of current U.S. energy policy , a report released earlier today by the Interior Department ’s inspector general stated that U.S. government employees received what they politely called “ improper gifts ” from 4 major oil and gas companies .
The $ 5.3 million dollar investigation found “ recreational marijuana and cocaine use ” by “ a handful ” of Interior Department staff and that two federal employees “ engaged in brief sexual relationships with representatives from companies doing business ” with the department .
Two Interior Department employees “ received combined gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing business — a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources , ” Inspector General Earl Devaney says in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne accompanying the report .
Two of the companies mentioned in the report , Shell and Chevron , have declined to comment , saying they need time to review the report .
Allegedly , about 1/3 of the Interior department ( 19 members ) were involved in “ inappropriate ” behavior , but its unclear what disciplinary action may follow .
The Department of Justice has declined to prosecute two of the employees listed in the report ( one of whom has pleaded guilty to a criminal charge ) but would not say why .
Final words from Rep. Louise Slaughter , D - New York and chairwoman of the House Rules Committee :
“ The Bush administration put an ‘ America for Sale ’ sign on the White House lawn from day one and has been courting Big Oil ever since .
. . This administration is literally in bed with Big Oil .
Little did we know they were such a cheap date . ”

New York Times magazine — but he may soon be appearing in court .
Nearly two years ago , Jason Fortuny placed a fake sex ad on Craigslist pretending to be a woman seeking casual sex , and then published the photographs of anyone who responded .
Now one of his victims has filed a $ 75,000 lawsuit against Fortuny in U.S. District Court , and this summer ( after four months of effort ) finally obtained a valid address for Fortuny and issued a summons .
Two weeks ago — as the New York Times was preparing their article —
Fortuny was writing an eight - page letter to the judge finally defending his " Craigslist experiment " against the legal charges , and offering his own testimony about the event .
" I take it back , " Fortuny wrote recently on his blog .
" You might get sued if you do a Craigslist Experiment ... "
But it 's still very complicated .
Count one : Violation of copyright act
Count two : Public disclosure of private facts
Count three : Intrusion upon seclusion
Count four : Injunctive relief
I 've been asked over and over , " Jason , why did you do it ? "
To be honest , it was a small act that quickly spun out of control .
It 's not like I woke up that morning and said , " hey , I think I 'll start a controversy today and get my face in the news . "
I posted the fake ad with the sole intention to satisfy my curiosity about what kinds of people respond to such overt advertisements .
I expected no responses .
I did n't believe anyone would fall for such an obviously fake ad on a website that tells its users to exercise caution .
When I received those 175 responses to my Craigslist ad , I was blown away by the utter disregard for personal privacy ...
The Plaintiff is seeking to punish my discussion of his DMCA actions by abusing the intent of copyright law , stretching the common law terms of privacy , using unverified e-mail as alternative process , and side stepping personal jurisdiction ...
I have never been afraid to answer for my actions and to face anyone who takes exception with me .
This case , however , is quite different .
This is a case of a person trying to get his pound of flesh out of me for my perceived wrongs .
looking 4 ruff man , harley rider ... i have a leg spreader , crop , cane and metal cuffs .
spit on me , verbally abuse ... " i am looking 4 a white or latin only , str8 brutal dom muscular male 30 - 35 yo who is arrogant , self - centered , nasty , egotistic , sadistic who likes 2 give intense pain and discipline ...
According to the suit Fortuny " acted with actual malice to harm and deceive the individuals responding to the Craigslist ad . "
The suit demands a jury trial and seeks a full slate of damages — compensatory , statutory , and punitive , plus attorney 's fees and costs .
" Plaintiff has suffered , and continues to suffer , harm arising from the foregoing wrongful conduct by Mr. Fortuny , " the lawsuit complains , identifying the victim as John Doe and arguing that the incident affected his private life " and the manner in which he is viewed among family , friends , and colleagues .
" Fortuny 's prank traumatized John Doe , it argues , causing him to " suffer and continue to suffer from humiliation , embarrassment , lost opportunity of keeping his family together , and emotional distress .
" John Doe is asking that Fortuny be enjoined from publishing the photo , that Fortuny destroy his copy of the photo ( and sexy email ) , and to " cooperate in the removal ... from any cached sites .
" The specific charges ?
Is he guilty of disclosing personally identifiable private facts ?
There are n't any , Fortuny argues .
" In his communication , Plaintiff does not use his actual name , or provide any method of personal contact , " he writes in his motion to dismiss — noting that the victim had used an anonymous email address .
And whatever Fortuny published , the victim had volunteered , the motion claims .
" I did not obtain any information by intruding into Plaintiff 's personal space , eavesdropping , or illegally intercepting any communication , " Fortuny argues .
" Thus , the disclosure of Plaintiff 's e-mail is not , by its nature , personal or intrusive .
" And what about the copyright law ?
Fortuny 's motion says that there 's been no violation of copyright law , since the photo he 's republished is used " to discuss how DMCA law can be used to be chill free speech . "
( After the photo was removed from another site , Fortuny had re-published it in October of 2006 in a blog post called " Do n't tread on me , or , how I learned to stop worrying and ignore DMCA threats . " )
Fortuny had filed a counter - notification disputing the copyrighted status of the photo .
( " The counter notification basically says ' you 're a liar liar pants on fire ' , " Fortuny wrote on his blog , " and adds that if you do n't respond within 14 days , I get to put my shit back up . " )
Now his motion adds that " The use of the photo is in reduced form , is transformative , does not affect market value of the original photo , and is for a purpose of education and public interest . "
The motion also notes that it 's a 4 - kilobyte image ( and not the original 22 kilobytes ) , and " there is ample case law that protects the fair use of reduced versions of media , especially for the purposes of education and discussion .
" Yes , there were sexy shenanigans on Craiglist , but Fortuny adds that while he did re-publish this particular photo , " there was no malicious intent in my actions .
This was never a plan to embarrass people or to single out a subset of the population .
" The Craigslist griefer writes that he understands the hurt and frustration inflicted on the unsuspecting victims .
But Fortuny also cites a clear warning in Craigslist 's terms of service that the information on the site might indeed be inaccurate or misleading .
" If I made the mistake of telling secrets to someone I did n't know online and it got out ... I 'd be kicking myself pretty hard .
I would most definitely be shouting expletives at my computer screen .
But that 's the risk we all take online , as well as in life .
Whether it 's someone 's e-mail , picture , or personal ad , there 's no guarantee of identity , and no guarantee that you wo n't be betrayed .
And there never will be .
" But the plaintiff obviously disagrees .
The lawsuit cites a section of Craigslists ' privacy policy stating that users " agree not to post , email , or otherwise make available content that includes personal or identifying information about another person without that person 's explicit consent . "
Making an obvious point , the suit notes that the plaintiff intended his sexy photo and email " to be a private communication between himself and the ' woman ' who placed the advertisement ...
The public disclosure of these private facts represents an intrusion upon the privacy of Plaintiff that is objectionable and highly offensive to a reasonable person . "
" The foregoing acts of infringement have been willful and intentional , in complete disregard of and with indifference to Plaintiff 's rights , " the suit argues .
" Moreover , the uncertainty of the extent of the intrusions continues to cause Plaintiff a great deal of anguish and suffering . "
The facts disclosed " were not of any legitimate public concern , " it argues , adding that " Mr. Fortuny acted with actual malice . " " Unless enjoined and restrained by this Court , Mr. Fortuny will continue to cause Plaintiff great and irreparable injury that cannot fully be compensated or measured in money .
" Appealing to the court 's sympathy , Fortuny shares a personal statement with his own perspective .
When Second Life 's user database was hacked , the press coverage was minimal , Fortuny argues , while his own stunt generated a disproportionate huge wave of attention .
" That there was so much coverage truly confused me , " he writes , adding that " I 've struggled to integrate this experience into my life , and to make it productive .
" And Fortuny also argues that he does n't ridicule the individuals who responded , but talks instead about " the larger issue of privacy on the Internet , and how to be proactive in protecting one 's private information . " " [ B]ringing legal action against me may punish me , but it wo n't change or even impact online culture in the positive ways that I describe above .
" But for the moment , he 's left grappling with the legal nuances of his defense .
For example , he points out that though both he and his victim live in Washington state , the suit was filed in federal court in Illinois .
( The suit argues it 's a federal issue , and that Fortuny also spoke about the incident at a " Lulz Con " in Chicago . )
There 's one more interesting wrinkle .
The plaintiff did copyright his photograph — but apparently as an after - thought .
( Fortuny published the image on October 6 of 2006 , and the plaintiff began his copyright filing on October 12 . )
Fortuny argues that tactics like the victim 's frivolous DMCA notice " erode the free speech rights of Internet users everywhere , especially the growing world of bloggers and other self - published groups .
When an individual uses copyright law and privacy torts to silence critics or unjustly control publicly relevant discussion , it damages everyone 's rights .
" Ironically , the day after filing the lawsuit , John Doe 's attorney had to ask the court to delete the copyright application because it revealed his embarrassed client 's real name .
Almost two years later , more than 180 responses remain online at Encyclopedia Dramatica , including photographs of more than 94 men ( and in some cases , close - ups of their genitals ) .
Fortuny reportedly copied the text verbatim from an actual Craigslist ad , which gave his lure an extra authenticity .
" i am 27 yo sexy str8 woman , 5 ft 7 in , 145 lbs ... " the ad promised .
" send ur stats and a face pic and i'll return mine to you ...
" But so far the resulting legal actions have been centered on the uses of copyright law .
Neither " John Doe " nor his lawyers returned our request for a comment — nor did Craigslist or the EFF .
But Jason Fortuny did , urging internet users " protect your free speech rights .
Stand up to copyright and DMCA law abuse .
" But so far , he 's standing alone .
( " Let me introduce you to my amazing lawyer , " Fortuny wrote on his blog .
" Me. " )
He contacted the Chicago ACLU , according to the post , saying that they replied that handling e-mail was " too complicated , could you please send us a fax . "
So faced with expensive legal fees and his own counter - arguments about copyright law , " here I am , going Pro Se on this .
This is going to be fun .
" In an email today , Fortuny conceded that " The case is at a very early stage , and it 's not at the forefront of my brain right now . "
But a hint of his true sense of impunity may have slipped into his letter to the court .
" I make no excuses about who I am , " he writes in his motion to dismiss .
" I am frequently rude , unsympathetic , unempathetic , and politically incorrect , to put it mildly .
" But there 's no law against that . "
THERE HAS BEEN a mistake .
I should n't be here at all .
I 'm looking down the length of North Michigan Avenue , known as the Magnificent Mile , a compact concentration of department stores and designer houses , and I 'm thinking this is all wasted on me .
For serious shoppers this is retail heaven : Chicago is fast becoming the first choice of Irish people planning shopping expeditions to the US .
My mission is to shop for Ireland on this boulevard of bargain dreams , but I suspect I may not be up to the task .
I consider myself a bit of a metrosexual , reasonably familiar with the menswear section at Brown Thomas , but we 're talking major - league shopping here .
" Why are they sending you ? " asked Herself a few days previously .
" They should send an expert - like me . "
But , for better or worse , here I am in downtown Chicago , and the stores beckon to me with their promise of retail bliss and designer nirvana .
Where do I start ?
Well , how about from the top ?
The attraction of Chicago as an alternative shopping destination is apparent when you realise how easy it is to navigate the Magnificent Mile .
Although you can wear out your Manolos hoofing around Manhattan in search of the perfect pair of shoes , here you can practically glide up and down North Michigan Avenue , slipping in and out of the stores with cushion - soled ease .
Just in case you 're suffering from New York withdrawals , the city 's big department stores - Bloomingdale's , Macy 's and Saks Fifth Avenue - all have branches here .
There 's even a Tiffany Co to soothe your inner Audrey Hepburn .
Most of the big design houses are here , too , including Hugo Boss , Prada , Burberry , Armani , Louis Vuitton , MaxMara , Zegna and - my favourite - Kenneth Cole .
I picked up a nice wallet on sale .
Talk about the last of the big spenders .
The Magnificent Mile is also dotted with shopping malls , from the 900 Shops at 900 Michigan Ave - billing itself as " above Magnificent " - to Westfield North Bridge at 520 North Michigan .
Water Tower Place , across from Chicago 's legendary Water Tower , is particularly impressive , with its eight - level atrium and fountains dancing alongside the escalators .
While the Magnificent Mile is dead handy - like O'Connell Street but without the pound shops - you 're not going to find anything that you can't find in any other shopping capital .
If you want something unique and individual , you 'll have to get off Michigan and head for Chicago 's boutique districts .
If you 're only in town for a day or so , you may not have time to ferret out all the hot fashion houses .
What you need is your own local guide , a style Sherpa who can help you negotiate the tricky terrain and hunt down those must - have items .
So I signed up for a guided shopping tour of Chicago 's neighbourhoods , led by stylist and shopping expert Danielle Lutz .
Imagine having your own Carrie Bradshaw to bring you to all the best boutiques and show you the best stuff on offer .
Meeting up with Lutz and her clients at the appointed place , I feel as if I 've just walked on to the set of Sex and the City .
I'm the only bloke on the tour ; this is tailored for serious shoppers , and serious shoppers tend to be female .
If there 's such a thing as a thoroughbred shopper , then Lutz is the real deal .
A former advertising executive , Lutz saw an opportunity to turn her vast knowledge of Chicago 's boutiques and her expert eye for clothes into a profitable business .
chicagoshopwalk.com has only been going for just over a year , but it 's already striding ahead of the posse .
Today we 're pounding the pavements of Bucktown , a pleasant , bohemian district just to the northwest of downtown Chicago .
We meet at Café de Luca , on North Damen Avenue , where Lutz and the ladies discuss brands , styles , cuts and colours over a latte .
We hit the streets and head for the first boutique , and it's just like the TV show - high - heeled feet clacking purposefully along the sidewalk , designer handbags swinging nonchalantly , hair swishing back as the ladies stride out in search of some hot couture .
And a big awkward Irishman shuffling behind in his sneakers and jeans .
We head into the first boutique on the trail , and the ladies make a beeline for the rails , expertly flicking through the clothes and chattering excitedly .
I 'm standing around self - consciously , trying not to look like a shoplifter , or a perv .
One bemused shop assistant asks suspiciously if she can help me .
" Yes , please help me , " I want to say .
" I came on this shopping trip by accident .
Can you arrange for my wife to be here instead of me ? "
Instead I murmur : " It 's okay , I 'm just the bodyguard . "
When you sign up with Lutz you get not only the benefit of her expertise but also a discount at each boutique you visit .
She 'll even organise champagne and canapes - essential fuel for shoppers on the go .
A two - hour tour costs $ 41 ( €28 ) , which could be a bargain if you want to maximise your shopping time and get straight to the fashion motherlode .
But the real cost can be as much or as little as you like - few of Lutz 's clients leave the boutiques empty - handed .
This summer Lutz has seen more European visitors signing up for the shopwalk tour .
I did manage to come away with one purchase - a pair of trendy FitFlops for the real shopaholic in my life .
Next time around I 'll just send Herself on the tour .
Not even Carrie Bradshaw will be able to keep up .

MEDIA ALERT
National Impeachment Network
A spokesperson for a National Impeachment Network ( NIN ) lobbying delegation , which has been meeting with Congress members in Washington DC this week , said “ There is clear evidence that the mood of Congress has shifted .
Impeachment hearings could start
this month .
It appears that hearings will likely focus on impeachable offenses not requiring testimony and lengthy investigations because evidence is on the public record — the administration ’s refusal to honor subpoenas , the nearly 800 signing statements used to alter the intent of legislation passed by Congress , and the deliberate misinformation given to Congress to get approval for going to war .
We are very optimistic that Cheney and Bush are finally going to be held to account and investigated . ”
Said another member of the NIN delegation , “ The reception we ’ve received has been positively amazing .
Every Representative we ’ve met with supports impeachment strongly .
Our team is working hard and will continue lobbying efforts through the month of July .
We ’ll be there tomorrow when Kucinich introduces his new resolution for impeaching Bush for the deliberate intelligence deceptions leading to the Iraq War – and Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers invited the group to sit in on the Judiciary Committee hearing where Karl Rove is expected to be cited for contempt of Congress .
Conyers told the group that he would like to deliver the inherent contempt citation to Rove himself .
This is incredibly exciting .
The majority of Americans favor impeachment and want
the Democratic Party to listen to the grassroots .
Congress members are going to insist on restoring their oversight authority .
We should take heart that the breakthrough we ’ve been seeking appears to finally be happening . ”

As Columbia only very recently announced , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be speaking in Roone Arledge auditorium this Monday .
A number of students and student organizations have already announced plans for a protest rally the same day .
We are not among them .
We do not endorse Ahmadinejad or his views , many of which are inexcusable .
However , as opponents of a US military strike against Iran , we have serious concerns with the content of some of the hostility that has been expressed to his presence , and specifically with the planned protest .
We fear the demonization of Ahmadinejad , because we think this demonization contributes to the likelihood of war .
In the current climate , with many on the political right in the U.S. and Israel pushing for air strikes , a campaign against Ahmadinejad is dangerous , regardless of the intentions of most involved .
A call to action , unless it prominently rules out war , implies military action .
A rally where each speaker denounces Ahmadinejad ’s reactionary policies and just a few call explicitly for military action will still be perceived , on campus and around the U.S. , as pro-war .
The right - wing media , from Fox News to the New York tabloids , has already jumped on the event , and will spin it to favor their cause .
Conservative organizations with no affiliation to Columbia ’s campus , such as the David Project , have already signed on to the rally on Facebook , and are likely to distribute hundreds of warmongering flyers and picket signs .
The rally will seem to be a sea of pro-war demonstrators — and the more people who attend it and the more organizations that endorse it , the more powerful this disastrous message will be .
A U.S. attack on Iran , which is not an inevitability but is a real possibility , would have consequences just as terrible as the invasion of Iraq .
Thousands would die in initial air strikes , and more in the resulting backlash and regional conflagration .
The work of Iranian campaigners for free speech , women ’s rights , and lesbian and gay liberation , and against racism and anti-semitism , would be set back immeasurably .
As Iranian Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi has pointed out , “ Human rights are not established by throwing cluster bombs on people .
You can not introduce democracy to a country by using tanks . ”
There are other means for engagement with Iran than war , and other means for disagreement with Ahmadinejad than the planned protest .
We call on those who do not support a war with Iran to be wary of the vilification of Ahmadinejad , to avoid Monday ’s rally , and to express vocally their opposition to military intervention .
Columbia Coalition Against the War
The Columbia Coalition Against the War ‘s statement was made available at the Bwog ( “ compiled by the staff of The Blue and White , Columbia University ’s undergraduate magazine ” ) and Debate ( an SA discussion list ) .

Me : intelligent , fun and stunning bisexual that has always kinda been around since I am the younger sister of the best friend .her : breathtakingly beautiful bisexual ... your wife .... YOU : tall , funny , big - brother type who walked in on your wife going down on me when you came home from a long night .
I would like to first off apologize for my reaction to you walking in .
If I had known for sure that it was just you , I would n't have been so quick to cover up all my goodies .
I am smart enough to realize that if your wife has been tasting it , it is only fair that you get to see it .
Second , I would like to explain why there was no hand of welcome extended out to you : 1 .
I was supposed to have left to pick my brother up about 20 minutes before you walked in .
( What can I say ?
I was sidetracked ... ) 2. you had a friend waiting for you in the livingroom .
3. you looked like you wanted to punch me in the face .
Under normal circumstances
I would have simply asked you if you wanted to join in .... to be honest , reason 2 would n't have stopped me , reason 1 was just a minor setback , and well .... reason 3 was the real deal - breaker on that one .
Reason 3 explains why I quickly put on my pants , grabbed my purse , and left the house without saying goodbye to you .
So , ok , things have cooled down a bit .
Me and you are back to our normal retardedly witty banter , and since then me and your wife have n't done anything .... ok well .... we have had a few make - out sessions , and I may or may not have had my hand down her pants the other night .... but there has been no sex .
( not for my lack of teasing - slash - trying ... but I mean ... you have seen your wife , and you know how awesome she is ~can you really blame me ? ) I know she has been with other girls in the past , and it never bothered you before .
But maybe it was because this time it was at home , and maybe it was because this time it was with me , and there are real feelings there , and it is n't just about the sex ....
But I promise I am not trying to steal her away .
I do n't even want to make you fully share ~our work schedules are as such that I can be with her while you are at work , and you do n't have to miss any time with her at all !!!
So please , please , please , PLEASE give her permission to be with me again .
(.... and again and again and again ... ) because , well ... it is SO hard to find a girl [ or guy ] with the same dating goals and ideals as me , and me and her have this connection that is just like .... well I can't even explain it .
And sweetheart , I * PROMISE * that the next time you walk in on us , I wo n't cover anything up .
I will give you a great display of myself&my goodies , then look you straight in the eye , and ask you why your clothes are still on .
Yeah , it may be a little awkward since I have always had little sister status , but I think once you get in the mix of things you will forget all about my relatives .

Advertisement Apple has unveiled the latest version of its iPod Nano , featuring what it says are the thinnest measurements yet .
The fourth generation Nano was launched at a US press conference by Apple chief Steve Jobs , who announced new shuffle and library features .
He also listed the Nano 's environmental credentials , including arsenic - free glass and a mercury and PVC - free body that is " highly recyclable " .
The Nanos are expected to sell in the UK for £ 109 ( $ 191 ) for the 8GB version .
The 16GB version will retail at £ 149 .
Speaking live in San Francisco , Mr Jobs unveiled Apple 's new Genius function which allows users to create automatic playlists from the iPod 's library with the click of a button .
He said the function worked by taking one song and creating a playlist based on the user 's song library and could also suggest other tracks the user might want to buy .
Mr Jobs described the new Nano as " highly recyclable " Mr Jobs said the new Nano also had a " shake to shuffle " mode , which sends the gadget to shuffle mode with the flick of a wrist allowing you to go backwards and forwards on your playlist .
' Lots of fun '
The Apple chief executive officer said the company had sold more than 160 million iPods since its introduction seven years ago .
An updated iPod Touch - the closest cousin to the iPhone - was also announced at the event .
It is thinner than previous models and has integrated volume controls and a built - in speaker for " casual listening " and will also include the Genius function .
New software for the iPhone - which will be available free to all users - would " fix a lot of bugs " including dropped calls and connection problems reported by customers .
Mr Jobs said : " We 're really , really excited about all these products .
We think people are going to have a lot of fun . "
Rocks the house ?
The Apple announcement was much touted on the blogosphere for days leading up to the launch with plenty of speculation about what would be unveiled .
Gizmodo's Jesus Dias was not disappointed and said " iPod touch second generation rocks our socks off . "
However Craig Grannell of Cult of Mac said " Fairly modest expectations were barely met and all we got were skinny things we already knew about anyway . "
Instead of picking a few colours , Jobs said they decided to pick every colour Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC that this line up of new products did not deliver the way the company has in the past .
" I do n't like to sound like I am putting products down .
I like new pieces of hardware and I did n't think it was the biggest one of all time for Apple .
" But then we do n't present like we do at our Mac World Expo .
Some of our introductions are weaker than others and we did n't really expect an awful lot from today . "
Wall Street 's reaction was also fairly lacklustre with Apple 's share price actually falling more than 7 points during the course of the event from $ 159.64 ( £ 90 ) to $ 152.12 ( £ 86 ) .
Some analysts however were more than happy with Apple 's product launch .
" These are evolutionary products with some revolutionary new features , " Michael Gartenburg , vice president of Jupiter Media told the BBC .
" Apple has done it again .
They have reinvented the line in a way to capture mainstream consumers ' hearts and minds and doing at a price point that is extremely affordable . "

What are these ?
So 1 gb size , but still 10 minute cap ?
That 's some high def .
File under " wow , our national reputation really is in the toilet " : a Canadian court rules that since the US military in Iraq may have forced a deserting soldier to commit " a war crime , a crime against peace or a crime against humanity , " he can legally apply for asylum in Canada to avoid further military service .
CBC , h/t to commenter ' always interested ' :
[ US Soldier Joshua ]
Key was sent to Iraq in 2003 as a combat engineer for eight months where he said he was responsible for nighttime raids on private Iraqi homes , which included searching for weapons .
He alleged that during his time in Iraq he witnessed several cases of abuse , humiliation , and looting by the U.S. army .
When Key was back in the U.S on a two - week leave , he said he was suffering from debilitating nightmares and that he could n't return .
A military lawyer told him that he could either return to Iraq or face prison .
Instead , Key took his family to Canada and applied for refugee status .
Citing a case from the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal , [ Canadian Federal Court Justice Robert ]
Barnes said officially condoned military misconduct could still support a refugee claim , even if it falls short of a war crime .
" The authorities indicate that military action which systematically degrades , abuses or humiliates either combatants or non-combatants is capable of supporting a refugee claim where that is the proven reason for refusing to serve , " Barnes wrote ....
Key 's lawyer , Jeffry House , said the ruling expands a soldier 's right to refuse military service .

Ron Paul ’s followers are trading venues for a Minnesota rally planned during the Republican National Convention , giving them room for thousands more spectators .
The conservative Texas congressman and former Republican presidential candidate is the headliner for the “ Rally for the Republic . ”
It will take place at Target Center in Minneapolis , home of basketball ’s Minnesota Timberwolves .
Organizers expect as many as 15,000 people to hear Paul speak during the 10 - hour rally on Sept. 2 .
Local coordinator Marianne Stebbins said she does n’t see the rally as being in competition with the Republican convention set for Sept. 1 - 4 at St. Paul ’s Xcel Energy Center .
“ We have two different goals , ” Stebbins said today .
“ They ’re there for their political convention to nominate their candidate .
We ’re supplementing it .
Liberty is getting short shrift right now .
We ’re giving our people a place to go for those days . ”
A mission statement posted on the rally ’s Web site describes one goal as to place “ a clear call to the Republican Party to return to its roots of limited government , personal responsibility , and protection of our natural rights . ”
A Republican convention spokesman did n’t immediately respond to a request for comment .
Sen .
John McCain is due to receive his party ’s nomination on the GOP convention ’s final day .
The Paul event planners had originally scoped out a college basketball arena that they figured would hold 11,000 people .
Target Center can hold almost 20,000 people for concerts .
Stebbins said Paul supporters from coast - to - coast are expected to attend .
The Paul speech will be the capstone for three days of planned activities .
They include training sessions for people looking to become more politically involved , concerts and a Paul book signing .
Tickets go on sale Friday at a cost of $ 17.76 .
CHARLOTTE , N.C. – Senator Barack Obama said the government plan to stabilize the nation ’s financial markets came with “ a staggering price tag , ” but he told voters here on Sunday that any rescue plan needed to include new regulations of the financial system .
“ First , there must be no blank check when American taxpayers are on the hook for this much money , ” Mr. Obama told supporters at an outdoor rally in downtown Charlotte .
“ Second , taxpayers should n’t be spending a dime to reward C.E.O.s on Wall Street while they ’re going out the door . ”
In his first public remarks about the $ 700 billion proposal that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve presented to Congressional leaders , Mr. Obama offered qualified support for the bailout .
Until complete details emerge this week on Capitol Hill , aides said , Mr. Obama would not render a final judgment .
But he said any plan had to include protections for taxpayers and assistance for homeowners at risk of losing their property .
“ This initial outlay of up to $ 700 billion is sobering , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ In return for their support , the American people must be assured that the deal reflects the basic principles of transparency , fairness , and reform . ”
Here in Charlotte , with the towering offices of Bank of America and Wachovia in the background , Mr. Obama devoted a significant portion of an afternoon address to the financial crisis as he derided lax government oversight of the mortgage and financial system .
He said the Bush administration has “ run this economy into the ground . ”
But Mr. Obama added that the country should n’t shoulder the burden alone , declaring : “ This is a global crisis and the United States must insist that other nations join us in helping secure the financial markets . ”
In a weekend interview aboard his campaign plane , Mr. Obama offered guarded praise of how Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is managing the crisis .
The Democratic presidential nominee stopped short of pledging to keep Mr. Paulson in place in an Obama administration , but said the gravity of the turmoil in the nation ’s financial markets was so serious that continuity would be important to avert further crisis .
“ Getting a new person to start juggling those balls is going to be tricky , ” Mr. Obama said as he arrived here in North Carolina .
“ Regardless of who wins the election , the issue of transition to the next administration is going to be very important .
And it ’s going to have to be executed with a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation . ”
While he is critical of how the crisis began , Mr. Obama offered kind words for the instincts and judgment exercised by Mr. Paulson in recent weeks .
The two have spoken on the phone nearly every day for the past week about the problem .
“ He has been put in a situation where there are no great options , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ I think he ’s a serious person .
I think he is not an ideologue .
I think he ’s very practical - minded and he wants to solve the problem . ”
To a large crowd of supporters on Sunday , Mr. Obama delivered a blistering critique of Senator John McCain , whom he accused of leading the push for deregulation during his years in Washington .
“ We ’re now seeing the disastrous consequences of this philosophy all around us , ” Mr. Obama said , adding : “ He calls himself fundamentally a deregulator , when reckless deregulation and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem . ”
Tucker Bounds , a spokesman for Mr. McCain , said the Democratic candidate had failed to outline specific proposals to address the calamity on Wall Street that has caused ripples throughout the financial markets around the world .
“ Barack Obama called for decisive action , while offering absolutely no new ideas , policies or concrete solutions , ” Mr. Bounds said in a statement .
He added , “ John McCain rejected complacency and political calculation in favor of a direct call for updated , effective regulations that will protect Americans ’ homes , savings and jobs . ”
As of today , Intel 's new X25 - M ( 80 GB ) solid state disk ( SSD ) is officially launched , some six months after the company first announced its intention to enter the SSD market .
We 've kept an eye on Intel through the entire run up to today , and discussed the reasons why the company is interested in flash storage to begin with .
The company 's focus , at least with this first mainstream generation of products , is on boosting the performance and reliability of multi level cell ( MLC ) drives rather than lowering their cost — do n't expect any sudden drops in SSD prices as a result of this introduction .
As previously mentioned , Intel 's SSD is built on MLC technology instead of a single level cell ( SLC ) design .
The difference between the two can be summarized adequately as a price / performance tradeoff .
SLC drives are generally faster , consume less power , and are considered to be more reliable than MLC drives ( though drive manufacturers are closing this gap ) .
MLC drives are n't as fast as their SLC counterparts ( particularly when writing ) and consume more power , but are much , much , cheaper , as we 'll see in a moment .
Intel 's X25 - M , exterior view .
Intel claims the X25 - M offers a number of significant improvements over other SSDs currently on the market , including vastly improved wear - leveling efficiency , better power efficiency , and higher number of IOPS ( Input / Output operations per second ) then its competitors .
We now know that these 80 GB drives will cost $ 595 in 1,000 unit quantities , and should appear in both OEM system designs and the retail market in the near future .
Here 's how price breaks down compared to various SSD options already on the market :
SSD vs. HDD .
The current SSD market
The flash market is currently something of a mess , and drive prices can vary significantly from manufacturer to manufacturer or OEM to OEM .
Adding a 64GB SSD to Apple 's Macbook Air , for example , costs $ 599 ( $ 9.37 / GB ) , while Dell will drop a 128 GB SSD into its XPS M1730 for just $ 425 ( $ 3.32 / GB ) .
Surf over to Dell 's business products , however , and you 'll find a 64GB SSD option on the Dell Precision M4400 with a price of $ 554 ( $ 8.66 / GB ) .
I also checked HP , but that company does n't seem to offer any SSD options by default — all of the higher - end machines I checked in both Home / Home Office and Business carried standard hard drives .
The retail market also shows considerable variation , as detailed in the following graph .
Retail SSD price - per - gigabyte varies dramatically — far more than we'd expect to see if we compared various HDD manufacturers .
These different costs underline an extremely important point :
Not all SSDs offer the same level of performance .
The performance and power consumption of any SSD is a function of the manufacturing process and technology that drive is built upon .
Relevant factors include whether the drive is built using SLC or MLC ( as we covered ) , as well as how good the manufacturer is at squeezing maximum performance out of their own design .
At $ 7.44 / GB , Intel 's new SSD is significantly more expensive than its MLC competitors ; only Samsung 's SLC 64GB drive is more expensive .
As for the hard drives , the VelociRaptor is generally considered to be the fastest traditional HDD on the market ( and carries a premium as a result ) , while the WD Caviar stands in as a basic hard drive .
The $ 0.14 / GB price on the 500GB drive is not abnormal ; 750 GB drives are now available for just $ 0.15 / GB , and even 1TB drives , which once carried a significant price premium , are as low as $ 0.17 / GB .
Performance , power consumption , and market positioning
Now that we 've talked a bit on where the drive stands in the SSD market , let 's have a short look at its performance and power consumption .
Originally , I 'd planned to test this drive in my brand - new Macbook Pro ( my desktop is still Windows , so do n't fret ) .
Several screws in the MBP , however , defeated my most ardent attempts to remove them , despite the fact that I had appropriately - sized screwdrivers .
I now have several ruined screwdrivers and a number of circular bruises on my right hand , and the Macbook sits on my desk , mocking me .
End result : I tested the SSD on my standard Intel X38 - based desktop with 4GB of RAM at 1066MHz , a Q6600 ( quad-core , 2.4GHz ) , and an EVGA 9800 GTX .
Idle power consumption was measured at the wall after Vista had been installed .
The benchmark I chose , in this case , was rather simple :
How long did it take to install Vista to a clean drive ?
I used a stopwatch , and started it when the actual installation process began , as opposed to when the OS install disc first booted .
Whenever I had to enter any information , I stopped the clock , resuming the timer only after I finished .
The numbers below also include the automatic performance test Vista performs when first installed .
It 's a very simple test , but the results actually track quite well with what I 've seen elsewhere .
Any OS installation is a mixture of both reads and writes and , while we can't see the percentage breakdowns for the two categories , there 's a noticeable performance difference between Intel 's X25 - M on the one hand , and the two mechanical drives on the other .
The WD VelociRaptor is 51s behind the X25 - M , or about 6.5 percent slower , while installation on the 7200.2 Momentus takes about three minutes ( 23 percent ) longer than installing to the X25 - M .
As for power consumption , the WD VelociRaptor clearly " wins " , at 140W in Idle mode .
While the Seagate technically edges out the Intel , realistically , given the inherent margin of error in such measurements , the two drives probably tie .
I would have vastly preferred to test both power consumption and battery life in the MBP , but that proved impossible .
Shipping versions of the X25 - M may draw less power but , even at the moment , the drive does n't seem as if it 'll hurt battery life in any way , even if we did n't see an improvement .
As a final note , the Seagate Momentus 7200.2 drive we tested is $ 99.99 at NewEgg , or approximately $ 0.50 / GB .
Conclusion
Intel 's X25 - M is n't going to directly drive the cost of SSDs downward , and the company clearly feels the advantages it claims ( some of which are apparent in specific benchmarks ) are enough to justify a price point midway between standard MLC drives and Seagate 's 64GB SLC .
Indirectly , however , the drive could have some impact .
No other company , not even Samsung , can match Intel 's extensive partner network .
If OEMs begin shipping more SSDs ( both from Intel and other manufacturers ) , manufacturing capacity must rise to meet that demand .
This creates economies of scale and , while Intel obviously intends to leverage its own massive fabrication capacity , we 'll undoubtedly see demand for other manufacturers ' solutions rising as well .
We 've actually known for some time that this year 's new SSDs would focus primarily on increasing performance and capacity over driving down the cost of the technology .
Current test results indicate this may well have been the right choice , particularly given MLC 's weak write performance .
Intel 's new drive is an impressive piece of work , particularly for an MLC device , but there 's still a huge gap between HDD and SSD pricing that will eventually have to be addressed .
Those of you wanting an Intel SLC solution wo n't have long to wait ; the company plans to introduce enterprise - class SLC drives later this year .
Expect these to carry a significant price premium , even over the mainstream counterparts .
If you 're looking for high - end performance without completely blowing your budget , however , Intel 's X25 - M is a new option to consider .
While it 's more expensive than any other MLC SSD on the market , it 's also larger and cheaper than Samsung 's 64GB SLC drive .
For buyers at the high end of the market , Intel 's new SSD may ultimately be a more attractive option than competing solutions , and this launch , taken as a whole , is a definite success .

The Large Hadron Collider had its first hiccup yesterday , just a week after it fired up .
AFP reported today that the collider was stopped due to an electrical problem involving a cooling system .
A spokeswoman for CERN , the organization that runs the LHC , said that " it 's normal for there to be stoppages . "
The work was expected to resume sometime today .
What 's more surprising is that the exceedingly complex , $ 5 billion , 17 - mile collider has n't had more problems during the startup phase .
Getting beams of particles around the ring in both directions on the first day of operation was better than expected .
The process is actually ahead of schedule and the first collisions , originally planned for Oct. 21 , could happen within weeks .

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama ’s selection of Joseph Biden as his running mate constitutes a stunning betrayal of the antiwar constituency who made possible his hard - fought victory in the Democratic primaries and caucuses .
The veteran Delaware senator has been one the leading congressional supporters of U.S. militarization of the Middle East and Eastern Europe , of strict economic sanctions against Cuba , and of Israeli occupation policies .
Most significantly , however , Biden , who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the lead - up to the Iraq War during the latter half of 2002 , was perhaps the single most important congressional backer of the Bush administration ’s decision to invade that oil - rich country .
Shrinking Gap Between Candidates
One of the most important differences between Obama and the soon - to - be Republican presidential nominee John McCain is that Obama had the wisdom and courage to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Obama and his supporters had been arguing correctly that judgment in foreign policy is far more important than experience ; this was a key and likely decisive argument in the Illinois senator ’s campaign against Sen.
Hillary Clinton , who had joined McCain in backing the Iraq war resolution .
However , in choosing Biden , who , like the forthcoming Republican nominee , has more experience in international affairs but notoriously poor judgment , Obama is essentially saying that this critical difference between the two prospective presidential candidates does n’t really matter .
This decision thereby negates one of his biggest advantages in the general election .
Of particular concern is the possibility that the pick of an establishment figure from the hawkish wing of the party indicates the kind of foreign policy appointments Obama will make as president .
Obama ’s choice of Biden as his running mate will likely have a hugely negative impact on his once - enthusiastic base of supporters .
Obama ’s supporters had greatly appreciated the fact that he did not blindly accept the Bush administration ’s transparently false claims about Iraq being an imminent danger to U.S. national security interests that required an invasion and occupation of that country .
At the same time Biden was joining his Republican colleagues in pushing through a Senate resolution authorizing the invasion , Obama was speaking at a major antiwar rally in Chicago , correctly noting that Iraq ’s war - making ability had been substantially weakened and that the international community could successfully contain Saddam Hussein from any future acts of aggression .
In Washington , by contrast , Biden was insisting that Bush was right and Obama was wrong , falsely claiming that Iraq under Saddam Hussein  severely weakened by UN disarmament efforts and comprehensive international sanctions  somehow constituted both “ a long - term threat and a short - term threat to our national security ” and was an “ extreme danger to the world . ”
Despite the absence of any “ weapons of mass destruction ” or offensive military capabilities , Biden , when reminded of those remarks during an interview last year , replied , “ That ’s right , and I was correct about that . ”
Biden Shepherds the War Authorization
It is difficult to overestimate the critical role Biden played in making the tragedy of the Iraq war possible .
More than two months prior to the 2002 war resolution even being introduced , in what was widely interpreted as the first sign that Congress would endorse a U.S. invasion of Iraq , Biden declared on Aug. 4 that the United States was probably going to war .
In his powerful position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he orchestrated a propaganda show designed to sell the war to skeptical colleagues and the American public by ensuring that dissenting voices would not get a fair hearing .
As Scott Ritter , the former chief UN weapons inspector , noted at the time , “ For Sen . Biden ’s Iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern - day Gulf of Tonkin resolution - equivalent for Iraq , his committee will need to ask hard questions  and demand hard facts  concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by Iraq . ”
It soon became apparent that Biden had no intention of doing so .
Biden refused to even allow Ritter himself  who knew more about Iraq ’s WMD capabilities than anyone and would have testified that Iraq had achieved at least qualitative disarmament  to testify .
Ironically , on Meet the Press last year , Biden defended his false claims about Iraqi WMDs by insisting that “ everyone in the world thought he had them .
The weapons inspectors said he had them . ”
Biden also refused to honor requests by some of his Democratic colleagues to include in the hearings some of the leading antiwar scholars familiar with Iraq and Middle East .
These included both those who would have reiterated Ritter ’s conclusions about nonexistent Iraqi WMD capabilities as well as those prepared to testify that a U.S. invasion of Iraq would likely set back the struggle against al - Qaeda , alienate the United States from much of the world , and precipitate bloody urban counter - insurgency warfare amid rising terrorism , Islamist extremism , and sectarian violence .
All of these predictions ended up being exactly what transpired .
Nor did Biden even call some of the dissenting officials in the Pentagon or State Department who were willing to challenge the alarmist claims of their ideologically driven superiors .
He was willing , however , to allow Iraqi defectors of highly dubious credentials to make false testimony about the vast quantities of WMD materiel supposedly in Saddam Hussein ’s possession .
Ritter has correctly accused Biden of having “ preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq . ”
Supported an Invasion Before Bush
Rather than being a hapless victim of the Bush administration ’s lies and manipulation , Biden was calling for a U.S. invasion of Iraq and making false statements regarding Saddam Hussein ’s supposed possession of “ weapons of mass destruction ” years before President George W. Bush even came to office .
As far back as 1998 , Biden was calling for a U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Even though UN inspectors and the UN - led disarmament process led to the elimination of Iraq ’s WMD threat , Biden  in an effort to discredit the world body and make an excuse for war  insisted that UN inspectors could never be trusted to do the job .
During Senate hearings on Iraq in September of that year , Biden told Ritter , “ As long as Saddam ’s at the helm , there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out , root and branch , the entirety of Saddam ’s program relative to weapons of mass destruction . ”
Calling for military action on the scale of the Gulf War seven years earlier , he continued , “ The only way we ’re going to get rid of Saddam Hussein is we ’re going to end up having to start it alone , ” telling the Marine veteran “ it ’s going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking Saddam down . ”
When Ritter tried to make the case that President Bill Clinton ’s proposed large - scale bombing of Iraq could jeopardize the UN inspections process , Biden condescendingly replied that decisions on the use of military force were “ beyond your pay grade . ”
As Ritter predicted , when Clinton ordered UN inspectors out of Iraq in December of that year and followed up with a four - day bombing campaign known as Operation Desert Fox , Saddam was provided with an excuse to refuse to allow the inspectors to return .
Biden then conveniently used Saddam ’s failure to allow them to return as an excuse for going to war four years later .
Biden ’s False Claims to Bolster War
In the face of widespread skepticism over administration claims regarding Iraq ’s military capabilities , Biden declared that President Bush was justified in being concerned about Iraq ’s alleged pursuit of weapons of mass destruction .
Even though Iraq had eliminated its chemical weapons arsenal by the mid-1990s , Biden insisted categorically in the weeks leading up to the Iraq war resolution that Saddam Hussein still had chemical weapons .
Even though there is no evidence that Iraq had ever developed deployable biological weapons and its biological weapons program had been eliminated some years earlier , Biden insisted that Saddam had biological weapons , including anthrax , and that “ he may have a strain ” of smallpox .
And , even though the International Atomic Energy Agency had reported as far back as 1998 that there was no evidence whatsoever that Iraq had any ongoing nuclear program , Biden insisted Saddam was “ seeking nuclear weapons . ”
Said Biden , “ One thing is clear :
These weapons must be dislodged from Saddam , or Saddam must be dislodged from power . ”
He did not believe proof of the existence of any actual weapons to dislodge was necessary , however , insisting that “ If we wait for the danger from Saddam to become clear , it could be too late . ”
He further defended President Bush by falsely claiming that “ He did not snub the UN or our allies .
He did not dismiss a new inspection regime .
He did not ignore the Congress .
At each pivotal moment , he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation . ”
In an Orwellian twist of language designed to justify the war resolution , which gave President Bush the unprecedented authority to invade a country on the far side of the world at the time and circumstances of his own choosing , Biden claimed that “ I do not believe this is a rush to war .
I believe it is a march to peace and security .
I believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur . ”
It is also important to note that Biden supported an invasion in the full knowledge that it would not be quick and easy and that the United States would have to occupy Iraq for an extended period , declaring , “ We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul ; not just the day after , but the decade after . ”
Biden ’s Current Position
In response to the tragic consequences of the U.S. invasion and the resulting weakening of popular support for the war , Biden has more recently joined the chorus of Democratic members of Congress criticizing the administration ’s handling of the conflict and calling for the withdrawal of most combat forces .
He opposed President Bush ’s escalation ( “ surge ” ) of troop strength early last year and has called for greater involvement by the United Nations and other countries in resolving the ongoing conflicts within Iraq .
However , Biden has been the principal congressional backer of a de facto partition of the country between Kurdish , Sunni Arab , and Shia Arab segments , a proposal opposed by a solid majority of Iraqis and strongly denounced by the leading Sunni , Shia , and secular blocs in the Iraqi parliament .
Even the U.S. State Department has criticized Biden ’s plan as too extreme .
A cynical and dangerous attempt at divide - and - rule , Biden ’s ambitious effort to redraw the borders of the Middle East would likely make a violent and tragic situation all the worse .
Yet it is Biden ’s key role in making possible the congressional authorization of the 2003 U.S. invasion that elicits the greatest concern among Obama ’s supporters .
While more recently expressing regrets over his vote , he has not formally apologized and has stressed the Bush administration ’s mishandling of the post- invasion occupation rather than the illegitimacy of the invasion itself .
Biden ’s support for the resolution was not simply poor judgment , but a calculated rejection of principles codified in the UN Charter and other international legal documents prohibiting aggressive wars .
According to Article VI of the Constitution , such a rejection also constitutes a violation of U.S. law as well .
Biden even voted against an amendment sponsored by fellow Democratic Sen .
Carl Levin that would have authorized U.S. military action against Iraq if the UN Security Council approved the use of force and instead voted for the Republican - backed resolution authorizing the United States to go to war unilaterally .
In effect , Biden has embraced the neoconservative view that the United States , as the world ’s sole remaining superpower , somehow has the right to invade other countries at will , even if they currently pose no strategic threat .
Given the dangerous precedent set by the Iraq war resolution , naming one of its principal supporters as potentially the next vice president of the United States has raised serious questions regarding Obama ’s commitment to international law .
This comes at a time when the global community is so desperately hoping for a more responsible U.S. foreign policy following eight years of Bush .
Early in his presidential campaign , Obama pledged to not only end the war in Iraq , but to also challenge the mindset that got the United States into Iraq in the first place .
Choosing Biden as his running mate , however , raises doubts regarding Obama ’s actual commitment to “ change we can believe in . ”

Beer was prohibited in Iceland until 1989 .
This was too crazy a fact for me to just trust Wikipedia on .
Sure enough :
Beer was illegal in Iceland until 1989 .
Yes , this is not a misprint .
Iceland , like the USA , underwent prohibition in the early part of the 20th century .
Our friends in Spain & Portugal helped resolve this situation in the 1930s when they unilaterally stated that they would accept no more Icelandic salted cod ( fish & fish products are Iceland ’s largest export ) unless Iceland agreed to import red wine .
Iceland ’s response was to agree and the door was open .
Iceland also had a history of producing a rough home - spirit called Brennivín ( tastes like Aquavit ) and the push was also made to legalize hard spirits .
Somehow , beer slipped through the cracks and remained ‘ prohibited ’ , although I am told it was n’t especially illegal to have it , just illegal to buy or sell it .
Happily they now have a national beer day to celebrate the end of the prohibition – March 1st .
Report : E - Voting companies being charged with counting votes David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Although many states have rejected electronic voting machines because of their vulnerability to errors and outright fraud , a third of the nation will still be using them this fall .
What 's worse , notes CNN 's Lou Dobbs , " a new report says election officials often are outsourcing their responsibilities to the very companies that make the e-voting machines , even trusting those companies to count the votes . "
That report ( pdf ) was issued by voting rights group VotersUnite .
Org , whose founder Ellen Theisen told CNN , " Elections should be accountable to the people and run by public officials who are selected by the people .
...
When that 's handed over to private vendors , these public elections are no longer public . "
The problem is particularly serious when voting machine companies also tabulate the votes , because the companies own both the equipment and the propriety software which runs it and election officials have no way of double - checking their tally .
The VotersUnite report concludes , " The depth of the current dependence is shocking , but even more shocking is the fact that our elections are dependent on vendors whose records reveal their unethical and even unlawful behavior , as well as their incompetence . "
Oklahoma is one state which owns its own voting system and was n't tempted by the offer of federal funds in 2002 to switch over to a proprietary system .
" There was really nothing on the market we would buy then , " Michael Clingman of the Oklahoma State Election Board told CNN , " and there 's still nothing we would want to buy today . "
" Oklahoma is a real piece of America ! " Dobbs commented approvingly .
" They 're telling these silly son - of - a - guns to go stick it -- and they 're honoring a commitment to the public . "
Dobbs promised to post a list of every state or county that is outsourcing the vote on his Web site .

In The Constitution of Liberty , Friedrich Hayek gave a dire prognosis for the future of technology : " [ W ]e are probably only at the threshold of an age in which the technological possibilities of mind control are likely to grow rapidly and what may appear at first as innocuous or beneficial powers over the personality of the individual will be at the disposal of government .
The greatest threats to human freedom probably still lie in the future . "
Hayek , like most of the leading intellectuals of his time , did not foresee the emergence of the Internet  the quintessential Hayekian spontaneous order .
As a decentralized communication system facilitating the sending and receiving of messages by billions of people , the Internet has greatly shifted the balance of power away from governments and toward sovereign individuals .
Even in its early days , the Internet played a vital role in bringing about the downfall of the Soviet Union ’s government .
Since then , it has catalyzed tremendous economic , social , and political liberation in countries ranging from Cuba to the United States .
While governments have tried to use modern communication technologies to monitor and regulate private individuals , their efforts are doomed to failure stemming from a much more powerful and competent market response .
Hayek Did Not Know the Internet
When Friedrich Hayek ’s
The Constitution of Liberty was first published in 1960 , the Internet did not exist ; nor did its military predecessor , ARPANET , which was initiated in 1969 .
Fifteen years after the horrors of World War II , the means by which the totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union used mass broadcasting technology to indoctrinate their people were still recent memories .
During the Nuremberg Trials , Albert Speer himself expressed the Nazi regime ’s effectiveness at using technology to spread propaganda : " Through technical devices like the radio and the loudspeaker , eighty million people were deprived of independent thought .
It was thereby possible to subject them to the will of one man . "
Faced with such facts ,
Hayek understandably feared future uses of mass broadcasting technology .
Indeed , in a world where the only mass communication technologies were radio and films , the scales of power were shifted toward totalitarian governments and away from sovereign individuals .
According to Christopher Kedzie , " Since traditional broadcast media are located closest to the dictator ’s optimum they are almost certain to be employed as a powerful political weapon . "

The Best of Gennady Stolyarov II
Why do n’t we see the truck racing toward us , or the treasure of gold beneath our feet ?
Are these just invisible events ?
In this excerpt from the book , It Starts with One : Changing Individuals Changes Organizations , authors J. Stewart Black and Hal B. Gregersen offer examples from the mobile phone industry and from the Spanish exploration of America in the 16th century to explain why organizations and individuals fail to see the need for change .
“ Why do we fail to see the need for change ? ” the authors ask .
Their answer : “ Fundamentally , we fail to see because we are blinded by the light of what we already see . ”
Just imagine .
You are relaxing on the beach ; the sun is shining ; its rays shimmering off the ocean waves as they lazily break on the shore .
A cooling breeze occasionally rustles the palm trees .
You are in this idyllic spot because you ’ve done it the old - fashioned way — you ’ve earned it .
You ’ve worked hard ; you ’ve been smart .
Your company is touted in the press as one of the most admired .
You are the market leader in what is expected to be one of the largest consumer market products ever — the cell phone .
At its unveiling , your StarTac phone instantly becomes the phone to own .
You are Motorola .
You are doing the right thing and doing it well .
This was the case for Motorola into the early nineties .
Its analog phones were the phones to own , and Motorola dominated the industry with a global market share of more than 30 % at its peak .
But then the environment shifted — radically .
First , a new digital technology for mobile phones came along .
However , early on it was not clear how superior it would be .
In addition , the new digital technology would require literally billions of dollars of infrastructure investment .
Most U.S. carriers , such as Sprint and Verizon , did not seem to want to make this investment , and it would make little sense to produce a phone that would not work on the carriers ’ systems .
Perhaps this is why none of the other U.S. mobile phone makers leaped in this new digital direction at first .
Although European carriers did seem as though they would embrace the new technology , any individual country such as Germany or France paled in comparison to the market size of the United States , so why worry about what the Europeans might do ?
The second shift involved the emergence of a new competitor .
Although the new competitor was pushing the new technology , to many this seemed more an act of desperation than foresight .
The company had just been through a serious internal leadership shake - up , including the suicide of its CEO in 1990 .
The new CEO installed in 1992 , Jorma Olilla , was a former banker and certainly not a technologist .
So what if he was making some noise about focusing on mobile communication , which represented less than 2 % of Nokia ’s total revenue at the time .
The vast majority of its revenue came from forest products , and it had been that way for more than 100 years .
The company also excelled at making rubber boots for fishermen .
So what in the world could it know about high tech ?
To top it off , the new competitor was based somewhere in frozen Finland , a country with a total population less than the city of Chicago .
Besides , no one was really sure how to pronounce the company ’s name — Nokia .
Was it Nó-kia ( with the emphasis on the “ No ” ) or No-kiá ( with the emphasis on the “ kia ” ) ?
The result ?
Motorola ’s first reaction was to flat - out deny that this new competitor or technology was anything to worry about .
But then Nokia ’s revenue increased four - fold from $ 2.1 billion in 1993 to $ 8.7 billion in 1997 .
All of Europe adopted a common digital standard that allowed people to use mobile phones virtually anywhere in the region .
This convenience drove even greater demand .
In the meantime , the fragmented U.S. standards meant that one phone would not necessarily work in every state , which caused a dampening effect on growth .
Nokia also decided to emphasize brand and brand management as much as technology .
It focused on seemingly innocent items like making the user interface intuitive ( such as a green key for “ send ” and red for “ end call ” ) and consistent across all its models .
In 1998 , just six years after it decided to push into the global mobile phone market , Nokia moved from not even being in the race to taking over the No. 1 position and passed Motorola in terms of units sold globally .
What did Motorola do ?
Oddly , it put even more investment and effort into analog phones .
It did what it knew how to do — what it was good at doing — and it did it even more intensely than before .
Well , we all know what happened after that .
In just six short years ( between 1998 and 2003 ) , Motorola ’s global share of mobile phones plummeted by more than 50 % .
During this same period , Nokia , virtually unknown in the U.S. in the early nineties ( or most of the rest of the world for that matter ) gathered steam to become one of the top ten recognized brands in the world behind the likes of Coca - Cola and McDonald’s .
In 2001 , with a market share of around 35 % , Nokia ’s profit share ( i.e. , share of all money made in the industry ) was nearly 70 % .
So while one in every three phones sold were Nokia phones , seven in every ten dollars ( euro , yen , markka , etc. ) in profits went to Nokia .
That ’s right : Nokia ’s “ profit share ” doubled their “ market share . ”
If only the story ended here , but , it does n’t .
While Nokia was busy taking over the world and dethroning Motorola , a company that was n’t even making mobile phones when Nokia ’s CEO , Jorma Olilla , took over in 1992 , quietly began to move in 1998 just as Nokia was overtaking Motorola with nearly 40 million total units sold to Motorola ’s nearly 35 million .
The company was Samsung , and in 1998 it held a mere 2.7 % of the global world market and sold just 4.7 million phones .
However , even this number failed to capture Nokia ’s attention because Samsung sold most of its phones at home in Korea .
As a consequence , no one , and certainly not Nokia in 1998 , predicted Samsung would rise to challenge Motorola for the No. 2 spot in the world among mobile phone makers by 2006 .
No one saw Samsung coming , including Nokia , until it was a bit too late .
Samsung ’s real surge started in 2002 .
While other manufacturers dismissed a new capability of putting small but low - quality cameras in phones , Samsung put into action the old saying : “ A picture is worth a thousand words . ”
Samsung executives grasped that people did not want phones to replace cameras but simply wanted an additional , more information - rich means of mobile communication with friends and family .
And so in six startling years , Samsung raced from selling a mere 21 million phones in 2000 to 104 million in 2005 , and its global market share nearly tripled from 5 % to 13 % !
In every case , shareholders paid a dear price for the failure to see the need to change .
As Motorola was blindsided by the surge of Nokia , Motorola shareholders saw their value drop by 50 % between 1997 and the end of 2002 .
During the same period , Nokia shareholders watched their value increase by 300 % .
Likewise , as Nokia was stunned by the explosion of Samsung onto the world mobile phone stage , between 2002 and the end of 2005 , Nokia shareholders gasped as the value of their stock drop by 26 % .
During this same period , Samsung shareholders grinned as they saw the value of their shares soar by 216 % .
How this three - way battle will shake out is anyone ’s guess .
In 2006 , both Nokia and a revitalized Motorola pushed ahead and placed a bit more distance between themselves and Samsung .
However , it will be interesting to see how well they ’ve learned their lessons or whether all three will be blindsided by Apple , which announced its new iPhone on January 9 , 2007 .
We make no predictions , but odds are that past success will cause someone to miss something critical relative to needed changes to sustain success in the future .
Blinded by the Light
It is no brilliant statement to say that if you do not see the need to change , you will not change .
Everyone knows this .
But if everyone knows this , why do so many change initiatives fail to break through this first barrier ?
Stated simply , we fail at breaking through this first barrier of change not because we do n’t know it is there but because we underestimate its strength .
We underestimate its strength because we fail to take the time or effort to understand fully its nature .
So why do n’t we see the truck racing toward us , or the treasure of gold beneath our feet ?
Why could Motorola not see the threat of Nokia ?
Why did Nokia miss the rise of Samsung ?
Were these just invisible events ?
Were they simply impossible for anyone to see ?
These might seem like silly questions , but if a particular demand for change were invisible , then we could hardly blame ourselves or someone else for not seeing it .
But in most cases , the need for change is visible — if only we would see it .
Again , why do we fail to see the need for change ?
Fundamentally , we fail to see because we are blinded by the light of what we already see .
To explain , let ’s return to Motorola .
( By the way , we do not mean to pick on Motorola .
They do not stand alone by any means in missing a significant threat or opportunity .
At different points in time , firms such as AT&T , Black & Decker , Caterpillar , IBM , Kmart , Lucent , Merrill Lynch , Sony , Xerox , and others have not seen the need to change as early as they might have and have paid the price — as have their shareholders . )
Still , while Motorola is not the only firm to miss an important threat or opportunity , the threats and opportunities Motorola faced were hardly invisible .
Yet Motorola still did not see , recognize , or acknowledge them until after the cost of waiting was significant .
Instead , Motorola first denied the threat and then worked harder at what it knew how to do well .
So why do we deny ?
When we see evidence that a strategy , structure , technology , or product was right in the past but now is wrong , why do we ignore and deny the evidence ?
Remember , we fail to see the need for change because we are blinded by the light of what we already see .
Virtually every major personal or company change rarely occurs in isolation but contains a context , a history .
In virtually every case , individuals or companies were doing the right thing and doing it well before something in the environment changed .
Just as the previous right thing did not come from out of the blue , neither did our ability to do it well .
Our ability to do the old right thing well developed over time .
Likewise , the maps we used to guide our actions were developed and reinforced by success over time .
With success these mental maps came to guide our behaviors as concretely as physical maps guide the steps we take on a wilderness trek .
Our mental maps tell us where to go and how to get there .
Island of California
[ There exists ] a map of the island of California .
Many people , when they first see it , think it is a futuristic map of the state after a huge earthquake — what Californians refer to as the “ great quake to come . ”
The map is actually quite old .
For centuries , Europeans were captivated by legends of distant islands with unimaginable wealth .
In 1541 , Hernán Cortés and a group of adventurers set sail from Spain to discover such an island .
Cortés sailed across the Atlantic , portaged through Mexico , and then set sail again up the Strait of California , more commonly known today as the Gulf of Baja .
Eventually , his provisions ran low , his crew grew nervous , and he was forced to turn back .
To better understand this , it may be helpful to remember that the Gulf of Baja ( also called the Sea of Cortez ) is nearly 1,000 miles or more than 1600 kilometers long , and the sailing is slow because the winds between two mainlands , modern - day Mexico and the Baja peninsula , stay weak and inconsistent .
For Cortés , failure was unacceptable , and so with a little wishful thinking he created a success .
To the east was land and to the west was land ; to the north and south , water .
Cortés reached a perfectly logical conclusion : he was in search of an island , and an island he had found — La Isla de California .
Cortés returned to Spain and reported to the king and queen exactly what they wanted to hear ( and what he wanted to believe ) : California is an island .
Shortly after Cortés ’s discovery , another expedition was launched to confirm his claim .
This one traveled far up along the Pacific coast , past present - day San Francisco .
This overly ambitious expedition also ran low on supplies , and by the time they reached the Mendocino River on northern California ’s coast , the crew was stricken with scurvy .
With no inclination to dispute Cortés and no absolute evidence that he was wrong , they concluded that the Mendocino River was really a strait separating the northern part of the island of California from the rest of the continent .
Just imagine if you had this map and landed in what is present - day eastern Texas along the Gulf of Mexico .
Your objective is to travel overland and reach the island of California .
What would you need to take with you ?
Boats , of course .
You would have to haul boats more than 2,500 kilometers ( more than 1,500 miles ) across what are present - day Texas , New Mexico , and the deserts of Arizona , only to discover that California was not an island .
In fact , several expeditions after Cortés provided clear proof that California was not an island .
Still , how long did this map of the Island of California persist ?
One hundred years ?
One hundred and fifty years ?
No , this cartographic myth persisted throughout Europe for more than two centuries , until in 1745 a royal proclamation from Spain finally declared : “ California is not an island . ”
( Keep in mind this was just a few years before the American colonies declared independence . )
Why did it take so long for this map to change ?
Once the belief that California was an island had been established , reports from later explorers were filtered to fit the existing map ; anything contradictory was labeled false or impossible .
For all the king knew , the map worked quite well .
Why should he throw it away ?
Similarly , for Motorola , analog phones had worked quite well for a long time .
Black , clam - shell phones with little thought about consistent brand characteristics or easy user interface provided a successful map for more than a decade .
Why should Motorola throw away this great map ?
Again , this phenomenon is not restricted to companies , nor is it a disease that only infects senior executives .
It can and does happen in all sizes of firms and at all levels of positions .
To appreciate this we only have to think of some individual examples .
Consider the transition from individual contributor to manager of individual contributors .
Managers consistently tell us it is one of the most difficult .
Why ?
Simplified , as an individual contributor you get things done by doing them yourself .
If you are a salesperson , you get the sale by going out and making the pitch and closing the deal yourself .
Over time , you establish a personalized set of maps for navigating this individual contributor territory .
However , as a sales team manager , you must transition from doing things yourself to getting them done through others ; you must change from motivating yourself to motivating others .
Because the situation has changed ( you ’ve been promoted ) , what was clearly the right thing before ( i.e. , doing things yourself ) has become the wrong thing , but you are still very good at doing it .
Or consider someone who was very successful at conveying subtle hints and cues in his communication and thereby never risking open embarrassment to anyone in public with whom he might disagree .
This individual was known as a master communicator in his native Japan .
He had years of success in Tokyo and developed an intricate , first - rate map for guiding his communication effectively .
His map also led him to determine that those who demonstrated less tact and sophistication were untrustworthy with sensitive issues or assignments .
This individual was subsequently transferred to an attractive new position a few kilometers to the south — Melbourne .
Sadly , his carefully constructed , well tested communication map did not work so well in Australia .
While he worked hard at communicating with great sensitivity and subtlety , “ locals ” perceived him as not being direct and therefore untrustworthy .
In turn , while the locals “ said what they meant and meaning what they said , ” as they thought they should do , he viewed them as insensitive to others ’ feelings and a bit immature and self - centered in their communication .
Not surprisingly , the assignment did not go well .
Yet , this individual manager was slow to see that what was once very right was now very wrong .
He was slow to see that a serious personal change was needed if he were to continue to succeed in this new and different environment .
Thus , the first and critical point about why we fail to see the need for change stems from the fact that we stand blinded by the light of successful past mental maps .
The longer these maps have worked , the more it makes sense to hold on to them and the more difficult it is to see beyond them to recognize the need for changing them .
This applies not only to companies and macro issues like strategies or technology , but also to individuals and issues as small as how to communicate or provide feedback to someone .

Congress prepared to cast a somber and momentous vote today - a vote of conscience - on a $ 700 billion bailout of the nation 's financial system , hoping that it will prevent what many members now fear is an impending collapse of the U.S. economy .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused late Sunday evening to guarantee it would pass .
After intervening twice during marathon Saturday negotiations to force the Bush administration to accept further changes , the San Francisco Democrat said simply , " We did the very best we can to improve it .
Now let 's see how much support we get . "
House Republican leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , after a long meeting explaining the bailout plan to nervous members , said he supports the plan and urged " that as many as can vote for this bill should do it . "
The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday .
Democrats said they want half of the House Republicans to vote for the bill , to force them to help carry the responsibility for an administration - led bailout .
Many members in both parties said Sunday they were still undecided .
President Bush , who is expected to speak this morning to calm the markets , issued a statement thanking Congress for giving his administration " the necessary tools and funding to protect our economy from a systemwide breakdown , " saying inaction would be " disastrous . "
A sense of foreboding hung over members , none of whom on either side of the aisle is eager to cast such a difficult vote .
Those who do will win no praise or adulation , but will have to explain to their angry and fearful constituents why they took action of such unprecedented scope and untold consequence .
But many feel they must vote yes or be responsible for an economic collapse that could wipe out millions of jobs and close thousands of businesses .
The hope is that with the government offering to buy distressed debt from banks and other institutions that have no market for that debt today , the credit markets that have ground to a near halt will be unfrozen and normal commerce can resume .
A need to act
" I 'm as mad as my constituents are , " said Rep. Ellen Tauscher , a Walnut Creek Democrat who was one of the first women to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange .
But in the end , she said she would vote for the bill and bring her New Democrat caucus with her .
" This is a time when you come to work and it 's game day .
This is not a drill . "
Rep. Christopher Shays , R - Conn. , called it a " legacy vote " as he left the GOP meeting still unsure what he would do .
" This is the kind of vote you have to live with for the rest of your life . "
Los Angeles Democrat Henry Waxman , a fierce opponent of the administration , said he had called many economists and financial experts for advice and was convinced of the need to act .
" All of them said to me you cannot leave doing nothing , " Waxman said .
Members were presented with a plan devised by an administration that neither Republicans nor Democrats trust any longer .
They were told they must act immediately , and had no time to explore alternatives .
Pelosi pointedly emphasized that the legislation belongs to the Bush administration , and congressional leaders , Republican and Democrat , did the best they could in the time they had to modify the unparalleled grant of money and unconstrained authority that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson initially demanded little more than a week ago .
Members said they were not being pressured by leaders or offered favors for their votes , but members who face easy re-election bids will be urged to help push the bill to passage .
Angry dissidents from both parties met across the hall from each other in the basement of the Capitol .
" Why are we swallowing the underlying premise of the administration ? " asked Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
" Remember what happened in the Iraq debate . "
Opposition Democrats , gathered by Rep. Brad Sherman , D - Sherman Oaks ( Los Angeles County ) , queried economists about alternatives .
They got cold comfort , told that maybe if nothing is done , people would be unable to withdraw cash from their banks '
ATM machines " for a few hours , " and that the collapse of the banking system could be remedied by a nationalization of the banks for two or three years , during which time the U.S. financial system would be transformed .
House and Senate leaders from both parties signed off on the bill at 12:30 Sunday morning after hours of tense negotiations .
Pelosi's crucial proposal
Pelosi intervened twice to break deadlocks , forcing the Bush administration to accept taxpayer protection in addition to what the administration had agreed to last week and limits on executive compensation .
One of her proposals turned out to be crucial in winning agreement .
It requires that if the government loses money on its purchases after five years , the president must propose a way to force financial institutions to repay the money to taxpayers .
The changes were added mainly to bring on board conservative House Democrats - whose pay - as - you - go philosophy , already in tatters , is eviscerated with this legislation - and House Republicans who had revolted last week and proposed their own alternative plan for insurance self - financed by banks rather than taxpayers .
These are in addition to changes the administration agreed to late last week that require equity participation by taxpayers in companies whose bad debt the taxpayers buy , aid to homeowners facing foreclosure by directing the Treasury to work out distressed loans where possible , and doling out the money in installments of $ 250 billion , $ 100 billion and $ 350 billion .
Congress could block the last installment within 30 days of the president 's request for the money .
Paulson , a former chief executive of investment bank Goldman Sachs , had argued that limits on executive compensation could reduce participation in the bailout .
The legislation would impose a punitive 20 percent surtax on golden parachutes for executives of companies whose bad debt the Treasury purchases , said Sen. Judd Gregg , the New Hampshire Republican who led Senate Republicans in the negotiations .
Pelosi said that for Wall Street executives , " the party is over . "
Gregg insisted that taxpayers would make much if not all their money back when distressed mortgages and related securities that are now weighing down bank balance sheets are later resold , when markets presumably recover .
Pelosi said all transactions under the plan will be posted on the Internet within 48 hours , and strong oversight was added , including three independent agencies : a bipartisan board appointed by Congress , the General Accountability Office , and a new inspector general .
The Treasury will also have to consider the Republicans ' insurance plan as an option .
Sherman denounced the changes as fig leaves .
He predicted that Bush will request the final installment within days , and if Congress objects , he will veto lawmakers ' objection , requiring a two - thirds vote of both chambers to stop the financing .
A contentious meeting
The agreement came after an unprecedented and contentious meeting at the White House last week that included both presidential nominees , Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
McCain , accused by Democrats of interfering , was praised by House Republicans for forcing changes and possibly saving the bill by making sure they were heard .
McCain called the legislation vital to the nation , but had threatened Senate Republicans that he might not back it unless House GOP objections were incorporated .
" This is something that all of us will swallow hard and go forward with , " McCain said .
Obama issued a statement calling the agreement " the culmination of a sorry period in our history , " but called it necessary and promised a thorough review of the plan should he win the presidency .
Gregg said the intervention by both candidates proved helpful in the end by calling public attention to the severity of the crisis .
Gregg was dire in his warnings of what would happen without action .
" What we face in the credit markets is a potential financial dislocation of a proportion we 've never seen , " he said .
" This is about Main Street .
This is about the whole fabric of American life .
...
It would be such a catastrophe for our nation , we do n't even want to think about it . "
Walnut trees respond to stress by producing significant amounts of a chemical form of aspirin , scientists have discovered .
The finding , by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo. , opens up new avenues of research into the behavior of plants and their impacts on air quality , and also has the potential to give farmers an early warning signal about crops that are failing .
" Unlike humans , who are advised to take aspirin as a fever suppressant , plants have the ability to produce their own mix of aspirin - like chemicals , triggering the formation of proteins that boost their biochemical defenses and reduce injury , " says NCAR scientist Thomas Karl , who led the study .
" Our measurements show that significant amounts of the chemical can be detected in the atmosphere as plants respond to drought , unseasonable temperatures , or other stresses . "
For years , scientists have known that plants in a laboratory may produce methyl salicylate , which is a chemical form of acetylsalicylic acid , or aspirin .
But researchers had never before detected methyl salicylate in an ecosystem or verified that plants emit the chemical in significant quantities into the atmosphere .
The team of scientists reported its findings last week in the journal Biogeoscience .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , NCAR 's sponsor .
" Biosphere - atmosphere interactions are important to the understanding of the Earth system , " said Cliff Jacobs , program director in NSF 's Division of Atmospheric Sciences .
" This fortuitous discovery of methyl salicyclate in quantities not anticipated adds to an already important study . "
Researchers had not previously thought to look for methyl salicylate in a forest , and the NCAR team found the chemical by accident .
They set up specialized instruments last year in a walnut grove near Davis , Calif. , to monitor plant emissions of certain volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) .
These hydrocarbon compounds are important because they can combine with industrial emissions to affect pollution , and they can also influence local climate .
When the NCAR scientists reviewed their measurements , they found to their surprise that the emissions of VOCs included methyl salicylate .
The levels of methyl salicylate emissions increased dramatically when the plants , which were already stressed by a local drought , experienced unseasonably cool nighttime temperatures followed by large daytime temperature increases .
Instruments mounted on towers about 100 feet above the ground measured up to 0.025 milligrams of methyl salicylate rising from each square foot of forest per hour .
Karl and his colleagues speculate that the methyl salicylate has two functions .
One of these is to stimulate plants to begin a process known as systemic acquired resistance , which is analogous to an immune response in an animal .
This helps a plant to both resist and recover from disease .
The methyl salicylate also may be a mechanism whereby a stressed plant communicates to neighboring plants , warning them of the threat .
Researchers in laboratories have demonstrated that a plant may build up its defenses if it is linked in some way to another plant that is emitting the chemical .
Now that the NCAR team has demonstrated that methyl salicylate can build up in the atmosphere above a stressed forest , scientists are speculating that plants may use the chemical to activate an ecosystem - wide immune response .
" These findings show tangible proof that plant - to - plant communication occurs on the ecosystem level , " says NCAR scientist Alex Guenther , a co-author of the study .
" It appears that plants have the ability to communicate through the atmosphere . "
The discovery raises the possibility that farmers , forest managers , and others may eventually be able to start monitoring plants for early signs of a disease , an insect infestation , or other types of stress .
At present , they often do not know if an ecosystem is unhealthy until there are visible indicators , such as dead leaves .
" A chemical signal is a very sensitive way to detect plant stress , and it can be an order of magnitude more effective than using visual inspections , " Karl says .
" If you have a sensitive warning signal that you can measure in the air , you can take action much sooner , such as applying pesticides .
The earlier you detect that something 's going on , the more you can benefit in terms of using less pesticides and managing crops better . "
The discovery also can help scientists resolve a central mystery about VOCs .
For years , atmospheric chemists have speculated that there are more VOCs in the atmosphere than they have been able to find .
Now it appears that some fraction of the missing VOCs may be methyl salicylate and other plant hormones .
This finding can help scientists better track the impact of VOCs on the behavior of clouds and the development of ground - level ozone , an important pollutant .

Ukraine ’s ruling pro-Western coalition has officially collapsed , the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says .
President Viktor Yushchenko has been involved in a long - running dispute with Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko .
The president ’s Our Ukraine bloc left the coalition earlier this month .
Parliament now has 30 days to try to form a new ruling coalition .
If those efforts fail , Mr Yushchenko can dissolve parliament and call a snap election .
The Our Ukraine party pulled out of the coalition on 3 September after the Tymoshenko Bloc sided with the pro-Moscow opposition Party of Regions to pass several laws that Mr Yushchenko saw as a threat to his presidential powers .
“ I officially declare the coalition of democratic forces … in Ukraine ’s parliament dissolved , ” parliament speaker Arseny Yatsenyuk announced on Tuesday .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days , forcing administrators to implement the " digital version of a traffic cop " to handle the overload .
Servers hosting Web sites of the House of Representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days .
" This is unprecedented , " said Jeff Ventura , communications director for the House 's chief administrator .
The tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced Sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $ 700 billion bailout of the country 's financial system .
In making the announcement , legislators said the public could view the agreement at financialservices.house.gov .
" In a short period of time , lots of Web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing , " Ventura told CNN in a phone interview .
As millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan , the House.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying " this page does not appear . "
iReport.com :
Do you support a bailout ?
Ventura compared the situation to the " old days , when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster .
Then everyone calls the same 1-800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal . "
" This was a massive digital busy signal , " he said .
As more people gained access to the page and details of the bailout proposal were published in the news media , constituents then started to e-mail their representatives , Ventura explained .
" We know it 's in the millions , " he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving .
" But we have n't counted yet , because when you 're about to get hit by a tidal wave , you do n't count the drops of water in the wave . "
After the House failed to pass the proposed deal Monday by a vote of 228-205 , the e-mail volume surged again , Ventura said .
" Because there were so many e-mails , it was impacting even the presentation of House.gov , " he explained .
" This morning , our engineers sounded the alarms ... and we have installed a digital version of a traffic cop .
We enacted stopgaps that we planned for last night .
We had hoped we did n't have to . "
The office of the chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives issued a statement Tuesday saying : " This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional Web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system .
Engineers are working diligently to accommodate this enormous traffic flow and we appreciate your patience in this matter . "
Now , when House.gov or individual members ' sites begin to get overloaded , a message will come up on the computer screen saying , in effect , " try back later , " Ventura said .
" This really tells us that the level of constituent engagement on this issue is extremely high , " he added .
He said after the failed vote Monday and the initial backlash , the House 's Web site administrators thought there would be a drop in Web traffic -- especially with the Rosh Hashanah holiday .
" We monitored the situation all night long , and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday , " Ventura said .
He predicted that traffic on those Web sites " would start to subside once there 's some guidance on the marketplace and political landscape about what comes next . "
Ventura said the House.gov
Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks against the United States , but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days .

It is n't clear to me exactly what the tension is .
It will , no doubt , depend on the religion in question .
Some religions do not hold that the non-believer will be punished or that there is a special religious basis for morality .
In my experience , many who do believe that the non-believer will go to hell make an effort to " save " souls ; those who do n't may be shy or preoccupied with other things .
Being uninterested in converting others is not the same as being opposed to it ( though more on this below ) .
On the broader issue of morality , I 'm not sure why the religious person is in a position any different from any moral person .
If believe that eating meat is morally wrong ( for whatever reason ) , should I try to convince others to become vegetarian ?
Well , one 's answer will depend on the broader moral theory one subscribes to .
If I 'm a utilitarian , I 'll have to determine whether trying to convince others to be vegetarian will have the best consequences ; maybe I 'm terrible at such efforts and could better spend my time in other morally worthwhile projects .
If I believe that eating meat is wrong because God says so , and my view of morality is that one ought to do what God says , then whether I should try to convince others to be vegetarian will depend on whether God tells me to .
There 's no inconsistency in believing that God says that I should be vegetarian and also says that I should not attempt to convert others to vegetarianism ( maybe God wants this job for him / herself ) .
But maybe you are wondering how the belief that an action is wrong is compatible with tolerating someone 's performing the action .
Toleration is a complicated and difficult concept .
But it might help to start with the thought that tolerating or not tolerating something is itself an action .
Some moral views have strong principles of non-interference , so there may be difficult trade - offs when such a principle comes into conflict with another substantive principle .
Usually talking or reasoning with others is not considered interference , so there 's plenty of room to try to talk people out of doing wrong .
But in the spiritual domain there is sometimes the idea that we must each walk our own spiritual path and do our own spiritual work .
So this vague idea may be behind some hesitation within religious contexts to put any pressure on others to conform on matters of faith .
This also raises questions about the nature of faith and the differences between faith and reason ( how does conversion really happen ? ) .
You either love them or hate them .

The £ 3,000 ' txt - spk ' poster that ' undermines English teaching '
It sometimes seems as if the youngsters of today speak another language .
And in a controversial new poster campaign it appears that many local education authorities agree , resorting to communicating with children in ‘ text speak ’ .
Nearly 5,000 posters have been put up in schools , written in a mind - boggling array of numbers and unlikely combinations of letters , in an attempt to connect with children who are more comfortable writing and reading in the abbreviated language used in mobile phone text messages than formal English .
Cn u hr me nw ?
The Top Tips for Pupils that aims to make the safety message clear for students
Entitled ‘ Top Tips for Pupils : Safe surfing at home and at school ’ , the posters are on display in corridors and classrooms of more than 2,000 secondary schools in London .
One of the nine tips on the poster , which uses the letters XXX to denote an adult , says : ‘ nvr agree 2 mEt an on9 pal IRL w/o chekin W a responsible XXX . ’
That means : ‘ Never agree to meet an online friend in real life without checking with a responsible adult . ’
Another reads : ‘u av d ryt 2 feel safe ll d tym , includN wen UzN ICT or yr mob ph . ’
That translates as : ‘ You have the right to feel safe all the time , including when using information communications technology or your mobile phone . ’
The campaign , aimed at making children more aware of the risks while on the internet and in using their mobile phones , has dismayed educational traditionalists .
But bosses at London Grid for Learning ( LGfL ) , the local authority - funded organisation behind the posters , believe text language is the best way to get through to children today .
Brian Durrant , the organisation ’s chief executive , said : ‘ We think it would raise their interest by using “ textese ” .
It does take some translating , but we want to connect with the pupils .
‘ We want them to be aware of the risks when using their mobile and computers .
It has been warmly received - I see the posters on show whenever I visit schools . ’
The poster aims to help students act safe when using the Internet - but it has been criticised for ignoring plain - speaking English in favour of ' txt- spk '
But the campaign has been criticised by those campaigning for higher standards in education .
Nick Seaton , from the Campaign for Real Education , said : ‘ This is a complete waste of money .
Posters that go up in schools should be written in standard English and encourage children to read and write standard English .
‘ To use text language is to pass on entirely the wrong message and encourage lower standards .
The people behind this really should have known better . ’
An English teacher in a West London school added : ‘ These posters go up on the corridors of the English department , as well as everywhere else , and it undermines everything that we do . ’
The posters , which cost nearly £ 3,000 of taxpayers ’ money to produce , were published by the LGfL along with 5,000 further posters written in standard English and 5,000 posters with tips for teachers .
It is just the latest development in the growing influence of text language in education .
In Scotland , text messaging , social networking websites and blogs will be studied alongside books , plays and poetry in schools in future under new curriculum guidelines that were published earlier this year .
The idea is to use modern methods of communication to engage children and prepare them with the skills necessary for the workplace .

( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc's AIG.N former Chief Executive Robert Willumstad has rejected a $ 22 million severance payment , the Wall Street Journal reported , citing a person familiar with the decision .
Willumstad e-mailed his successor , Edward Liddy , of his decision to forego the severance since he was not able to execute the restructuring plan he had developed , the paper said .
The newspaper also reported major shareholders concerned about the government takeover were planning to meet on Monday to discuss alternatives to the federal bailout , citing a person familiar with the matter .
AIG and Robert Willumstad could not be immediately reached for comment .
THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND ….
We talked earlier about Wisconsin nurse Debra Bartoshevich , a former Clinton delegate who is now appearing in McCain campaign ads .
It ’s hard not to wonder what on earth she ’s thinking .
This afternoon , however , we actually got a better sense of the answer .
At a Denver press conference this afternoon organized by Republicans , Bartoschevich , who claims to be a pro-choice Democrat , was asked about her concerns about reproductive rights under another pro-life Republican president .
“ Going back to 1999 , John McCain did an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle saying that overturning Roe v.
Wade would not make any sense , because then women would have to have illegal abortions , ” Bartoschevich said .
This is surprisingly helpful .
I ’ve wondered why a pro-choice Democrat who cares about women ’s rights would even consider a conservative Republican with an abysmal record on women ’s rights .
It turns out , the answer is pretty straightforward : she ’s terribly confused .
McCain did , in fact , say in 1999 , that he “ would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade . ”
It was a reversal from his previous position , and soon after , McCain reversed right back , denounced Roe , vowed to overturn it , and assured voters he would lead an exclusively pro-life administration , arguably slightly to the right of Bush / Cheney .
Indeed , Sarah Blustain had a great item in The New Republic recently , explaining just how serious a “ zealot ” McCain is on the issue of reproductive rights .
During his political career , McCain has participated in 130 reproductive health - related votes on Capitol Hill ; of these , he voted with the anti-abortion camp in 125 .
McCain has consistently backed rights for the unborn , voting to cover fetuses under the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program and supporting the Unborn Victims of Violence Act , which allowed a “ child in utero ” to be recognized as a legal victim of a crime .
He has voted in favor of the global gag rule , which prevents U.S. funds from going to international family - planning clinics that use their own money to perform abortions , offer information about abortion , or take a pro-choice stand .
There ’s a reason McCain has a zero rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America .
The 1999 quote was just a cheap ploy , intended to make McCain appear reasonable .
He ’s not — when it comes to women ’s rights , he ’s nothing short of a nightmare .
Last week , Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick had an excellent item , explaining that a key component of McCain ’s campaign strategy is fooling women into thinking he ’s not a staunch opponent of reproductive rights .
Lithwick argued if McCain can “ keep [ voters ] in the dark , ” he might “ snooker voters into thinking that his abortion views are centrist , ” when that ’s obviously not the case .
As of this afternoon , the scheme appears to actually have fooled a couple of Democrats , who regrettably do n’t know better .
But here ’s a fun little test , to see who ’s right .
Ask the McCain campaign if Bartoschevich was accurately describing John McCain ’s current position on abortion rights .
It ’s a straightforward proposition : she said McCain believes “ overturning Roe v. Wade would not make any sense . ”
Does McCain and his team agree with this assessment ?
Or is Bartoschevich & Co. under a false impression ?
We ’re waiting .
The stakes in this year 's presidential campaign are high .
But that 's nothing new .
There have been many other pivotal presidential elections in our history , some that set an entirely new course for the United States and a few that were crucial to the very survival of the republic .
To put the current campaign in perspective , U.S. News White House correspondent Kenneth T. Walsh , author of four books on the presidency , examines the 10 most consequential elections in American history — the races that produced the biggest change and had the most lasting impact .
An installment of this 10 - part series will run on the U.S. News website each Wednesday through September .
This is the second in the series .
On April 12 , 1861 , about five weeks after Abraham Lincoln 's inauguration for his first term , Southern forces began bombarding Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor , starting the Civil War .
On April 13 , the Union forces surrendered , prompting jubilation in the new Confederacy and anger and disappointment in the North .
The election of Lincoln , an antislavery moderate , had been the last straw for pro-slavery leaders .
His victory ended any hope they had of compromise because they were convinced that , with Lincoln in command , the North would trample the rights of the Southern states and move to end slavery .
They began to secede from the Union and form a Confederacy of their own .
Many in the North thought the war would end quickly , but they did n't properly assess the military strength and the will of their adversaries , the quality of the Confederate forces ' leadership , and the difficulty of invading and pacifying the Southern states .
As a result , the war went very badly for the Union at first , and Lincoln 's popularity in the North plummeted .
He was derided as a despot , a dictator , an incompetent , and worse .
At the same time , he was blamed for the many failures on the battlefield and for the horrendous casualties , posted day after day in town after town across the land .
He changed generals when they lost big battles or when they did n't follow up on their limited successes , but for the early years the conflict seemed hopeless .
Meanwhile , Lincoln worked tirelessly to keep the Republican Party behind him and to minimize antiwar sentiment in the North .
Many historians say he handled a very bad situation as well as anyone could have .
" If there is a common denominator in presidential assessments , it is a bias toward activism , unless the activism is viewed as misplaced , as in the instances of Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam , and Nixon and Watergate , " says Princeton 's Fred Greenstein .
Lincoln made his share of mistakes , such as choosing a succession of inept commanders , but he acted decisively and wisely when it counted most .
One of his biggest decisions — now considered a huge advance in American justice — was issuing the Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22 , 1862 , which ordered freedom for slaves in the rebellious states .
This was considered a half measure by some abolitionists because it failed to free slaves in all the states .
But it set the Union on the path to ending slavery eventually .
It also had the effect of shoring up support for the Union in Europe , especially in the United Kingdom , which had been flirting with the Confederacy .
The proclamation cost the South some important potential allies because many European leaders did n't want to back the slaveholding Confederacy and abandon the antislavery North .
Then , in 1863 , the military tide turned — and the North 's military success became the most important political development of the 1864 presidential campaign .
Union forces won at Gettysburg and Vicksburg , and Lincoln 's stock began to rise .
In 1864 , there were more Union successes , including those at Atlanta and Mobile Bay , and Lincoln got much of the credit .
With the war now seemingly on a positive track , he easily won a second term .
He received 2.3 million votes to former Union Gen. George McClellan 's 1.8 million .
Even though McClellan had been Lincoln 's senior commander , the former general sought an early end to the war , which was a popular position for most of the campaign .
But the North 's newfound military success undercut his arguments that it was time to sue for peace .
Perhaps most gratifying to Lincoln , the soldiers doing the fighting gave Lincoln a huge margin , 116,887 votes to McClellan 's 33,748 , even though they knew that re-electing Lincoln would mean continuation of the conflict and the likelihood that many of them would be killed or wounded .
But they also knew that re-electing Lincoln would virtually guarantee victory , complete with the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union , and these were their top priorities .
On March 4 , 1865 — in his second inaugural address — Lincoln gave one of the most eloquent and stirring speeches in history .
" With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right , " he said , " let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . "
The following month , five days after Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his Confederate forces at Appomattox , Lincoln was shot by an assassin .
He died the next morning , on April 15 , 1865 .
In the end , Lincoln 's profound legacy was created and propelled by two elections — the one in 1860 , which triggered the war , and the election of 1864 , which enabled Lincoln to win it .
Historian Henry Adams once wrote that a president " resembles the commander of a ship at sea .
He must have a helm to grasp , a course to steer , a port to seek . "
Lincoln understood this to his core .
Added historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. : " The Constitution offers every president a helm , but the course and the port constitute the first requirement for presidential greatness .
Great presidents possess , or are possessed by , a vision of an ideal America .
Their passion is to make sure the ship of state sails on the right course . "
Defining that vision and setting that course are what Lincoln 's presidency was all about .
Things are supposed to be looking rosy for Democrats this November .
But in case Barack Obama loses the Presidency , an excuse is all ready to go : America 's too racist to elect a black man .
Not even , in his Vice Presidential pick Joe Biden 's inimitable description , one so " articulate and bright and clean . "
This narrative has gained traction with the Democratic Presidential candidate 's recent setbacks in the polls .
We hear it from the convention crowd in Denver and liberals in the press .
The older , poorer , white , often Hillary ...

Foreign policy is an open issue among libertarians .
Some of us are isolationists .
Others are pacifists .
Others take a more belligerent line .
I am an isolationist .
Though I incline to anarchist , I accept that for the moment , the world is ruled by various states , and that there will always be disputes between states , some leading to war .
This being so , I believe that the best way to minimise the threat of war is to have our own state keep out of any dispute that does not immediately concern the integrity of its own territory .
I am a citizen of a country that was a principal actor in the two big wars of the twentieth century .
I believe that these wars were unnecessary for the security of my country and killed unimaginable numbers of people .
They also destroyed British primacy in the world and were the means of transforming Britain from genuine liberal democracy to politically correct corporatism .
That is why I was so opposed to our role in the wars of the past decade in the Balkans , in Iraq and in Afghanistan .
And that is why I am now opposed to any intervention in the war between Russia and Georgia .
I am told that Russia is an aggressive power that must be resisted in the Caucasus before it is able to threaten other places .
The newspapers are filled with the usual talk of Munich and appeasement , together with claims that a new Cold War is beginning .
I deny this .
Russia may be an aggressor in this war .
Or it may not be .
I will not enter into the details of who moved first , or with what provocation .
But , even assuming that Russia is the aggressor , I fail to see what business this war is of the British or American Governments .
The implied deal at the end of the 1980s was that the Soviet Union would evacuate its European colonies , in return for which Russian security would be respected .
Every former republic of the Soviet Union , with the exception of the Baltic States , were to be regarded as part of the Russian sphere of interest .
That included the Ukraine and Georgia .
It was unwise to recruit the former East European colonies of the Soviet Empire into NATO , and to move Western armed forces right up to the old Soviet border .
But that was something the Russians at the time were in no position to resist , and that they might , given intelligent diplomacy , be brought to accept was no threat to them .
Now that Russia is again a first - class power , it would be madness to intervene in what used to be a core part of the Soviet Union .
Yes  Russia is again a first - class power .
This may be founded on the high price of oil and gas .
The demographic trends in Russia may point to a longer - term weakness .
But Russia will for perhaps the next decade be again a first - class power .
This is no threat to the west .
I was against fighting the Cold War .
But it was then arguable that the Soviet Union was a danger to the west .
What we had then was the largest country in the world , with the largest armed forces , both at the disposal of a murderous and expansionist ideology with intellectual sympathisers in every country in the world .
First class or otherwise , Russia today is a normal power .
It is no longer interested in conquering France and Australia and Argentina .
The present ruling class in Russia legitimises itself and its efforts in terms of Russian nationalism and Orthodox Christianity .
This makes Russia a danger to some of its immediate neighbours , but not to us .
It is rightly annoying to the British Government that Mr Putin seems willing to have his political enemies murdered in London .
In the longer term , indeed , Russia is at least a potential ally of the West , if not part of the West .
If there is to be a contest in this century  and I hope there will not be  between the West and Islam , or the West and China , Russia must reasonably be counted as on our side .
With two lost wars in the Islamic world , and growing American impotence in East Asia , now is not the time to antagonise Russia .
I have , in the past day , read statements by David Milliband , the British foreign Secretary , and by the Conservative leader , David Cameron , that strike me as almost childish in their failure to understand the realities of international politics .
There is nothing we should do to help the Georgians .
There is nothing we can do .
Russia is not an enemy of Britain .
Sadly , London , just like Washington , has been captured by the neoconservatives .
These are not conservatives , new or old .
They are simply warmongers .
They have misread the history of the twentieth century .
For them , national greatness is measured by military power .
They are allied to business and other interests that benefit from war .
They had a fine time during the Cold War .
They were disappointed when this abruptly ended .
They have since then been lying us into smaller wars all over the world .
They want a permanent war with Islam .
They look forward to a cold war with China .
Of course , now that Vladimir Putin is in charge of Russia , they are in love with the idea that the original Cold War never really ended , and that the warm certainties of their youth can now be revived .
What passes in the Conservative Party for thinking about foreign policy is dominated by these people .
I remember one Conservative politician who , in 1995 , assured a closed meeting that the Soviet evacuation of Eastern Europe was a fraud , and that Russian tanks were ready to rumble westward at the press of a button in Moscow .
I was urged at the time not to hold the clown up for the ridicule he deserved .
I wish I had not listened .
The man is still important , and is a standing reminder that the Conservatives are at least as great a menace to world peace as New Labour .
I could say more .
But I think I have said enough .
I hope the Russians and Georgians will come to terms before too many more people are killed .
In the meantime , I am resolutely opposed to any intervention of any kind in the dispute by the British Government .
And , since Britain is regrettably for the moment part of the American Empire , I oppose involvement by the Americans .

MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- Mercedes Gorden remembers August 1 , 2007 , like it was yesterday .
Mercedes Gorden was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge when it suddenly collapsed .
" I remember everything .
I remember it being sunny and hot .
I had my window down , " Gorden said .
" The next thing I knew , the concrete started to wave in front of me . "
It was a normal day .
Or so she thought .
She was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge that spans the Mississippi River when it started to buckle and collapse during the evening rush - hour traffic .
" The bridge pulled apart in front of me ... and I went sliding , " Gorden said .
Without warning , cars careened into the Mississippi River below and Gorden 's Ford Escort plummeted about 60 feet down into the river bank .
" I said I will not die on that bridge .
I am not going to die today , " Gorden , 31 , said .
" This is not the way I am going to go . "
She was trapped for more than an hour and rescue workers had to cut her out of the car .
All of the bones in her legs were shattered and her spine was fractured .
Nine surgeries and countless hours of physical therapy later , she knows it could have been worse .
Thirteen people died that day and 100 others were injured .
One year after the tragedy , many Minnesotans and commuters around the country wonder if their bridges and highways are safe .
Watch : Are U.S. roads and bridges safe ? »
The answer is : Maybe .
Across the United States , there are about 600,000 bridges .
The Federal Highway Administration reported in 2006 that one quarter of the nation 's bridges were at risk .
The American Society for Civil Engineers said in 2006 that it would cost nearly $ 10 billion every year for the next two decades to fix them .
But the funds used to repair and maintain the country 's bridges and highways are drying up .
Some of the money comes from the Highway Trust Fund , which Americans pay for through taxes on gasoline .
Faced with higher gas prices , more commuters are carpooling , taking mass transit or driving less , about 4 percent less in May alone compared with a year ago .
Interactive : Check troubled bridges in your state »
The federal Department of Transportation predicted taxes will fall far short of what 's needed for improvement projects -- leaving many projects delayed or even canceled .
Ryan Toohey , a lead strategist with America Moving Forward , a group that lobbies for private investment to fix the nation 's infrastructure problems , said nearly every state is facing a budget crisis and does n't have the money to solve problems .
" When I hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient , that scares me and I think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very , very important and should be a welcome trend in the United States , " Toohey said .
The Bush administration projected that at some point in the next fiscal year , after October 1 , 2008 , the highway account will hit zero , down from $ 8 billion at the start of the fiscal year .
Payments for repairs can't be made if the money is n't there .
U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said , " Without a doubt , our federal approach to transportation is broken " and " it is time for a new , a different and a better approach . "
Peters said one short - term solution may be for the Highway Trust Fund to borrow from the Mass Transit Fund .
But she said it would n't be easy to get congressional approval .
The House has passed a resolution to inject $ 8 billion into the Trust Fund , but even if the Senate passed it , President Bush has threatened to veto the measure .
Some states , such as Minnesota , are trying to get creative in raising money for road projects .
" We are looking at mileage - based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel .
We are looking at private sector investments , " said Minnesota 's Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel .
The Minnesota legislature has passed a package of tax increases to raise $ 6.6 billion to improve the states ' roads and bridges .
Even after the Minneapolis bridge collapse , not all the bridges in the state are structurally safe .
In fact , on July 26 , chunks of concrete weighing about 1,200 pounds fell from an overpass in St. Paul , just a few miles from the Minneapolis scene .
CNN has learned that bridge was rated " structurally deficient " 23 years ago , in 1985 , and the Minnesota Department of Transportation confirmed it was rated " structurally deficient " again in 2007 , just days after the Minneapolis bridge collapsed .
Still , the state said it was safe to drive on .
Nobody was hurt in the St. Paul bridge incident , but critics like Rep. Jim Oberstar , a Democrat from Minnesota , are demanding action .
" You would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses , yet this was one they failed to accurately assess ...
It was like a meteor falling to the ground , " said Oberstar , who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
Sorel said bridges now are supposed to be shut immediately if there is any risk .
His department has inspected 1 in 5 of the more than 20,000 bridges across the state and closed at least six .
The state also said it has spent $ 390 million on repairing and replacing its bridges since 2003 .
Is that enough ?
Not for victims like Gorden , who drives by the site of the collapse every week on her way to physical therapy .
She wonders how sales taxes can be found to subsidize a new baseball stadium in Minneapolis -- but not for bridges .
" I say how did we get money for stadiums ?
How did we get money for all these new stadiums we 're building ? "
Gorden said .
" What 's more important : baseball or safe traveling ?
Should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now ? "

University of Alberta
Abstract :
It is shown that the popular puzzle Sokoban can be used to emulate a linear bounded automata ( finite tape Turing Machine ( TM ) ) .
In particular , a construction is given that has a solution if and only if the corresponding Turing Machine on its input halts in the accept state .
Further , if the TM halts and accepts , then the pusher will make moves and pushes , where n is the number of symbols on the input tape , and t(n ) is the number of transitions made by the TM during its computation .
This construction shows that the puzzles are PSPACE - complete , solving the open problem stated in [ 1 ] .

Aversion to Foreign Law
The adamant opposition of some Supreme Court justices to the citation of foreign law in their own opinions also plays a role , some foreign judges say .
“ Most justices of the United States Supreme Court do not cite foreign case law in their judgments , ” Aharon Barak , then the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Israel , wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 2002 .
“ They fail to make use of an important source of inspiration , one that enriches legal thinking , makes law more creative , and strengthens the democratic ties and foundations of different legal systems . ”
Partly as a consequence , Chief Justice Barak wrote , the United States Supreme Court “ is losing the central role it once had among courts in modern democracies . ”
Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia said that his court no longer confined itself to considering English , Canadian and American law .
“ Now we will take information from the Supreme Court of India , or the Court of Appeal of New Zealand , or the Constitutional Court of South Africa , ” he said in an interview published in 2001 in The Green Bag , a legal journal .
“ America ” he added , “ is in danger of becoming something of a legal backwater . ”
The signature innovations of the American legal system  a written Constitution , a Bill of Rights protecting individual freedoms and an independent judiciary with the power to strike down legislation  have been consciously emulated in much of the world .
And American constitutional law has been cited and discussed in countless decisions of courts in Australia , Canada , Germany , India , Israel , Japan , New Zealand , South Africa and elsewhere .
In a 1996 decision striking down a law that made it a crime to possess pornography , for instance , the Constitutional Court of South Africa conducted a broad survey of American First Amendment jurisprudence , citing some 40 decisions of the United States Supreme Court .
That same year , the High Court of Australia followed a 1989 decision of the Supreme Court in a separation - of - powers case , ruling that a judge was permitted to prepare a report for a government minister about threats to aboriginal areas because the assignment did not undermine the integrity of the judicial branch .
Sending American ideas about the rule of law abroad has long been a source of pride .
“ The United States Supreme Court is the oldest constitutional court in the world  the most respected , the most legitimate , ” said Charles Fried , a law professor at Harvard who served as solicitor general in the Reagan administration .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to temporarily ban short - selling , The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday night .
It 's unclear if the commission has approved the move , the Journal reported .
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson were briefing congressional leaders Thursday night .
The U.S. move would follow a similar action by U.K. regulators on Thursday .
I just finished this account of a journalist ’s encounter with a “ lost tribe ” in New Guinea , that is , a group of people who had not encountered Europeans prior to 1993 .
The book is riveting , almost despite itself .
Marriott strikes me as naive , foolish , and often obtuse , but , boy , can he write a story .
He decides to march into a thick , deadly jungle , led by some local guides , in search of some barbaric people who are known to be cannibals in order to ask them how things are going .
He encounters several drunken , disillusioned westerners along the way , who all chastise him for calling the tribe “ lost ” out of some bizarrely misplaced concern for political correctness .
The New Guinea infrastructure appears pretty much nonexistent , certainly once you leave what passes for a city .
If you break an ankle in a New Guinea rainforest , you may as well just lay down and die , or wait for the cannibals to come ; no life flight will be on its way .
( I know , this is an overly snobbish take on my part ; I do n’t deal well with societies in which I cannot find a good martini .
Utah is a even a bit of a stretch for me . )
As Marriott and his guides tramp , slip , and slide their way through the heart of darkness , they come across a little pig , which the guides gleefully strangle , pack up in leaves , and later toss into a fire so that they can break apart its flesh and bones and savor the fat little strips of undercooked meat in their black teeth , grease dripping into their beards .
It ’s that kind of place .
They encounter the lost tribe , and guess what ?
They are destitute and barbaric .
But this is what I found most fascinating of all .
The tribe is only partly accessible , culturally and emotionally .
Meaning : by Marriott ’s account , you ca n’t safely trust any of your assumptions about what people will do or how to interact with them .
It ’s bewildering and disorienting .
In one scene , Marriott is talking with the village men who are psyching themselves up for a hunt ( more little piggies ) , and these guys , who had been somewhat friendly , are now starting to get scary .
They brag about their cannibalistic past and start taking on fierce attitudes .
Marriott starts to back away , and rightly so : there really is no telling what ’s about to happen .
The guys are hovering in a kind of waking dream state , where whims are not likely to be overriden by any rational or emotional commitments .
Indeed , that ’s the whole lost tribe for you — a group of people in a strange , impressionistic swirl of superstitions and quasi - knowledge , fed by raw emotions and desires .
You can see why some people ended up calling such native people “ childlike , ” since children have a similar kind of impetuousness , but this is an impetuousness coupled with very violent adult passions and adapted to a harsh environment .
The first Westerner to encounter these folks gave them a smattering of gifts and appointed one of them as being in charge .
This , despite the fact that there already was a chief .
Marriott now finds the chief totally disoriented and aloof .
He has no sense of his own place , and wanders the village silent and alone .
There is also a strange man living among the tribe and trying to impart Christianity to them .
He ’s self - important and stupid and cruel , though Marriott finds some empathy for him and his bleak situation .
Just before Marriott and his guides are about to leave there is a terrible thunderstorm .
Everyone huddles in the makeshift houses as lightning pounds down around them .
One house is struck , and five women and children are killed .
Marriott and his guides know they had better get out of town fast before the hunters return , since they will surely be blamed for the accident , and certainly killed .
So they flee , but in their escape they encounter the tribe ’s hunting party , led by a man Marriott has befriended , whose wife and children have just been killed .
What do you do ?
Break the news to your friend that his wife and daughters have been fried by lightning ?
No , because if you do he and his buddies will kill you and eat you .
So you lie , congratulate them on their hunt , shake hands , and off you go .
You simply can’t count on reason and heartfelt emotion to carry the day .
Marriott ends up feeling guilty , as if he did indeed bring harm to the tribe .
But that ’s nonsense .
And so far as I can see , there is no “ indictment of colonialism and its lingering legacy of cultural annihilation , ” as the book jacket suggests .
The lost tribe , having had a taste of civilization , wants an airstrip and a hospital and a gold mine to be brought to them .
But , bloody hell , they can all march out of that godforsaken place anytime they want , and make use of what little civilized amenities New Guinea has to offer .
And I ca n’t see that anything beautiful would have been lost : these people are living at the margin of existence , shutting up women into huts and trading them for pigs and watching their children die of malaria .
Nothing noble about the savagery here .
I know : spoken like a true cultural imperialist .
I ca n’t help but feel that some forms of life are better than others , and the one ridden with superstition , malaria , and cannibalism is pretty low in the rankings .

Young teens believe you can't get pregnant standing up and you can reuse a condom if you wash it
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Playground myths — such as you cannot get pregnant standing up or you can reuse a condom if you wash it carefully — form the foundation of teenagers ' knowledge about sex , according to a report published today .
A poll of 500 children aged 11 to 14 revealed the most common misconceptions about sex and relationships that dominate playground chat .
The most popular myths include you cannot get pregnant the first time you have sex , it is unhealthy for a boy with an erection not to have sex and you will lose your virginity if you use tampons .
The survey was commissioned by the Department for Children , Schools and Families as part of its teenage pregnancy strategy and its continuing campaign to reduce conception rates .
Some 44 % of the teenagers questioned said they did not trust the sex advice they received from their friends and 75 % wished they could talk more easily with their parents about sex and growing up , the report - Everyday Conversations , Every Day ( pdf ) - reveals .
Parents are reluctant to talk about sex because they are embarrassed or afraid that discussion will lead children to experiment and become promiscuous , the report says .
However young people are more likely to defer starting a sexual relationship , and to use contraception when they do become active , if their parents are confident in sexual discussions , it says .
Commenting on the report , Gill Frances , spokeswoman for the Teenage Pregnancy Independent Advisory Group , said : " Our campaign is about supporting parents and overcoming the fear of ' the big conversation ' with their children .
" We are learning from parents and teens that having a series of less pressurised conversations throughout the teen years forges better relationships for the long term .
Everyday conversations , every day will help keep the communication channel open . "
The UK still has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe although conception rates are falling .
According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics , the number of young women under the age of 18 in England who fell pregnant in 2006 was 2 % lower than in the previous year and pregnancy rates were 1 % lower for under - 16s .
The ONS figures showed an under - 18 conception rate of 40.6 for each 1000 girls aged between 15 – 17 in 2006 , a drop of 12.9 % since 1998 .
The 2006 conception rate for girls aged between 13 to 15 was 7.7 per 1000 - a fall of 12.6 % since 1998 .
The DCSF spokeswoman said : " This was the biggest drop for five years in conception rates and now puts un at the lowest level for 20 years . "
The DCSF report and the continuing campaign to reduce pregnancy rates in young women comes as the government is reviewing sex and relationship education in schools following concerns expressed by the UK Youth Parliament .
An independent review group made up of young people , parents , sex education experts and teachers and chaired by the schools minister , Jim Knight , is due to publish its findings in the next few weeks , the DCSF confirmed .
A DCSF spokeswoman said : " The review includes representatives from all interested groups , so we will need to look at the recommendations before making a decision . "
Since it 's no longer taboo to point out John McCain 's ridiculous and offensive attempts to use of his experience as a POW as if it 's somehow an excuse for everything from his extramarital affairs to his rule - breaking to his having more pieces of real estate than he can keep track of , and so on , we would be remiss if we did n't point this one out too .
When CNN's Walter Isaacson confronted John McCain about his professed love of the band of ABBA , which of course was a lame attempt to cater to " disaffected Hillary supporters " as his blogger Michael Goldfarb made clear , McCain ( you guessed it ) whipped out the trusty ol ' POW card to explain :
“ What were you thinking ? , ” Isaacson asked him , looking incredulous .
“ If there is anything I am lacking in , I ’ve got to tell you , it is taste in music and art and other great things in life , ” McCain joked .
“ I ’ve got to say that a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time I impacted a surface - to - air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again . ”
But , as Spencer Ackerman was quick to point out :
What ?
McCain was shot down in 1967 .
ABBA began making music in 1972 .
Do n't try this sh** on me , McCain !
Your POW experience has nothing to do with your Partridgey musical taste .
Cue the mockery ...

During her first speech after being named as McCain ’s surprise pick as a running mate , Palin said she had told Congress “ ‘ thanks but no thanks ’ on that bridge to nowhere . ”
In the city Ketchikan , the planned site of the so - called “ Bridge to Nowhere , ” political leaders of both parties said the claim was false and a betrayal of their community , because she had supported the bridge and the earmark for it secured by Alaska ’s Congressional delegation during her run for governor .
The bridge , a span from the city to Gravina Island , home to only a few dozen people , secured a $ 223 million earmark in 2005 .
The pricey designation raised a furor and critics , including McCain , used the bridge as an example of wasteful federal spending on politicians ’ pet projects .
When she was running for governor in 2006 , Palin said she was insulted by the term “ bridge to nowhere , ” according to Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein , a Democrat , and Mike Elerding , a Republican who was Palin ’s campaign coordinator in the southeast Alaska city .
“ People are learning that she pandered to us by saying , I ’m for this ’ … and then when she found it was politically advantageous for her nationally , abruptly she starts using the very term that she said was insulting , ” Weinstein said .
Palin ’s spokeswoman in Alaska was not immediately available to comment .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank are the biggest cheerleaders for a Republican administration sponsored $ 700 billion giveaway .
Both have caved in to administration whims so disgusting that most Republicans will not vote for this bill .
Please consider the New York Times article , Bailout Plan in Hand , House Braces for Tough Vote
The House braced for a difficult vote set for Monday on a $ 700 billion rescue of the financial industry after a weekend of tense negotiations produced a plan that Congressional leaders portrayed as greatly strengthened by new taxpayer safeguards .
The measure still faced stiff resistance from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who portrayed it as a rush to economic judgment and an undeserved aid package for high - flying financiers who chased big profits through reckless investments .
All sides had to surrender something .
The administration had to accept limits on executive pay and tougher oversight ; Democrats had to sacrifice a push to allow bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages ; and Republicans fell short in their effort to require that the federal government insure , rather than buy , the bad debt .
“ This is a major , major change , ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday evening as she declared that negotiations were over and that a House vote was planned for Monday , with Senate action to follow .
It is virtually impossible to know the ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers , but Congressional leaders stressed that it would likely be far less than $ 700 billion .
Because the Treasury will buy assets with the potential to resell them at a higher price , the government might even turn a profit .

Bailout Bill Is A Disgrace
Dear senator / congressional rep
Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank have agreed to the most preposterous taxpaper bailout in history .
It is loaded with toothless provisions that are not worth a plug nickel when it comes to protecting the taxpayer .
Fox Oversees Henhouse
The bill sets up an oversight board , which is directed to “ ensure that the policies implemented ” by Mr. Paulson are proper .
Mr. Paulson is to be one of the five members of the board watching over his own actions .
He is joined by the chairman of the Federal Reserve , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Housing Secretary and the director of the Federal Home Finance Agency .
This is supposed to be an oversight committee ?
New Proposal Cedes Congressional Authority To The Administration
Paulson , or whoever the next Treasury Secretary is , can buy whatever he wants , at whatever price he wants .
Why should Congress give such authority to anyone at any time ?
Note that the next Treasury Secretary is not even a known quantity !
The limit on any bailout should be no more than $ 250 billion flat out with no automatic escalations .
If Congress thinks more money is needed it can vote to provide more money later .
Ceding blank check power to the president and requiring super majorities to override would set a dangerous precedent .
I am appalled that the administration would ask for such power and I am even more appalled that Congress would be willing to structure a bill this way .
No Insurance
Ceding power to the treasury on how to best implement the insurance provision is also a terrible idea .
Congress , not the Treasury should stipulate how insurance should work .
Leaving insurance to the discretion of the Treasury is tantamount to agreeing there should not be insurance .
Broad New Powers For The SEC
A provision of the bill gives the S.E.C. permission to suspend the rule for any individual company if it thinks that is in the public ’s interest .
It is absurd that the SEC should be allowed to wave whatever rules it wants .
We got into trouble in the first place because of poor accounting principles !
No Help For Homeowners
This bill offers no help for homeowners .
All it offers is a provision to " encourage " servicers of the underlying mortgages to take advantage of the Hope for Homeowners Program .
Exactly what use is that ?
Administrative Costs
Where are administrative costs hidden ?
Recoupment mechanism
The recoupment mechanism does nothing except to require the President submit a proposal to offset such costs after five years .
How could this be so poorly worded ?
Why should Congress require the president to submit a bill , any bill ?
Bill Is A Disgrace
This bill is so full of holes and toothless provisions it is a disgrace to suggest it is close to being ready for a vote .
Most importantly , th e bill will not create a single job , nor will it solve the underlying economic problems .
Over 190 major economists agree .
If you vote for this Bailout Bill I will vote against you .
I will do more than that , I will work actively for your opponent , no matter who that person is , doing everything in my power to contribute to your defeat .
If you vote for this bill I will contribute my time , energy and money to your opponent , whoever that may be .
I will talk to my friends , my family and my co-workers and urge them to do the same .
I have already contacted many friends and have asked them to do the same .

Iran maintains that the purposes of its nuclear programme are peaceful
The European Union has approved new sanctions against Iran in protest at its nuclear programme .
The measures target loans to companies trading with Iran and allow for tougher cargo inspections .
Iran rejects claims that it is seeking nuclear weapons , and recently condemned the new sanctions as illegal .
Major powers agreed on Wednesday to consider further separate UN sanctions after Tehran failed to meet a deadline to freeze its nuclear activities .
Deadline missed
The EU sanctions are seen as a strong implementation of the most recent of three UN resolutions imposing curbs Iran after it defied successive Security Council ultimatums to freeze uranium enrichment .
The measures call on member states to exercise " restraint " in committing state - funded financial support for trade with Iran , including the granting of export credits .
They also allow EU countries to inspect planes and ships travelling to and from Iran to check they are not carrying contraband goods .
Earlier this week Iran missed a deadline to reply to an offer of incentives to end its uranium enrichment programme .
France , the US and UK are pushing for new sanctions , but Russia says there is potential for more dialogue .
The fact Iran is enriching uranium has led Western powers to fear it is seeking to develop an atomic bomb .
Tehran denies there is any intention beyond peaceful energy production .
Russia , Georgia , and McCain ’s reckless belligerence
With the conflict between Russia and Georgia moving “ toward full - scale war , ” even those of us who follow the news closely might pause and think , “ Now , what ’s that conflict about again ? ”
The NYT ’s James Traub wrote a very helpful piece today offering plenty of background and history to explain the context for the violence , and why the parties have been moving towards this war in the North Caucasus for quite some time .
But given the U.S. presidential race , and the fact that this is a political site , I ’d also note the significance of Barack Obama ’s and John McCain ’s reactions to the conflict , which actually tell us quite a bit about their respective approaches to foreign policy .
Ben Smith published a solid report on this last night .
While Obama offered a response largely in line with statements issued by democratically elected world leaders , including President Bush , first calling on both sides to negotiate , John McCain took a remarkably — and uniquely — more aggressive stance , siding clearly with Georgia ’s pro-Western leaders and placing the blame for the conflict entirely on Russia .
The abrupt crisis in an obscure hotspot had the features of the real foreign policy situations presidents face — not the clean hypotheticals of candidates ’ white papers and debating points ….
Both American candidates back Georgia ’s sovereignty and its turn toward the West .
But their first statements on the crisis revealed differences of substance and style .
Obama , calling for restraint and condemning the “ outbreak of violence , ” also criticized Russia for having “ invaded Georgia ’s sovereign ” and having “ encroached on Georgia ’s sovereignty . ”
Obama ’s line was largely consistent with that of the Bush White House , the European Union , NATO , and a series of European powers .
John McCain took a different line , which , as Smith noted , “ put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush ’s first term . ”
A McCain adviser suggested that Obama ’s statement constituted appeasement ….
McCain ’s statement was longer , more detailed and more confrontational .
“ [ T ] he news reports indicate that Russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia .
Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory .
“ The government of Georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on South Ossetia with international mediators .
The U.S. should immediately work with the EU and the OSCE to put diplomatic pressure on Russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen . ”
John McCain ’s top foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , defended McCain ’s direct criticism of Russia in the early hours of the crisis .
“ Sen. McCain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here , ” he said , dismissing the notion that Georgia ’s move into its renegade province had precipitated the crisis .
“ I do n’t think you can excuse , defend , explain or make allowance for Russian behavior because of what is going on in Georgia . ”
That Scheunemann just so happens to have been a well - paid lobbyist for the Georgian government might , just might , raise questions about a potential conflict here .
Mark Brzezinski , a former Clinton White House official and an informal adviser to Obama , added , “ McCain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side , without a pragmatic assessment of the situation .
It ’s both sides ’ fault — both have been somewhat provocative with each other . ”
Wait , would - be presidents should appreciate nuance when dealing with an international crisis ?
Credible candidates should be able to recognize gray areas in complex parts of Eastern Europe ?
Thoughtful would - be leaders need not to rush to view the world as a series of good guys and bad guys ?
Ya do n’t say .
Let ’s be clear : if McCain the Candidate is a reliable indicator of what we can expect from McCain the President , the presumptive Republican nominee would apparently be anxious to exacerbate the burgeoning war , and antagonize Russia .
There ’s a lot going on right now , but this is a very important development in the presidential campaign .
Ben Smith characterized this as a “ true ‘ 3 a.m. moment ' ” for the presidential candidates .
And at this point , McCain is once again looking pretty scary .
By William Horsley
European affairs analyst
Western leaders face two fronts in their stand - off with Russia over its use of force to re-draw borders in Europe : one is the Russian army on the ground .
The other is a propaganda war .
Russia 's defence of its intervention has not always been convincing
So far , the West has failed to spell out a common response , to get Russia to end its occupation of large parts of Georgia and undo its recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Meanwhile , Russia has unleashed a propaganda barrage against an " aggressive " Nato alliance , drawing sharp ripostes from western leaders .
President Dmitry Medvedev , who came to office with overtures to the West , now warns of a " crushing response " to any other country that threatens the lives or dignity of Russian nationals .
He is " not afraid of a new Cold War " , he adds .
Inconsistencies
This war of words is not just a diversionary tactic .
The statements of Russian leaders reveal an underlying strategy which suggests that the West is right to see dangers ahead from the actions of a belligerent Russia .
This catalogue of feints and deceptions has hardened international opinion towards Russia
But those same statements also show glaring inconsistencies which belie Russia 's apparently strong hand .
The Russians ' strongest argument in defence of its armed intervention is that blame for the outbreak of a shooting war is shared .
Most observers agree it is , and that Georgia 's President Mikheil Saakashvili acted rashly or wrongly in ordering his army to bombard and take the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali .
He was wrong , too , to speak of Russia " exterminating " his nation .
But in many other ways , Russia 's defence of its armed intervention has been found wanting or false .
Russia 's official charges of " genocide " by Georgian forces against the South Ossetians were quickly discredited by Human Rights Watch .
Broken promises Moscow's South Ossetian allies still claim that nearly 1,700 people died in the Georgian assault but evidence has yet to be produced .
Moscow 's repeated promises to withdraw its forces as prescribed in the French - brokered ceasefire plan have been broken in many parts of Georgia .
Meeting Russia 's ' Number One ' Testing for a new ' Cold War ' Miliband warns over Russia crisis
That is what prompted the European Union and Nato to accuse Moscow of breaking international law , and breaking its word .
Mr Medvedev argued that Russia had been forced to use force to protect its own nationals in South Ossetia .
But Russia has deliberately engineered that situation by handing out Russian passports to large numbers of local inhabitants .
Sweden 's normally soft - spoken Foreign Minister Carl Bildt retorted that Russia 's resort to that argument echoed that of Hitler in annexing pre-World War Two Czechoslovakia .
Finally , Russia 's claim that its motive in Georgia was purely humanitarian was exploded by this week 's decision to recognise the independence of the two breakaway regions .
This catalogue of feints and deceptions has hardened international opinion towards Russia to the point where the West is undertaking an overall review of ties with Moscow - something scarcely imaginable only a month ago .
The acute international alarm regarding Russia stems from the offensive part of its concerted campaign to send messages of varying degrees of threat to other countries .
Strategic target Dmitry Medvedev 's hint that Russia might feel justified to intervene on behalf even of Russians living in other states brought a defiant show of solidarity from the leaders of Ukraine , Poland and the three Baltic states as well as Georgia .
The fall - out from the Georgia conflict may prove disastrous for Russia A senior Russian commander explicitly threatened Poland - saying it made itself " 100 % " into a Russian strategic target - after the Poles signed an agreement with the US to station American troops and missile defence shield interceptors on its soil .
Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin castigated the western media for what he called their consistently anti-Russian reporting of the Georgia conflict .
But in Europe 's free and diverse media Russia 's side of the story is regularly reported in detail , and views critical of the US over Iraq and Kosovo are commonplace .
In Russia , by contrast , the most influential medium of TV is heavily slanted to favour the Kremlin 's line .
Catastrophic Russia 's plea for understanding is undermined by its various punitive actions over recent years against nearly all of its neighbours to its west , from cutting the flow of gas to Ukraine to alleged cyber - attacks against Estonia .
Russia does indeed have friends in the West who are inclined to take a lenient stance now - Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for one , who once put himself forward as Vladimir Putin's " defence lawyer " .
But the real international fallout from Georgia is proving little short of catastrophic for Russia .
By its actions it has put at risk its privileged position within the G8 , and earned the clear condemnation of Europe 's two major international institutions devoted to building democracy and peace - the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
A way out for Russia lies in the precise pledge made by Mr Medvedev when he became president of Russia only three months ago - that he would strive to make Russia a nation that truly respects the rule of law and international norms .
Otherwise Russia could be undone by its own myths , and be isolated in the new Cold War that its leaders still say they do not seek .

What are these ?
Fierce individualists , Americans figure that we choose our own political beliefs , but actually it could come down to biology .
Individuals who are more easily startled by threats are more likely than others to support protective policies , such as military spending , the Iraq War and the death penalty , finds a new study .
Researchers over the years have put forth several factors to explain a person 's political beliefs , including religion , culture , genetics and everyday experiences .
While the new study involved a relatively small number of participants and does n't topple any of these ideas , it adds physiology as another driver of political leanings .
It suggests , at least for those with strong political views , that some people are somehow built differently than others , either through genetics or life experiences or both .
Stress and politics
The study involved 46 Nebraska residents , chosen for having strong political beliefs from a larger population of randomly selected individuals .
The participants answered survey questions on political beliefs , personality traits and demographics .
A couple of months later , the same participants underwent tests for their so - called startle reflexes .
The researchers measured levels of skin moisture as indicators of stress and anxiety for each participant as he or she looked at threatening images , including a large spider on the face of a frightened person , a dazed individual with a bloody face , and an open wound with maggots in it .
Similarly , participants also viewed three non-threatening images ( a bunny , a bowl of fruit and a happy child ) placed within a series of other images .
The researchers also measured the intensity of the participants ' eye blinks in response to sudden , jarring noises .
Harder blinks are linked with a heightened state of fear , the researchers say .
Participants who scored high on the skin and blinking stress tests also tended to support military spending , warrantless searches , death penalty , the Patriot Act , obedience , patriotism , the Iraq War , school prayer and the concept of Biblical truth .
And they tended to oppose pacifism , immigration , gun control , foreign aid , compromise , premarital sex , gay marriage , abortion rights and pornography .
Those who were less startled by threatening images and noises were more likely to favor foreign aid , liberal immigration policies , pacifism and gun control .
The researchers found no significant differences in the stress tests of participants when viewing the non-threatening images .
They also did n't find any real difference between men and women regarding their jumpy responses , though females did tend to be a little less supportive of defense spending and more supportive of pacifism , said researcher John Hibbing , a political scientist at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln .
Unyielding political beliefs
The results , if supported by further research could have implications for the everyday hair - pulling discussions about politics , Hibbing said .
Often , he said , individuals with strong , opposing views will become frazzled over why the other person can't " see the light . "
" But if I realize that maybe you do experience the world somewhat differently than I do and you see threats where I do n't or vice versa and you just feel it differently , that might increase our tolerance a little better , " Hibbing told LiveScience .
He added , " It might make it a little easier to appreciate why political disputes are so difficult to get around .
They 're almost ubiquitous . "
The results might also help to explain the seemingly unyielding beliefs of some individuals with strong political views .
" There are a lot of people with strong political beliefs and they just wo n't change .
They build the world around their existing beliefs , " Hibbing said .
" And we 're trying to figure out where those existing beliefs came from . "
The research , which will be detailed in the Sept. 19 issue of the journal Science , was financially supported by the National Science Foundation , ManTech Corporation , and University of Nebraska - Lincoln .
Last month , I posted some nice maps showing when and where good wind resources are found in the US .
Now I 've found something better : a visual comparison of electrical load with wind farm production [ pdf file ] , published by the Western Area Power Administration in 2006 .
The study compared electricity production from five wind farms in Northern Colorado , Southwestern Nebraska , and Central Wyoming in 2004 , 2005 , and the start of 2006 , compared with electricity consumption in the same area over the same time period .
The following is a guest post by Tom Konrad , PhD .
Tom is an investment blogger who brings readers ideas for investments that may benefit from Peak Oil and Climate Change at AltEnergyStocks.com , where this article is cross published .
Comparison of Wind Production to Electricity Demand
I 've copied four of the most representative graphs below .
The first and third heat graphs below show electricity production at the five wind farms studied in 2004 and 2005 , respectively .
The second and fourth show electricity demand in the surrounding territory .
Red( blue ) denotes areas of high ( low ) production or demand .
For wind advocates , these are probably rather scary graphs .
The first thing you probably noticed was the big blue patches of wind production during summer peak demand , roughly 10 am to 10 pm in June , July , and August .
This is why wind is referred to as an " energy resource " not a " capacity resource . "
Right when demand is often highest , the wind is least likely to be blowing , namely hot summer afternoons .
On Second Thought - How Much Backup Do You Need ?
That is just the first impression , and while it is a true impression , it 's also an oversimplification .
If you look at the scale , you will notice that the blues on the wind production graphs actually represent wind generating at 10 % to 15 % of nameplate capacity .
If you factor in the fact that a normal capacity factor for wind is about 25 - 40 % , that means that even on these hot summer afternoons , the farms are generating at one - third to one - half of their " normal " output .
This means that , contrary to popular misconception , wind does not require a " 100 % back - up with natural gas . "
It is true that wind is less reliable than baseload power plants such as coal and nuclear , which typically run about 90 % of the time , but in an apples - to - apples comparison , a 100 MW coal or nuclear plant will produce as much energy over the course of a year as a 270 MW wind farm .
During the peak summer months , the coal plant will need some backup power in case of an unscheduled shut down due to lack available coal ( this happened in Colorado in 2005 due to problems with dust in rail tracks ) or lack of available cooling water during a heatwave , and when a coal or nuclear plant goes down , it goes all the way down , so the 100 MW baseload plant has a small chance of needing 90 MW of backup to produce at its " normal " rate of power production .
On the other hand , the wind farm will be operating at ( a conservative ) third of its " normal " capacity , producing about 30 MW .
To bring that up to its normal capacity for the year , it will need 60 MW of back - up power .
In other words , because some part of a large distributed group of wind farms is always producing some power , it will never go completely down .
A large baseload power plant , on the other hand , is completely down about 10 % of the time ( although less during peak summer months , because utilities schedule maintenance in off seasons . )
Pick Farms to Match Your Load
Another point worth noting , is that the wind has different annual patterns in different locations .
The smallest ( 8.4 MW out of 139 MW ) of the five farms in the study was " Wind Farm B " in central Wyoming .
If you look at the following two heat maps below for 2004 and 2005 , which show the production of just this wind farm , you will note that during the peak summer demand , this farm was producing at over 50 % of " normal " capacity for much of the summer peak .
Since we know what electricity demand looks like , if we plan new wind farms ( and adequate transmission ) , we can choose to build wind farms that produce more power when we most need it .
If all the farms in the example in the last section had more favorable production patterns like Farm B , even less back - up generation would be needed to bring them up to " normal " capacity .
For instance , in the Texas Competitive Renewable Energy Zones study [ .pdf 7.64MB ] wind in the coastal area ( along Texas 's southern gulf coast ) was found to be a much better match for the ERCOT load shape than wind in other areas , although the average capacity factor was considerably lower than panhandle wind .
See chart below :
Hence , careful selection of wind farms can lead to wind production with higher capacity during peak loads , and correspondingly less need for dispactchable power .
Although Texas is currently focusing on developing wind farms in West Texas and the Panhandle because of their high capacity factors and correspondingly high annual energy output , the power from coastal wind farms is likely to become increasingly valuable as wind reaches higher penetration .
It 's Not All About Summer Peak
Statements about wind 's need for large dispatchable backup generation because of low capacity factors during peak times contain an implicit assumption that electricity demand is fixed .
This assumption is both false and pernicious , because shifting demand can be done cheaply , and often produces multiple benefits .
While it is true that most large scale electricity storage technologies , such as pumped hydropower , compressed air energy storage , and utility scale batteries are expensive or limited to a few available sites ( pumped hydro , ) technologies which shift the demand curve are not .
If you look back at the first set of four heat maps , you will note that wind actually does a quite good job serving the winter peak .
In 2004 ( a year with a moderate summer ) winter peak demand actually exceeded summer peak .
Capacity during winter peak has some advantages over summer peak .
First of all , natural gas prices are higher during the winter , because natural gas is used extensively for home heating as well as power generation .
In February 2006 , Xcel Energy had a series of major power outages in Northern Colorado which they blamed on insufficient natural gas in storage due to unusually cold temperatures .
Yet as this heat map
shows , wind farms in the region were operating at 40 - 60 % capacity factors ( i.e. well above " normal " production ) for January and February .
Note that the blue at the end of the year was due to lack of data , not lack of production .
Had there been more wind farms installed , this would have had a large impact on the amount of natural gas needed for electrical generation , and the outages would not have happened .
I do n't have data to back it up , but my personal experience leads me to believe that cold winters in the great plains are also particularly windy winters , meaning that winter wind capacity is ideally suited to displace natural gas needed for heating .
How Heat Pumps Fit In
Which brings me to the title of this article : why heat pumps are an excellent fit with wind generation .
In my article on how to invest in the Pickens Plan , I mentioned that ground - source heat pumps ( GHP ) can displace gas used for heating with a smaller amount of electricity from wind .
Since a GHP is both an efficient air conditioner as well as an efficient heat source , it not only reduces natural gas used for heating , but also reduces electricity used for cooling in hot summer months , which in turn reduces summer peak loads .
Deployment of GHPs does three things to make energy supplies fit energy demand :
1. Winter electricity usage is increased just when wind capacities are highest .
2. Summer electricity consumption is decreased when wind capacities are lowest .
3 . Use of natural gas for heating is reduced during times of peak gas demand .
GHPs , because of their extreme efficiency , also have the benefit of saving users a lot of money .
The Dual Fuel Option
Unfortunately , GHPs have not been widely adopted , due to the difficulties of installing the buried heat exchange loops , especially in urban areas ( although some utility programs have been very successful . )
When I bought a house , it was in a New Urbanist development with very small lots which was close to my work .
While this saves me countless gallons of gasoline , it meant that I was unable to use a heat pump .
I opted instead for the most efficient natural gas furnace available from my homebuilder , in combination with the most efficient air - source heat pump .
Unlike GHPs , air - source heat pumps lack a ground loop , meaning that they only work efficiently when temperatures are above about 40 F .
In my dual - fuel system , the heat pump heats my house during milder weather ( which is frequent in Denver winters ) , and the natural gas furnace takes over when it is cold .
Since the heat pump is only slightly more expensive than the air conditioner I would have bought anyway , the dual fuel system will pay for itself rapidly , especially when natural gas prices are high .
From the perspective of the electric grid , my electric usage is higher and my natural gas usage is lower during the heating season , when gas demand is high and wind farms are at their most productive .
So while a dual fuel house is much less of a strain on the energy infrastructure than one with a furnace and an air conditioner , it also saves the homeowner money for a much smaller investment .
In addition , while the need for a ground loop makes a GHP nearly impossible to retrofit to an existing home , an air source heat pump is an option for anyone considering replacing or installing an air conditioner , and has the added advantage of having a back - up heat source during a natural gas outage .
Another retrofit option I hope to see available soon is a hybrid ground / air source heat pump [ pdf ] .
These systems combine a short ground loop with an air heat exchanger .
By using the air exchanger during milder weather , only a smaller ground source loop is needed for use during more extreme conditions , reducing the up - front costs compared to a GHP , but without the performance loss of an air source heat pump .
A startup called Co-Energies has developed a way to retrofit existing air conditioners into hybrid heat pumps ; see slides 33 and later of this PowerPoint .
Electricity Demand Can Shift
Heat pumps are just one option for changing the shape of the electricity demand curve .
Many such efficiency measures can do so .
Other examples are improved home sealing and insulation , which typically pay for themselves in a couple years or less , and , because air conditioners work less hard in the summer , reduce summer peak loads .
Wind is undoubtedly a tricky sort of electricity to use in the existing grid , but the fallacy that demand is fixed makes the problem seem much harder than it needs to be .
3 Good Reasons to Stop Thinking So Much , And How to Do It
Image by gutter ( license ) .
What is stopping people from getting the results they want ?
Well , for one I 'd say a pretty common and self - imposed roadblock is thinking too much .
In fact , one of the best tips for getting things done that I have learned so far is simply to stop thinking and start doing .
I think this problem of overthinking things is nothing that I 'm alone with in the personal development community .
I think it may be one of the problems that draw people to books and websites on self - help and one of the things that still keep them from achieving what they want even after they have picked up on a lot of helpful advice .
Because after having read five books you think and plan and think a little more .
You get lost in thinking .
At least that 's what I did .
If you 're an overthinker then getting your hands on personal development information becomes just another way to creatively procrastinate .
But now you can label it as making progress and get an emotional kick out of it .
Now , I 'm not saying that educating yourself or thinking is something bad .
But overdoing it wo n't help you either .
Here are a couple of good reasons why .
1 . Thinking can't replace action .
I sometimes think there is some kind of wish when overthinking that thinking will somehow replace action .
A wish that if you just think enough you can find some easy way out or get what you want without having to actually do something .
Without taking action you 'll most likely not get what you want .
Thinking is however seldom as scary or uncertain as taking the leap into the unknown and taking action .
So it can become a place where you hide from taking action and then rationalize to yourself in different ways how all this thinking will help you .
Even though you know deep down that what you really want and need is to take action and get going .
2 . You may overcomplicate things .
Are things hard and difficult ?
Yeah , they might be .
But you may also want consider that it's you that are making them even harder .
By overthinking things you make them more and more complicated in your mind .
You can turn something fairly simple into a really complicated and big mess .
And so it goes from something you can do with some discomfort and persistence into an epic battle where you keep moving inch by painstaking inch .
A problem here is that when what you are doing is difficult and complicated then you and others think that it must be important .
And so you feel important .
You derive a sense of importance from making things into big struggles .
Such a thing can form into an identity where you are struggling and keeping on moving forward while you imagine other people lying at home in the sofa lazily watching some TV .
It can strengthen you .
It can make you feel negatively about other people .
It may feel good in a sort of way to feel like an outsider or some kind of misunderstood underdog that 's up against so much .
So it has its upsides .
However , you may also want to consider not making things to so hard for yourself .
You do n't have to be a rebel that 's going against the world .
You can just accept what you choose to do .
And that other people choose to do other things .
Upsides such as a feeling of importance or of being the underdog may make it hard to give up the notion that what you are doing may not be that difficult and complicated .
But I have found that when I do that then I become more relaxed and things tend to be easier to accomplish .
You can to some degree control how difficult something will be .
Much of your struggle is up there in your head .
Just try letting go of the notion of how awfully difficult something is and see what happens .
You may be relieved .
And surprised at how you have been making your life more complicated than it needs to be .
3 . You 'll perform worse .
If you overthink things you may overcomplicate them .
And so you become nervous and start to second guess yourself all the time .
It also becomes harder to focus on doing something when you have a have a habit of thinking a lot .
You may often slip into possible future scenarios in your mind instead just focusing on what you are doing right now .
All of this can cripple your performance and produce results that are worse than they could have been .
How to stop thinking so much
So , I used to be a big overthinker .
Still am .
From time to time .
But I have made progress .
Here are three things I use to cultivate a habit of not overthinking things .
Be aware of the problem .
The most important thing is to be aware that you tend to overthink .
And to keep being aware of that in your everyday life .
You can for instance do that with post - it notes that say “ Do n't overthink things .
Act ! ” or something along those lines .
By just being aware of your habit you can often pick up on when you are doing it , stop yourself and do something more helpful instead .
Over time it also becomes easier to step out of the loop of thoughts and not get stuck back in it a half an hour later .
Set deadlines for decisions .
Instead of thinking about something for days , tell yourself that you have – for example – 30 minutes to think .
Then you will make a decision .
Be present .
Focus on what 's in front of you instead of flying off to the past or Tomorrowland for long periods of time .
A tennis player will for instance not think much while playing .
She just trusts in her own subconscious and stays with flow .
Her body will – after years of practise – know what to do automatically .
The same goes for many things in everyday life .
You do n't have to think a lot about everything .
You can just stay present and let the right actions naturally arise .
This may sound a bit wonky , but if you just do things while being present you may discover that the results are often better than if you put in a lot of thought .
Like the tennis player , you know what the right thing to do is and how to do it well from years of experience and practice .
You just have to let go of all that thinking that can cripple you .
And have trust in your capabilities .

This will be interesting to a small subset of our readers , but we ’re finally seeing ATmega328P chips in the wild .
This is a new chip from Atmel that is nearly identical to– but with twice the memory of– the popular ATmega168 microcontroller , the microcontroller in the Arduino and in our ( Arduino - compatible ) Peggy 2.0 .
They are still in short supply , but they ’ll be a lot of fun to play with . :)
In the photo is one of these on one of our “ business card ” AVR target boards that we designed for the ATmega48 , ’ 88 , ‘ 168 , and ‘ 328 , so it ’s finally lived up to its name .
Somewhere in central Los Angeles , about 20 miles from LAX airport , there is a nondescript building housing a detention facility for foreigners who have violated US immigration and customs laws .
I was driven there around 11 pm on May 3 , my hands painfully handcuffed behind my back as I sat crammed in one of several small , locked cages inside a security van .
I saw glimpses of night - time urban LA through the metal bars as we drove , and shadowy figures of armed security officers when we arrived , two of whom took me inside .
The handcuffs came off just before I was locked in a cell behind a thick glass wall and a heavy door .
No bed , no chair , only two steel benches about a foot wide .
There was a toilet in full view of anyone passing by , and of the video camera watching my every move .
No pillow or blanket .
A permanent fluorescent light and a television in one corner of the ceiling .
It stayed on all night , tuned into a shopping channel .
After 10 minutes in the hot , barely breathable air , I panicked .
I do n't suffer from claustrophobia , but this enclosure triggered it .
There was no guard in sight and no way of calling for help .
I banged on the door and the glass wall .
A male security officer finally approached and gave the newly arrived detainee a disinterested look .
Our shouting voices were barely audible through the thick door .
" What do you want ? " he yelled .
I said I did n't feel well .
He walked away .
I forced myself to calm down .
I forced myself to use that toilet .
I figured out a way of sleeping on the bench , on my side , for five minutes at a time , until the pain became unbearable , then resting in a sitting position and sleeping for another five minutes .
I told myself it was for only one night .
As it turned out , I was to spend 26 hours in detention .
My crime : I had flown in earlier that day to research an innocuous freelance assignment for the Guardian , but did not have a journalist 's visa .
Since September 11 2001 , any traveller to the US is treated as a potential security risk .
The Patriot Act , introduced 45 days after 9/11 , contains a chapter on Protecting The Border , with a detailed section on Enhanced Immigration Provision , in which the paragraph on Visa Security And Integrity follows those relating to protection against terrorism .
In this spirit , the immigration and naturalisation service has been placed , since March 2003 , under the jurisdiction of the new department of homeland security .
One of its innovations was to revive a law that had been dormant since 1952 , requiring journalists to apply for a special visa , known as I - visa , when visiting the US for professional reasons .
Somewhere along the way , in the process of trying to develop a foolproof system of protecting itself against genuine threats , the US has lost the ability to distinguish between friend and foe .
The price this powerful country is paying for living in fear is the price of its civil liberties .
None of this had been on my mind the night before , when I boarded my United Airlines flight from Heathrow .
Sitting next to an intriguingly silent young man who could have been a porn star or a well camouflaged air marshal , I spent most of the 11 - hour flight daydreaming about the city where he so clearly belonged and that I had never visited .
My America had always been the east coast : as tourist , resident , journalist , novelist , I had never ventured much past the New York - Boston - Washington triangle .
But I was glad that this brief assignment was taking me to sunkissed LA , and I was ready to succumb to LA 's laid - back charm .
The queue for passport control was short .
I presented my British passport and the green visa waiver form I had signed on the plane .
The immigration official began by asking the usual questions about where I was staying and why I was travelling to the US .
It brought back memories of another trip there to write a series of articles about post 9/11 America for the German weekly Die Zeit .
I had written about commuters who preferred the safety of train travel to flying , and about a wounded New York that had become a city of survivors .
I had seen a traumatised , no longer cockily immortal America in a profound state of mourning .
But it had seemed to me that its newly acknowledged vulnerability was becoming its strength : stunned by an act of war on its own soil , Americans had been shocked into a sudden hunger for information about the world beyond their borders .
" I 'm here to do some interviews , " I said .
" With whom ? "
He wrote down the names , asked what the article was about and who had commissioned it .
" So you 're a journalist , " he said , accusingly , and for the first time I sensed that , in his eyes , this was not a good thing to be .
" I have to refer this to my supervisor , " he said ominously , and asked me to move to a separate , enclosed area , where I was to wait to be " processed " .
Other travellers came , waited and went ; I was beginning to feel my jetlag and some impatience .
I asked how long I 'd have to wait , but received no reply .
Finally , an officer said , noncommittally , " It seems that we will probably have to deport you . "
I 'm not sure , but I think I laughed .
Deport ?
Me ? " Why ? " I asked , incredulously .
" You came here as a journalist , and you do n't have a journalist 's visa . "
I had never heard of it .
He swiftly produced the visa waiver ( I - 94W ) I had signed on the plane , and pointed to what it said in tiny print : in addition to not being a drug smuggler , a Nazi or any other sort of criminal , I had inadvertently declared that I was not entering the US as a representative of foreign media ( " You may not accept unauthorised employment or attend school or represent the foreign information media during your visit under this program " ) .
My protestations that I had not noticed this caveat , nor been alerted to it , that I had travelled to the US on many occasions , both for work and pleasure , that I had , in fact , lived there as a permanent resident and that my husband was a US citizen , as was my New York - born daughter , all fell on deaf ears .
He grinned .
" You do n't care , do you ? " I said , with controlled anger .
Then I backtracked , and assumed a begging , apologetic mode .
In response , he told me I would have to be " interviewed " , and that a decision would then be taken by yet another superior .
This sounded hopeful .
Finally , after much scurrying around by officers , I was invited into an office and asked if I needed anything before we began .
I requested a glass of water , which the interrogating officer brought me himself .
He was a gentle , intelligent interrogator : the interview lasted several hours and consisted of a complete appraisal of my life , past and present , personal and professional .
He needed information as diverse as my parents ' names , the fee I would be paid for the article I was working on , what it was about , exactly , and , again , the names of people I was coming to interview .
My biography was a confusing issue - I was born in one country , had lived in many others : who was I , exactly ?
For US immigration , my British passport was not enough of an identity .
The officer said , pointedly , " You are Russian , yet you claim to be British " , an accusation based on the fact that I was born in Moscow ( though I never lived there ) .
Your governor , went my mental reply , is Austrian , yet he claims to be American .
After about three hours , during which I tried hard to fight jetlag and stay alert , we had produced several pages that were supposed to provide the invisible person in charge with enough material to say yes or no to my request to be allowed entry .
My interrogator asked one last obligatory question , " Do you understand ? "
" Yes , I understand , " I sighed , and signed the form .
The instant faxed response was an official , final refusal to enter the US for not having the appropriate visa .
I 'd have to go back to London to apply for it .
At this moment , the absurd but almost friendly banter between these men and myself underwent a sudden transformation .
Their tone hardened as they said that their " rules " demanded that they now search my luggage .
Before I could approach to observe them doing this , the officer who had originally referred me to his supervisor was unzipping my suitcase and rummaging inside .
For the first time , I raised my voice : " How dare you touch my private things ? "
" How dare you treat an American officer with disrespect ? " he shouted back , indignantly .
" Believe me , we have treated you with much more respect than other people .
You should go to places like Iran , you 'd see a big difference . "
The irony is that it is only " countries like Iran " ( for example , Cuba , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Zimbabwe ) that have a visa requirement for journalists .
It is unheard of in open societies , and , in spite of now being enforced in the US , is still so obscure that most journalists are not familiar with it .
Thirteen foreign journalists were detained and deported from the US last year , 12 of them from LAX .
After my luggage search , the officer took some mugshots of me , then proceeded to fingerprint me .
In the middle of this , my husband rang from London ; he had somehow managed to locate my whereabouts , and I was allowed briefly to wipe the ink off my hands to take the call .
Hearing his voice was a reminder of the real world I was beginning to feel cut off from .
Three female officers arrived to do a body search .
As they slipped on rubber gloves , I blenched : what were they going to do , and could I resist ?
They were armed , they claimed to have the law on their side .
I was an anonymous foreigner who had committed a felony , and " those were the rules " .
So I was groped , unpleasantly , though not as intimately as I had feared .
Then came the next shock : two bulky , uniformed and armed security men handcuffed me , which they explained was the " rule when transporting detainees through the airport " .
I was marched between the two giants through an empty terminal to a detention room , where I sat in the company of two other detainees ( we were not allowed to communicate ) and eight sleepy guards , all men .
I would have been happy to spend the night watching TV with them , as they agreed to switch the channel from local news ( highlight : a bear was loose in an affluent LA neighbourhood ) to sitcoms and soaps .
Their job was indescribably boring , they were overstaffed with nothing to do , and so making sure I did n't extract a pen or my mobile phone from my luggage must have seemed a welcome break .
I listened to their star - struck stories about actors they had recently seen at LAX .
We laughed in the same places during Seinfeld , an eerie experience .
I was beginning to think I could manage this : the trip was a write - off , of course , but I could easily survive a night and a day of this kind of discomfort before flying back .
But then I was taken to the detention cell in downtown LA , where the discomfort became something worse .
Though my experience was far removed from the images of real torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , it was also , as one American friend put it , " conceptually related " , at distant ends of the same continuum and dictated by a disregard for the humanity of those deemed " in the wrong " .
American bloggers and journalists would later see my experience as reflecting the current malaise in the country .
Dennis Roddy wrote in the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette : " Our enemies are now more important to us than our friends ...
Much of the obsession with homeland security seems to turn on the idea of the world infecting the US . "
On a more practical level , this obsession , when practised with such extreme lack of intelligence ( in both senses of the word ) , as in the case of my detention , must be misdirecting valuable money and manpower into fighting journalism rather than terrorism .
Ordinary Americans , rather than the powers that be , are certainly able to make that distinction .
According to an editor at the LA Times , there has been a " tremendous " response from readers to the reporting on my case , and I have received many emails expressing outrage and embarrassment .
The novelist Jonathan Franzen wrote , " On behalf of the non-thuggish American majority , my sincere apologies . "
These would have been comforting thoughts the following morning when I was driven back ( in handcuffs , of course ) to the communal detention room at LAX , and spent hours waiting , without food , while the guards munched enormous breakfasts and slurped hot morning drinks ( detainees are not allowed tea or coffee ) .
I incurred the wrath of the boss when I insisted on edible food .
" I 'm in charge in here .
Do you know who you are ?
Do you know where you are ?
This is n't a hotel , " he screamed .
" Why are you yelling ? " I asked .
" I 'm just asking for some decent food .
I 'll pay for it myself . "
A Burger King fishburger never tasted so good .
And it occurred to me that a hotel or transit lounge would have been a better place to keep travellers waiting to return home .
As documented by Reporters Without Borders and by the American Society of Newspaper Editors ( Asne ) in letters to Colin Powell and Tom Ridge , cases such as mine are part of a systemic policy of harassing media representatives from 27 friendly countries whose citizens - not journalists !
- can travel to the US without a visa , for 90 days .
According to Asne , this policy " could lead to a degradation of the atmosphere of mutual trust that has traditionally been extended professional journalists in these nations " .
Asne requested that the state department put pressure on customs and immigration to " repair the injustice that has been visited upon our colleagues " .
Someone must have listened , because the press office at the department of homeland security recently issued a memo announcing that , although the I - visa is still needed ( and I 've just received mine ) , new guidelines now give the " Port Directors leeway when it comes to allowing journalists to enter the US who are clearly no threat to our security " .
Well , fine , but does n't that imply some journalists are a threat ?
Maybe we are .
During my surreal interlude at LAX , I told the officer taking my fingerprints that I would be writing about it all .
" No doubt , " he snorted .
" And anything you 'll write wo n't be the truth . "

Graphs on the death of Marxism , postmodernism , and other stupid academic fads Graphs on the death of Marxism , postmodernism , and other stupid academic fads
[ Note : I 'm rushing this out before the school week starts , as I need sleep , so if it seems unedited , that 's why . ]
We are living in very exciting times -- at long last , we 've broken the stranglehold that a variety of silly Blank Slate theories have held on the arts , humanities , and social sciences .
To some , this may sound strange , but things have decisively changed within the past 10 years , and these so - called theories are now moribund .
To let those out - of - the - loop in on the news , and to quantify what insiders have already suspected , I 've drawn graphs of the rise and fall of these fashions .
I searched the archives of JSTOR , which houses a cornucopia of academic journals , for certain keywords that appear in the full text of an article or review ( since sometimes the big ideas appear in books rather than journals ) .
This provides an estimate of how popular the idea is -- not only the true believers , but their opponents too , will use the term .
Once no one believes it anymore , then the adherents , opponents , and neutral spectators will have less occasion to use the term .
I excluded data from 2003 onward because most JSTOR journals do n't deposit their articles in JSTOR until 3 to 5 years after the original publication .
Still , most of the declines are visible even as of 2002 .
Here are the graphs ( an asterisk means the word endings could vary ) :
Some thoughts :
First , there are two exceptions to the overall pattern of decline -- orientalism and post - colonialism .
The former may be declining , but it 's hard to say one way or the other .
The latter , though , was holding steady in 2002 , although its growth rate had clearly slowed down , so its demise seems to be only a matter of time -- by 2010 at the latest , it should show a down - turn .
Second , aside from Marxism , which peaked in 1988 , and social constructionism , which declined starting in 2002 * , the others began to fall from roughly 1993 to 1998 .
It is astonishing that such a narrow time frame saw the fall of fashions that varied so much in when they were founded .
Marxism , psychoanalysis , and feminism are very old compared to deconstruction or postmodernism , yet it was as though during the 1990s an academia - wide clean - up swept away all the bullshit , no matter how long it had been festering there .
If we wanted to model this , we would probably use an S - I - R type model for the spread of infectious diseases .
But we'd have to include an exogenous shock sometime during the 1990s since it 's unlikely that epidemics that had begun 100 years apart would , of their own inner workings , decline at the same time .
It 's as if we started to live in sparser population densities , where diseases old and new could not spread so easily , or if we wandered onto an antibiotic that cured of us diseases , some of which had plagued us for much longer than others .
Third , notice how simple most of the curves look -- few show lots of noise , or the presence of smaller - scale cycles .
That 's despite the vicissitudes of politics , economics , and other social changes -- hardly any of it made an impact on the world of ideas .
I guess they do n't call it the Ivory Tower for nothing .
About the only case you could make is for McCarthyism halting the growth of Marxist ideas during most of the 1950s .
The fall of the Berlin Wall does not explain why Marxism declined then -- its growth rate was already grinding to a halt for the previous decade , compared to its explosion during the 1960s and ' 70s .
Still , it could be that there was a general anti-communist zeitgeist in the 1950s , so that academics would have cooled off to Marxism of their own accord , not because they were afraid of McCarthy or whoever else .
Importantly , that 's only one plausible link -- there are a billion others that do n't pan out , so it may be that our plausible link happened due to chance : when you test 1000 correlations , 5 of them will be significant at the 0.005 level , even though they 're only the result of chance .
This suggests that a " great man theory " of intellectual history is wrong .
Surely someone needs to invent the theory , and it may be complex enough that if that person had n't existed , the theory would n't have existed ( contra the view that somebody or other would 've invented Marxism ) .
After that , though , we write a system of differential equations to model the dynamics of the classes of individuals involved -- perhaps just two , believers and non-believers -- and these interactions between individuals are all that matter .
How many persuasive tracts were there against postmodernism or Marxism , for example ?
And yet none of those convinced the believers since the time was n't right .
Postmodernism was already growing at a slower rate in 1995 when the Sokal Affair put its silliness in the spotlight , and even then its growth rate did n't decline even faster as a result .
Kind of depressing for iconoclasts -- but at least you can rest assured that at some point , the fuckers will get theirs .
Fourth , the sudden decline of all the big - shot theories you 'd study in a literary theory or critical theory class is certainly behind the recent angst of arts and humanities grad students .
Without a big theory , you can't pretend you have specialized training and should n't be treated as such -- high school English teachers may be fine with that , but if you 're in grad school , that 's admitting you failed as an academic .
You want a good reputation .
Is n't it strange , though , that no replacement theories have filled the void ?
That 's because everyone now understands that the whole thing was a big joke , and are n't going to be suckered again anytime soon .
Now the generalizing and biological approaches to the humanities and social sciences are dominant -- but that 's for another post .
Also , as you sense all of the big theories are dying , you must realize that you have no future : you 'll be increasingly unable to publish articles -- or have others cite you -- and even if you became a professor , you would n't be able to recruit grad students into your pyramid scheme , or enroll students in your classes , since their interest would be even lower than among current students .
Someone who knows more about intellectual history should compare arts and humanities grad students today to the priestly caste that was becoming obsolete as Europe became more rational and secular .
I 'm sure they rationalized their angst as a spiritual or intellectual crisis , just like today 's grad students might say that they had an epiphany -- but in reality , they 're just recognizing how bleak their economic prospects are and are opting for greener pastures .
Fifth and last , I do n't know about the rest of you , but I find young people today very refreshing .
Let 's look at 18 year - olds -- the impressionable college freshmen , who could be infected by their dopey professors .
If they begin freshman year just 1 year after the theory 's peak , the idea is still very popular , so they 'll get infected .
If we allow , say 5 years of cooling off and decay , professors wo n't talk about it so much , or will be use a less strident tone of voice , so that only the students who were destined to latch on to some stupid theory will get infected .
Depending on the trend , this makes the safe cohort born in 1975 at the oldest ( for Marxism ) , or 1989 at the youngest ( for social constructionism ) .
And obviously even among safe cohorts , some are safer than others -- people my age ( 27 ) may not go in for Marxism much , but have heard of it or taken it seriously at some point ( even if to argue against it intellectually ) .
But 18 year - olds today were n't even born when Marxism had already started to die .
It 's easy to fossilize your picture of the world from your formative years of 15 to 24 , but things change .
If you turned off the radio in the mid-late '90s , you missed four years of great rock and rap music that came out from 2003 to 2006 ( although now you can keep it off again ) .
If you write off dating a 21 year - old grad student on the assumption that they 're mostly angry feminist hags , you 're missing out .
And if you 'd rather socialize with people your own age because younger people are too immature to have an intelligent discussion -- ask yourself when the last time was that you did n't have to dance around all kinds of topics with Gen - X or Baby Boomer peers because of the moronic beliefs they 've been infected with since their young adult years ?
Try talking to a college student about human evolution -- they 're pretty open - minded .
My almost - 30 housemate , by comparison , was eager to hear that what I 'm studying would show that there 's no master race after all .
What a loser .
* I started the graph of social constructionism at 1960 , even though it extends back to 1876 , since it was always at a very low level before then ( less than 5 per year , often 0 ) .
Including these points did n't make the recent decline so apparent in the graph , so out they went .
Admittedly , a better estimate would be to measure the number of articles with the term in a given year , divided by the total number of articles that JSTOR has for that year , to yield a frequency .
But I do n't have the data on total articles .
However , on time - scales when we do n't expect a huge change in the total number of articles published -- say , over a few decades -- then we can take the total to be approximately constant and use only the raw counts of articles with the keyword .
Crucially , although this may warp our view of an increasing trend -- which could be due to more articles being written in total , while the frequency of those of interest stays the same -- a sustained decline must be real .

First , there are two exceptions to the overall pattern of decline -- orientalism and post - colonialism .
The former may be declining , but it 's hard to say one way or the other .

Surely someone needs to invent the theory , and it may be complex enough that if that person had n't existed , the theory would n't have existed ( contra the view that somebody or other would 've invented Marxism ) .
After that , though , we write a system of differential equations to model the dynamics of the classes of individuals involved -- perhaps just two , believers and non-believers -- and these interactions between individuals are all that matter .
How many persuasive tracts were there against postmodernism or Marxism , for example ?
And yet none of those convinced the believers since the time was n't right .
Postmodernism was already growing at a slower rate in 1995 when the Sokal Affair put its silliness in the spotlight , and even then its growth rate did n't decline even faster as a result .
Kind of depressing for iconoclasts -- but at least you can rest assured that at some point , the fuckers will get theirs .
Fourth , the sudden decline of all the big - shot theories you 'd study in a literary theory or critical theory class is certainly behind the recent angst of arts and humanities grad students .
Without a big theory , you can't pretend you have specialized training and should n't be treated as such -- high school English teachers may be fine with that , but if you 're in grad school , that 's admitting you failed as an academic .
You want a good reputation .
Is n't it strange , though , that no replacement theories have filled the void ?
That 's because everyone now understands that the whole thing was a big joke , and are n't going to be suckered again anytime soon .
Now the generalizing and biological approaches to the humanities and social sciences are dominant -- but that 's for another post .
Also , as you sense all of the big theories are dying , you must realize that you have no future : you 'll be increasingly unable to publish articles -- or have others cite you -- and even if you became a professor , you would n't be able to recruit grad students into your pyramid scheme , or enroll students in your classes , since their interest would be even lower than among current students .
Someone who knows more about intellectual history should compare arts and humanities grad students today to the priestly caste that was becoming obsolete as Europe became more rational and secular .
I 'm sure they rationalized their angst as a spiritual or intellectual crisis , just like today 's grad students might say that they had an epiphany -- but in reality , they 're just recognizing how bleak their economic prospects are and are opting for greener pastures .
Fifth and last , I do n't know about the rest of you , but I find young people today very refreshing .
Let 's look at 18 year - olds -- the impressionable college freshmen , who could be infected by their dopey professors .
If they begin freshman year just 1 year after the theory 's peak , the idea is still very popular , so they 'll get infected .
If we allow , say 5 years of cooling off and decay , professors wo n't talk about it so much , or will be use a less strident tone of voice , so that only the students who were destined to latch on to some stupid theory will get infected .
Depending on the trend , this makes the safe cohort born in 1975 at the oldest ( for Marxism ) , or 1989 at the youngest ( for social constructionism ) .
And obviously even among safe cohorts , some are safer than others -- people my age ( 27 ) may not go in for Marxism much , but have heard of it or taken it seriously at some point ( even if to argue against it intellectually ) .
But 18 year - olds today were n't even born when Marxism had already started to die .
It 's easy to fossilize your picture of the world from your formative years of 15 to 24 , but things change .
If you turned off the radio in the mid-late '90s , you missed four years of great rock and rap music that came out from 2003 to 2006 ( although now you can keep it off again ) .
If you write off dating a 21 year - old grad student on the assumption that they 're mostly angry feminist hags , you 're missing out .
And if you 'd rather socialize with people your own age because younger people are too immature to have an intelligent discussion -- ask yourself when the last time was that you did n't have to dance around all kinds of topics with Gen - X or Baby Boomer peers because of the moronic beliefs they 've been infected with since their young adult years ?
Try talking to a college student about human evolution -- they 're pretty open - minded .
My almost - 30 housemate , by comparison , was eager to hear that what I 'm studying would show that there 's no master race after all .
What a loser . *
I started the graph of social constructionism at 1960 , even though it extends back to 1876 , since it was always at a very low level before then ( less than 5 per year , often 0 ) .
Including these points did n't make the recent decline so apparent in the graph , so out they went . :
I 'm rushing this out before the school week starts , as I need sleep , so if it seems unedited , that 's why .
]
We are living in very exciting times -- at long last , we 've broken the stranglehold that a variety of silly Blank Slate theories have held on the arts , humanities , and social sciences .
To some , this may sound strange , but things have decisively changed within the past 10 years , and these so - called theories are now moribund .
To let those out - of - the - loop in on the news , and to quantify what insiders have already suspected , I 've drawn graphs of the rise and fall of these fashions .
I searched the archives of JSTOR , which houses a cornucopia of academic journals , for certain keywords that appear in the full text of an article or review ( since sometimes the big ideas appear in books rather than journals ) .
This provides an estimate of how popular the idea is -- not only the true believers , but their opponents too , will use the term .
Once no one believes it anymore , then the adherents , opponents , and neutral spectators will have less occasion to use the term .
I excluded data from 2003 onward because most JSTOR journals do n't deposit their articles in JSTOR until 3 to 5 years after the original publication .
Still , most of the declines are visible even as of 2002 .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks rallied Tuesday , with the Dow jumping 485 points on bets that Congress will pass a version of the government 's $ 700 billion package , following Monday 's crushing defeat .
But credit markets remained frozen .
Several closely watched measures of bank lending fear hit all - time highs , as firms continued to hoard funds .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) added 485 points , recovering much of the record 777 points lost the day before .
It was the third - biggest one - day point advance for the indicator in its history .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index rose 5 % and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) gained about 5 % .
Stock gains accelerated late in the day after the FDIC - the agency that insures depositors in case of a bank failure - said it wants to increase the amount of money it can insure .
Raising the limits could make businesses and individuals less anxious to withdraw money from accounts at a struggling bank .
It could also help get the $ 700 billion plan passed by mollifying critics who think the plan is too focused on Wall Street , rather than Main Street .
( Full story )
Later Tuesday evening , Senate leaders said they expected to vote on a version of the bailout bill on Wednesday , with new provisions that include a lifting of the FDIC limit .
But the actual impact from any increase in the insurance would be more psychological than anything else , said Brian Battle , vice president at Performance Trust Capital Partners .
" They 're trying to make bank deposits more sticky so people wo n't pull money out . "
At around the same time , the SEC and FASB - which monitors accounting standards - said it will announce guidance later this week on how financial companies can use fair - value accounting , which some have blamed for the escalation of the liquidity crisis .
Fair value , or mark - to - market accounting , says all assets have to be valued at what price they could be sold at immediately .
When a company that is struggling sells assets cheap to raise money , it drags down prices for the overall market .
Some critics have said temporarily suspending this rule would help the market for such securities gradually move higher .
The failed version of the $ 700 billion bill alluded to the potential for changes in those accounting rules .
Battle said he thinks the agencies were trying to hedge their bets in case the newest version of the bill calls for a temporary suspension of the rules .
Tuesday 's advance marked a readjustment on the part of investors , as they moved beyond the panic of Monday 's historic selloff , said Matt King , chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors .
" I think people are realizing that yesterday 's selling was overdone in terms of the fear , " he said .
That fear stoked a mass of sell orders near the close Monday , leading to Tuesday 's rally or " dead - cat bounce , " said Alan Lancz , director of Lancz Global .
" If the government thought it could make Wall Street a promise and then take it away , Monday showed them otherwise , " King said .
He noted that in the previous week , when the bailout was first announced , the Dow rallied roughly 800 points in two sessions .
But when the bailout appeared to be off the table , the Dow gave back almost all of that .
Despite Tuesday 's gains , September easily earned its reputation as the worst month on Wall Street , according to Stock Trader 's Almanac .
All three major gauges fell in September and for the third quarter .
( For details , click here . )
Bank rescue plan : Stocks plunged Monday after the House of Representatives shot down the proposed $ 700 billion bank rescue plan , surprising investors who had thought that a bipartisan compromise on the deal had been reached over the weekend .
The plan involves the Treasury Department buying up bad mortgage bets from banks , enabling them to start lending to each other again and ultimately defrosting the credit markets .
Lawmakers had fought to modify the plan with more taxpayer protections .
However , taxpayers were not entirely swayed , and voter complaints about the plan ahead of the election contributed to a majority in the House voting against the proposal .
( Full story )
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other officials conceived the plan in the wake of a series of bank failures and mergers amid the housing market collapse and subsequent credit market freeze up .
Frozen credit markets mean banks cling to cash , making it difficult for businesses and individuals to get needed loans .
Stocks were down Monday ahead of the vote on bets that either the plan would n't get Congressional approval , or even if it did , that it would n't be enough to relieve credit markets .
On Tuesday , President Bush urged lawmakers to take action on the bill when they return to Washington on Wednesday .
" While the plan is far from perfect , it would have established a floor , given the markets confidence and helped to unclog the credit markets , " Lancz said .
He said that the longer it takes for a plan to be enacted , the worse the impact it has on both the domestic and global economies .
( No bailout , here 's Plan B )
The Dow's 7 % decline Monday was the worst single - day percentage drop since Sept. 17 , 2001 - the first trading day after the September 11 attacks .
The S&P and Nasdaq both lost around 9 % , the biggest single - day percentage drop since the October 1987 crash .
The day 's loss knocked out roughly $ 1.2 trillion in market value , according to a drop in the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 , the broadest measure of the stock market .
It was the first time markets have ever lost more than $ 1 trillion in a day .
But markets gained back roughly $ 600 billion Tuesday , according to Dow Wilshire estimates .
Credit markets :
The credit markets remained tight Tuesday .
Libor , the rate banks charge each other for overnight dollar loans , hit a record 6.8 % , the highest level since tracking began in 1984 , according to the British Bankers ' Association .
The Libor - OIS spread , a cash scarcity gauge , rose to an all - time high .
But the TED spread , an indicator of credit risk , fell to 3.15 % from a 26 - year high of 3.58 % Monday , indicating a slight easing of the market .
The TED spread is the difference between what banks charge each other to borrow for three months and what the Treasury pays .
If banks are relatively confident , they should charge each other not much more than the U.S. government .
When the spread widens , that indicates rising jitters .
The yield on the 3 - month Treasury bill , seen as the safest place to park money in the short term , rose to 0.88 % from 0.14 % late Monday .
Earlier this month , the three - month bill fell to a 68 - year low around 0 % as panic gripped financial markets .
( Full story )
Government debt prices weakened and the yields rose .
The benchmark 10 - year Treasury note fell 1-27/32 after several up sessions , pushing the corresponding yields up to 3.82 % from 3.60 % Monday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
On the move : Many of the financial services stocks that tumbled Monday bounced back Tuesday .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) rose 15.7 % , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) climbed 14 % , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) added 15 % and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) gained 9.6 % .
Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) rallied 94 % Tuesday after sliding over 80 % Monday on news that Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) is buying the company 's bank assets in a $ 2.2 billion all - stock deal .
Citigroup gained 16 % .
A rise in oil prices gave a lift to the underlying stocks , with Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , Halliburton ( HAL , Fortune 500 ) and Schlumberger ( SLB ) all rallying .
Trading volume was moderate following Monday 's blowout .
On the New York Stock Exchange , advancers beat decliners 4 to 1 on volume of 1.62 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , winners topped losers by more than 3 to 2 on volume of 2.43 billion shares .
Portfolio managers ' end - of - quarter reshuffling can sometimes cause increased volatility and volume in the last few days of the quarter .
But not so this time , with the rescue plan 's surprise setback dominating trade .
Third quarter : Tuesday was the last day of an abysmal third quarter , in which worries about the health of the financial sector knocked down 9 of the 10 S&P economic sectors and all three major gauges .
Surprisingly , many financial sector stocks did well , bouncing after getting pummeled in the first two quarters of the year .
The Dow 30's biggest gainers were Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase , both up over 30 % .
For the quarter , the Dow lost around 4.4 % , the Nasdaq fell 9.2 % and the S&P 500 lost 9 %. , with most of the declines happening in September .
Economic news :
A closely watched measure of the housing sector showed that home prices in July fell by the largest rate ever , although the pace of monthly declines slowed .
( Full story )
The Chicago PMI , a key manufacturing report , fell to 56.7 in September from 57.9 in the prior month .
However , the decline was smaller than economists were expecting .
Any reading over 50 suggests growth .
The September consumer confidence index topped forecasts , the Conference Board reported .
It climbed to 59.8 from a revised 58.5 in August , surprising economists who thought it would fall to 55 .
Oil and gold : U.S. light crude oil for November delivery rose $ 4.27 to settle at $ 100.64 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
On Monday , oil prices plunged $ 10.52 a barrel in the second - biggest one - day plunge ever .
( Full story )
Oil prices had plummeted over $ 55 after peaking at $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 , as investors bet that sluggish global growth will diminish oil demand .
But the recent acceleration of the financial crisis had caused investors to buy up commodities in a safer - haven play .
COMEX gold for December delivery fell $ 13.60 to settle at $ 880.80 an ounce .
Like oil , gold prices rallied during the biggest periods of unrest over the last few weeks
Other markets :
In currency trading , the dollar fell against the euro and gained against the yen .
Gas prices fell for the 13th day in a row , according to a nationwide survey of credit card activity .
In global trading , Asian markets tumbled on the back of the U.S. selloff Monday .
European markets rose Tuesday .
Water Heaters Get Energy Star Status and Reduce Bills , Emissions
April 7th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
They ’re not sexy , and the Department of Energy estimates 13 % of your home energy consumption goes into a big tank of hot water .
I ’ve seen other estimates that go higher , and a larger or older tank will burn more energy .
So your water heater may be one of the more boring appliances in your home , but it ’s a leading load on your energy bill .
Fortunately , there are easy ways to fix that .
First let ’s talk about how to improve a water heater that you already have .
For less than $ 20 , you can hit your local DIY hub / home improvement store and buy a water heater blanket with quick and easy assembly instructions .
If Internet testimonials are true , it will probably take more time to drive to the store and buy one , than it will to install it .
If your water heater already has a blanket , bravo !
Just keep in mind that the big sticker on the front of your water heater has some important information .
You might want to tape it to the blanket for easy reference .
While you ’re at it , you could also consider insulating some of your pipes or ducts ( see first link in this paragraph ) for even more savings .
As for the yawn - factor on water heater tanks , check out my favorite Myth Busters episode from the Discovery Channel .
( Please do n’t try at home , duh )
[ kml_flashembed movie= " http://youtube.com/v/JmJoyuUJj2Q
" width = " 425 " height = " 350 " wmode=" transparent " /]
If you ’re renovating your house , or if your water heater recently died , consider an upgrade .
The D.O.E. just posted new Energy Star ratings for water heaters , so read the stats on a new tank to get the best value .
If you want to join millions of people in other countries , you could consider getting a tankless water heater .
Instead of heating a large volume of water and storing it , a tankless water heater works on demand , heating water as it ’s used .
They generally use 10 % to 20 % less energy than a standard 40 gallon tank heater , and they come in both electric and natural gas varieties .
I had one while I was living in South Korea and loved it .
The water was hotter than I needed , and it never ran out , not even when I had company .
If you ’re ready for a new water heater and you also have all the hook - ups for a tank , fear not .
General Electric is capitalizing on the infrastructure built into most homes to replace old water heater tanks with their upcoming hybrid- electric water heater tank .
Yes that ’s right , it ’s the hybrid of water heaters .
GE claims this electric water heater tank will use less than half of the energy a standard one requires .
And even more cool , it absorbs heat from the air and transfers it into the water .
Forgive me , but that tickles every nerdy bone in my body !
The electric water heater tank will be available in 2009 , and EcoGeek claims the energy savings could have huge implications .
Also , let ’s not forget solar - thermal water heaters .
As with investing in solar energy , this will return your investment fastest : better yet , it ’s a renewable source .
So are water heaters sexy ?
Maybe if they ’re tankless , but generally not .
However , that does n’t mean you ca n’t save some money by increasing your home ’s energy efficiency .
In fact , many groups suggest that increasing the energy efficiency of existing buildings is the cheapest and easiest way to combat climate change right now .
It ’s something most people can do to take action with minimal investment or effort .
So take a look at your water heater and see what you can do .
Once our water ’s energy use is efficient , maybe we can move on to making our use of water more efficient , too .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
ORLANDO , Florida ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Saturday that Republican rival John McCain ’s campaign has been cynical , not racist , in trying to raise fears about his candidacy .
Obama said McCain ’s campaign team was “ very good at negative campaigning ” and was using his relative inexperience , atypical biography and his race to try to stir up doubts about him .
McCain ’s campaign earlier this week said Obama played “ the race card ” by claiming McCain was trying to scare voters about his appearance .
Obama , the son of a black Kenyan father and white Kansas mother , would be the first black president .
“ In no way do I think that John McCain ’s campaign was being racist .
I think they are cynical , ” the Illinois senator told reporters in Cape Canaveral , Florida .
“ I think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues . ”
On the second day of a two - day tour of the key battleground state of Florida , Obama told the convention of the Urban League in Orlando that McCain had done little to support public education programs .
“ For someone who ’s been in Washington nearly 30 years , he ’s got a pretty slim record on education , and when he has taken a stand , it ’s been the wrong one , ” he said .
“ I ’m happy to put my record and ideas up against his any day . ”
McCain , an Arizona senator , mocked Obama in two ads this week -- one comparing him to vapid Hollywood celebrities like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , and the other lampooning him as an overconfident and Messiah - like candidate known as “ the One . ”
Obama , 46 , said race was just one of the factors the McCain campaign was using to stir up fears about him .
“ I do n’t come out of central casting , he said , listing his youth , name , birth in Hawaii and childhood in Indonesia as things voters might not be used to .
“ What that means is that I ’m sort of unfamiliar .
People are still trying to get a fix on who I am , where I come from , what my values are , ” he said .
“ So what I think has been an approach of the McCain campaign is to say ‘ he ’s risky . ’ ”
Obama said McCain ’s campaign had been taken over by former aides to President George W. Bush who were clearly planning a negative campaign .
“ They are very good at negative campaigns .
They are not so good at governing , ” he said of McCain ’s team .
“ We have seen this movie before . ”
MCCAIN SPOKESMAN : OBAMA IS THE CYNIC
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Obama was the one guilty of political cynicism .

“ The only ‘ cynical ’ candidate in this election is Barack Obama , who has opposed every element of John McCain ’s comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling , affordable nuclear energy and gas tax relief for hardworking families , ” he said .
Obama said his decision , announced on Friday , to back limited offshore drilling as part of a broader energy package that attempted to bring down gas prices was an effort to break gridlock in Washington on the issue .
He dropped his blanket opposition to any expansion of offshore drilling and signaled support for a bipartisan compromise in Congress that includes limited drilling .
Obama praised that legislation to increase domestic oil production and expand conservation and efforts to develop alternative energy .
“ There are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bipartisan group .
I remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions , ” he said .
“ But I will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect , ” he added .
Obama and McCain have battled sharply over the issue of offshore drilling , with McCain backing efforts to open new areas and Obama opposed .
Polls show a majority of the public supports expanded drilling to try to battle rising gas prices .
At a town hall meeting in Titusville , Florida , near the NASA complex in Cape Canaveral , Obama said he wanted to develop a plan to explore the solar system with both human and robotic missions .
Earlier in the campaign , Obama had proposed delays in NASA ’s manned missions in order to pay for his early education programs , but aides say he will find other ways to pay for those proposals .
“ Under my watch , NASA will inspire the world once again , make America stronger , and help grow the economy , ” Obama said .

This security field is based on the perception that spambots post data to forms in very short or very long regular intervals of time , where it takes reasonable time to fill in a form and to submit it for human beings .
Instead of captcha images or Ajax - based security interaction , the Security Field checks the time of rendering the form , and the time when it was submitted .
If the interval is within the specific range ( for example , from 5 seconds till 1 hour ) , then the submitter is considered as a human being .
Otherwise the form does n't validate .
Usage example :
class TestForm ( forms .Form ) : prevent_spam = SecurityField ( ) # ... other fields ...
The concept works only for unbounded forms .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The minimum wage in the world ’s richest country has just been raised by almost 12 percent .
That followed a 13.6 percent hike last year and looks like major progress for those at the bottom of the economic ladder .
At first sight , at least .
Examined more closely , the figures highlight poverty and economic inequality of Third World proportions .
The latest increase took effect last week and brought the minimum wage to $ 6.55 an hour .
Adjusted for inflation , this is less than it was in 1964 , the year President Lyndon Johnson declared “ unconditional war on poverty in America . ”
Poverty won , as free - market champion Ronald Reagan put it a quarter of a century later .
Then , 13 percent of the U.S. population lived below the official poverty line .
In 2006 , the most recent year for which the U.S. Census Bureau has statistics , it stood at 12.3 percent , or 36.5 million people .
On the other end of the scale , the U.S. economy produced billionaires at a steady pace .
There are 469 of them , by the latest count of Forbes magazine .
In 1982 , when the magazine started its annual list of the richest Americans , there were just 13 billionaires .
Today , the United States has the largest gap between rich and poor of any Western industrialized country .
In terms of equitable distribution of income and wealth , the U.S. is closer to Iran , Argentina or Mexico than to Canada or Germany .
( That is according to the Gini index , a complex statistical measure of inequality named after Corrado Gini , the Italian economist who devised it in 1912 . )
“ There has been a massive shift of income from the bottom and middle to the top , ” says Holly Sklar , director of Business for Shared Prosperity , a network of business owners supporting higher minimum wages .
“ The richest 1 percent of Americans have increased their share of the nation ’s income to a higher level than any year since 1928 , the eve of the Great Depression . ”
Poverty and inequality are not usually subject of wide debate in the United States but this is an election year which might mark the beginning of a change .
A poll this month by TIME magazine and the Rockefeller Foundation showed that 85 percent of Americans are unhappy with the economy and think their country is on the wrong track .
TIME termed the percentage unprecedented .
The poll also showed a striking shift of sentiment towards the role of government in solving the country ’s problems .
More than 80 percent favored public works projects to create jobs and 70 percent advocated government programs to help those struggling to survive in a sinking economy marked by falling home prices , foreclosures , and sharply higher prices for fuel and food .
COUNTER -REFORMATION ?
TIME termed the results “ a counterreformation of sorts in a Republican - led era that emphasizes deregulation and self - reliance . ”
Are there parallels between the present and the mood that led to the New Deal social reforms of the 1930s ?
Some scholars say yes .
In the words of Jacob Hacker , a political scientist at Yale University , “ we have an economic order that is not well placed to deal with the challenges of the 21st century , just as back then there was a realization that the world had changed but the government had n’t . ”
No matter who wins on November 4 , Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain , it is difficult to see economic gains flowing as freely to the top 1 percent as they did in the eight years of President George W. Bush .
Both candidates have announced plans to reform a health care system which has contributed greatly to the economic anxieties reflected by polls .
There is a good reason why the Census Bureau ’s annual report is entitled “ Income , Poverty and Health Coverage in the United States . ”
The number of Americans without health insurance has risen relentlessly since the beginning of the millennium and now stands at 47 million ( out of a population of 301 million ) .
More than 22 million hold full - time jobs and for many of them , falling ill can spell financial disaster and a slide from the edge of the middle class to the ranks of what is euphemistically known as “ the working poor . ”
That is the label for those working at the minimum wage - an estimated two million - or close to it .
Often they work two or three jobs and still ca n’t make it .
They include people who are forced to sleep in cars , trailers or shelters .
How miserably the system has failed is highlighted by the large crowds turning up for free weekend clinics run by an organization called Remote Area Medical Volunteer Corps .
It was founded in 1985 to bring medical services to the Central Amazon Basin , an area ill - served even by Third World standards .
The organization ’s founder , Stan Brock , calls the clinics “ expeditions ” to where the needs are greatest .
Sixty percent of the expeditions now go not to the Amazon or other Latin American regions but to places in the United States .
The most recent expedition , last weekend , was to Wise , in the southwest corner of Virginia .

Bill Schneider has covered political conventions for more than 30 years and has covered them for CNN since the 1992 election .
CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider says John McCain 's tribute to President Bush was risky .
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
It 's odd to present yourself as a maverick to the most partisan audience imaginable , as John McCain did Thursday night .
But the real audience was n't sitting in the Xcel Center this evening to watch the Arizona senator accept the Republican Party 's presidential nomination ; it was the independents at home looking for a reason to vote for him .
It was n't that long ago that McCain was the Republican most admired among Democrats .
He retains some residual popularity with Democrats and particularly independents .
But some of that glow has faded .
iReport.com : Do you think McCain hit the mark ?
He 's certainly doing his best to regain some of that luster .
He did n't talk much at all about divisive social issues : a brief reference to his support for life , no talk of gay issues , a brief reference to judges that do n't legislate from the bench but no extended focus on social issues .
That 's not the core of his agenda .
But in a moment sure to be featured in campaign ads from now to November , he paid tribute to the sitting Republican president , George W. Bush .
A risky move .
The most important thing McCain had to do tonight was to demonstrate that he knows the pain and anxiety Americans are going through right now and that he has a plan to address that .
Nobody doubts he's a hero , as the many tributes throughout the convention were meant to highlight , but what they want to know is what he 's going to do to fix the economy .
Watch McCain lay out his platform »
He used the issue to try to criticize Barack Obama , who holds the advantage on the issue .
Obama wants to raise your taxes , he said .
He wants to wish away the global economy .
Is there any basis for these critiques ?
I 'm not so sure .
But it 's a case he has to make to have a chance this November .
So far , at least , the essence of his economic plan is to stop government spending , an arguable proposition for economic growth , but it 's the most concrete economic plan he 's provided : stop government overspending and rescue the economy .
Democrats will try to pick that apart .
But frankly , a lot of people believe it
The second element of his economic plan is to cut taxes .
Cutting taxes and keeping government spending low are the foundation of Republican economics : Reaganomics .
Is that an economic rescue program ?
To put it another way :
Do people feel that their economic problems are caused by government spending and high taxes ?
They certainly did in 1980 , but it 's 28 years later .
It 's always been an article of belief among Republicans that they lost the 2006 congressional elections because of their abandonment of one of these core Republican principles and their embrace of federal overspending .
That 's simply not true ; they lost because of Iraq .
But they refuse to believe it .
The Iraq issue has really receded in importance in this campaign .
It was the central issue in 2006 but not 2008 .
And one of the ironies is that more Americans think we 're winning in Iraq , but more Americans believe that Obama will handle the issue better than McCain .
Iraq did take center stage in one respect Thursday night as anti-war protesters from Code Pink who managed to make it into the arena interrupted McCain at several points .
As these protesters continued to grab the crowd 's attention -- and the crowd , coming to his defense , unintentionally stepped on McCain 's speech with their chants -- he recognized that he really faced a serious problem and did his best to short - circuit it .
Ignore the " static , " he told the audience ; " Americans want us to stop shouting at each other . "
He 's right .
The danger in incidents like this is that people will see him as a president who will divide the country .
That 's the danger for him .
His initial response was the right one : Maintain calm in the situation , the crowd and himself .
Still , McCain ended with his biggest themes : sacrifice and patriotism .
It was intended to be stirring , but I wonder whether the call to " fight " turns off a lot of voters .
People really are tired of fighting .
My view is :
It was a simple and sincere speech that gave testimony to his character , avoiding most divisive social issues .
But it did not seem to answer the question , " What are you going to do about the nation 's terrible economic problems ? "
His answers seemed very much part of the past : cut spending , cut taxes .
He really needs to find a new and bolder economic plan .
He tried to claim some of Obama 's major campaign themes Thursday : unity and change .
But when McCain talks about change , he talks about changing Washington .
When the Democrats talk about change , they 're talking about changing the way things are going in the country .
If voters are choosing between two men , they will probably choose McCain .
If they 're choosing between two policies , I think Obama has the edge :
His are newer , smarter and fresher .

Women with depression may be much more likely than men to get relief from a commonly used , inexpensive antidepressant drug , a new national study finds .
But many members of both sexes may find that it helps ease their depression symptoms .
The persistence of a gender difference in response to the drug — even after the researchers accounted for many complicating factors — suggests that there 's a real biological difference in the way the medication affects women compared with men .
The reasons for that difference are still unclear , but further studies are now examining hormonal variations that may play a role .
The study involved citalopram , a commonly used antidepressant that is available both as a generic drug and under the brand name Celexa .
Researchers from the University of Michigan Depression Center and their colleagues from around the country tested the drug 's ability to help depression patients achieve remission , or total relief from their symptoms , in a multi- year study called STAR*D .
The gender differences emerged from a detailed analysis of data from 2,876 men and women who had a clear diagnosis of major depression , and took citalopram over a number of weeks , with the doses increasing over time .
In the end , women were 33 percent more likely to achieve a full remission of their depression , despite the fact that women in the study were more severely depressed than the men when the study began .

The study showed no differences between men and women in side effects , the amount of time that patients stuck to taking the drug , or the amount of time it took for them to achieve remission of their symptoms .
The new findings , which represent the largest and most rigorous analysis ever of gender differences in response to an antidepressant , are published online in the Journal of Psychiatric Research .
Elizabeth Young , M.D. , a professor and associate chair of psychiatry at the U - M Medical School and member of the Depression Center , is the study 's lead author .
" Other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants , but the evidence has been conflicting , " she says .
" This study is large enough , and we were able to control for enough complicating factors , that we feel confident there is a true difference .
These results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression . "
Young and her colleagues , including Susan Kornstein , M.D. , of Virginia Commonwealth University , and John Rush , M.D. , formerly of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas , conducted the analysis of data from men and women between the ages of 18 and 75 , many of whom were being treated by primary care physicians and not psychiatrists .
All of the patients had been experiencing depression for years , with the average length of experience around 12 years .
The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health .
Unlike many previous industry - sponsored studies of antidepressants , it included a " real world " sample of people with major depression , and did not exclude people who had a history of suicidal thinking .
The study did not include people with bipolar disorder .
Participants in the study could continue with psychotherapy that they had been undergoing before the start of the study , but could take no other antidepressants .

Citalopram is one of a class of medicines known as SSRIs , or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors .
In earlier decades , gender differences had been seen in studies of patients taking an older generation of drugs called tricyclics , with men tending to respond better to such medications .
But for more than 15 years , SSRIs have been the first choice for treating depression .
Although the current study did n't look at hormonal variations between men and women that might account for the difference in response to citalopram , Young and her colleagues note that animal studies have shown that estrogen modifies the brain systems involved in the activity of serotonin , a key brain chemical .
Kornstein is leading further analysis of the STAR * D results to look for possible differences among women according to their menopausal status and their use of hormone replacement therapy .
Meanwhile , Young 's research as a member of the U - M Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute focuses on the interactions of sex hormones and stress response in depression and other mood disorders .
Overall , women are more affected by depression than men , with about 12 percent of women suffering from some form of depression in a given year compared with 6 percent of men .
Depression and other mood disorders are the leading cause of disability among women under the age of 45 .
But the study 's authors are quick to caution that their findings do n't mean that citalopram should only be used in women .
Raw data from the study show that 24 percent of men achieved remission with the drug , compared with 29 percent of women .
The difference in remission rates grew larger once the researchers adjusted for other factors , but the fact remains that many men were helped .
Rather , they note that STAR *D and other studies have shown that many people with depression need to try several treatments to find the one that 's right for them and will produce lasting results .
That 's why a new study called CO - MED has begun .
Young and colleagues from U - M and around the country are now enrolling people with depression for this study that will assess the impact of combinations of medications .
One of the medications in that study is escitalopram , a cousin of citalopram , but it also includes other common SSRI antidepressants .
In addition to Young , Kornstein and Rush , the study 's authors include Sheila Marcus of the U - M Depression Center , Madhukar Trivedi and Diane Warden of UT - Southwestern , Anne Harvey of Via Christi Research , Stephen Wisniewski and G.K. Balasubramani of the University of Pittsburgh and Maurizio Fava of Harvard Medical School .
All MPs must swear allegiance to the Queen Anti-monarchy campaigners hope to force a legal challenge to the oath of loyalty MPs swear to the Queen .
Human rights lawyer Louise Christian is representing campaign group Republic in its planned legal challenge .
Meanwhile 22 MPs have signed a Commons motion by Lib Dem Norman Baker , backing an alternative oath in which MPs would swear allegiance to their constituents .
Tory MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC it appeared human rights lawyers were trying to " usurp the Queen " .
After election , MPs must swear an oath of allegiance " to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth , her heirs and successors " or take a " solemn affirmation " , in which they pledge to do the same , but without the words " I swear by Almighty God " .
Crossed fingers
But there have been several protests against the oath - the Labour MP and former sports minister Tony Banks crossed his fingers as he read out his pledge and Sinn Fein members ' refusal to take the oath means they are unable to take their seats in Parliament .
Republic seeks to challenge the oath sworn by MPs , as well as other officials like judges , people seeking citizenship , peers , archbishops and bishops and police constables .
You can be perfectly patriotic without wanting to swear allegiance
Louise Christian
They hope to force a judicial review through a test case where a new MP , magistrate or other official refuses to take the oath .
Ms Christian told BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme she believed the oath could be challenged on the grounds that it no longer reflected the way the country was run and that it discriminated against Catholics , Muslims , other religions and atheists by requiring them to swear allegiance to the head of the Church of England .
She said : " You can be perfectly patriotic without wanting to swear allegiance to ... not just one person , it 's not just the Queen it 's her heirs and successors , whoever they may be . "
' Unifying force ' But Mr Carswell told the BBC the case illustrated why Britain should adopt its own " bill of rights " and drop the Human Rights Act .
" The Queen is a profoundly unifying force , no matter what your background , what your heritage , where your grandparents came from , we can all unite with her as our personal head of state , " he said .
He added : " Not content with trying to run public policy and things that should be left to the elected government , here we have an example of human rights lawyers wanting to usurp the Queen . "
He argued that taking away the things that make the country distinctive would make the country indistinct .
But Ms Christian added : " What I was talking about was the rule of law and the importance of the rule of law and that means nobody is above the law . "
The early day motion proposed by Mr Baker says that " some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch " and calls for an optional alternative to be brought forward .
It has so far been signed by 22 MPs - 14 of them Labour , seven Lib Dem and one Conservative .

What are these ?
It 's remarkable what those fiendish GOP operatives can squeeze into thirty seconds :
Not only does McCain's " celeb " ad have " Barack Obama will rape yo daughters overtones , " says Rick Perlstein ( who 's apparently under the impression that most Americans think of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears as stand - ins for their daughters ) , but it was edited to blatantly evoke Triumph of the Will as well - the better to freak out elderly Jews in South Florida , perhaps .
Comparing the " Celeb " ad to stills from Leni Riefenstahl 's work , Perlstein writes : " I actually wonder if the Republicans had a crew on the scene to capture just the right angles ; for instance , the identical camera placement shooting the speaker over the shoulder at stage right . "
If he actually wonders that , I fear for his sanity .
Here 's a tip for liberals :
If your candidate is going to stage enormous rallies in front of tens of thousands of chanting Germans ( with monuments to Prussian military might in the background ) in the middle of his Presidential campaign , it is n't the GOP 's fault if the footage comes out looking a little like Hitler at Nuremberg .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Obama : McCain sang about bombing Iran RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Foreign policy became a tense subject between the candidates Friday night as they argued over what was best for U.S. involvement in the Middle East .
Sen . John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama for the strategies that " he condemned in Iraq . "
He also lambasted the senator for publicly stating that he was willing to attack Pakistan .
" He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan , now , you do n't do that , you do n't say that out loud , if you have to do things , you have to do things . "
Obama responded by questioning McCain 's own sense of prudence .
" Coming from you , who in the past have threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran , I do n't know how credible that is . "

' And she said - I can't remember the exact words because I was so shaken - something like : " We will talk about this again , " and she turned and walked quickly out of the door . ' "
The global food supply , as recent events have shown all too clearly , is threatened by many problems .
Some of them are man-made ; some are natural .
The natural ones tend to be obvious — droughts , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes — and , in the past year alone , they have been notably devastating .
Searing droughts in Australia and central Europe have squandered wheat supplies ; more recently , Cyclone Nargis destroyed rice stocks for millions of people in Myanmar .
Historically , the damage to food supplies by bad weather has been regarded as fleeting : catastrophic in the short term but ultimately remitting .
Droughts ease , floodwaters recede , and farmers replant their crops .
But as a new government report indicates , such views are increasingly narrow and outdated , in that they fail to acknowledge the creeping reach of global climate change .
The report , released Tuesday , offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at the impact that climate change is expected to have on U.S. agriculture over the next several decades .
Not surprisingly , the prognosis is grim .
Temperatures in the United States , scientists say , will rise on average by about 1.2 degrees Celsius by 2040 , with carbon dioxide levels up more than 15 percent .
The consequences for American - grown food , the report finds , will most likely be far - reaching :
Some crop yields are predicted to drop ; growing seasons will get longer and use more water ; weeds and shrubs will grow faster and spread into new territory , some of it arable farmland ; and insect and crop disease outbreaks will become more frequent .
The new report , which was produced by more than a dozen agencies over multiple years and reflects the findings of more than 1,000 scientific studies , offers only predictions , but the predictions reflect a high degree of confidence .
In a sense , there is a vein of fatalism among most scientists about what will happen in the next few decades .
Government actions , they say , may alter the trajectory of climate change 50 to 100 years from now , but the fate of climate change in the short term has been largely shaped by past behavior , by carbon already released into the atmosphere .
The question now is the extent of its impact .
Some agricultural changes are already observable .
In the central Great Plains , in states known for their grassy prairies and sprawling row crops , there are new neighbors : trees and large shrubs , often clustering in islands in the middle of fields .
In the Southwest , perennial grasses have been largely pushed out by mesquite bushes , those long - rooted staples of the desert .
And the invasive kudzu vine , formerly a nuisance only to the South , has advanced steadily northward , forming a staggered line stretching from Connecticut to Illinois .
Human practices in all three cases have abetted the turnover , but climate change , scientists say , has been a primary driver , as invasive species reproduce more quickly and expand into areas once deemed too cold for their survival .
In turn , high - quality pastureland , once ideal for livestock grazing , has become poor - quality brush , and farmland faces competitors for space .
In the next 30 years these problems will very likely expand and multiply , as an already taxed food system faces threats on multiple fronts .
A rise in temperature — even as little as 1 degree Celsius — could cause many plantings to fail , the report indicates , since pollen and seeds are sensitive to slight temperature changes .
Yields of corn and rice are expected to decline slightly .
Heat - sensitive fruits and vegetables , such as tomatoes , will most likely suffer .
Some of the potential damage will be blunted by higher carbon dioxide levels ; soybean yields , for instance , will probably improve , because soybeans ( and several other crops ) thrive from higher carbon inputs .
But if temperatures keep rising , the balance will ultimately tip :
At some extreme temperature , cells stop dividing , and pollen dies .
High ozone levels , which have risen sixfold in the United States in the past century and are expected to rise further , will suppress yields as well .
In fact , ozone levels are already extremely high in the eastern and midwestern regions of the country , rivaled globally only by eastern China ( no model of air quality , to be sure ) and parts of western Europe .
One recent study , for instance , found that high ozone levels significantly suppress yields of soybean , wheat , and peanuts in the Midwest .
Eventually , the effects of climate change , far from being limited to individual plants , could percolate throughout entire ecosystems .
If springs become warmer , as predicted , the crop - growing season will expand .
Insects and pests , thriving in warmer winters , will reproduce more frequently and spread more rapidly .
Many , in fact , are proliferating already , as reflected in reports of abnormally high rates of disease outbreaks in the western half of the United States .
Higher temperatures also are usually accompanied by declining rainfall , threatening to slowly transform once lush areas into arid expanses .
At the same time , droughts and heavy isolated rainfalls could become more numerous .
The Church of Scientology will be tried in a French court for " organised fraud , " legal sources said Monday .
Founded in the United States in 1954 by science - fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard , the church was officially recognised as a religion there nearly 20 years later .
But it is often accused in France and other European countries , including Belgium , Germany and Greece , of exploiting its members financially .

Thanks to growing fears that the United States has entered a prolonged recession – with some saying we ’re about to see the second Great Depression – the price of oil fell over $ 10 per barrel today and closed below $ 100 for the first time since last Monday .
Most of today ’s market action – marked by the DOW ’s single largest daily point drop , the S&P and NASDAQ both losing roughly nine percent and oil ’s second largest daily price decline – came about thanks to Congress balking at the proposed $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout .
This bailout , which was agreed upon in principle Sunday evening , was meant to help restore confidence in the financial markets by having the Treasury Department buy hard to value mortgage backed securities from struggling financial firms in an effort to get them lending to each other , businesses and consumers .
In addition to the House ’s vote , several European bank failures helped to push the dollar up against the euro .
Â
As I ’m sure you ’ve come to find out over the past several months , a stronger dollar tends to push commodity prices lower .
In turn , the price of gasoline continued to fall , and is now at a national average price of $ 3.60 per gallon .
Â
Currently , Oklahoma is reporting the lowest statewide average price at $ 3.29 per gallon , while Hawaii is reporting the highest statewide average price at $ 4.34 per gallon .
The price of gas has fallen roughly 10 cents over the past week , and is now roughly 13 % below the record highs set back in mid-July .
Â
While this is certainly good news given our weak economy , we still ca n’t take too much solace in the recent price drop , especially considering prices are still 30 % higher than what they were last year .
It ’ll certainly be interesting to see how the markets react tomorrow if some sort of accord is n’t reached tonight or early tomorrow morning regarding the bailout .
Â
( As a side note , I think I ’m for the bailout , but I have n’t completely made up my mind . )
While it would certainly be nice to have oil and gasoline prices contiue to drop , if it means I ’m going to be worried about my job , it ’s not like I ’ll be rejoicing .
Â
And I ’m sure I ’m not alone in this one .
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The federal government would put up as much as $ 700 billion in a far - reaching plan to rescue the nation 's troubled financial system , according to a bill unveiled by lawmakers on Sunday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said she hopes the House will take up the bill on Monday .
Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said he believes the Senate can move on the legislation by Wednesday .
Pelosi said the provisions added by Congress will protect taxpayers from having to pay for the bailout .
" We sent a message to Wall Street - the party is over , " she said at a press conference with Reid and other Democratic leaders from the House and Senate .
The core of the bill is based on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's request for authority to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions so banks can resume lending and so the credit markets , now virtually frozen , can begin to operate more normally .
But Democrats and Republicans - concerned about the potential taxpayer cost - have added several conditions and restrictions to protect taxpayers on the down side and give them a chance at some of the potential upside if the companies benefit from the plan .
" People have to know that this is n't about a bailout of Wall Street .
It 's a buy - in so we can turn our economy around , " Pelosi said .
Key negotiators for the financial rescue plan will be busy trying to line up votes on Capitol Hill on Sunday to support the accord they reached soon after midnight .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , told CNN he believes a majority of representatives on both sides of the aisle can and will support the bill .
President Bush , in a statement Sunday evening , said " this is a difficult vote , but with the improvements made to the bill , I am confident Congress will do what is best for our economy by approving this legislation promptly . "
On Sunday evening , the House Republican working group , which was stringently opposed to earlier drafts of the plan and offered a counterproposal , indicated it would support the bill , and its members are encouraging other Republicans in the House to do the same .
" Nobody wants to have to support this bill , but it 's a bill that we believe will avert the crisis that 's out there , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , told reporters .
Key provisions of the bill
Doling the money out :
The $ 700 billion would be disbursed in stages , with $ 250 billion made available immediately for the Treasury 's use .
Authority to use the money would expire on Dec. 31 , 2009 , unless Congress certifies a one - year extension .
Protecting taxpayers :
The ultimate cost to the taxpayer is not expected to be near the amount the Treasury invests in the program .
That 's because the government would buy assets that have underlying value .
If the Treasury pays fair market value - which investors have had a hard time determining - taxpayers stand a chance to break even or even make a profit if those assets throw off income or appreciate in value by the time the government sells them .
If it overpays for the assets , the government could be left with a net loss but would get something back on the open market for the assets when it eventually sells them .
If it ends up with a net loss , however , the bill says the president must propose legislation to recoup money from the financial industry if the rescue plan results in net losses to taxpayers five years after the plan is enacted .
In addition , Treasury would be allowed to take ownership stakes in participating companies .
Stemming foreclosures :
The bill calls for the government , as an owner of a large number of mortgage securities , to exert influence on loan servicers to modify more troubled loans .
In cases where the government buys troubled mortgage loans directly from banks , it can adjust them more easily .
Limiting executive pay : Curbs would be placed on the compensation of executives at companies that sell mortgage assets to Treasury .
Among them , companies that participate will not be able to deduct the salary they pay to executives above $ 500,000 .
They also will not be allowed to write new contracts that allow for " golden parachutes " for their top 5 executives if they are fired or the company goes belly up .
But the executives ' current contracts , which may include golden parachutes , would still stand .
Overseeing the program :
The bill would establish two oversight boards .
The Financial Stability Oversight Board would be charged with ensuring the policies implemented protect taxpayers and are in the economic interests of the United States .
It will include the Federal Reserve chairman , the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , the Federal Home Finance Agency director , the Housing and Urban Development secretary and the Treasury secretary .
A congressional oversight panel would be charged with reviewing the state of financial markets , the regulatory system and the Treasury 's use of its authority under the rescue plan .
Sitting on the panel would be 5 outside experts appointed by House and Senate leaders .
Insuring against losses : Treasury must establish an insurance program - with risk - based premiums paid by the industry - to guarantee companies ' troubled assets , including mortgage - backed securities , purchased before March 14 , 2008 .
The amount the Treasury would spend to cover losses minus company - paid premiums would come out of the $ 700 billion the Treasury is allowed to use for the rescue plan .
Far - reaching program
Paulson first announced the administration would seek an economic bailout plan on Sept. 18 , after meeting with key lawmakers in the House and Senate - a meeting that left lawmakers looking ashen when they spoke to the press afterwards .
If enacted , the rescue plan would be the most dramatic and extensive government intervention in the economy since the Great Depression .
President Bush on Sept. 24 gave a prime - time address to the nation in which he urged lawmakers to pass his plan and warned that the " entire economy is in danger . "
The aim of the rescue is to unfreeze the credit markets - short - term lending among banks and corporations .
The core of the problem is bad real estate loans that have led to record foreclosures when the housing bubble burst and home prices declined .
In the past two weeks , the banking world and Wall Street have been reordered by a wave of collapses and corporate mergers .
The most recent development was the seizure by federal regulators on Thursday night of Washington Mutual , once the nation 's largest thrift and a major mortgage lender .
The chill of the credit freeze has been felt far beyond Wall Street , as well .
Businesses large and small have seen the cost of borrowing spike higher .
At the same time , the scale of the administration 's plan - and the quick pace of the debate over it - has given pause to many Americans and lawmakers worried about its potential cost to taxpayers .
" We begin with a very important task , a task to stabilize the markets , to protect all Americans - and do it in a way that protects the taxpayer to the maximum extent possible , " Paulson said early Sunday morning .

Believe it or not , it appears the Bush administration has a sane policy on Russia — that is when compared to the policies of the selected candidates Obama and McCain , or rather their advisors , their political Svengalis .
Dead man in Gori : the ultimate result of neocon and neolib anti-Russian policies in the Caucasus .
McCain wants to expel Russia from the G8 and one of his key puppet masters , neocon and former PNAC director Randy Scheunemann , “ spent a number of years lobbying on behalf of Georgia and has publicly taken strong pro-Georgia , anti-Russia positions , ” according to Think Progress .
In fact , as freelance journalist Lindsay Beyerstein notes , Scheunemann is a registered representative of the government of Georgia in the United States and “ has developed a very close relationship with President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili and many senior Georgian officials . ”
In other words , McCain ’s brain is likely all for Georgia ’s brutal invasion of South Ossetia and the mass murder of over two thousand civilians so far .
“ The government of Georgia has called for a cease - fire and for a resumption of direct talks on South Ossetia with international mediators .
The U.S. should immediately convene an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to call on Russia to reverse course , ” declared McCain , that is to say his puppet masters .
“ The US should immediately work with the EU and the OSCE to put diplomatic pressure on Russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen .
We should immediately call a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to assess Georgia ’s security and review measures NATO can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation .
Finally , the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in South Ossetia . ”
Not a word here about the fact Saakashvili invaded South Ossetia , cynically using the opening of the Olympic Games as cover .
Saakashvili “ has involved Russia with opening fire at Russian citizens and peacekeepers .
Now he is trying to involve other states and international organizations , ” Russian Permanent Representative to NATO Dmitry Rogozin told Itar Tass on Friday .
Obama , on the other hand , has Zbigniew Brzezinski leading him around by the nose , the low - level Polish aristocrat whose life has been devoted to hatred of Russia .
Recall Brzezinski’s effort to “ suck ” the Soviet Union into an Afghanistan quagmire .
“ The 1980 Carter Doctrine — that the US was determined to dominate the Persian Gulf — is at the root of the first Gulf War , of the present Iraq war , and of the possible war on Iran .
Brzezinski’s grandiose schemes of world transformation caused a renewal of the Cold War and gave birth to Al - Qaeda , and without Soviet restraint the results could easily have been far more tragic than they turned out to be , ” notes Eric Walberg .
In his book , The Grand Chessboard : American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives , Brzezinski declared Georgia — and Kazakstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Azerbaijan , Armenia — key to his demented effort to destabilize and take down Russia , a nation with a large number of nuclear weapons at its disposal .
No doubt Brzezinski supports and relishes the mass murder currently underway in South Ossetia and apparently Abkhazia as well .
Zbigniew ’s son , Ian , is U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and NATO affairs and a backer of NATO expansion into Ukraine and Georgia .
“ This project means that Americans will be committed to fight and die for a gangster regime in the Caucasus , at the far end of the Black Sea , ” writes Webster G. Tarpley .
Thus , be it Obama or McCain , confrontation with Russia will likely be on the agenda .
If the comparatively lackluster Bush neocon stance toward Russia and China results in the Russian and Chinese militaries conducting joint military exercise involving large numbers of troops and combat vehicles under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , what kind of a response would a McCain or Obama administration elicit ?
Paul Craig Roberts put it succinctly when he said a nuclear exchange between the U.S. and Russia “ would establish the hegemony of the cockroach . ”
It appears both Obama and McCain ’s handlers are apparently determined to make cockroaches the rulers of the world .

McCain campaign co-chair Phil Gramm is right :
We have “ become a nation of whiners . ”
But who is whining more than the bankers that former Sen.
Gramm ’s financial deregulation legislation benefited ?
The very bankers who now expect a government bailout , such as those at UBS Investment Bank , where Gramm found lucrative employment .
As chair of the powerful Senate Banking Committee , Gramm engineered passage of legislation that effectively ended the major regulatory restraints applied to the financial industry in response to the Great Depression .
The purpose of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act — co-authored by Gramm , passed in 1999 by a Republican - controlled Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton — was to liberate the banks , stockbrokers and insurance companies from restraints imposed on their activities more than seven decades ago .
It was legislation that the financial community , which contributed heavily to Gramm ’s campaigns in the previous five years , desperately wanted and obviously has abused .
So why now bail these institutions out ?
Hows about some “ tough love ” for those bankers suddenly in trouble ?
You know , the sink - or - swim approach of “ welfare reform ” that Gramm and Clinton applied to poor people to end their addiction to government handouts .
Or , perhaps a heavy dose of “ faith - based ” personal responsibility initiatives to get those knaves who messed up our entire housing market back on the straight and narrow .
Sounds ridiculous I know , because nothing but the bleeding - heart , big - government , throw - money - at - the - problem approach will do when it comes to salvaging corrupt corporations .
That is the real legacy of what has been ballyhooed as the “ Reagan Revolution , ” which Clinton went along with , but which found its full flowering in the administration of George W. Bush .
The bookends of the Bush years are the Enron debacle and the federal bailout of bankers drunk on their own greed .
And no two people in this country are more responsible for enabling this sordid behavior than the power couple Phil and Wendy Gramm .
Enron , lest we forget , was their baby .
Then - Sen . Gramm sponsored the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 , which allowed Enron ’s scamming to happen .
As Ken Lay , who was chair of Gramm ’s election finance committee , put it quite candidly when asked for the secret of Enron ’s success , “ basically , we are entering or in markets that are deregulating or have recently deregulated . ”
Part of that deregulation involved rulings of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , then chaired by Wendy Gramm , who upon retiring from that post became a highly compensated member of the Enron board of directors , serving for eight years .
She even was on the board ’s audit committee during the time of the corporation ’s despicable financial shenanigans .
While on the Enron board , Wendy Gramm also chaired an anti-regulatory think tank that received funding from Enron and other corporations that benefited directly from the policies her institute espoused .
My point here is not to expose the dubious ethics of the Gramms ’ various business ventures but rather to question why Sen.
John McCain turned to Phil Gramm for leadership in his presidential campaign .
Indeed , until his verbal gaffe , Gramm was highly visible and rumored to be the choice for secretary of the treasury should McCain win .
McCain has long promised voters that he learned the hard lessons provided by his being one of the infamous Keating Five in the nefarious savings and loan scandal that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars .
Yet he chose as his campaign co-chair a former senator whose push for government deregulation facilitated the far deeper scandal we now are experiencing .
Here is a man whose legislation created what financial guru Warren Buffett termed “ financial weapons of mass destruction . ”
Why in the world would you designate as your key economic adviser someone who left the Senate to become an officer of the bank that is at the very center of this mess , a former senator who not only secured highly paid employment with a banking giant that benefited from legislation he helped pass , but who then lobbied Congress for even more of the deregulatory breaks that got the bank into such deep trouble ?
The answer cannot simply be that McCain does n’t care much about economics , as he himself has indicated .
Perhaps that would explain his having voted for all of the measures pushed through the Senate by Gramm .
Perhaps it even would explain McCain ’s having been chair of Gramm ’s own failed presidential bid .
But indifference to economics does not explain the prominence of Gramm in the McCain campaign as the top economic adviser during these past months of the U.S. financial crisis .
Indifference to the folks losing their homes is a more plausible explanation .

Barack Obama on Gun Control Junior Senator ( IL ) ; President - Elect
Opposed bill okaying illegal gun use in home invasions
In March 2004 , the Illinois Senate passed Senate Bill 2165 , a law introduced in response to DeMar 's case , with provisions designed to assert a right of citizens to protect themselves against home invasions , such that self - defense requirements would be viewed to take precedence over local ordinances against handgun possession .
The measure passed the Illinois Senate by a vote of 38 - 20 .
Barack Obama was one of the 20 state senators voting against the measure .
Governor Rod Blagojevich vetoed the bill .
On Nov. 9 , 2004 , the Illinois Senate voted 40 - 18 to override Blagojevich 's veto .
Again , Obama acted against the bill .
On Nov. 17 , the Illinois House voted overwhelmingly , 85 - 30 , to override the governor 's veto and Senate Bill 2165 became law .
Ok for states & cities to determine local gun laws
A : As a general principle , I believe that the Constitution confers an individual right to bear arms .
But just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government can’t constrain the exercise of that right , in the same way that we have a right to private property but local governments can establish zoning ordinances that determine how you can use it .
Q : But do you still favor the registration & licensing of guns ?
A : I think we can provide common - sense approaches to the issue of illegal guns that are ending up on the streets .
We can make sure that criminals do n’t have guns in their hands .
We can make certain that those who are mentally deranged are not getting a hold of handguns .
We can trace guns that have been used in crimes to unscrupulous gun dealers that may be selling to straw purchasers and dumping them on the streets .
Source : 2008 Philadelphia primary debate , on eve of PA primary Apr 16 , 2008
FactCheck : Yes , Obama endorsed Illinois handgun ban
Actually , Obama ’s writing was on the 1996 document , which was filed when Obama was running for the Illinois state Senate .
A Chicago nonprofit , Independent Voters of Illinois , had this question , and Obama took hard line :
35 .
Do you support state legislation to :
a. ban the manufacture , sale and possession of handguns ?
Yes .
b. ban assault weapons ?
Yes .
c. mandatory waiting periods and background checks ?
Yes .
Obama ’s campaign said , “ Sen . Obama did n’t fill out these state Senate questionnaires - - a staffer did -- and there are several answers that did n’t reflect his views then or now .
He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire , but some answers did n’t reflect his views . ”

April 2008 : " Bittergate " labeled Obama elitist
Clinton said the remarks were " not reflective of the values and beliefs of Americans . "
McCain said Obama showed " breathtaking " elitism .
Obama challenged the accusations , and noted in response to the charge of elitism that he had been raised by a single mother who relied on food stamps , but conceded he could have been more diplomatic .
Respect 2nd Amendment , but local gun bans ok
A : Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country .
I think it ’s important for us to recognize that we ’ve got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally .
And a lot of law - abiding citizens use it for hunting , for sportsmanship , and for protecting their families .
We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage .
And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets .
And cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children , the mentally ill .
We can have reasonable , thoughtful gun control measure that I think respect the Second Amendment and people ’s traditions .
Source : 2008 Politico pre-Potomac Primary interview Feb 11 , 2008
Provide some common - sense enforcement on gun licensing
A : I do n’t think that we can get that done .
But what we can do is to provide just some common - sense enforcement .
The efforts by law enforcement to obtain the information required to trace back guns that have been used in crimes to unscrupulous gun dealers .
As president , I intend to make it happen .
We essentially have two realities , when it comes to guns , in this country .
You ’ve got the tradition of lawful gun ownership .
It is very important for many Americans to be able to hunt , fish , take their kids out , teach them how to shoot .
Then you ’ve got the reality of 34 Chicago public school students who get shot down on the streets of Chicago .
We can reconcile those two realities by making sure the Second Amendment is respected and that people are able to lawfully own guns , but that we also start cracking down on the kinds of abuses of firearms that we see on the streets .

2000 : cosponsored bill to limit purchases to 1 gun per month

Concealed carry OK for retired police officers
When I queried him about the vote , he said , “ I did n’t find that [ vote ] surprising .
I am consistently on record and will continue to be on record as opposing concealed carry .
This was a narrow exception in an exceptional circumstance where a retired police officer might find himself vulnerable as a consequence of the work he has previously done -- and had been trained extensively in the proper use of firearms . “
It was n’t until a few weeks later that another theory came forward about the uncharacteristic vote .
Obama was battling with his GOP opponent to win the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police .
Stop unscrupulous gun dealers dumping guns in cities
A : You know , when the massacre happened at Virginia Tech , I think all of us were grief stricken and shocked by the carnage .
But in this year alone , in Chicago , we ’ve had 34 Chicago public school students gunned down and killed .
And for the most part , there has been silence .
We know what to do .
We ’ve got to enforce the gun laws that are on the books .
We ’ve got to make sure that unscrupulous gun dealers are n’t loading up vans and dumping guns in our communities , because we know they ’re not made in our communities .
There are n’t any gun manufacturers here , right here in the middle of Detroit .
But what we also have to do is to make sure that we change our politics so that we care just as much about those 30 - some children in Chicago who ’ve been shot as we do the children in Virginia Tech .
That ’s a mindset that we have to have in the White House and we do n’t have it right now .

Keep guns out of inner cities -- but also problem of morality
Source : The Audacity of Hope , by Barack Obama , p.215 Oct 1 , 2006
Bush erred in failing to renew assault weapons ban
OBAMA : Let ’s be honest .
Mr. Keyes does not believe in common gun control measures like the assault weapons bill .
Mr. Keyes does not believe in any limits from what I can tell with respect to the possession of guns , including assault weapons that have only one purpose , to kill people .
I think it is a scandal that this president did not authorize a renewal of the assault weapons ban .
Ban semi-automatics , and more possession restrictions
Principles that Obama supports on gun issues :
Ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons .
Increase state restrictions on the purchase and possession of firearms .
Require manufacturers to provide child - safety locks with firearms .
Source : 1998 IL State Legislative National Political Awareness Test Jul 2 , 1998
Voted NO on prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers .
Exempt lawsuits brought against individuals who knowingly transfer a firearm that will be used to commit a violent or drug - trafficking crime
Exempt lawsuits against actions that result in death , physical injury or property damage due solely to a product defect
Call for the dismissal of all qualified civil liability actions pending on the date of enactment by the court in which the action was brought
Prohibit the manufacture , import , sale or delivery of armor piercing ammunition , and sets a minimum prison term of 15 years for violations
Require all licensed importers , manufacturers and dealers who engage in the transfer of handguns to provide secure gun storage or safety devices

As Australia experiences its worst drought in 100 years , farmers and residents across Australia 's " food bowl " - the Murray Darling Basin - describe how it has affected their lives .
MIKAELA SAUNDERS , 10 - YEAR - OLD STUDENT , MILDURA , NSW I looked around and the vegetation was all dying .
The Murray River brings life to our area .
We need it for our drinking water , and the irrigators need it to water their crops and supply our food .
We have a lot of tourism here because of the mighty Murray .
But recently we visited Wallpolla Island , right next to the Murray River .
As we arrived , we crossed onto the island where water used to block the way .
When we went , there were rocks on the ground where the water should have been very deep .
Sadly it had dried up because of the terrible drought .
I looked around and the vegetation was all dying .
The biggest tree in the area , a River Red Gum , estimated to be over 300 years old , looked dreadful !
A River Red Gum tree .
Enlarge Image
Almost all of the trees were dead or dying and , therefore , the wildlife was scarce .
Birds used to fly over and breed in this area .
Now all the vegetation had shrivelled up .
This area needs emergency watering .
But I think it is too late ...
There are many other places along the Murray just like this one .
In some of these areas the drought has won !
Return to map BEVERLEY ROSE , CATTLE FARMER , COLEAMBALLY , NSW Farmers are very proud people .
They would just like to be able to get on with what they do best - farm .
My family came to Coleambally Irrigation Area in 1963 , from Victoria where we worked on a dairy farm .
My late husband and his father drew this block of land in a ballot .
We were 20th Century pioneers .
Schools , the shopping centre , the medical centre and other community centres are all in jeopardy if this drought continues .
We have 0 % allocation of irrigation water and water is astronomically expensive .
There is some drought assistance but not everyone is eligible and not everyone wishes to be given a handout .
Farmers are very proud people .
They would just like to be able to get on with what they do best - farm .
The only rice crops being grown in the Coleambally area now are those on the big bore blocks [ a borehole is a shaft drilled into the ground for extracting water ] .
Our irrigations farms are set up to run water , not to harvest it - so we have had to put down domestic bores so we can give water to our cattle .
The government is in the water market for " water for rivers " and " water for the environment " but not - it seems - " water for food . "
In pictures : Impact of the drought
It is buying up water and water entitlements from willing sellers .
Older farmers - who have spent their savings hand feeding and watering animals - have sold the water so they can retire .
When it comes to the younger generation , women have gone back to work if they can find it and men have gone to the mines .
Will they ever come back to work on the farms ?
What will happen to our communities ?
Rain is the only answer .
Return to map MARG WATERS , RETIRED TEACHER , BENALLA , VICTORIA
We learned to use ' grey water ' , which is water collected from washing machines and even the kitchen sink .
I live in the small rural town of Benalla .
All of the rivers in this area rise in the nearby mountains .
These flow into larger rivers and eventually into the Murray River .
Our main river in Benalla is the Broken River .
We have experienced many years of drought , but for us it has been particularly bad in the last four years .
Many seasonal creeks in this area have not flowed for a number of years .
The summer of 2006 / 07 was the worst in living memory .
We just did not have water here .
Creeks and rivers that normally flow dried up !
This included those that supply our town 's water .
We learned to use ' grey water ' , which is water collected from washing machines , the shower , and even the kitchen sink , to put on gardens .
Many people still collect the water .
A new industry emerged with businesses actually setting up watering systems in home gardens to continue this practice .
In pictures : Dry lakes in Benalla
Water is also pumped from the Broken River for farm needs .
This is not irrigation , but a means for keeping stock alive .
If water is not available then the crops fail - and livelihoods are ruined .
With so much doubt about getting water many farmers have downsized their crop or stock .
Buying stock and grain is expensive which means food has also become quite expensive .
Return to map PAUL MARTIN , ALMOND GROWER , LINDSAY POINT , SOUTH AUSTRALIA
I am a positive person and still feel we can make it through the tough times , but these are the toughest I have faced .
We do not get enough rain to grow a crop like almonds .
The summers are very dry and hot .
The trees here would die without irrigation and I rely almost entirely on irrigation water from the Murray River .
Last year we received less than half our allocation .
It was our first big water cut and I had to buy temporary water from farmers upstream .
These farmers made more by selling their temporary water to me than they could by growing cash crops of wheat or cattle feed .
This enabled me to finish my crop and grow my young trees .
But it also sent me into debt with the bank .
The drought has sapped a lot of money , buying water , putting new drip irrigation in place , replanting old trees with small trees that will use less water in the first few years .
The cost is eating into our bank loan , and I have to think about using the reserves we put aside for retirement .

I really do n't know when it will end .
I am happy to put money into buying water and increasing my water - use efficiency for one year .
But we are now facing a second year .
I feel under stress at times .
It makes me a little irritable , which can affect the family .
Sleep is not so sound any more .
I am generally a positive person and still feel we can make it through the tough times , but these are the toughest I have faced in my 36 years of farming .

We are all going through extremely difficult times financially and emotionally
I grow winegrape and citrus in Riverland , South Australia .
My crop production is dependent on the Murray Darling basin and I extract water from the Yatco Lagoon , a large and shallow backwater upstream .
There are a number of irrigators here , all family businesses , farming winegrape , citrus , olive , vegetable and fodder crops .
The Yatco lagoon community and landholders have been significantly affected by the drought for years , through reduced water allocations and increasing water salinity levels .
So in 2006 we formed the Yatco Wetland Landcare Group as it became increasingly clear that sustainable farming in this community was dependent on the management of our ecological assets .
We have put in place various measures such as building an earthen bank to achieve evaporative water savings - this was one short term measure to combat drought .
But we also have other plans which could lead to big improvements in the health of these wetlands .
In pictures :
The story of Yatco lagoon Hopefully these will ' drought proof ' this River Murray community and its associated industries .
The project has given the Moorook township something to be very proud of in these tough times .
We are all going through extremely difficult times financially and emotionally , but we are all determined to improve the general health of the wetland for the next generation .
Return to map PAUL MARTIN , HOUSEBOAT HIRER , RENMARK , S AUSTRALIA / VICTORIA
Our houseboat bookings have been reduced by almost 50 %
I am the owner / manager of a houseboat hire company , Customs House Houseboats .
We are located on the River Murray and are dependent on the Murray - Darling system for our domestic and commercial water supply and for our houseboats to be able to travel up and down the river .
Our water levels here are currently maintained .
But further downstream the water levels are much lower and every time the media print reports and photos of these low levels , the general public and our future hirers think this applies to the river as a whole .
A large percentage of our repeat hirers are farmers .
As the drought has affected their crops and income , either by low rainfall and or reduced water for irrigation , these people do not have the money to spare on a houseboat holiday .
Our houseboat bookings have been reduced by almost 50 % and the income of our general store is down about 50 % on previous years .
There are still tourists coming to the area but we are definitely seeing less of them .
Water levels are currently maintained in the Kennedy 's stretch of river .
Our lives are quieter and the phone does n't ring as often .
But on the up side , we have caught up with our maintenance work , created new advertising plans and painted the premises .
We are lucky that our landscape remains unaffected at present .
If the drought continues , this will certainly change .
The future is unknown , but we remain optimistic .
It will rain again !
Return to map RITA BOWLER , HOLBROOK , NEW SOUTH WALES Lake Hume is at less than 50 percent capacity I live on a family farm inherited from my husband 's grandfather .
We have n't been hit so bad yet .
But not far from here , in Albury , there is a major water shortage at Lake Hume .
It 's at less than 50 % of its capacity .
There 's a paddle steamer called the Cumberoona there , and people used to pay to go for a ride up and down the water .
The water is so low now that they can barely float it .
It 's sitting high and dry on the banks of the lake .
I do not know what people are doing - many might be reconsidering their futures .
The drought has other implications too .
The wombats have come out of the nearby national parks because of the lack of feed .
Unfortunately they have moved into areas such as our cropping paddock , and along the watercourses , in search of food .
The Cumberoona paddle steamer has been stranded on the banks
This is quite a problem when they take up residence in the middle of a paddock which you are trying to drive machinery over .
The wombats are a protected species so we are not permitted to do anything about removing them either .
Every living thing seems to be affected .

What are these ?
MEXICO CITY , June 26 ( Reuters ) - Crude output from Mexico ’s struggling Cantarell oil field fell in May for the eighth month in a row to 1.038 million barrels per day , its lowest level in more than 12 years , Energy Ministry data showed on Thursday .
The fading jewel of Mexico ’s oil industry , Cantarell has declined rapidly since 2004 and is pulling down overall oil production in the world ’s No. 6 oil - producing nation , threatening Mexico ’s status as a top supplier to the United States .
The field ’s waning yields are putting pressure on the government to overcome opposition in Congress to its proposal to overhaul the oil industry by lowering barriers to private investment as a way to speed up new drilling projects .
Cantarell for years produced 60 percent of Mexico ’s crude oil , and production peaked at around 2 million barrels per day in 2004 .
But its
May output fell again , from 1.074 million bpd in April , to stand at its lowest level since January 1996 , according to Energy Ministry data .
Cantarell , which state oil monopoly Pemex sees declining at around 15 percent annually , accounted for just 37 percent of Mexico ’s May oil production , down from 39 percent in April .
Pemex is battling to increase output at less productive fields , such as the offshore Ku Maloob Zaap complex and the technically tricky onshore Chicontepec field .
Pemex also wants to reach potentially huge deep - sea oil deposits in the Gulf of Mexico , but says that without an easing of constitutional laws against taking on foreign partners , it could be 20 years before it is producing deepwater oil .
Energy Minister Georgina Kessel says that without reform , Mexico ’s oil output could shrink to half its size by 2021 .

4. 9 to 5 — Dolly Parton , for the Jane Fonda movie Nine to Five ( 1985 )
You ’re just a step on the boss man ’s ladder , but that does n’t matter , because Dolly Parton just empowered you — and millions of other working women like you — to claim your own rung .
Both the song and movie are named after a nonprofit founded to improve treatment of women at the workplace .
Best lyrics :
Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen ;
pour myself a cup of ambition ,

out on the street , the traffic starts jumping ,
with folks like me on the job from nine to five .

Still , it bounces along .
Best lyrics :
I work all night , I work all day , to pay the bills I have to pay
Ai n’t it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me

If I got me a wealthy man
I would n’t have to work at all , I ’d fool around and have a ball

Summer ’s next album came out through a different label .
Best lyrics :
It ’s a sacrifice working day to day

just to hear them say that they care
She works hard for the money
so hard for it honey
she works hard for the money
so you better treat her right
11 . How to be a Millionaire — ABC , How to Be a…Zillionaire ! ( 1985 )
ABC first came together in England in 1980 .
According to the biography on the band ’s website ,
If tomorrow a bunch of white northern students decided to form a band inspired not by the integrated - to - the - point - of - invisibility Beatles - Kinks - Stones but instead by the collective irrationality and transcendent imaginations of Aphex Twin , N*E* R*D and The Beta Band , you ’d still only be halfway towards understanding just how fundamental a break with tradition ABC effected in that period between punk and Madchester / grunge .
Dang .
This whole time , I thought ABC was all about lighthearted booty shaking .
Best lyrics :
I ’ve seen the future , I ca n’t afford it
Tell me the truth sir , someone just bought it
Say mr. whispers !
here come the click of dice
Roulette and blackjacks – gonna build us a paradise
Larger than life and twice as ugly
If we have to live there , you ’ll have to drug me

Best lyrics :
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket , win a lottery ,
Scoop the pearls up from the sea

I know theyre stolen , but I dont feel bad .
I take that money , buy you things you never had .

Of strife and upheaval .
But I ’m certain , honey , that life would be sunny
With plenty of money and you .

And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
Say a prayer for the Pretender
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender

Officials say the plane could belong to a Cambodian airline
Vietnamese authorities say they are mystified as to who owns a Boeing 727 which has been abandoned at Hanoi 's Noi Bai airport .
The plane was flown in from Siem Reap in neighbouring Cambodia in late 2007 and has been unclaimed ever since .
An airport official told the BBC that they believe the owners could be an airline based in Cambodia .
The official said that if it remains unclaimed , the plane will have to be sent for scrap .
The plane has a Cambodian flag on its fuselage and is emblazoned with the name Air Dream , but the authorities say they have no information about the airline .
Earlier , one security official at Noi Bai airport told the BBC's Vietnamese Service that the plane belongs to bankrupt budget Cambodian airline Royal Khmer , but this is not certain .
Permission was originally given for the plane to remain at the airport while essential maintenance was carried out but these repairs have not been done .
Online newspaper VietnamNet reported that the owners could be unable or unwilling to pay the required airport parking fees .
Wind - bells tinkle and cypresses sway in the breeze .
The sun casts sharp shadows across an undulating landscape .
There are strange concrete forms everywhere : giant open vaults , painted half - domes with strange crests , an amphitheatre ringed by buildings with giant circular openings , little houses sunk into the hillside .
Healthy - looking , vaguely hippy - ish people , young and old , stride about in dusty jeans and T - shirts .
Beyond are the scrub - covered hills of the Sonoran desert .
This not your typical American settlement .
In fact , it 's not your typical Earth settlement .
For one thing , there are no cars or roads .
Everything is connected by winding footpaths .
Nor are there shops , billboards , or any other garish commercial intrusion .
It looks like the set of a sci - fi movie designed by Le Corbusier .
Round the next corner , you might expect to bump into Luke Skywalker , or Socrates , or a troupe of dancers doing Aquarius .
This is Arcosanti , 70 miles from Phoenix , Arizona .
It 's a curious taste of what an environmentally friendly US town could look like , but probably never will .
It was designed by Paolo Soleri , an Italian - born architect , who originally came to Arizona to work for Frank Lloyd Wright , but soon set off on his own idiosyncratic path .
Soleri is a genuine visionary architect .
In the early 1970s , his designs and fantastical writings made him a big - hitter in architectural circles , up there with other postwar sci- fi modernists such as Buckminster Fuller .
Then he all but disappeared , becoming , for the past 30 years , little more than an obscure curiosity .
Yet today , as the world wakes up to the grim realities of climate change , peak oil and sustainability , Soleri 's path looks less idiosyncratic .
In fact , he 's now something of a guru : in demand on the lecture circuit and , recently , offering sage advice in Leonardo DiCaprio's " how can we save the world ? " documentary The 11th Hour .
Soleri invented " ecotecture " before the word even existed .
In the 1960s , he derived a similar term , " arcology " , to describe low - impact , environmentally oriented design .
But Soleri 's arcology went beyond mere architecture .
He developed an entire philosophy of civilisation , laid out in his 1969 book , The City in the Image of Man .
It is a wondrous tome , full of lucid rhetoric , almost impenetrable diagrams and spectacular drawings of " arcologies " : fantasy cities of the future intricately rendered .
Rather than inefficient , land - hungry , low - rise , car - dependent cities ( like nearby Phoenix ) , Soleri 's arcologies are dense , compact , car - free , and low - energy .
Their gigantic structures leave nature unspoilt and readily accessible .
Some are hundreds of metres high , designed to accommodate six million people ; others are built on top of dams , or form artificial canyons , or float in the open sea .
Four decades on , Soleri is still happy to expound on the state and the fate of the city .
He welcomes me to Arcosanti , then gets straight down to business , explaining what he tried to set up here by first rounding on his old mentor Frank Lloyd Wright for glamorising suburbia .
This , says Soleri , actually leads to the breakdown of the city , as what he calls " the hermitage " begins : " Instead of people gathering to develop a culture , they want to escape from other people .
Individuals believe they can reach a level of self - sufficiency that can isolate them - or their family - in an ideal place .
Then they somehow expect the civilisation that has made them to serve them .
It 's a parasitic kind of life . "
In the 1970s , Soleri 's vision of an alternative drew hundreds of student volunteers from all over the world to build Arcosanti , a prototype arcology with a projected population of 5,000 .
They worked for free in the sweltering heat , sleeping outside and learning from the master - who , judging by the photos , was usually to be found in swimming trunks and a short - sleeved shirt , digging alongside them .
" It was not a community for community 's sake , eating tofu and giving each other back rubs , " says Roger Tomalty , who oversaw construction .
" It was the opposite of the hippy scene : a community of construction workers .
If you were going to be here , you were going to work - harder than you 'd ever worked in your life . "
In the 1950s , Soleri built a base in Scottsdale , a desert town that has since been engulfed by Phoenix .
He still lives there now .
Named Cosanti , it was the prototype for Arcosanti : a complex of experimental , sculptural buildings born of low - energy construction methods such as " earthcasting " : build a mound of earth , pour a layer of concrete over it , take away the earth and , hey presto , you 've got a dome .
Curiously , Soleri 's main source of income was not architecture but windbells .
Soleri wind - bells , cast from ceramic and bronze , still sell well .
The windbell money , combined with lecture circuit cash , meant Soleri could buy the land for Arcosanti outright .
" It was very exciting , " says Tomalty .
" Paolo was central to everything .
He was an unbelievably dynamic speaker .
Everywhere he went , his energy was obvious .
Through word of mouth , a steady stream of people came .
We had to send people away in the end .
The kitchen could n't cook more than 1,000 meals a day . "
Many of these people are still here .
Tomalty 's wife , Mary , for example , is Soleri 's assistant ; there 's Carri , who does the guided tours ; and Sue , who manages the archive , which contains vast scroll paintings by Soleri , one chronicling the intellectual evolution of mankind .
It 's 170 ft long .
Here , too , are sketchbooks , masterplans , essays , photos and press cuttings .
One clipping is from the Guardian , recording Soleri 's 1973 visit to London .
" It may all sound impossibly utopian , " the reporter writes of his arcological doctrine , " but at least Soleri is having a try . "
Unfortunately , Arcosanti does n't seem to have got much further since .
Only 3 % of the original design has been built ; the rest does n't look likely to spring out of the desert any time soon .
Arcosanti never quite achieved the critical mass it needed .
Its population reached a peak of about 200 in the mid-1970s , but today is lower than 60 .
That 1970s idealism gave way to 1980s " me generation " priorities and people moved on to " proper jobs " , Tomalty says .
A regular flow of students still passes through , but they treat it more as a five - week work experience than an open - ended lifestyle experiment .
Soleri has slowed as well .
Already in his 50s when he started Arcosanti , he is now 89 , still fit and articulate , but that once hypnotic voice is now a hushed murmur , barely audible above the desert wind .
" The main fault is me , " he says when I ask him why Arcosanti has not been completed .
" I do n't have the gift of proselytising .
For years and years , they responded to me like , ' That crazy guy , what is he doing out there ? ' "
Inevitably , the real reason for Arcosanti's incomplete state is money .
Visionary he might be , but Soleri never seems too bothered with finance .
Did he really expect to be able to build a city by selling wind - bells ?
Soleri laughs .
" I was driven by emotions .
I never sat down and said , ' What am I going to do now ? '
I was too busy . "
But , I ask , is it possible to build a utopia without money ?
" Uh-oh , " says Mary .
Soleri mimes a curtain coming down and a bell chiming , as if the interview has ended .
I 've said the u-word , clearly in breach of house rules .
But would n't Soleri describe himself as a utopian ?
" Oh Jesus ! " he says , as if affronted that I 've repeated the word .
" Utopia is a pretty stupid notion .
It says if any group anywhere develops some ideal condition , this condition is legitimate .
And I say , ' Forget it ! '
If you are surrounded by all sorts of demeaning or painful conditions , then ' utopia ' is just an arrogant notion that has no room for evolution . "
But is Soleri guilty of a little arrogance himself ?
Utopian or not , his vision was never particularly practicable .
Rather than addressing the problems of the existing urban realm , Soleri wants to build a new world , to his masterplan .
This was always going to be a challenge , especially with limited cash .
The tragedy is that , judging by the buildings completed at Arcosanti , Soleri was a terrific architect .
These are mostly bare - faced concrete , but they incorporate wood , murals , tiles and intricate details that lend them a homely , handbuilt quality , like the best of Le Corbusier 's later work .
They might have taken a long time to build , but they possess a spatial richness and geometric coherence that most modern boxes lack , both inside and out .
And they are exemplary in their incorporation of simple , low - tech environmental principles .
Concrete apses are oriented to capture the heat and light of the low winter sun , yet also provide shade when it is at its highest in summer .
And the roads , of course , are relegated to the perimeter .
Later phases in Arcosanti's design would have called for 25 - storey towers , transforming the village - like settlement into a dense city .
They would n't be difficult to construct .
If this was China , you could probably complete Arcosanti in about a year .
But what exists there already is rather compelling - a persuasive alternative to current urbanism .
In fact , it could represent the kind of sustainable , low - energy lives we are belatedly coming to realise we should have been living all along .
Rather than a " crazy guy " ranting in the wilderness , Soleri has proved to be a voice of reason .
Nobody wanted to hear his diagnosis of the ills of US society , but it has been proved right - the car - centric , inefficient , horizontal suburban model has left us in poor shape to cope with climate - change problems .
Yet Soleri is sceptical of new - found admirers of his philosophy .
" They take a very shallow understanding of it , " he says .
In Soleri 's view , we need to reformulate , rather than simply reform , our strategy for civilisation .
His outlook is not hopeful .
" Materialism is , by definition , the antithesis of green , " he says .
" We have this unstoppable , energetic , self - righteous drive that 's innate in us , but which has been reoriented by limitless consumption .
Per se , it does n't have anything evil about it .
It 's a hindrance .
But multiply that hindrance by billions , and you 've got catastrophe . "
Soleri long ago came to terms with the fact that Arcosanti will not be completed in his lifetime .
What will happen after his death is up for debate .
Some trustees of the Arcosanti Foundation want to see it completed to his original vision ; others think it should be opened up to other architects , or even turned into a health spa to generate revenue .
Soleri suggests it could be sold to a university or architectural research organisation .
Whatever happens , Soleri 's ideas could well be of benefit to future architects , if not as a wholesale solution , then at least as a source of inspiration .
Perhaps Soleri was simply too far ahead of his time .
" I 've put quite a lot of work into this , " he says , looking out over his domain .
" But there 's no point in sitting and moaning " .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that North Korea remained -- for now -- part of what he once branded an “ axis of evil ” , but hoped the list would some day be empty .

Bush , in his 2002 State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress , accused Pyongyang , Iran and Iraq of seeking weapons of mass destruction that could be used for attacks on U.S. allies or to blackmail the United States .
But recent steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons , including declaring nuclear program details and blowing up a water cooling tower at its ageing Yongbyon plant , had raised questions whether it might be removed from the list .
“ That ’s to be determined .
The human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist , ” Bush said after meeting South Korean President Lee Myung - bak .
“ The North Korean leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program . ”
“ In order to get off the list , the ‘ axis of evil ’ list , then the North Korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t predict the North Korean leader ’s decision making . ”
Bush praised the demolition of the cooling tower as a “ positive step ” .
He has already proposed dropping North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism as early as next week if Pyongyang agrees to a plan for verifying details about its nuclear weapons program .
But most experts expect that will take longer .
Critics said the label was inaccurate and confrontational when he should have focused more on diplomacy .
The White House has said Bush did pursue diplomatic means to avoid the Iraq war .
Iraq was effectively dropped from the list after the United States led a coalition of forces to oust Saddam Hussein .
However , no nuclear weapons were found in Iraq despite Bush administration pronouncements Baghdad had a program to develop them .
Iran remains atop the “ axis of evil ” roster because of a stalemate over halting its uranium enrichment program .
Washington worries Iran wants an atomic weapon but Tehran insists it is only seeking civilian nuclear energy .
“ My hope is that the ‘ axis of evil ’ list no longer exists , ” Bush said .
“ That ’s my hope for the sake of peace .
It ’s my hope for the sake of our children . ”
Interview : Javier Paniza on OpenXava and Open Source
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 15 , 2008
Are you familiar with OpenXava ?
Not everyone is , but it has big fans in the Java development community .
It 's a popular web application framework for developing business applications .
It generates Java ( JavaEE / J2EE ) web applications that can be deployed on any Java Portal Server as portlet applications .
OpenXava is noted for saving developers programming time by delivering business components that they can adjust , rather than making them build applications from the ground up .
Javier Paniza , Creator and Lead Developer , checked in with us on where OpenXava is going and other open source goings on .
OStatic : A lot has been said about the reason people contribute to Open Source .
What are your reasons for getting involved ?
Javier Paniza : I initally created this project because I was obsessed by the idea of being productive in creating business applications using Java and OOP .
Java is very portable and scalable , but is not productive in development terms .
That 's especially true if you compare it with the traditional alternatives , such as 4GL , RPG , Visual Basic , etc. OpenXava achieves this goal : productivity with Java for creating business applications .
OStatic : What technologies does OpenXava use ?
Javier Paniza : OpenXava is a model - driven framework .
That is , you write your model classes , the Java classes that represent the business concepts , and OpenXava provides you a complete application , ready for production .
The base source for the applications is Java POJOs annotated with Java annotations .
The application you end up with is a Java Web application deployable on any Java application server .
OpenXava also generates Java Portlets ( JSR - 168 ) deployabled in any Java Portal ( such as Liferay , Jetspeed or WebSphere Portal ) .
Since version 3.1 ( now in beta ) , it supports AJAX .
OStatic :
What products are your closest alternatives ?
What advantages / disadvantages does OpenXava have compared to them ?
Javier Paniza : With regard to NakedObjects , and RomaFramework , OpenXava uses Java POJOs with JPA ( standard and very common ) while these frameworks use propietary conventions .
OpenXava also has better layout possibilites .
OpenXava produces portal applications while these frameworks produces plain web applications .
Regarding JMatter , it also uses propietary conventions .
OpenXava produces web and portal applications while JMatter produces desktop applications .
Trails is another alternative , but OpenXava has better layout possibilites .
OStatic : Who is your typical user ?
Javier Paniza : Java developers that want to develop business applications using Java EE , looking for productivity .
Javier Paniza : Version 3.1 will suport AJAX .
Version 3.2 will have a more rich UI by means of a JavaScript toolkit , maybe jQuery UI , Dojo , YUI or Scriptaculous .
There are a lot of exciting possibilities for version 4.0 , but the shape of the version 4 is not defined yet , it depenss on the comunity feedbackand work .
OStatic : How would you say OpenXava benefits from being open source ?
Javier Paniza :
The benefits have been great , and very sweet .
OpenXava evolved from a project used by 5 to 10 developers and developed by only one -- me -- to a project with more than 20 committers and used all around the globe , with more than 70,000 downloads now .
OStatic : How have you monetized your project thus far ?
Javier Paniza : OpenXava has no business model .
Indeed , a true open source project cannot have a business model because an open source project is not from a company or individual , but a creation shared by a community .
On the other hand , it 's possible for a company to have a business model around an open source project , but this was not the case until now for OpenXava .
Currently it is used inside Gestión 400 for creating the commercial business applications that Gestión 400 sells , and in exchange Gestión 400 sponsors OpenXava as open source project .
Also , recently some companies have asked us for training on OpenXava .
OStatic : Thanks , Javier .
Monday August 11 2008
The flare - up of major hostilities between Russia and Georgia has been dubbed by some " the pipeline war " .
The landlocked Caspian sea's huge oil reserves are a factor , especially since Georgia became a key transit country for oil to travel from Baku in Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean .
The pipeline , which was completed in May 2006 , is the second longest in the world .
Although its route was chosen in order to bypass Russia , denying Moscow leverage over a key resource and a potential source of pressure , the current crisis in the Caucasus is about issues far bigger than oil .
The Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation : an attempt , sponsored largely by the United States but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex-Soviet allies , to reduce every aspect of Russian influence throughout the region , whether it be economic , political , diplomatic or military .
Georgia 's President Mikheil Saakashvili is the region 's most enthusiastic proponent of this strategy .
His " pipeline neighbours " , Azerbaijan and Turkey , are less virulent .
They have been trying to reap the economic benefits of Caspian oil while keeping good relations with Russia and avoiding provocations .
The question now is whether Saakashvili has over - reached himself .
Has his escalation of the South Ossetian crisis done more than destroy any chance of normalising Georgian relations with Russia as long as he remains president ?
Has it reinforced his image among many western leaders as a hothead , and set back his hopes of getting a promise from Nato this autumn to start membership proceedings ?
France and Germany led Nato 's cautious camp in April when they forced President Bush to delay a membership action plan for Georgia for months .
Their argument that Georgia is not yet ready may well be strengthened now .
The sudden crisis has put the United States on the spot .
While supporting Georgia 's Nato ambitions , the White House was leery of military action , knowing it could do little in the face of a powerful Russian response .
Visiting the former Soviet republic in 2005 , President Bush urged Saakashvili to keep cool .
" Georgia 's leaders know that the peaceful resolution of conflict is essential to your integration into the transatlantic community , " he told a huge rally in Tbilisi .
Saakashvili's supporters claim Nato 's delay was what emboldened Russia to stir up tension in Abkhazia ( the other rebel area of Georgia ) and South Ossetia this spring and summer .
" It was interpreted by the Russians as a window of opportunity , " George Kandelaki , deputy chair of the Georgian parliament 's foreign relations committee , said yesterday .
Like other Georgians , he argued that it was not his country 's forces that took the initiative last week for escalation in what had been in recent months a low level , tit - for - tat series of border incidents .
The fighting backfired , and the Russian counteroffensive now seems aimed at capturing the 40 % of South Ossetia which was under Georgian control until last week .
" They [ the Russians ] control pretty much all of South Ossetia now , " Kandelaki said , adding : " They 're trying to take over all of Abkhazia . "
If the Russians succeed , they will have to decide whether to keep the newly acquired territory as a bargaining chip for negotiations with Saakashvili , or go to the extreme of encouraging South Ossetia , now unified , to do what most of its inhabitants want - proclaim independence from Georgia and a referendum on joining North Ossetia , its ethnic twin on the northern side of the Caucasus mountains .
Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , hinted at the tougher option , when he told Ossetian refugees this weekend that Georgia had lost the right to rule the territory .
When the fighting ends and the dust settles , Saakashvili may also face an onslaught from his political opposition in Georgia .
In the heat of battle , parliamentary leaders have rallied round the national flag , but if a ceasefire comes with all Georgian troops and civilians driven out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , Saaksahvili may be called to account for losing not just territory but the chance of early membership of Nato as well .
Well , that did n't last long .
Crude oil , which briefly dipped below $ 100 last week , gained more than $ 10 a barrel in trading Monday , bringing crude futures prices back over $ 115 a barrel .
Oil - market analyst at work ( AP ) Apparently the $ 700 billion financial bailout package has done two things to juice the oil markets .
Like dad stepping in to rescue the lemonade stand , it 's given the market assurance that the worst is probably past �meaning economic growth , and thus demand for oil , will continue one way or another .
But ...
The present - day U.S. military qualifies by any measure as highly professional , much more so than its Cold War predecessor .
Yet the purpose of today ’s professionals is not to preserve peace but to fight unending wars in distant places .
Intoxicated by a post - Cold War belief in its own omnipotence , the United States allowed itself to be drawn into a long series of armed conflicts , almost all of them yielding unintended consequences and imposing greater than anticipated costs .
Since the end of the Cold War , U.S. forces have destroyed many targets and killed many people .
Only rarely , however , have they succeeded in accomplishing their assigned political purposes .
. . .
[ F ] rom our present vantage point , it becomes apparent that the “ Revolution of ‘ 89 ” did not initiate a new era of history .
At most , the events of that year fostered various unhelpful illusions that impeded our capacity to recognize and respond to the forces of change that actually matter .

HSBC , a global banking company with roughly 300,000 employees worldwide , is evaluating the iPhone as the standard mobile device for its staff .
HSBC 's CIO for the Australia and New Zealand region , Brenton Hush , told ZDNet Australia that " it 's definitely something we are considering from a HSBC Group perspective . "
The company currently uses RIM's BlackBerry devices to keep staff connected to e-mail , calendar , and contacts .
One of the biggest barriers to enterprise adoption of the iPhone was once the lack of Exchange support .
Apple vastly improved the enterprise compatibility of iPhones by licensing Microsoft 's ActiveSync technology to sync the device with Exchange servers .
The company also added support for distributing and managing custom apps and remotely wiping a stolen or lost device .
Hush thinks the changes make it a viable choice for HBSC 's staff .
" I think [ the iPhone ] would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective .
But [ Apple ] have been pretty smart with the design , " he said .
No timeline is in place for any kind of switch , and according to Hush , it 's not a high - priority issue .
But if HSBC did standardize on the iPhone 3G , it would be one of the largest single orders for Apple 's mobile device and could be a significant cut in business for RIM .
Surely there are some users that would just as soon have their BlackBerry and its QWERTY keyboard ripped from their cold , dead hands , but a large deployment like this — " conservatively , to 200,000 people , " said Hush — could help legitimize the iPhone as an enterprise - ready device .
Superheroes saved Hollywood this summer , boosting box office to record heights and funneling $ 1 billion and counting into studio coffers .
Now , emboldened by the success of The Dark Knight , Iron Man , The Incredible Hulk , Wanted and Hellboy II , filmmakers are stampeding toward comic books and graphic novels to find bigger - than - life stories for the silver screen .
Longtime heavyweights DC Comics ( Batman , Superman ) and Marvel ( Spider - Man , X - Men , Fantastic Four ) are trotting out lesser - known characters from their catalogs .
Ant Man ( pictured at right ) ?
Yes !
Joining the fray are relative upstarts including Dark Horse , Platinum Studios , Top Cow Productions , Oni Press and Devil ’s Due Publishing , which are busy populating the superhero pipeline with a new generation of flawed crime - fighters .
Comic books have become so hot that some titles prompt a feeding frenzy from studio execs before they ’re even published .
For example , B. Clay Moore ’s new assassin series Billy Smoke does n’t hit stores until next year , but it ’s already been picked up by Warner Bros. as a possible project for Lost star Matthew Fox .
“ It ’s kind of funny that comic book fans think the success of a published comic book is some kind of indicator as to how well a comic book will translate to the big screen , ” said Moore .
“ Ultimately , what studios are interested in is a good idea . ”
As pulp fiction fans pack their bags for next week ’s Comic - Con International in San Diego , here ’s a look ahead at some of the comic book movies heading for the big screen .

Additional reporting by John Scott Lewinski
Anorexia is an eating disorder where people starve themselves .
Anorexia usually begins in young people around the onset of puberty .
Individuals suffering from anorexia have extreme weight loss .
Weight loss is usually 15 % below the person 's normal body weight .
People suffering from anorexia are very skinny but are convinced that they are overweight .
Weight loss is obtained by many ways .
Some of the common techniques used are excessive exercise , intake of laxatives and not eating .
Anorexics have an intense fear of becoming fat .
Their dieting habits develop from this fear .
Anorexia mainly affects adolescent girls .
People with anorexia continue to think they are overweight even after they become extremely thin , are very ill or near death .
Often they will develop strange eating habits such as refusing to eat in front of other people .
Sometimes the individuals will prepare big meals for others while refusing to eat any of it .
Two - thirds of California ’s unique plants , some 2,300 species that grow nowhere else in the world , could be wiped out across much of their current geographic ranges by the end of the century because of rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns , according to a new study .
The species that cannot migrate fast enough to higher altitudes or cooler coastal areas could face extinction because of greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet , according to researchers .
California ’s flora face a potential “ collapse , ” said David Ackerly , an ecologist at UC Berkeley who was the senior author of the paper .
“ As the climate changes , many of these plants will have no place to go . ”
Half of the plant species that are unique to the continental United States grow only in the Golden State , from towering redwoods to slender fire poppies .
And under likely climate scenarios , many would have to shift 100 miles or more from their current range -- a difficult task given slow natural migration rates and obstacles presented by suburban sprawl .
Advertisement
The study , published Tuesday in the peer - reviewed on - line journal PLoS One , is the first to analyze the effect of climate change on all of the plants unique to one of the world ’s most biologically diverse areas .
Previous models have focused on fewer species in areas such as the eastern United States , Europe , South Africa and Australia .
“ The climate is changing 10 times faster than it did during the last ice ages , ” said ecologist Scott Loarie , who has a doctorate from Duke University and who conducted the study over five years with Ackerly and other collaborators .
“ The first thing we need to do is to reduce the pace of change . ”
The study , which was based on more than 80,000 specimens , was hailed as groundbreaking by leading scientists in the field .
“ It is a timely analysis of the likely fate of the plants of California in the face of climate change , ” Peter Raven , president of the Missouri Botanical Garden and coauthor of seminal texts on California flora , said in an e-mail .
And in Southern California , given water shortages and habitat disruption , he added , “ lots of the populations are right on the edge .
. . .
The balance could easily be tipped so we could lose many of them in a very short period of time . ”

As California ’s unique species migrate , they could be separated from the creatures that pollinate them .
Animals could be divided from the plants on which they depend , the researchers noted .
“ Individual plants ca n’t pick up and fly away like birds , ” Ackerly said .
“ A seed grows into a tree .
Then the adult tree drops another seed , which can be carried by the wind or an animal .
And that seed grows into another tree . ”
The state may also have to set aside new refuges and corridors , and prepare to move some plants if necessary .
“ Planning for plant refugees will become a new but important concept for natural reserves to think about , ” said biologist Brent Mishler , director of the University and Jepson Herbaria at UC Berkeley , the state ’s most important flora collection .
The study is likely to add urgency to a decades - long movement to protect the state ’s flora .
The California Native Plant Society , which has 33 chapters , warns that less than 10 % of the state ’s original coastal sage - scrub land and less than 1 % of its native grassland remain intact .

But the paper foresees even more dramatic changes .
Coast redwoods may range farther north , it said , while California oaks could disappear from Central California in favor of cooler weather in the Klamath Mountains along the Oregon border .
Many plants may no longer be able to survive in the northern Sierra Nevada or in the Los Angeles Basin .
It also predicts that plants of northern Baja California will migrate into San Diego County ranges .
Meanwhile , the Central Valley could become the preferred habitat for plants of the Sonoran Desert .
And what would replace Southern California ’s native plants ?
“ We do n’t know what will move into the void , ” Loarie said .
“ Possibly desert plants similar to those in Nevada and Arizona , but more likely unpleasant agricultural weeds . ”
Coauthor Katharine Hayhoe , a Texas Tech University scientist who serves on the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , prepared projections under a scenario of a relatively rapid rise in global temperature of 3.8 to 5.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century , and under a conservative estimate of 2.3 to 3.3 degrees Celsius .
Advertisement
The study looks at eight scenarios that used different rates of warming and of species mobility .
Loarie cautioned that there were uncertainties in the analysis , such as the known range of individual plants , the precise microclimate each plant prefers , and the magnitude of predicted changes in rainfall patterns .
“ But there is a clear trend , ” he said .
“ The climate is outpacing these plants . ”
Under the worst - case scenario , plant diversity would decrease everywhere by as much as 25 % , and 66 % of all species unique to California would suffer more than an 80 % decrease in range .
In the most optimistic scenario , under which governments move to rapidly decrease greenhouse gas emissions globally , and plant species prove able to move into new habitats , diversity might increase along the state ’s northwest and central coasts , the study concluded .
Advertisement
But even under this scenario , many species would disappear from Southern California and the Northern Sierra .
The authors steered clear of predicting specific extinctions .
“ If a plant loses 80 % of its range and goes from 100 to 20 square kilometers , it is hard to say if that plant is extinct or not , ” Loarie said .
“ In a hot year , that plant ’s gone . ”
Native plants often support 10 to 50 times as many species of native wildlife as nonnative plants , and biologist Philip Rundel , a California plant specialist at UCLA , noted that the effects measured by the study “ will surely be paralleled by what we can expect to occur with animal species . ”

“ This article is a wake - up call for all Californians that global change impacts on our environment are more than just a theoretical issue . ”

U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Saturday denied that the Bush administration – in conjunction with the nation 's telecommunication companies – devised a " dragnet " electronic surveillance program that funneled Americans ' communications to the National Security Agency without court warrants .
But the attorney general also insisted that defending his claim in court would harm national security .
" Specific information demonstrating that the alleged dragnet has not occurred cannot be disclosed on the public record without causing exceptional harm to national security , " Mukasey wrote in a federal court filing in San Francisco .
" However , because there was no such alleged content - dragnet , no provider participated in that alleged activity . "
It was the first time Mukasey , as the nation 's top law enforcement official , provided an emphatic and wholesale written courthouse denial of allegations contained in lawsuits accusing the Bush administration of widescale domestic spying in the years following the 2001 terror attacks .
Keith Alexander , the NSA director , issued a similar courthouse denial in a 2007 court document ( .pdf ) .
Despite Mukasey 's denial , contained in a court filing (. pdf ) made public Saturday , Mukasey asked a federal judge to grant immunity to the nation 's telecommunications companies accused of assisting with the alleged surveillance dragnet .
It is the first time the government has invoked the immunity legislation ( . pdf ) Congress approved July 9 , which was signed by President Bush the next day .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama voted for the immunity bill and helped block a filibuster .
Republican rival John McCain supported the measure , but did not vote .
The lawsuit was brought in 2006 by the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The EFF 's lawsuit includes documents from a former AT&T technician that the EFF claims describe a secret room in an AT&T building in San Francisco that is wired up to share raw internet traffic with the NSA .
The attorney general 's statements were provided to U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker in addition to the government 's motion ( .pdf ) to grant the telcos immunity .
Walker , of San Francisco , is overseeing three dozen lawsuits accusing U.S. telecommunication companies of taking part in the government 's alleged " dragnet " surveillance program .
According to the immunity bill , Congress authorized Mukasey to inform Judge Walker via classified and non-public documents about why the government is seeking immunity on behalf of the communication companies .
According to the legislation , Walker has little power to deny Mukasey 's request .
Still , Mukasey 's filing did acknowledge the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
The so - called TSP authorized the NSA to intercept , without warrants , international communications to or from the United States that the government reasonably believed involved a member or agent of al - Qaeda , or affiliated terrorist organization .
Bush acknowledged the program after the New York Times disclosed its existence in 2005 .
Mukasey , as part of his court filing , sought immunity for the telecoms that participated in the TSP program .
The TSP has now been legalized by Congress .

“ 富野節 ” というのは、劇中のセリフ回しに適用される言葉であろうが、富野由悠季氏ご自身の語りが、梅雨時の土曜昼下がり、東大駒場キャンパスで炸裂した。
6月15日、東京大学工学部にて、イベント「テクノドリームI：工学～それは夢を実現する体系」が開催された。これは、富野由悠季氏をゲストに迎え、東京大学下山勲教授（情報理工学系研究科長）と同じく東京大学の中須賀真一教授（工学系研究科・航空宇宙工学専攻／工学部・航空宇宙工学科）が鼎談を行なうというもの。後半には民間企業からの参加ということで、東洋エンジニアリングの内田正之氏、三洋電機の田端輝男氏が加わった。司会は工学部広報室の内田麻理香特任教員。
テーマは工学の未来について。テクノドリームというイベント自体、“工学の夢を新たに描き直すイベント”と位置づけられている。富野氏がゲストということで、工学そのものの立ち位置から地球環境の話まで、大いに話題がふくらんだ。東大の教授陣もユニークな顔ぶれで、中須賀教授は手のひらサイズの人工衛星や人工知能研究で知られる人物。下山教授はITとRT（Robot Technology）を組み合わせたIRT研究機構の中心として、少子高齢化解決の産業基盤を作る拠点の運営に関わっている。民間企業のお二人も東大卒。エコやエネルギー開発の現状を紹介した。
教授陣や民間企業の方々のお話も興味深いものであったが、ここでは、富野氏の主なことばを紹介し、そのメッセージをお伝えしたい。主に工学部の学生向けに話された内容ではあるが、メッセージに込められた意義は、工学という科学の一ジャンルから発して広く普遍的なものとなっていて、おそらくは関係のない人はいないであろうものだった。キャッチーな言葉と、その言葉が導き出されてきた会話を、なるべく発言の雰囲気を感じていただけるよう再現した。会場の雰囲気を感じ取って頂ければ幸いである。
富野氏のことばその1 スペースコロニーは実現不可能？
「スペースコロニーのような構造では絶対に、1000年、2000年という単位で人が住める構造体にはなり得ない」
━━ガンダムシリーズを作っているときに、スペースコロニーを舞台にして劇を作る、つまりそこで暮らしている人を動かすということを仕事にしている。ということは、かなりリアルにシミュレーションしているというふうに、自分自身が理解できるようになりました。ガンダムを作り続けてきたために、そういう頭の構造になって来たのだと思います。━━
富野氏 10 年くらい前です。 「 あ、スペースコロニーのような構造では絶対に、1000年、2000年という単位で人が住める構造体にはなり得ない」ということが分かりました。これが――現代の技術を持ってしてもという言い方もあるのですが――現代の最高の金属工学のようなものを利用して、お金をかけることも一切合切考えないで好きに作れると思っても、重力が1Gの円筒の筒があり、それが回って慣性重力という疑似重力を得る空間が、1000年、2000年持つのかと考えた時に、外壁の部分に宇宙線、放射能の遮蔽版まで作ることを想定して、その想定の部分で言えば外版で鉛を使わなければいけなくなってくるわけです。それも、恐ろしい話ですが、厚さが10メートルとか20メートルです。そういうものでも完璧に放射線を遮蔽出来ないかもしれない。できたとしても、基本的に慣性重力、疑似重力なのです。中が空洞のモノです。工学的に作れるモノなら作って見せてください。
それを可能としなければいけないのは皆さんの世代です。我々の頭では、そんなモノ出来ないと思っています。そういうことから何を考えるかというと、地球という球体で、重力を、質量を保っている力を持てて、地球の表面がどの程度のスピードで移動しているかというと……音速の1．4倍ですか？
今我々の体が音速以上で移動しているのですって。（そのスピードを）感じていないだけのことで、十分感動するんです。海でもいいですし、山でもいい。シーン……としているところや水平線が見えているところの景色を、「作れるモノなら作ってみろ！」というのが地球だと思っています。
音速を超えた速度で我々が移動している物性の中で、シーンっていう空間を手に入れられるというものを、人工的に作れるモノならば作って見せてよ。つい1週間位前に、スペースステーションで日本の「きぼう」が稼動するようになって、“エアコンが静かだからそこで寝られるようになった”というのが、我々の技術なんです。
このようなことを想像していただけたら、つまり工学が進むべき事と、「いやあそんな事は、やっぱり工学的にはできないんだ」ということ、どちらに皆さんの感性を振るのかと言うことが一番大事な問題です。可能な部分はあると思っていますし、現実的に工学が進むべき道というのは現代の社会の中に山ほどあるのではないかと感じることができるようになりました。というのが、すみません、スペースコロニーの話をしていたのですが、こういう話になりました。

Google Releases an Open Source Cryptography Toolkit
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 12 , 2008
Related Blog Posts
Google has just released an open source cryptographic toolkit : Keyczar .
The company is aiming to make inherently complex cryptography easier and safer for developers to implement .
In addition to the Google Code page where you can get the toolkit , there is this information page , and a link to a discussion group .
Keyczar is released under an Apache 2.0 license .
What does it offer ?
Keyczar is built on OpenSSL , PyCrypto , and the Java JCE libraries , and is " not intended to replace existing cryptographic libraries , " according to Google Code .
It works with both symmetric and asymmetric keys , and there is this introduction on the Google Code page :
" Cryptography is easy to get wrong .
Developers can often choose the wrong cipher mode , use obsolete algorithms , compose primitives in an unsafe manner , or fail to anticipate the need for key rotation .
Keyczar abstracts some of these details by choosing safe defaults , automatically tagging outputs with key version information , and providing a simple interface . "
I 've talked to many leading people in the field of cryptography , and " easy to get wrong " is an understatement .
One of the reasons we do n't see more of our content encrypted -- from e-mail messaging to encrypted storage archives -- is the sheer complexity of cryptography .
I was amused to see that Google has provided a " non-goals " page for Keyczar , where it clarifies that it is not intended for tasks such as encrypting very " short blobs of data . "
If you want to take a gander at some example uses of Keyczar , see the " illustrative use " cases on this page .
There , you 'll find actual code that , say , a Python developer might use to encrypt a URL parameter value with a symmetric key .
Keyczar was developed within the Google Security Team .
Steve Weis of Google and Arkajit Dey of MIT were among the lead developers .

Psychotherapist surrenders counseling license prior to hearing of
California regulators
San Diego Union - Tribune , March 21 , 1996
John Wilkens and Jim Okerblom
A La Mesa psychotherapist facing state disciplinary hearings has
surrendered her counseling license amid allegations that she coerced an
8 - year - old rape victim into falsely identifying her father as the attacker .
Kathleen King Goodfriend was accused by government regulators of being
“ grossly negligent or incompetent ” in her treatment of the child , Alicia
Wade .
The California Board of Behavioral Science Examiners said that
“ pressure ” by Goodfriend over a period of 13 months finally led the girl to
falsely accuse her father .
As a result , her father , James Wade was
arrested , charged and faced 16 years in prison .
Alicia was nearly placed
for adoption .
Alicia ’s mother , Denise Wade attempted suicide .
Authorities
overlooked DNA evidence which proved the father had not assaulted his
daughter and disregarded a suspect already convicted of attacking other
girls in the neighborhood .
Under the agreement that takes effect April 15 , Goodfriend admits no
wrongdoing , but she will no longer be allowed to practice as a marriage ,
family and child counselor in California .
By law , Goodfriend could apply
for a new license in three years .
But in doing so , she would have to
acknowledge that her treatment of the child was “ unprofessional ” and
“ recklessly caused emotional or physical harm ” to Alicia , according to the
agreement .
“ The burden would be on her to show that she is rehabilitated , ”
said Susan Fitzgerald , a deputy state attorney general who prepared the
case against the therapist .
Although regulators had looked forward to a
full airing of the case against Goodfriend , they felt the settlement was
merited , Fitzgerald said .
Two years ago , the Wade family settled a multimillion - dollar civil suit
filed against Goodfriend , social workers , detectives , prosecutors and
others involved in the case .
The settlement was about $ 3.7 million .
Of
that , $ 1 million came from Goodfriend .

Most of us recall what Ben Franklin told us in his Almanack .
“ Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise . ”
In various forms , that proverb actually preceded Old Ben by about 300 years .
The fact that we still quote it today tells us that it still has some truth to it .
But why ?
At times in my life , I have been an early riser , as I am now , and I have been a night owl , as I was when I briefly managed some local bands .
Sometimes , I was both , as when I would go to shows all night and then grab a 3:30 am breakfast at a diner even though I had an 8 am class a few hours later .
Based on experience , I know that I always feel better when I am paying heed to Mr. Franklin ’s adage and getting up early .
I also know that I save money and can be more productive merely by getting up before everyone else I know .
You can feel better , save money and enjoy greater productivity , too , especially if you consider :
Meals at Home
Early risers have more time in the morning before work .
Instead of rushing out the door to get to your job , as an early riser you can enjoy a home - cooked breakfast and brew your own coffee .
You can also consider packing your own lunch for the office .
Moreover , if you get to work early , you can probably ensure that you usually get to leave your office on time and can get home for dinner , rather than grab a less satisfying meal on the way home .
Less Commuting Costs
If you leave for work early , you can avoid most of the traffic congestion that you would encounter during the morning rush .
This puts less wear and tear on your car and gives you better gas mileage .
Of course , it also makes for a better commuting experience for you .
Also , if you are not required to put in any overtime , your boss may send you home early , thus allowing you to miss the evening commute .
When I was a just out of college , I worked as a paralegal for a large utility company in Boston .
I got to work every day at 6 am and generally worked until 6 pm .
On Fridays , my boss always told me at lunch time that I could get an early start on my weekend .
I loved that and would quickly head out the door for a quick ride home .
Easy Overtime
As I mentioned above , by getting to work at 6 am , I was able to get 3 hours of overtime before any of my colleagues had gotten into the office .
I routinely got 16 to 20 hours of overtime every week even though I left the office at the same time each night as everyone else .
All of my peers – there were about 18 of us – envied my ability to get overtime but they could not get themselves out of bed , so I remained the only beneficiary for the two years that I worked there .
Better Physical Health
In talking to people at the gym , I often hear that if they do not get out of bed to work out before breakfast , they know they will never get to the gym that day .
By rising early , you are much more likely to fall into a routine of going to the gym , going for a run , going for a bike ride or taking a swim .
If you are consistent with your exercise , your body will repay you with a longer , healthier life that requires fewer trips to the doctor .
Better Mental Health
If you get out of bed early , you are less likely to find yourself rushing to get ready for work and then rushing to work .
When you get to work , you will not be in a frenzied state that requires an hour of decompression .
You will get more accomplished and you will not find your heart racing all the time .
Just as it is important to take care of our bodies , we also need to preserve peace of mind or risk another host of stress related maladies .
Black Friday and Other Sales
The day after Thanksgiving , America ’s malls will open early and for the intrepid shopper , sales galore will be available .
Early morning sales happen on other days of the year as well .
A shopper who scouts the sales circulars and who plans their shopping route can enjoy great savings by getting to the mall at 5 am or 6 am on these special sales days .
Read the Paper
I read three newspapers every morning – The Wall Street Journal for financial news , The Financial Times for world news and the Orlando Sentinel for local news .
I do not take a lot of time to read the papers because I know that I will also read the on - line versions of the Journal and FT every day at work .
I do spend a lot of time reading the Sentinel , however , because I know that I can find a lot of money saving coupons and sales announcements if I read every page .
If I left the newspapers to the end of the night , I know I would check only the Sentinel ’s inserts and would miss everything in the body of the paper .
By giving myself an extra 15 minutes in the morning , I save at least $ 100 per week by using information that I find in my local paper .
Few Entertainment Costs
My wife and I both get up early each day .
I am usually out of bed between 4:30 am and 5:00 am and bring my wife her morning coffee by 5:30 am .
After trips to the gym and breakfast , we both sit down to work ( since we both work from home ) .
We do have the luxury of not needing to spend time commuting and we both get to enjoy three meals a day with each other .
At the end of the day , even though we may have been in the house for 9 or 10 hours , neither of us really has any desire to go out for the evening .
Our bodies are telling us that an evening in is preferable so we have a quiet dinner and read or watch a movie that we got from the library or recorded on our DVR .
When we were younger ( not that we are ancient by any definition at this point ) , we went out every night of the week at times , and it cost us a fortune .
We also slept until 9 am every day so we were not ready to shut down for the evening at 8 pm or even 10 pm .
( Our first date was a dinner at midnight after work one night . )
By getting up early , we cured ourselves of the need to constantly pursue entertainment at night .
Early Bird Specials
I am not sure that any place actually uses the term “ early bird special ” anymore , but that is what the discounts were called when I was a kid .
The math is simple , since most people go out to eat late and go to the movies late , early diners or filmgoers get a discount as an incentive to get them to go out .
My wife and I do still go out from time to time .
We are frugal – not shut -ins .
When we do go out , we enjoy ourselves a lot , but we pay less than most people pay because we are usually getting an early bird discount .
All forms of entertainment that we enjoy – dining out , going to the movies , going to a theatrical production – offer some form of discount for early dining or seeing an early showing .
It does not matter to us that we are eating dinner at 5 in the afternoon because we would do that anyway .
It does not matter to us that we are seeing a matinee at the cinema because the movie is just as good .
It does not matter to us , but it does save us money .
Lower Electric Bills
By getting up early , we use natural light more often than we use electric lights .
Our lights stay off for most of the day and that helps to keep our electric bills down .
Are you a “ morning person ” or a “ night owl ” ?
Have you ever considered why ?
Why do you follow the sleep cycle that you follow ?
How does your daily routine contribute to savings ?

Russia supplies roughly a quarter of the EU 's natural gas Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said his decision to recognise Georgia 's breakaway regions as independent is irrevocable .
On the eve of a special EU summit on Georgia , he warned that Russia was ready to retaliate against any sanctions the EU might impose .
Germany and the UK have differed in tone over how the EU should proceed , with Berlin warning against escalation .
Moscow 's envoy to London said sanctions would hurt the EU more than Russia .
Ambassador Yuri Fedotov told the BBC that Russia did not want any further confrontation and was not seeking a new Cold War .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He was speaking after UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown called in a newspaper article for a fundamental review of relations with Russia to prevent further " Russian aggression " .
But German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier said unilateral actions by both Russia and Georgia had worsened the crisis .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili urged EU leaders not to " give up faced with [ Russia 's ] dirty attempt at aggression " .
While EU leaders are expected to boost support for Georgia and warn Russia there can be no business as usual after its actions , the summit will stop short of calling for sanctions amid divisions between the EU 's 27 member states , the BBC's Oana Lungescu reports .
Russia 's four - day war with Georgia began on 7 August when Georgia tried to regain control of its breakaway South Ossetia province by force and Russia counter - attacked deep into Georgia .
' Equal partner ' Speaking to Russian TV channels in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi , Mr Medvedev also promised military and economic aid to Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
MARDELL'S EUROBLOG
Many see the most obvious punishments , blocking or expelling Russian from international bodies , as counter - productive
A serious summit
On the possibility of sanctions against Russia , he said : " We do not favour sanctions on the whole and only resort to them in extreme circumstances .
[ But ] if required , we could pass the relevant legislation . "
The EU gets about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia , which is also a major oil exporter .
Russia 's ambassador to the EU , Vladimir Chizhov , told Reuters news agency Moscow had no plans to use energy supplies as a political tool , and said the prospect of any EU sanctions was " highly improbable " .
Ambassador Fedotov told the BBC that " any sanctions [ would ] hurt the European Union first of all much more than Russia " .
Mr Fedotov also argued that the world needed to understand what the modern , post - Soviet Russia was about .
" Russia wants to be an equal partner ... but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse , but of two equal individuals , " he said .
' Beyond the current day ' Georgian demonstrators are planning to hold rallies in Tbilisi and in other European capitals to coincide with the special EU summit in Brussels when it opens at 1100 GMT on Monday .
My message to Russia is simple : ... you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
Gordon Brown
UK prime minister
UK warns over ' Russia aggression '
It was called by France , which currently chairs the EU and brokered a peace deal between Russia and Georgia .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told the BBC that Paris did not support sanctions but the views of all EU members would have to be taken into account .
" The situation is very difficult and ... we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending , of course , territorial integrity of Georgia , " he said .
Mr Brown said both the EU and Nato should review their ties with Russia " When Russia has a grievance over an issue such as South Ossetia , it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force , " he said .
" My message to Russia is simple :
If you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the G8 , OECD and WTO , you must accept that with rights come responsibilities . "
Germany 's foreign minister said that " the dangerous spiral of violence [ over Georgia ] must be stopped " .
" We need a strong and sensible European role to allow a return to reason and responsibility , " he said .
Speaking earlier in the week , Mr Steinmeier rejected the idea of sanctions , saying " someone should first tell me what a sanction against Russia could be " .
" Particularly in such a serious political situation , it is necessary to show a bit of common sense , " he said .
" We will continue to have Russia as our neighbour also beyond the current day , and it is in our own interest to return to a normal relationship . "

Researchers , growers and Industry specialists from 22 countries will share the latest research into the use of Brassica species , such as mustard , radish , or rapeseed , to manage soil - borne pests and weeds – a technique known as biofumigation .
“ Brassica plants naturally release compounds that suppress pests and pathogens , principally isothiocyanates ( ITCs ) , which most people would recognise as the ‘ hot ’ flavour in mustard or horseradish , ” says CSIRO ’s Dr John Kirkegaard , the conference convenor .
“ When ITCs are released in soil by green - manuring , soil - borne pests and pathogens can be suppressed and the yields of solanaceous vegetables such as potatoes , tomatoes and eggplants can be increased by up to 40 per cent in some cases .
“ The technique is relevant to developed countries seeking alternatives to banned synthetic pesticides such as methyl - bromide , as well as poor farmers in developing countries who often have few alternatives for controlling serious diseases in their crops , ” Dr Kirkegaard says .
“ It can provide economic and social benefits , as improved crop yields lead to increased incomes , as well as a range of environmental and health benefits from a reduced reliance on fumigants and pesticides . ”
Using brassicas to manage soil - borne pests is not new , but modern science is providing new insights and techniques to enhance the reliability of the effect as part of an integrated pest control strategy .
Brassicas can also provide other benefits to the soil as green manures .
Australian scientists are at the forefront of this area of research , in projects on tropical vegetable production systems in north Queensland and the Philippines , supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research ( ACIAR ) , and on temperate southern Australian vegetable production , supported by Horticulture Australia Limited ( HAL ) using voluntary contributions from industry and matched funding from the Australian Government .
The Symposium will consist of three days of scientific and Industry presentations designed to stimulate discussions about the underpinning science , as well as the practical application of biofumigation technology in Australia and worldwide .
“ The Symposium is an excellent opportunity to draw together the latest research on the subject from around the globe , ” Dr Kirkegaard says .
Buffet made 10 % return on investment and his company now holds $ 43 billion in cash , much of it invested in foreign currencies .
ABC News online briefly mentions worries about trade and ignored the sharecropper quote altogether .
Berkshire owned about $ 21.4 billion in foreign currency spread among a dozen countries at the end of the year .
Buffet said this hedge against the U.S. dollar does not mean he is unpatriotic , but he voiced a warning about the nation 's growing trade and fiscal deficits .

ST . PETERSBURG , Florida ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama proposed a package of measures on Friday to help workers fight rising energy costs , including an immediate $ 1,000 tax rebate for low - and middle - income families .
Obama , trying to shift the focus of his campaign debate with Republican rival John McCain back to the economy , said he would pay for the $ 65 billion tax package with a 5 - year windfall profits tax on oil companies .
The Illinois senator also revamped his proposal for a $ 50 billion economic stimulus plan to include $ 25 billion to replenish the highway trust fund and pay for infrastructure improvements that he said could save up to 1 million endangered jobs .
“ With job losses mounting , prices rising , increased turbulence in our financial system , a growing credit crunch , we need to do more , ” Obama said at a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg , Florida .
The proposals came as the government announced the U.S. unemployment rate hit its highest level in four years with another 51,000 non-farm jobs lost in July , bringing job losses for the year to 463,000 .
“ Do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies ? ” Obama asked , accusing McCain of embracing President George W. Bush ’s economic approach .
The tax rebates , which would be phased out for those making more than $ 150,000 a year , are an accelerated version of Obama ’s earlier proposal for permanent tax reductions of up to $ 1,000 for working families , aides said .
“ You ca n’t afford to wait for relief .
Right now , people are suffering , ” Obama said .
A spokesman for McCain said the Arizona senator ’s approach to fighting energy costs , including new offshore oil drilling , more nuclear power plants and gas tax relief , was better than raising taxes on oil companies .

“ The higher taxes that Barack Obama supports are one of the surest ways to kill jobs and exactly the wrong approach to a slowing economy , ” McCain spokesman Taylor Griffin said .
Obama said the proposals grew from his talks this week in Washington with economic officials and an all - star panel of economic advisers including billionaire investor Warren Buffett .
“ We agreed that the main risk we face today is doing too little in the face of our growing economic troubles , ” he said .
DUELING MCCAIN
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president if he wins the November 4 election , spent the last two days dueling with McCain in a series of increasingly negative attacks .
McCain ’s campaign charged Obama was playing “ the race card ” by claiming McCain would try to scare voters about Obama ’s candidacy .
McCain also aired a television advertisement earlier in the week comparing Obama to Hollywood celebrities like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
“ The American people deserve better , ” Obama said in St. Petersburg .
“ They want a serious conversation about the challenges we face . ”
Obama said his $ 50 billion stimulus package would help jump - start new jobs .
Half would go to help pay for infrastructure projects that have been put on hold , threatening jobs .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , also has discussed the possibility of a $ 50 billion stimulus bill , which the Bush administration so far opposes .
On Thursday , she said a new round of tax rebates could be part of the formula .
Obama announced the proposals at the start of a daylong bus tour across central Florida to focus on the economy , which polls show is the top issue among American voters .
Florida , the state that decided the 2000 election that landed Bush in the White House , promises to be a crucial battleground again .
Obama already had proposed a windfall profits tax on oil company profits but the new plan specifies the tax would last five years .
He linked his call for a windfall profits tax to Exxon Mobil ’s announcement on Thursday of nearly $ 12 billion in profits for the quarter .
“ It ’s time we used some of their record profits to help you pay record prices , ” he said .
After six years of research , Raser Technologies will deliver geothermal energy to the city of Anaheim , California .
The geothermal generator , which is located in Beaver County , Utah , will produce 10 megawatts of energy , or enough to power 9,000 homes .
It should be completed by October .
Anaheim ’s new energy source will put it on the fast track to reaching 20 percent of its total energy needs through renewable energy by 2012 .
The Raser geothermal model is much more consumer - friendly than previous models , as it operates at the relatively low temperature of 165 F .
And a lot is riding on its success .
According to Merrill Lynch ’s managing director of corporate finance Roy Piskadlo , “ The success of this project will be important , because with this new low - temperature technology , the range of potential commercial sites is much wider . ”
Not only is the low temperature of the Raser model revolutionary , but so its existence in the first place .
The Beaver County project , which draws on 640 acres of land , is the first geothermal project to be built in Utah in approximately 20 years .
Most importantly , Raser believes that there will be a very low risk of water degradation in the project ’s reservoir , thus ensuring the sustainability of the energy source .
And more areas of the country should begin to see the fruits of Raser ’s labor sometime in the near future — the company holds the rights to 225,000 acres of land in multiple states .
Hopefully , Raser ’s project will help cities and town that ca n’t rely on wind or solar energy reach their sustainability goals sooner rather than later .

Researchers have built a " biological brain " for a robot using a dish full of rat neurons , and have harnessed the neurons ' electric signals to navigate the robot around a pen .
Researchers say the experiment should add to their understanding of how brain cells function , and could provide insight into what goes wrong in neurons affected by diseases like Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
The robot's
controller nestles inside a small pot containing a pink broth of nutrients and antibiotics .
Inside that pot , some 300,000 rat neurons have made - and continue to make - connections with each other .
As they do so , the disembodied neurons are communicating , sending electrical signals to one another just as they do in a living creature [ New Scientist ] .
The neurons ' automatic drive to connect and communicate may be an indication of how sturdy brain cells are ; researcher Steve Potter , who has been involved in similar experiments , says that brain cells have " evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that does n't kill them "
[ Telegraph ] .
The electrical signals are sent to the robot via a bluetooth radio link , and are interpreted as motion commands .
Researchers say the robot , which they nicknamed Gordon , can learn behavior to a certain extent .
When it hits a wall , for example , it gets an electrical stimulation from the robot 's sensors .
As it confronts similar situations , it learns by habit .
To help this process along , the researchers also use different chemicals to reinforce or inhibit the neural pathways that light up during particular actions [ AFP ] .
Lead researcher Kevin Warwick ( who has had two electronic chips implanted in his arm as part of Project Cyborg ) says that Gordon currently swerves to avoid a wall eight out of 10 times :
" The signals and the pathways are strengthening as each action gets repeated " [ Telegraph ] .
Once the robot can routinely navigate around its pen and can recognize elements of its environment ,

Wasilla Police Billed Sexual Assault Victims for Their Own Rape Kits
08Sep08
Of all of the things I ’ve learned about Sarah Palin in the last week and a half , this has got to be the most disturbing .
While Sarah Palin was serving as the Mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , the city charged victims of sexual assault between $ 300 and $ 1200 for their own rape kits .
A rape kit is a sexual assault forensic evidence kit , used to collect DNA that can be used in criminal proceedings to assist in the conviction of those who commit sex crimes .
The kit is performed as soon as possible after a sexual assault or attack has been committed .
It is usually humiliating and uncomfortable for the victim–imagine enduring that and then paying $ 1200 just so that the criminal who assaulted you might be caught .
There are times when I believe , erroneously , that there is no low that this bunch wo n’t sink to .
And always , I ’m wrong .
FORCING RAPE VICTIMS TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN RAPE KITS ???

UPDATE : Remember , if you got pregnant from said rape , McCain ’s Choice would FORCE YOU TO CARRY THE PREGNANCY TO TERM … in ‘ her ’ America .
@petuniacat
are you brain dead or ignorant ?
First , everyone was trying to say that calling a person " half - Jewish and half - Persian " is WRONG because it is comparing religion and nationality , understand ?
Judaism is a religion .
You would not call a person " half - Christian and half - Danish ? " now , would you ?
There are Persian Jews and Persian Christians and Persian Muslims and even people who are Persian who have parents of different religions .
Secondly , the next argument is whether " Persian " means " Iranian .
There is no " Persia " therefore if one is from the country of Iran , one is Iranian .
However , some prefer to use the term , Persian , though it is not correct in theory .
Perhaps this young lady is actually fully Iranian with one Iranian - Jewish parent who had to flee when the Ayatollah came into power as many Jews and other non-Muslims and Shah supporters had to do .
Those who are stuck there face extreme prejudice .
Now , does it matter what her nationality or religion is ?
Why are n't these other swt 15 brats mentioned as the " horrible girl of Euro descent with that Catholic parent ? "
Should H.U.D. Really Be Dismantled ?
In a Times Op - Ed Friday , my co-author ( and regular blog contributor ) Sudhir Venkatesh argues that the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( H.U.D. ) has outlived its useful life .
The Chicago economist in me is not so sure that the alternative he proposes — a new federal agency devoted to regional planning — is going to be a great alternative , however .
I told him that and he challenged me for some better ideas .
The only problem is I do n’t think I have any !
Most economists would argue that the only long - term solution to poverty is figuring out a way to dramatically increase the human capital of the poor through some combination of better schools , better parenting , and convincing kids to stay in school and to work hard in school .
Stable housing is no doubt an input to helping disadvantaged children achieve their potential .
A number of studies have shown that kids who switch schools suffer a setback academically .
So — both for reasons of basic human decency and helping the long term prospects of the poor — affordable housing seems like a worthwhile objective .
The first obvious ( but important ) point about housing is that there is an active market for rental housing .
So it seems like a situation where it makes sense for government involvement to come in the form of subsidies to low - income renters to allow them to participate in the rental market .
That is what Section 8 vouchers do now .
A second obvious ( but important ) point is that housing markets are local .
They might cross city boundaries , but not much more than that .
So the need for federal involvement is not so clear to me .
One thing a federal agency might do is try to encourage home ownership among the poor .
Perhaps there are benefits to home ownership ; the huge tax subsidy for mortgage interest suggests that the government believes that to be the case .
The federal government can ( and does ) do this through low interest loans for low - income borrowers .
Again , this is the Chicago economist in me revealing himself , but in light of recent government efforts to bail out people who made bad loans , the last thing we need right now is the government getting more involved in the mortgage business .
The federal government might also try giving subsidies for housing developments that integrate middle - income housing with low income housing .
I believe there are generous programs of this kind in place now .
I do n’t know what the evidence is on these developments , but my guess is that mixed - income developments represent a very unstable equilibrium with a strong tendency to tip one way or the other .
What do blog readers think the federal government should or should n’t be doing about affordable housing ?
" Half of the new female members we spoke to claimed to be married to professionals or senior managers directly affected by City or economy issues , and all of them said they had joined because their husbands were no fun , and that any sort of passion or intimacy had simply dried up since the New Year .
Fred sez ,
Students for Free Culture has organized a grassroots conference for , and about free culture , technology , copyright , remixing , and free software .

A massive cluster of galaxies seen in the distant universe by ESAâ€™s orbiting XMM - Newton x-ray observatory is so big that astronomers believe there can only be a few of them that far away in space and time .
â€ œSuch massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant Universe , ” said Georg Lamer , Astrophysikalisches Institut in Potsdam , Germany .
“ They can be used to test cosmological theories .
Indeed , the very presence of this cluster confirms the existence of a mysterious component of the Universe called dark energy .â€ 
The astronomers compared the rare find to a cosmic ‘ needle in a haystack . ’
The newly - discovered monster , known by the catalogue number 2XMM J083026+524133 , is 7.7 thousand million light - years distant and is estimated to contain as much mass as a thousand large galaxies .
Much of it is in the form of 100 - million - degree hot gas .
The bright blue blob of gas was found during a systematic analysis of catalogued objects as Lamer and his team were looking for patches of X - rays that could either be nearby galaxies of distant clusters of galaxies .
Based on 3,500 observations performed with XMM - Newton ’s European Photon Imaging Camera ( EPIC ) covering about 1 % of the entire sky , the catalogue contains more than 190,000 individual X - ray sources .
J083026+524133 stood out because it was so bright .
While checking visual images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , the team could not find any obvious nearby galaxy in that location .
So they turned to the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona and took a deep exposure , which found a cluster of galaxies in that location .
The astronomers were surprised to find the cluster contains a thousand times the mass of our own Milky Way Galaxy .
No one knows what dark energy is , but it is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate .
This hampers the growth of massive galaxy clusters in more recent times , indicating that they must have formed earlier in the Universe .
â€œThe existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy , â€ says Lamer .
Yet he does not expect to find more of them in the XMM - Newton catalogue .
â€ œAccording to the current cosmological theories , we should only expect to find this one cluster in the 1 % of sky that we have searched , â€ says Lamer .

The chemicals in marijuana could put the brakes on colon cancer , according to new research .
That does n’t mean smoking a joint will help , though , as the chemicals only form part of the process .
Raymond DuBois and colleagues at the University of Texas in Houston discovered that a key receptor for cannabinoids , which are found in marijuana , is turned off in most types of human colon cancer .
Without this receptor , a protein called survivin , which stops cells from dying , increases unchecked and causes tumour growth .
To better understand the role that the receptor , called CB1 , plays in cancer progression , the researchers manipulated its expression in mice that had been genetically engineered to spontaneously develop colon tumours .
Advertisement
“ When we knocked out the receptor , the number of tumors went up dramatically , ” says DuBois .
Alternatively , when mice with normal CB1 receptors were treated with a cannabinoid compound , their tumours shrank .
Dual attack
The findings suggest a two - step treatment plan for colon cancer , as well as for other cancers that might be linked to this receptor .
First , turn the CB1 receptor back on , and then activate it with drugs currently in development that mimic marijuana .
But how to turn it on ?
The researchers found that in human colon cancer cells , the gene that makes the receptor is blocked by a process called methylation , in which a small chemical group is added to the DNA .
Treating the cells with decitibine – a demethylating drug already approved for use in humans – removed the chemical group and the gene began making the receptor .
Drugs that mimic marijuana might then activate the receptor , although DuBois did not test this .

Kucinich Opposes Bailout and asks , " Is this the United States Congress or the board of directors of Goldman Sachs ? "
WASHINGTON , D.C. ( September 28 , 2008 ) -- Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) today made the following speech on the floor of the House of Representatives regarding the proposed Wall Street bailout :
" The $ 700 billion bailout for Wall Street , is driven by fear not fact .
This is too much money in too a short a time going to too few people while too many questions remain unanswered .
Why are n't we having hearings on the plan we have just received ?
Why are n't we questioning the underlying premise of the need for a bailout with taxpayers ' money ?
Why have we not considered any alternatives other than to give $ 700 billion to Wall Street ?
Why are n't we asking Wall Street to clean up its own mess ?
Why are n't we passing new laws to stop the speculation , which triggered this ?
Why are n't we putting up new regulatory structures to protect investors ?
How do we even value the $ 700 billion in toxic assets ?
Conyers may hold hearings , but plans no action on impeachment Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 15 , 2008
Print This Email This All Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants is a chance to present his case .
The Ohio Democrat has made a crusade of his efforts to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , only to be ignored and ridiculed by many of his fellow lawmakers .
While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still sees the prospect of actually booting the president from office as " off the table , " discussing the idea now at least seems OK .
Sometime before its August recess , the House Judiciary Committee likely will hold a hearing to consider Kucinich 's impeachment appeal , CQ Politics reports : Chairman John Conyers Jr. , D - Mich. , said Judiciary will take a broad look at the behavior of the Bush administration , and Kucinich can lay out his arguments as part of that as - yet unscheduled hearing .
Kucinich , D - Ohio , intends to formally offer a resolution on Tuesday that accuses Bush of lying to Congress in order to get approval to invade Iraq .
Conyers said he wants a public discussion of the issues being raised by Kucinich , but does not plan to take any action on the resolution .
 We re not doing impeachment , but he can talk about it ,  the chairman said .
He said such a hearing would continue oversight of the executive branch that has included hearings on the exposure of the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame and the firing of U.S. attorneys .
Conyers appears to be of mixed opinions about impeachment .
Prior to the Democrats ' takeover of the House in 2006 , he penned a Washington Post editorial in which he all but promised he would n't .
But by August of this year , he seemed to have warmed .
" Nancy Pelosi has impeachment ' off the table , ' but that 's off her table , it is not off John Conyers ' table , " the Michigan Democrat said during a town hall meeting in his district Aug. 28 .
" Nancy Pelosi , who I actually supported , cannot prevent me from introducing an impeachment resolution against , well I 've got a long list of people who are eligible . "
A Conyers spokesman did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for clarification of the congressman 's comments at the time .
" I want you to know that I have no reticence , no reluctance , no hesitation to use the tool of impeachment ... whenever I feel that it is appropriate , " Conyers said .
" I only wish that I could be moved by a lot of people coming to my office . "
At a press conference last week when he unveiled the single article , Kucinich said a chance to talk was all he wanted .
Kucinich said he was " grateful " for Pelosi 's earlier suggestion that the Judiciary Committee may soon hold hearings on his measure .
" Like everything else in Washington , never say never , " Kucinich said .
Democrat says Congress must reassert power Speaking about his impeachment article last week , Kucinich said : " Congress must , in the name of the American people , use the one remedy which the Founders provided for an Executive who gravely abused his power : Impeachment .
" Congress must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government ; bring this President to an accounting , and in doing so reestablish the people 's trust in Congress and in our United States system of government .
We must not let this President 's conduct go unchallenged and thereby create a precedent which undermines the Constitution .
He continued , " In the final analysis this is about our Constitution and whether a President can be held accountable for his actions and his deceptions , especially when the effects of those actions have been so calamitous for America , Iraq and the world .
" Unless Congress reasserts itself as the power branch of government which the Founders intended , our experiment with a republican form of Government may be nearing an end , " Kucinich said in closing .
" But when Congress acts to hold this President accountable it will be redeeming the faith that the Founders had in the power of a system of checks and balances which preserves our republic . "

I ’ve noticed that frequently in technical discussions , the strongest disagreements seem to come from people with little to no actual experience with the technology they ’re arguing against .
How can that be ?
For example :
Test - First Development .
I wish I had a dollar for every time I ’ve suggested to a developer that writing their tests before or along with writing their code will make the code not only easier to write but also more robust coming out of the gate , and I get back responses like , “ What ?
That ’s crazy !
How can you write tests before you have any code ?
That does n’t make any sense ! ”
Having an initial reaction like that is n’t such a big deal , as I ’ve seen numerous developers who have such reactions actually try the “ test first ” approach and quickly become strong advocates who wonder how they ever did without it .
The point is , though , that they actually tried it .
Arguing with them before they tried it always turned out to be a total waste of time .
No amount of words seemed to convince them .
They had to experience it before they understood it .
Erlang syntax .
Erlang is getting more and more attention these days , and rightfully so , but a typical reaction from those who have written little to no Erlang code is that the language ’s syntax is too weird , too hard to read and write , etc .
Is the syntax different ?
Yes .
Is it weird or difficult ?
No , not at all — in fact , it ’s actually very simple and regular when compared to popular general - purpose imperative languages .
Spend a day or two writing some real Erlang code , and I guarantee you that any initial dislike you might have for its syntax will disappear .
REST .
If you search the blog of any REST proponent , including this one , you ’re sure to find all kinds of comments from detractors who argue against REST despite never having used it to develop any real systems .
Similarly , the blogs of many WS -* advocates who have never tried using REST contain all kinds of reasons why REST can’t possibly work .
Check out the comments in Damien Katz ’s recent “ REST , I just do n’t get it ” posting , for example ; you have useful ones from those who have obviously used REST and understand its benefits , and then you have other comments that argue against REST while simultaneously showing a great misunderstanding of it .
Those detractors would do well to read Bill de hÓra ’s excellent response .
Also interesting about these three particular cases is that I do n’t personally know of anyone who ’s actually tried the approaches and decided against them .
In a posting last November , for example , I asked for comments from anyone who had actually tried REST for real and with an open mind , but decided that it was inferior to WS -* and so abandoned it .
Either nobody read that posting or no such people exist .
I ’m fairly confident it ’s the latter .
There will always be arguments made by people whose livelihood is somehow threatened by the approach they ’re opposing , but I do n’t think that ’s the source of all the opposing arguments .
As developers we can’t possibly try everything , of course , because there just is n’t enough time .
It ’s inevitable that we ’ll sometimes have to resort to researching an approach via only reading , questions and discussion and decide against it without prototyping .
But ultimately we developers owe it to ourselves and our employers to keep ourselves objectively informed so that we can take advantage of new approaches whenever appropriate .
When a whole bunch of smart developers have success with a particular approach , I do n’t see how any responsible developer can actively and vocally oppose it without first objectively trying the approach and experiencing it firsthand .
When the Korea Development Bank had signaled that buying a stake in an investment bank might be premature at this juncture , it had appeared the bureaucrats had beaten back KDB ’s chairman and former head of Lehman ’s Seoul branch , Min-Euoo - song , who was pushing the deal .
But the Telegraph tells us not only that negotiations are back on , but that Lehman appears desperate to cinch a deal before its earnings are announced in roughly two weeks .
And no wonder .
The Telegraph indicates the earnings release will include $ 4 billion of writedowns .
Note that this is consistent with , even lower than some of the estimates out on the Street now .
For instance , Merrill ’s Guy Moszkowski forecasts that Lehman will lose $ 2.6 billion in its third quarter , showing $ 4.5 billion in losses , with a 35 % reduction due to gains on hedges .
So if these numbers are already reflected in the stock price , why the scramble to get a deal done ?
Is this simply adherence to the recent practice of having capital - raisings in hand that are equal to or in excess of the hit to capital ?
Is it that , as with the second quarter , the losses that will be announced are vastly worse than expected ?
Or is it that the details in the financials will suggest that further deterioration is likely ?
From the Telegraph :
ALBANY – Gov. Paterson , convinced the state faces its worst fiscal crisis since the mid-1970s , will deliver the grim news in an unprecedented special address to New Yorkers as soon as tomorrow night , The Post has learned .
The governor ’s address – which his aides hope will be televised by public and cable news stations – will say that plunging state revenues will force painful cuts in state services , necessitate a reduction in the state work force , possibly through layoffs , and require other difficult economic measures , source said .
Paterson is also expected to announce that he ’s ordered state agencies to slash spending beyond the relatively modest 3.3 percent cuts he ordered in late spring .
City ‘ Kitty ’ Bound for Crisis Too
Fall Fashions Show Depression - Era Chic
He may also call a special session of the Legislature to propose reducing some of the record - high levels of spending that were approved as part of the state ’s new budget in April .
“ The situation is worse than anyone realizes , ” said a source close to Paterson .
“ The governor has said he ’s tired of the state going from deficit to deficit , spending like it has a credit card that never has to be paid , and that he ’s prepared to take action , ” the source said .
Paterson in recent days has huddled with budget planning officials from the administrations of former Govs.
Mario Cuomo and Hugh Carey “ to get their ideas on how to manage a fiscal crisis , ” the source said .
To make his concern even clearer , Paterson will hold a private meeting today with Columbia University ’s Nobel prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , the former head of the World Bank , who has called the current worldwide financial crisis the worst since the Great Depression .
“ The governor has been impressed with Stiglitz ’s work , and there have been staff discussions leading to the meeting Monday , ” said an administration source .
Paterson warned last week that Wall Street bonuses – a major source of state tax revenue – will likely drop by 20 percent or more this year .
A day later the state Financial Control Board said New York City ’s projected two - year deficit had grown by a whopping $ 4 billion because of Wall Street losses and the economy ’s overall decline .
The governor ’s own budget experts are slated to present an updated financial plan with sharply lower projected revenues on Wednesday .
Spendthrift New York City almost went bankrupt in 1975 - 76 and the state defaulted on some of its bonds at the same time in the worst fiscal crisis to face New York since the Great Depression .
While state and city leaders pledged to assure the prudence of future fiscal practices , that pledge was largely abandoned during the past 20 years as officials ran up state spending at two or three times the inflation rate because of sharp increases in education and health - care spending .

A " why bother ? " economy has been created in Britain which has left thousands with no motivation to work , a report published today concludes .
Successive governments have encouraged a welfare culture that has left every family facing a £ 1,300 bill because the poor stay poor , it claims .
The findings by the public services think tank Reform suggest that increased welfare dependency has made it more difficult for those on the lowest incomes to do better .
Scroll down for more ...
Jean Thompson , right , with son Steven and granddaughter Jessica :
All ten members of her family share a three - bedroom council house and have never worked
An education system with a " dismal record " of educating the poorest , and a complex welfare system , have together created a far more divided society than other European countries , it finds .
Means - tested benefits and higher taxes have reduced the incentives available to those on low incomes to better themselves , Reform says .
It concludes : " The unintended consequence has been a ' why bother ? ' economy in which a significant minority do not have the capability or motivation to succeed . "
The report finds that social mobility has not improved since the 1970s , despite substantial increases in benefits - Compared to other industrial countries the UK has an above - average number of the low - skilled relying on state handouts , which reduces the economy 's productivity .
Reform concludes that if the UK had the skills levels of the U.S. the benefit to the economy would be £ 32 billion per year , or £ 1,300 per family .
And it points out that inequalities in the tax system mean that those receiving welfare who find work face punitive rates of taxation as for every extra pound earned they lose up to 90 per cent of their benefit .
Professor Nick Bosanquet , Reform 's consultant director , said : " Social mobility is a vital economic issue , not just an equity issue .
" We need to look at new ways of making it happen in this much tougher economic environment .
" Every person failed by the education system and held back by the tax and benefits system means that the economy cannot fulfil its potential . "
Publication of the report coincides with one from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies which calls for a major overhaul of Gordon Brown 's beleaguered tax credit system to provide better incentives for those on benefit to find work .
It calls for replacing the current " piecemeal " benefits system with a single programme which would give more to those who work , but less to those who do not .
The Mail highlighted the problem of those refusing to work last month , meeting families in which not one member has worked for three generations .
The grandmother matriarch of one , Sue McFadden , 54 , said : " Our neighbours are so snobby - they call us the ' Shameless ' family and say that we ought to go out to work .
But how can we work when we have all these children to look after ? "
I find it truly dismaying that you cling to the belief that George W Bush , Richard Cheney and their administrations have not lead the United States to very dire straits with a growing litany of failures not only of policy but of moral rectitude .
Surely you must admit that considering
the de-valuation of the dollar , the sky - rocketing national debt , the worrisome American indebtedness to the PRC , the astronomic rise in oil and food prices , the sub - prime crisis , the housing crisis , rising unemployment , the despicable , loathsome shyster - like lexical dissembling attempted by the Bush administration to justify the torturing of " detainees " the kidnapping and " torture - by - proxy " program of " Special Rendition " the waiving of " Habeas Corpus " as a matter of policy , the illegal spying on American citizens conducted by the government , the illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that continue to devastate those countries and our economy , the horrific loss of life due to those conflicts , the growing clamor for investigation of war profiteering by Halliburton , KBR , Bechtel and other corporations with ties to members of these administrations , the unlawful politicization of the Justice Department , the loss of prestige by America in the international community of nations , and the nose - thumbing at international efforts to address global climate change ,
have all happened on George W. Bush 's " watch " -- surely you must admit that he and his administrations have not exactly been a boon for our nation or the world .
It is sad and dismaying that any of you would prefer to pass off all of the above mentioned catastrophes as partisan smoke - screens set by " liberals " to salve their sense of pride about not winning the political beauty contests of 2000 and 2004 .
It is understandable that you would prefer to do that rather than face the truth about the horrific , disastrous political and economic situation that is the legacy of George W Bush and his administrations , but it is sad .
It is sad and dismaying that you actually believe that there remains the possibility of anything remotely close to what might be even loosely construed as a military victory in Iraq -- a deplorable military mis-adventure that the Pentagon 's premier military educational institute , the National Defense University , called a " debacle " in its April , 2008 report .
( I say " believe " because it must be faith , there being no logical argument or rational thought or consideration of substantive data involved . )
This deeply felt dismay has been brought on by the lying , conniving , obfuscating , dissembling , misrepresenting , mis-informing , dis - informing clutch of greedy , self - serving ultra-nationalists " serving " in the US government ( such as Karl Rove , Donald Rumsfeld , Colin Powell , Condi Rice , Dick Cheney , David Addington , etc ) whose actions have resulted in an illegal invasion and violent military occupation of a sovereign nation ; the reduction of the " Cradle of Civilization " to a bombed - out shell of a looted museum ruled by murderous force of arms ; the continued occupation of another ruined wreck of a third - world nation ; the death of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghanis , an estimated 4.7 million Iraqi refugees ; and the eviscerating of US banking regulations that took the legal restraints off of " predatory lenders " ( aka loan sharks ) leaving thousands of Americans bankrupt and homeless .
It is sad and dismaying NOT because the vast majority of Americans who presently disapprove of Bush 's policies hold you personally responsible .
It is sad and dismaying that you have swallowed the Neo-Conservative propaganda hook , party line and sinker .
It is sad and dismaying that many of you continue to denounce as " unpatriotic " those who did n't take the bait .
It is sad and dismaying that you do not see that the clay feet of your " heroes " are crumbling in a rising tide of irrefutable evidence of stark criminality and arrogant disregard for the fundamental values of this nation and the expressed will of the people .
No one would expect you to admit publically that the pastseven and a half years have been ruinous to the US , Iraq and Afghanistan .
No one would expect an admission by you that you chose badly in placing your trust in Bush and Cheney .
No one expects you to change your political stripes .
What is dismaying is that you would choose to place your sanity and your own moral rectitude in peril by not at the least admitting to yourself that the bandwagon you 've been riding on in a high dudgeon of patriotic fervor is on fire and headed over the cliff with millions of people , millions of your fellow Americans , in tow .
That is cause for much sadness and dismay .
Sincerely ,
DC Rapier
The Institute for National Strategic Studies , National Defense University ( NDU ) Report for April , 2008 .
July 29 , 2008 --
It 's a Godzilla vs. King Kong match - up -- in mice .
Researchers have pitted the food - poisoning bug salmonella against breast , colon , and skin cancers in lab animals .
Who wins ?
Hint : Do n't bet on the cancer .
Markus Loeffler , MD , John C. Reed , MD , PhD , and colleagues at California 's Burnham Institute for Medical Research took advantage of the fact that salmonella bacteria home in on cancer cells and accumulate in tumors .
But for medical use , the bacteria have to be rendered harmless .
What chance would they have against cancer cells ?
To fix the odds in salmonella 's favor , Loeffler and colleagues turned the bugs into ticking time bombs .
They genetically engineered the bacteria to give off the FasL cytokine , a deadly chemical signal that tells cells to commit suicide and also attracts attack by immune cells .
When injected into mice with breast or colon cancers , the salmonella did exactly what they were supposed to do .
They inhibited the growth of breast tumors by 59 % and growth of colon tumors by 82 % .
Moreover , they reduced the tumor spread to other parts of the body by a third .
Perhaps most importantly , the deadly chemical signal the bacteria carried did not damage the mice .
The results , Loeffler and colleagues conclude , suggest that genetically engineered salmonella " could offer an acceptable strategy for employing FasL and possibly other toxic cytokines for cancer therapy . "
The researchers report their findings in the Aug. 6 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .

Long a symbol of humanity ’s throw - away culture , existing landfill sites are now being viewed as mines of potential which as the world population grows could also help bolster the planet ’s dwindling natural resources .
“ By 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet , we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars , and we could be in a really resource - hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in Libya , Russia and Saudi where natural gas is limited , ” said Peter Jones , one of Britain ’s leading experts on waste management .
“ It is those drivers , those conditions , which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining . ”
In Britain alone , experts say landfill sites could offer up an estimated 200 million tonnes of old plastic -- worth up to 60 billion pounds at current prices -- to be recovered and recycled , or converted to liquid fuel .
As many oil analysts predict oil prices will stay above $ 100 a barrel , waste experts in America , Europe and across Asia have been conducting pilot projects to recoup old plastic and other waste materials .
Prices for high quality plastics such as high - density polyethelenes ( HDP ) have more than doubled to between 200 and 300 pounds ( $ 370 - 560 ) per tonne , from just above 100 pounds a year ago , according to experts in the waste industry .
With this in mind , leaders of the world ’s waste management industry are planning to come together in London in October for what is being billed as the first “ global landfill mining ” conference .
“ Once plastic is in a landfill site , it pretty much sits there doing nothing -- and the beauty of that is that you ’re able to go back and recapture it in the future , ” said Peter Mills , a director of waste and recycling company New Earth Solutions , who is scheduled to speak at the conference .
“ There are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil , so as the raw price of oil goes up , every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly . ”
According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the amount of household rubbish thrown out across the world is expected to rise to about 3 billion tonnes a year by 2030 from 1.6 billion tonnes in 2005 -- or about 1 kg ( 2.2 lbs ) per person per day in 2005 .
Many of the world ’s rich countries send about half of that trash to landfill , but the OECD projects that rate will fall to 40 percent by 2030 as governments promote recycling -- of materials such as metals , glass and paper -- or incineration to generate heat or electricity .
“ Over a period of a very long time -- many decades -- we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites -- so there are valuable resources in those sites , ” said Steve Whatmore , of Orchid Environmental , a waste and recycling firm .
“ And wherever there are valuable resources , there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them .
The logic is sound , but the practicalities are complex -- and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability . ”
FROM “ SCAVENGING ” TO “ LANDFILL MINING ”
Landfill mining -- digging in dumps for valuable materials -- is hardly a new concept , and already viable for some .
Images of poor , often homeless people scavenging waste to sell from landfill sites in Asia and South America have already provided evidence there is money to be made from other people ’s rubbish .

William Hogland , a professor in Environmental Engineering and Recovery from the University of Kalmar in Sweden , also points to previous instances of dumpsite mining in Israel in the early 1950s where the soil -- enriched with rotting waste -- was recovered and recycled to improve soil quality in orchards .
And certain U.S. states have since the 1980s mined waste from landfills to be used as fuel for incineration to produce energy .
“ Several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre-feasibility studies in countries in Europe , but also in China , Japan and India , ” he said .
For global waste experts , not everyone ’s rubbish is the same : different sites have different potential and an individual country ’s or region ’s dumps show characteristics relating to the culture , historical development and economic climate .
“ For example , landfills in Sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material , reflecting the construction boom of that era , ” said Hogland .
“ And other landfills have very specific waste -- like those used by vehicle breakers -- which have high concentrations of aluminum , copper and iron scrap . ”
“ The value of these materials varies daily with global market prices , and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from China , for instance . ”
But in Britain , it is in the millions of tonnes of plastic that people threw out in a pre-recycling era that experts see a potentially lucrative future .
That potential is clear to Chris Dow , managing director of the first so - called “ closed loop ” recycling plant in Britain able to recycle plastic bottles to a standard high enough for re-use as food packaging .
Closed Loop London is one of only six similar plants around the world in Austria , Germany , Mexico , Switzerland and the United States and processes polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) plastic , used for water and drinks bottles , and high - density polyethylene ( HDP ) .
It has the capacity to recycle 35,000 tonnes each year .
A passionate recycler , Dow is convinced there is value buried in rubbish dumps , but angry that talk has turned to investing in technologies to harvest it rather than focusing on stopping more plastic from being dumped now .
“ Just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills -- it could be incredible , ” he told Reuters .
“ But the insane thing is that we are talking now about investing millions into tapping into a resource under the ground , when the real tragedy is that every week we ’re still dumping tonnes and tonnes of plastic into more landfills .
It ’s an act of vandalism against the environment . ”
Obama spokesman Bill Burton reacts to McCain 's new ad repeating the Bridge to Nowhere claim :
Despite being discredited over and over again by numerous news organizations , the McCain campaign continues to repeat the lie that Sarah Palin stopped the Bridge to Nowhere .
John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 % of the time and he and Sarah Palin will continue Bush 's economic policies , his health care policy , his education policy , his energy policy , and his foreign policy .
McCain and Palin will say or do anything to make people believe that they will change something besides the person sitting in the Oval Office .
That 's the kind of politics people are tired of , and it 's anything but change .
I keep a pretty close eye on the searches that bring people to this blog .
A lot of you are searching for how to sort in JavaScript ( I ’ll have to go into more detail on sorting soon ) .
And a whole mess of you want to know about missing and default parameters .
I ’m going to take another shot at the default parameter problem .
I gave a solution that adds just one line of code per function , but it requires you to pass all parameters in a single object .
I ’ll adapt that solution to better handle the normal way of passing JavaScript parameters .
Really quickly , let ’s talk about JavaScript parameters .
When you pass in fewer than the expected number of parameters , the missing ones come in as undefined .
When you pass in more than the expected number of parameters , the excess ones can be slurped out of the arguments pseudo - array .
This array - like variable has the length method , but is missing other array methods .
A common way to implement default parameters is with a series of statements like this : a=a || 1 ;
The problem with such a statement is that so many different values evaluate to false that it ’s easy to make a mistake and prevent a valid number like 0 from coming through .
A better way to implement default parameters is like this : if ( a===undefined ) a=1 ; Another common way is if ( a==null ) a=1 ;
This works pretty well because null and undefined are loosely equal to each other , but other falsy values are n’t equal to either of them .
Let ’s modify my defaultHandler from my previous post on the subject so that it works with arrays instead of objects .
defaultHandler=function ( defaults , params ) { var i ; for ( i=0 ;i< defaults.length ;i++ ) { if ( params [i ]!==undefined ) { defaults [ i] =params [i ] ; } } return defaults ; }
Choose Your Poison
You now have a couple choices on how to use it .
After the default handler is called , the array params will hold all your parameters in order .
function test ( a , b, c ) { var params=defaultHandler ( [ 1 , " banana " , 3 ] , arguments ) ; console.log ( params ) ; }
If you really want to , you can stuff the values back into the original named parameters …
function test ( a , b, c ) { var params=defaultHandler ( [ 1 , " banana " , 3 ] , arguments ) ; a=params [ 0 ] ; b=params [ 1 ] ; c=params [ 2 ] ; console.log ( a , b, c ) ; }
It ’s a shame there ’s no way to automate that stuffing of the parameters back into the original variables , is n’t it ?
Ah , but there is .
In fact , the whole process can be cleaned up with a bit of metaprogramming and some introspection .
But that ’s for Episode VI .
Note :
This is the second post on default parameters .
I took a cue from George Lucas on its numbering to try to get some search hits from the Star Wars zealots .
