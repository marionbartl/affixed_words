The evil Bush administration has largely completed the process begun years ago of turning America , the most powerful and richest nation in history , into a Third World nation .
I remember a lunch , about 21 years ago in Long Beach , California , with the president of an aerospace company , myself , and a senior foreign general .
A comment by the general has always stayed with me .
He said , " America is a very rich nation , it will take a lot to bring her down " .
In the twenty some years after this , I am simply amazed at just how far one crooked president after another , with the assistance of our " bought and paid for " Congress has managed to take us .
Currently we have an economy that is being held together with bailing wire and glue until after the November election .
Even CNBC 's Cramer , a capitalist if there ever was one , now says that the American stock market is so rigged that the average person needs to get out NOW ( link to a video with him talking about this is http://www.breakthematrix.com/content/Cramer-
States - the - Obvious - Markets - are - Rigged --- here ) .
We have just seen the early stages of systemic problems in the American economy and the global economy with the fallout from the subprime mortgage problems .
The real problem is that the " policemen " of the American economy , and to a lessor extent the entire global economy , have " been asleep " at their jobs ; and this has not been an accident .
Laws have been changed overturning the post - Great Depression rules designed to save the banking industry from itself .
We have had a massive host of new investment vehicles created over the last few years , and in many cases even the people pushing the vehicles do not understand how they work because they have been designed to be so complex as to confuse even the experts .
We have $ 1.2 quadrillion invested in derivates , trillions in collateralized debt obligations and structured investment vehicles ~ and many of these new forms of financial paper are shady in the extreme .
The American economy , and with it the global economy , is being deliberately set up to collapse .
One can look to the traditional sources of war , economic crisis , and revolution to find the cause behind the demise of America .
The global international banking families fingerprints are all over the programmed fall of America .
While they had their hands in the War of 1812 , and the Civil War , blackmailed Wilson to get the US into the First World War , placed their puppet FDR in the White House to control ( to their designs ) the Great Depression and then to bate the Japanese to attack us to get American in the Second World War , the deliberate high treason committed on 9/11 by senior Bush / Cheney administration officials was a new low .
We have now experienced almost seven years of wars based on this false flag operation and we are being led into yet another war with Iran ( a nation with advanced biological strategic weapons of mass destruction that can kill a third of the world ) .
Additionally the satanic US Vice - President is in Georgia preparing to push the Russians into the coming Third World War ; a world war that with current 21st Century weapons will kill most of us .
We are currently witnessing the main stream news media 's massive coverage of the Democratic National Convention , with the follow - on coverage of the Republican National Convention in a couple of weeks .
This coverage is designed to convince the American public that " their vote does count " , that the American political system is working for them .
This BS / hype is falling on more and more ' deaf ears ' as more people turn to the alternative internet news sources for the truth .
Americans have not forgotten that two years ago they elected a Democratic Congress to end the war in Iraq but instead the Democratic controlled Congress actually increased the funding for the war and the troop levels .
Some thirty - five years ago , we legalized bribery in America by allowing PACs ( political action committees ) .
What had been done before under the table , suddenly became legal and this allowed money to elbow out whatever influence the public had in Congress .
Unless you are making tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to your congress critter do n't expect him to really care about you or your interest .
The average Congressman must raise $ 40,000 per day for every day that he / she spends in Washington .
Not even the most beautiful hooker on earth can rake in that level of money but out Congressmen and Senators do , giving a whole new meaning to the term prostitution .
We have a medical / pharmaceutical industry that is more fraud and rip off than real medicine .
Most expensive pharmaceuticals are designed to " treat you " rather than to " cure you " and in fact the treatment usually brings on additional serious health problems .
No one can do anything about this as Big Pharma spends untold millions every year buying off Congress .
We have a giant agricultural industry whose genetically modified food is killing off the bees and without the bees , most of us will not have enough food to survive .
A sign of a Third World country is that its systems do n't work well because the government is for sale .
When you can bribe anyone in the government to get what you want , regardless of the death and suffering that it causes to the population , that is a sign of very deep sickness in the nation .
No society that allows a high level of organic corruption , of the outright buying of votes in its parliament or congress , will function well .
That is why so many African and other Third World nations are failed states .
This is happening more and more to America .
We are in a madman 's race to see what kills us first , corporate food and medical nightmares or the ever increasing march to global war by the neo-cons .
It breaks my heart to see the great American experiment in democracy fail and fail so horribly .
The first Earl of Stirling ( Sir William Alexander of Menstrie ) was the founder of English - speaking Canada and was the owner of what became several American states and most of Canada .
The last claimant ( before me ) to the Earldom was Major General Lord Stirling of the American Revolutionary Army .
He was a key financier of George Washington ; took over Washington 's command when he would take a rare leave of absence to return to Mt. Vernon ; saved Washington 's army at the Battle of Long Island ( which the Earls of Stirling use to own ) ; and gave his fortune and his life to the American nation .
On my watch ( as Earl ) , I am seeing America destroyed .

" 集合知プログラミング " という本が出たらしい .
私の積読には元本の " Programming Collective Intelligence " があって , 途中まで読んだまま放置していたら日本語訳が出てしまった.
( オライリーのアンチパターンと命名. ) 悔しいので本は処分 .
そのうち日本語版で続きを読もう....
興味を持っていたのは推薦エンジン( 協調フィルタ)だった.
私の中では検索エンジンに匹敵するウェブのハイテクという位置付けなんだけど , 草の根には普及しておらず悲しい. 検索エンジンでの Hyper Estraier や senna に相当する協調フィルタの立ち位置は デッドヒートが予想される ...とだいぶ前から思ってるんだけど , いまのところ閑古鳥気味 .
まったく , 出し抜くだけの実力があればなあ .
先の皇帝ペンギン本では , 一章にさっそく協調フィルタが登場する .
読んでみると , 簡潔な python のコードであっさりアルゴリズムが実装されている .
著者とリスト内包表記の力に目を見張る. 例題は del.icio.us を使った推薦エンジン .
私もさっそく ruby で del.icio.us 用エンジンを書いたけど , いまいちうまく動かなかった . del.icio.us は取得できるデータが制限されている上に , すぐ throttling されてしまう .
十分なデータが揃わないとレコメンダの旨味はでない.
( 私のコードにバグがあっただけかもしらんけど...)
そのあと少し真面目に作りなおそうと調べ物をしていたら , 海外では Netflix Prize という 推薦エンジンコンテストで盛り上っていたのを知った .
Netflix はアメリカにあるオンラインレンタルビデオ屋で , 日本でいうと ぽすれん みたいなものだろうか .
割と人気のあるサービスらしく , friendfeed でも対応している .
でも日本はサービス外で , すっかり外野気分 .
Netflix は Amazon ばりの協調フィルタを持っており , ユーザの試聴記録と評価の星から次に見るべきビデオを勧めてくれる.
あるとき , この協調フィルタの性能に限界を感じた
Netflix は思いきった行動に出る .
アルゴリズムの一般公募を始めたのだ. そのコンテストが Netflix Prize というわけ .
コンテストは 2006 年に始まり , 2011 年(!) まで続く. 賞金は 100 万ドル. 年に一回 " Progress Prize " という途中経過の表彰もある .
こちらは賞金 5 万ドル. 2007 年に最初の Progress Prize が贈られている .
参加者は匿名化された実データのサブセットをダウンロードし , 自分のアルゴリズムで計算した推薦データ投稿する.
運営システムはその投稿を秘密の実データと比較 , 誤差を評価する .
誤差が小さいほど成績があがる. 現在のランキングは leaderboard で一覧できる .
score が誤差 , improvement が Netflix のシステム ( Cinematch ) からの改善分をあらわしている .
Prize が始まってしばらくは , 賞金目当ての猛者と外野が大層盛りあがっていたらしい .
そんな祭りに乗りそびれたのは悔しいけれど , レースはまだ続いている . いまさら様子を眺めてみよう .
Try This at Home
コンテスト開始から数ヶ月後 , 参加者のひとり Simon Funk が自身のアルゴリズムを ウェブで公開し波紋を呼んだ .
Simon は行列ベースの協調フィルタ( 皇帝ペンギン本で紹介されているようなの) では必須となる SVD の高速な実装を紹介している .
購買情報のように極めて疎な行列は推薦エンジンのアリゴリズムで扱いにくい.
そこでより低い次数をもつ , 密度の高い行列に変換して扱うのが機械学習の定石となっている(らしい ) .
SVD はこうした次元の縮退に用いるツールのひとつで , ふつうは計算に時間がかかる .
Simon のアルゴリズムを使うと SVD の近似を高速に計算できるという .
( 計算そのものより結果の更新の速さが売りなんだけれど , まあそれは細かい話 . )
Prize 参加者に走った衝撃は , 当時の Forum のスレッド を見るとわかる .
これ以降 , アマチュア参加者がまずやるべきなのはこの
Simon's SVD を実装することになったと言っていい .
Netflix Prize 入門サイトでは必ず紹介されている .
ちなみに Simon 自身は既にコンテストから身を引いたのか , ランキングにそれらしい名前はない .
2007 年のインタビュ ー( PDF ) を読んだ範囲でもやる気はなさそう.
なんとなくかっこいい .
いまでは Simon Funk 以外にもいくつかのチームが自らのアルゴリズムを解説している.
そうした解説は leaderboard からリンクされている各チームのページで見ることができる .
( ワークショップもあっ た らしい ...)
When Gravity and Dinosaurs Unite
2007 年の冬 , 参加者の一群は Progress Prize に向けて凌ぎを削っていた .
トップを走るのは " KorBell " .
AT&T の研究者 Yehuda Koren と Bob Bell のチームだ .
( プロかよ ... ) そして後を追う " Team Gravity " と " Team Dinosaur Planet " .
どちらも学生( 当時 ) がやっている .
締切も差し迫ったころ , KorBell を追うこの 2 チームが手を組み , " When Gravity and Dinosaurs Unite " を結成する .
そしてお互いの出力をブレンドし , 結果を改善したのだ .
トップに躍り出る重力の恐竜! ( 画像は上のページから拝借 )
しかし KorBell も黙ってはいない .
すかさず新しい結果を投稿し , 彼らを抜き返したのだ .
結局そのまま KorBell が逃げきり , 第一回の Progress Prize を手中に収めた .
終盤の白熱した様子は Berkeley science review の取材が詳しく伝えている .
その夜 , 僕とチームメイトはほとんど眠らなかったから , 頭の中は新しいテクニックやどうやってそれを混ぜるかで一杯だった .
コードを仕立てて何個か新しい方法を試した , 結果はよくなった .
けれど決着がついてみると BellKor がトップだったのさ .
それにしても < 出力をブレンドする > なんてことができるんだろうか?
これを可能にするのが , ensemble learning や boosting と呼ばれる一連のアルゴリズムだ(と Wikipedia に書いてあった .
私はよくしらない ... ) .
トップの KorBell も , 実は 100 以上のアルゴリズムを合成したと解説記事で明らかにしている.
やりすぎだろ ...
KorBell はブレンドにも工夫をしている : テストデータを性質に応じて 15 に分割し , 個々の部分集 合( bin ) ごとに別々の重みを与えているのだ.
こうすることで , データの性質による得手不得手をある程度補い合えるという.
KorBell の後継である BellKor は今も leaderboad でトップの座を守り続けている .
Team Gravity はレコメンダ屋を 起業 した. もう一つのトップ常連である BigChaos も 起業 している .
みんながんばってね .
心理学者の追 撃
上位の膠着状態が続くなか新星が現れた. その新星 , " Just a guy in a garage " は しばらく所在を明らかにせず , 利用しているアルゴリズムについてもまったく知られていなかったが , 今年 2 月の WIRED の記事 が彼の正体を明らかにした .
記事による と Just a guy ... の作者は Gavin Potter というイギリス在住の心理学者で , もともとは IBM でコンサルをしていたらしい .
機械学習でも勉強するかと会社をやめた傍ら手をつけた
Netflix Prize で , 目を見張る成果を上げることになる .
Gavin Potter はアルゴリズムの詳細を明らかにしていないが , 先の記事では " アンカリング " など 行動経済学の知見をとりこんだと謳っている .
自身の blog でも , 他の参加者は " ignore the fact that there are humans actually making the ratings . " と指摘し , そこに勝機を見ているようだ .
また 他のエントリ では " シリーズもの同士の相関 " というように , コンテンツの中身に踏みこんだ調査もしている.
たしかに評価データを行列やベクトルとみなす数学者的アプローチとは少し違う視点を持っているのかもしれない.
WIRED の記事は多くの関心を集めたようだ .
マンネリ化が始まったかに見えた leaderboard にも新風を吹きこんだ .
記事を読んで興味をもったという PragmaticTheory チームは , 早くも第 3 位に食い込んでいる .
Wikinomics blog も今年に入ってから この Prize に言及するなど , 開始から 2 年近くがたった Netflix Prize は今なお何か面白いことが起きそうな予感を孕んでいる .
データセットにまつわる話
Netflix Prize の公開したテストデータは画期的なものだった .
それ以前に世の中で公開されていた最大のデータセットは
Movie Lens のもの で , これは 1,000,000 件のデータを含んでいた .
対する Netflix のデータはおよそ 100,000,000 件のデータを含む .
二桁多い .
この巨大なデータがアカデミアの興味を引いたのは間違いない.
かつて Amazon でレコメンダを開発していた Greg Linden もこの点を評価している .
ある新しいアリゴリズムが現実のデータセットで使えるだけスケールするのか , 研究者は検証のしようがなかった. 洗練されたアルゴリズムよりデータの量がものをいう 世界でこれは困ってしまう .
Prize のデータセットはそんな状況を改善した .
( Netflix は 一日 200 万 件 のペースで評価データが増える というから , この 1 億件もたかだか二ヶ月分なんだけどね ...)
リアルで巨大なデータセットは思わぬ問題に繋がる.
ある研究者が , Netflix Prize のデータセットから匿名性を暴く研究を公表した .
この研究では , あるユーザについて 7 - 8 件の評 価( と評価日 ) 情報がわかれば , そのユーザ を Prize のデータセットから特定できるとしている .
雑談のつもりで映画の善し悪しをを話したら , 他の( 人には言えないような ) ビデオの閲覧情報が明らかになってしまうわけ.
ちょっと気味が悪い .
この研究に限らず , データセットや推薦結果のプライバシは昨今の協調フィルタの分野では割とよく研究されているようす.
面倒だけど仕方ないのかもしらん.
オープンソースの推薦エンジン
色々読み物を眺めているうちに , 実際のコードをみたくなってきた .
探してみるとオープンソースの実装がいくつかあった.
PHP 向けの Vogoo と Java 製の Taste は , そこそこ開発が続いているように見える .
Vogoo のサイトにはいくつか採用実績が載っている .
日本では 映画生活 が採用しており , ウノウラボにも紹介記事 があった .
Taste のサイトにはそうした記述は見当らないが , その割にはちゃんと作ってあるんだよな .
開発者自身が使っているのかもしれない. (...と思ったけど開発者の Sean Owen は Google のプログラマなので , 仕事じゃ使えなそうだなあ .
やっぱり単なる趣味かもね. )
PHP はしんどいので Java で書かれ た Taste のコードをみると , Netflix Prize に出てくるような高等なアルゴリズムは使っていない .
ただデータの入出力やアルゴリズムを pluggable にするなど好感の持てる作りではある .
Prize データを読み込むモジュールもあった .
その Taste が少し前に Apache の Mahout プロジェクトへ 統合されたのは興味深い .
Mahout は Apache Hadoop の上に機械学習のライブラリを揃えようという野心的なプロジェクトで , Taste もそうしたライブラリに組込もうとしているのだろう .
レポジトリをみたところ , Taste 用の Job ( Mapper や Reducer ) の実装が始まっている .
Mahout で実装している SparseMatrix や SparseVector を使う様子はなく , 自身のデータ構造を使って Hadoop の上に実装を進めている .
これまでの Taste は計算に使うデータをオンメモリに持つつくりになっており , 規模拡大に不安があった .
Hadoop にあわせてうまくデータを分割できれば , こうした制限を押し広げることができるだろう .
Mahout も今のところ多くの機能が未実装で使えるかんじじゃないけれど , 熱心に開発が続いている .
二年もすれば実用になる並列計算のライブラリになっているんじゃなかろうか.
追いかけがいのあるプロジェクトだとおもう.
まとめ
さて , 勢いに任せて Netflix Prize の周辺をとりとめもなく眺めてみました .
ウェブみてる暇があったらコード書けという話もあるけど , そこは夏休みということでお許しを. 暑くてね...
日本語で読める推薦エンジンの解説記事には , " 推薦システム-情報過多時代をのりきる " などがある .
同じ著者によるもう少し詳しい入門記事として , 人工知能学会誌 の 2007/11 から三号続けて連載があった.
学生のひとは学校の図書館で読めるんじゃないでしょうか. 夏休みの暇潰しに Netflix Prize にのりこむのも面白そう .

Water , good ol ' H 2 O , seems like a pretty simple substance to you and me .
But in reality , water - the foundation of life and most common of liquid - is really weird and scientists actually do n't completely understand how water works .
Here are 5 really weird things about water :
1. Hot Water Freezes Faster Than Cold Water
Take two pails of water ; fill one with hot water and the other one with cold water , and put them in the freezer .
The hot one would be frozen before the cold one .
But wait , you say , that 's counterintuitive : would n't the hot water have to cool down to the temperature of the cold water before proceeding to freezing temperature , whereas the cold one has " less to go " before freezing ?
In 1963 , a Tanzanian high - school student named Erasto B. Mpemba was freezing hot ice cream mix in a cooking class when he noticed that a hot mix actually froze faster than a cold mix .
When he asked his teacher about this phenomenon , his teacher ridiculed him by saying " All I can say is that is Mpemba 's physics and not universal physics . "
Thankfully , Mpemba did n't back down - he convinced a physics professor to conduct an experiment which eventually confirmed his observations : in certain conditions , hot water indeed freezes before cold water * .
Actually , Mpemba was in good company .
The phenomenon of hot water freezing first , now called the " Mpemba effect " was noted by none other than Aristotle , Francis Bacon and René Descartes .
But how do scientists explain this strange phenomenon ?
It turns out that no one really knows but there are several possible explanations , including differences in supercooling ( see below ) , evaporation , frost formation , convection , and effects of dissolved gasses between the hot and cold water .
* In reality - of course - it 's much more complex than that : hot water freezes first ( it forms ice at a higher temperature than cold water ) , whereas cold water freezes faster ( it takes less time to reach the supercooled state from which it forms ice ) - see discussion on our previous blog post about this topic .
2. Supercooling and " Instant " Ice
Everybody knows that when you cool water to 0 °C ( 32 °F ) it forms ice ... except that in some cases it does n't !
You can actually chill very pure water past its freezing point ( at standard pressure , no cheating ! ) without it ever becoming solid .
Scientist know a lot about supercooling : it turns out that ice crystals need nucleation points to start forming .
These nucleation points could be anything from gas bubbles to impurities to the rough surface of the container .
Without these things , water would continue to be a " supercooled " liquid well below its freezing point .
When nucleation is triggered , then a supercooled water would " instantly " turn into ice , as this very cool video clip by Phil Medina of MrSciGuy shows :
Note : Similarly , superheated water remains liquid even when heated past its boiling point .
3. Glassy Water
Quick : how many phases of water are there ?
If you answer three ( liquid , gas , and solid ) you 'd be wrong .
There are at least 5 different phases of liquid water and 14 different phases ( that scientists have found so far ) of ice .
Remember the supercooling we talked about before ?
Well , it turns out that no matter what you do , at - 38 °C even the purest supercooled water spontaneously turns into ice ( with a little audible " bang " no less ) .
But what happens if you continue to lower the temperature ?
Well , at - 120 °C something strange starts to happen : the water becomes ultraviscous , or thick like molasses .
And below - 135 °C , it becomes " glassy water , " a solid with no crystal structure .

4. Quantum Properties of Water
At a molecular level , water is even weirder .
In 1995 , a neutron scattering experiment got a weird result : physicists found that when neutrons were aimed at water molecules , they " saw " 25 % fewer hydrogen protons than expected .
Long story short , at the level of attoseconds ( 10 - 18 seconds ) there is a weird quantum effect going on and the chemical formula for water is n't H 2 O .
It 's actually H 1.5 O! ( Source )
5. Does Water Have Memory ?
In the alternative medicine of homeopathy , a dilute solution of a compound can is purported to have healing effects , even if the dilution factor is so large that statistically there is n't a single molecule of anything in it except for water .
Homeopathy proponents explain this paradox with a concept called " water memory " where water molecules " remember " what particles were once dissolved in it .
This made no sense to Madeleine Ennis , a pharmacologist and professor at Queen 's University in Belfast , Northern Ireland .
Ennis , who also happened to be a vocal critic of homeopathy , devised an experiment to disprove " water memory " once and for all - but discovered that her result was the exact opposite !
In her most recent paper , Ennis describes how her team looked at the effects of ultra-dilute solutions of histamine on human white blood cells involved in inflammation .
These " basophils " release histamine when the cells are under attack .
Once released , the histamine stops them releasing any more .
The study , replicated in four different labs , found that homeopathic solutions - so dilute that they probably did n’t contain a single histamine molecule - worked just like histamine .
Ennis might not be happy with the homeopaths ’ claims , but she admits that an effect can not be ruled out .
So how could it happen ?
Homeopaths prepare their remedies by dissolving things like charcoal , deadly nightshade or spider venom in ethanol , and then diluting this " mother tincture " in water again and again .
No matter what the level of dilution , homeopaths claim , the original remedy leaves some kind of imprint on the water molecules .
Thus , however dilute the solution becomes , it is still imbued with the properties of the remedy .
You can understand why Ennis remains skeptical .
And it remains true that no homeopathic remedy has ever been shown to work in a large randomised placebo - controlled clinical trial .
But the Belfast study ( Inflammation Research , vol 53 , p 181 ) suggests that something is going on .
" We are , " Ennis says in her paper , " unable to explain our findings and are reporting them to encourage others to investigate this phenomenon . "
If the results turn out to be real , she says , the implications are profound : we may have to rewrite physics and chemistry .
( Source )
So far , other scientists failed to reproduce Ennis ' experimental findings ( throughout , Ennis herself was skeptical of the result 's interpretation that water has a " memory " but maintained that the phenomenon she saw was real ) .

More recently , a team of scientists at the University of Toronto , Canada , and Max Born Institute in Germany , studying water dynamics using fancy multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy did find that water have a memory of sorts - in form of hydrogen bond network amongst water molecules .
Problem for homeopathy was , this effect lasted only 50 femtoseconds ( 5 x 10 - 14 seconds ) !
Bonus : Ice Spikes
photo : SnowCrystals
Ice spikes are , well , spikes that grow out of ice cube trays .
They look like stalagmites found in caves , and you can make 'em yourself using distilled water .
Kenneth G. Libbrecht of SnowCrystals explains :
How do Ice Spikes Form ?
Ice spikes grow as the water in an ice cube tray turns to ice .
The water first freezes on the top surface , around the edges of what will become the ice cube .
The ice slowly freezes in from the edges , until just a small hole is left unfrozen in the surface .
At the same time , while the surface is freezing , more ice starts to form around the sides of the cube .
Since ice expands as it freezes , the ice freezing below the surface starts to push water up through the hole in the surface ice ( see diagram ) .
If the conditions are just right , then water will be forced out of the hole in the ice and it will freeze into an ice spike , a bit like lava pouring out of a hole in the ground to makes a volcano .
But water does not flow down the sides of a thin spike , so in that way it is different from a volcano .
Rather , the water freezes around the rim of the tube , and thus adds to its length .
The spike can continue growing taller until all the water freezes , cutting off the supply , or until the tube freezes shut .
The tallest spike we 've seen growing in an ordinary ice cube tray was 56 mm ( 2.2 in ) long .

Bonus 2 : Make Instant Snow with Boiling Water
What do you get when you throw boiling water to the air in subzero weather ?
Instant snow .
Interestingly , it only works with boiling hot water :
[ You Tube clip ]
These are n't the only things weird about water .
We did n't talk about how water density changes with temperature ( ice , for instance , is less dense than water so it floats - a key property of water that made life possible in the oceans and lakes ) .
Nor did we talk about the weirdly strong surface tension of water , ordered clustering of liquid water , and so on .

It may not be fun for all the family – well , not in the same way as Monopoly , Trivial Pursuit or Mousetrap , say .
The themes of empire building and terrorist - style attacks on opponents would probably provoke an outbreak of spluttering over the Christmas sherry .
It is rare , however , for a board game to be seized by the police .
This week that distinction befell War on Terror : The Boardgame ; a set was confiscated from climate protesters in Kent .
Following a series of raids on the climate change camp near Kingsnorth power station , officers displayed an array of supposed weapons snatched from demonstrators : knives , chisels , bolt cutters , a throwing star – and a copy of the satirical game , which lampoons Washington ’s “ war on terror ” .
For the game ’s creators , Andrew Sheerin and Andy Tompkins , web designers from Cambridge , the inclusion of their toy was a shock .
“ When I saw the pictures in the papers I was absolutely baffled , ” said Mr Sheerin , 32 .
“ I thought : surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon ? ”

In what was reported earlier as a minor situation , comes news that a uranium leak from one of France ’s nuclear power plants has tainted well water and two rivers 30 miles from the tourist city of Avignon , which is currently hosting an arts festival .
No Fishing Allowed and Drinking Well Water is Banned
According to published reports , the amount of untreated liquid uranium released amounted to 75kg , and was rated as a one on the one - to - seven scale of nuclear accidents .
Interesting , just a one , and you ca n’t drink the water , cannot fish or swim in the two rivers .
The local government is said to have immediately banned the drinking of well water , told residents in Vaucluse not to fish , or eat fish caught from the rivers , ended all swimming and water sports and the irrigation of crops in nearby fields .
How It Happened
It all came about while a tank was being cleaned last Monday night , when 30 cubic meters of liquid containing uranium leaked out of the tank .
Officials said 18 cubic meters poured onto the ground and into the nearby Gaffiere and Lauzon Rivers , which empty in to the Rhone .
In case you ’re interested , and you should be , 30 cubic meters is equal to 7,925 gallons , and 18 cubic meters is equal to 4,755 gallons .
Radioactivity in Water Decreasing
The amount of radioactivity in the water is decreasing steadily , but a French environmental group , the Committee for Independent Research and Information on Radioactivity , said ; “ the amount released into the environment was at least 100 times higher than the fixed limit for that site for the entire year “ .
The release occured at the Tricastin nuclear power centre in Bollene , a plant that ’s been operating since 1975 .
It is one of several that produces about 87 % of France ’s electricity needs , but like the rest of us , it ’s getting older , and humans are at the wheel .

The Nobel - prizewinning IPCC is among the bodies that lodged complaints Media regulator Ofcom is due to decide whether a Channel 4 documentary broke rules on accuracy and fairness .
The Great Global Warming Swindle attracted various complaints , including claims it misled contributors .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and the former UK government chief scientific adviser Sir David King were among the complainants .
Channel 4 said it aired the documentary to demonstrate that the debate on climate change was not over .
Its key contention was that the increase in atmospheric temperatures observed since the 1970s was not primarily caused by emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels .
First aired by Channel 4 in March 2007 , the documentary has since reportedly been sold to 21 countries and distributed on DVD .
What we now have is an out - and - out propaganda piece , in which there is not even a gesture toward balance
Dr Carl Wunsch Among discussion groups of " climate sceptics " , it is sometimes cited as a counter to Al Gore 's documentary An Inconvenient Truth and has been credited with infuencing public opinion on the causes of modern - day climate change .
An Ipsos Mori survey in the UK last month concluded : " Many believe leading scientists remain undecided on the exact causes of climate change " .
Distinguished climate scientists , including former IPCC chairman Sir John Houghton , Professor Peter Cox from the UK Met Office , and Professor Brian Hoskins from Reading University , signed a letter to production company WagTV alleging that the film " misrepresented both the scientific evidence and the interpretations of researchers that have been documented in the scientific literature " .
' Propaganda piece '
Ofcom will rule whether the programme broke two parts of its broadcasting code , on accuracy and fairness .
Leaks to newspapers last week indicated that Sir David 's fairness complaint - that the programme attributed comments to him that he had not made , and did not allow him a chance to reply - would be upheld .
It is also believed Ofcom will back a complaint from Carl Wunsch , an oceanographer interviewed for the programme , that he was misled as to its intent .
Dr Wunsch , from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology , said he believed he was being asked to take part in a programme that would " discuss in a balanced way the complicated elements of understanding of climate change " , but " what we now have is an out - and - out propaganda piece , in which there is not even a gesture toward balance " .
The accuracy code , meanwhile , includes an instruction that " a personal view or authored programme or item must be clearly signalled to the audience at the outset " , and that programmes covering issues of political controversy must not give " undue prominence " to any particular point of view .
While some of the complaints received by Ofcom are short and straightforward , one group assembled a 188 - page document alleging 137 breaches of the Broadcasting Code .
The Ofcom ruling is expected at about 1100 BST on Monday .

The hurricanes disrupted the two major pipelines feeding the southeast from the Gulf of Mexico , Colonial and Plantation , temporarily knocking out up to 60 % of the Gulf of Mexico ’s oil production .
The southeast is still — two weeks after Ike made landfall , and about a month after the arrival of Gustav — facing rampant gasoline shortages , which analysts expect to last at least another couple of weeks .
According to the Washington Post , half of the gas stations in Atlanta were closed last week ; most that were open had hour - long lines of about 60 cars waiting for fuel .
Typical of government , the Atlanta city government barred the public from two stations , to ensure that city vehicles would have plenty of fuel .
The Post story also reports that drivers in Charlotte faced similar conditions , with numerous closed stations and hour - long lines of about 60 cars at each of those still open .
Numerous anecdotal stories have also surfaced in the past week of people being stranded in their cars after running out of gas while waiting in line to refuel , and of others being forced to leave their cars at home , to instead take public transportation , walk , or ride a bike due to the fuel shortage .
Predictably , the parasites have responded to the crisis by denouncing the market function they refer to as " price gouging . "
An MNSBC story about the aftermath of Ike reported that President Bush " said the hurricane ’s toll on refineries and pipelines is creating u2018 an upward pressure on price ’ for people at the gas pump .
" The president also said , though , that people should not be subjected to price gouging .
The federal government is working with state leaders to monitor whether consumers are being charged unfairly high prices during the disruption in the energy supply . "
Likewise , North Carolina governor Mike Easley released the following statement :
" As a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , oil refineries in Texas and Louisiana have temporarily interrupted some gasoline supplies to the pipelines that serve North Carolina .
Therefore , there may be temporary limitations on our gas supply .
However , wholesale gas prices are up less than 20 cents a gallon over the last few days .
Therefore , consumers should not see prices rise substantially more than this rise in the wholesale price .
" Today I have declared a state of abnormal market disruption under North Carolina law and charged the Attorney General with enforcing the price gouging statute .
This statute prohibits the charging of prices that are unreasonably excessive under the circumstances .
" We know that there will be some supply disruption , but we do not yet know the extent .
Past events of this kind have lasted only a short time .
I urge motorists to reasonably conserve gasoline until the situation is clearer . "
North Carolina ’s NBC affiliate , WITN , reported , along with providing the text of the " North Carolina Price Gouging Statute " and a link to a " price gouging complaint form " so viewers can report to the state the identity of anyone they catch trying to alleviate the shortage by raising their prices , " The North Carolina Attorney General ’s office says they are getting complaints of gasoline price gouging .
" But the state ’s price gouging law does n’t become effective until the governor declares a state of emergency , which has not happened .
" Attorney General Roy Cooper today urged the governor to make that happen .
u2018 People are understandably frustrated that already high gas prices are rising so quickly .
I urge the governor to trigger the price gouging law and we stand ready to take consumer complaints .
I encourage gas stations to avoid panic price increases and consumers to avoid panic fill - ups . ’ "
Not to be outdone , Georgia governor Sonny Purdue invoked his state ’s price gouging statute ; Atlanta ’s WSB - TV reported him as saying , " ’ The threat of Hurricane Ike has disrupted the production of distribution of gasoline , which will have an effect on prices .
" ’ However , we expect the prices that Georgians pay at the pump to be in line with the prices retailers are paying .
We will not tolerate retailers taking advantage of Georgians during a time of emergency , ’ he added . "
Then the story continues , without the slightest acknowledgment of even the possibility of a causal relationship , " Consumers told WSB - TV Saturday that many convenience store chains are running out of all or some gas grades .
" Georgia ’s price gouging statute prevents retailers from selling goods or services at an unreasonable or egregious price . "
Elsewhere , in a testament to the success of public schooling in America , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported , " More than 1,400 drivers have complained to the state about gas gouging in the past two weeks , and the state has subpoenaed sales records from 130 stations to determine if they illegally jacked up prices .
" It will take several weeks to determine whether stations were illegally gouging consumers .
" u2018 We have enough questions about this — 130 — that we ’re asking them for information , ’ said Bill Cloud of the Office of Consumer Affairs .
u2018 When they send us that data , we may say , u2018 Well that ’s not price gouging , ’ and that would be the end of that .
" u2018 But if we look at some of the data and it looks a little hinky to us , we ’re obviously going to pursue it as a case . ’
" While gas stations are allowed to raise their prices as the price of gasoline goes up , they have to keep the same profit margin they had when the governor activated the law , Cloud said .
" The state had one report Tuesday that an Acworth station was charging $ 8.82 a gallon , but that report has n’t been verified , Cloud said .
" However , state officials are getting fewer complaints about gas gouging than they did after Hurricane Katrina three years ago .
" u2018 I think part of that may well be that the stations are much more attuned to the price gouging laws than they were before Katrina , ’ Cloud said .
u2018
It sunk in with enough people that we do n’t go away on this . ’"
According to the story , the state government of Georgia shook down gas stations and hotels for $ 180,000 in the wake of Katrina ; as we can see , they ’re looking to do it again .
And , in an op - ed for the Atlanta Journal - Constitution by Chris Clark , Executive Director of the Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority , and Carol Crouch , Director of the Environmental Protection Division at the Georgia Department of Natural Resources , the pair praised the Georgia state government ’s response , including that " Gov. Perdue activated Georgia ’s price - gouging statute to protect consumers from unlawful increases in gas prices and other products . "
Then , after lauding the government for forcibly stopping the market from producing the one thing — pricing information — that would have caused most people to voluntarily conserve gasoline during the shortage , they concluded their editorial — without the faintest hint of irony — by writing , " Until the refineries and pipelines that Georgia relies on for fuel return to normal operations , we ask Georgians to continue to do their part to conserve fuel by reducing unnecessary travel , carpooling and using mass transit , telecommuting , driving a little slower , and refueling only when low on gas . "
The Invisible Hand
The irony is that so - called " price gouging " is nothing but the market at work .
When supply falls relative to demand , the price of that good or service climbs as a signal to consumers about the new reality .
If there ’s a panic among buyers , causing demand to rise as supply falls , then the price rises still further .
On the whole , those higher prices cause people to voluntarily ration their consumption , because they ca n’t afford to use as much as they did before .
The higher prices also alert businesspeople to the shortage , which signals producers to produce more , and retailers who already have more than enough supply in their region to send some of it into the shortage region , so they can earn higher profits than they could at home by helping to relieve the shortage elsewhere .
The Visible Glove
But when prices are forced to remain at pre-crisis levels , it produces the perverse incentive for the first people in line to take more than they would if the prices were higher , leaving less for the next people .
Equally perversely , such measures also eliminate the incentive for businesses from outside the crisis area with surplus supplies to come in to alleviate the shortage , because there are no extra profits to be earned for doing so .
We ’re seeing exactly this scenario play out now in the southeast .
There could be plenty of gasoline available for $ 5 , $ 7 , $ 10 , or whatever price per gallon would create equilibrium between present supply and demand .
If that natural market process were allowed to occur , consumers could choose to do without gas for a while if they felt the price was n’t worth it to them — or they could choose to still buy all they want — if they ’re willing to pay the higher prices .
Instead , the government has kept prices at unrealistic , pre-crisis levels , and the result is that consumers are forced to do without gas because there ’s none to buy at the artificially low prices .
Further , price controls are also an affront to property rights , which are the foundation of civilization .
Any property owner has every right — if not every obligation — to attain the best possible price for his property .
By what right does an unaffected third party presume to forcibly interfere ?
Further still , notice the inherent arbitrariness in the wording of these statutes , using terms like " unfair , " " unreasonable , " and " excessive . "
Charges on such vague terms are probably difficult to disprove , which must make it easy for governments to shake down businesses for " price gouging " fines — which is likely no small part of why such statutes were enacted in the first place .
Ignorance or Malice ?
It ’s possible that some of these politicians and bureaucrats mean well , and really are so ignorant that they truly think anti-" gouging " laws really help regular people .
If so , this is another argument against political power , because such people should not be able to force the consequences of their economic ignorance at gunpoint onto thousands or millions of people .
Contrast this situation with the market , where people generally are n’t hired for influential positions for which they ’re unqualified ; when they are , neither they , nor their employers , can force anyone to associate with them ; and companies that make a habit of hiring such people usually go bankrupt .
But a cynic ca n’t help but wonder if most of these people really are that ignorant , or if they ’re conscious of the fact that their policies are hurting average people , but proceed anyway for some self - interested reason .
Maybe they ’re what Butler Shaffer describes as " people pushers , " people who have totalitarian , control freak personalities they desire to indulge at the expense of others .
Or maybe they ’re somehow gaining financially or advancing their careers by such actions .
Or , again , maybe they just found another easy way to raise money , by fining businesses for invented crimes .
If nothing else , anyone in government who understands the real function and value of " gouging " certainly has no incentive to admit it ; if they acknowledge that the voluntary exchanges of individuals known as the market rations scarce resources as well as possible , and alleviates shortages as quickly and easily as possible , and that people do n’t need to be " protected " from high prices , because they can decide perfectly well on their own whether to buy something — and , if so , how much , then how do the parasites justify their jobs , salaries , and the coercive power they presume to hold over others ?
They can’t , and therein lies a message for members of the parasitical political class regarding anti-" gouging " laws , no matter their motivation behind enacting such impediments to trade .
For the well - meaning : blocking pricing information from adjusting to fluctuations in supply and demand will accomplish the opposite of what you ’re trying to do ; rather than preventing people from being " exploited " and " gouged , " you ’re exacerbating shortages and extending them for the longest possible period , ensuring that people can’t find for any price the things they need to endure a crisis .
For the sociopaths : there ’s a growing remnant who are wise to your " public servant " charade , and we do n’t appreciate having our standard of living eroded so that you can play petty dictator , enrich yourself , pay off political debts , or chase whatever other self - interested motivation you ’re trying to catch .
Legalize Freedom
Regardless of the motivations behind such laws , the only way to ensure that people can get what they need before , during , and immediately after a crisis is simple and clear : repeal them all .
Legalize price gouging !

This is such a refreshing thread !
Whenever I see an article on Salon , HuffPo or other " progressive " sites , you still get a lot of transphobic talk .
I myself had the bottom surgery about 3 years ago , and yeah , if they did that for Isis she would not be able to compete .
Stuck in bed the first three days , very gentle walking for the rest of the week .
And if there was a slight bulge in her swimsuit now , that surgery causes enough swelling that it looked like I was pregnant in my crotch for a while .
And the bleeding !
As far as gender binary , yeah , I 'm not genderqueer so I 'm not necessarily trying to fuck with the system , but I think I 'm not performing my gender any more than most women .
I rarely wear makeup except for special occasions .
I never got implants , even though hormones have n't done wonders for me , I 'm happy with what I have .
No plastic surgery to change my face or anything like that .
I 'm lucky enough I guess that I 'm 75 % passing or whatever .
But the more time goes by , the more comfortable I am with myself , the less I care about passing , because ya know what ?
All of us have people in the world that do n't like us for any number of reasons , so if they do n't like me cuz they think I 'm a freak , well ...
Their loss .
I think I 'm a pretty nice person and a good friend .
I 've been lucky , though , in that I had the money to get the surgery and looked androgynous enough that I did n't think I needed any facial surgery .
Now , my boss when I was transitioning fired me when I was out for my surgery , but I 've found a new job I like a lot more but pays less , but money is n't everything .
I know it can be much more difficult than it was for me .
Anyway , I really like this thread , y'all are very cool .

In the ongoing $ 1 billion legal lawsuit between YouTube and Viacom , a federal judge has recently ordered Google to turn over records of all users and videos ever viewed on YouTube .
Privacy concern aside , that 's 12 terabytes of data .
Well , it sounds enormous ... but what exactly does 12 terabytes - worth of information look like ?
To help you visualize the magnitude of that volume of data , we 've compiled this handy dandy chart :
12 terabytes of data are roughly equivalent to :
- 5,280,000,000 single - spaced typewritten pages
- 1 , 006,633 phone books
- 19,358 regular compact discs
- 2,614.5 DVDs
- 61.4 average - sized hard disks ( 200 GB )
- 9.6 human brains ( the capacity of a human being 's functional memory is estimated to be 1.25 terabytes by futurist Raymond Kurzweil in The Singularity Is Near )
- all the data from Microsoft's WorldWide Telescope
I do n't know the details of the legal order , but it seems that if information is information , then Google should just hand over the data in 5 billion sheets of single - spaced typewritten page .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New Yorkers can soon take a bite out of city crime by uploading video or photo evidence directly to the New York Police Department , in a move welcomed on Thursday by civil rights groups .
“ We ’re putting that technology in place to enable us to do that , ” said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly , adding that the service will be available soon .
“ It ’s a fact of life , ” Kelly said .
“ Everybody has a camera in their telephones .
When people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation , it ’s helpful . ”
Soon citizen sleuths can transmit evidence of criminal activity directly to the police and 911 , including evidence of police misconduct , such as the recent video of a police officer shoving a bicyclist to the ground in Times Square .
The video of the incident has received over one million views on YouTube and has generated online discussion about police brutality and abuse of power .
Donna Lieberman , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said , “ I think that while it ’s appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers , the New York Police Department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable . ”

Explanation :
Get out your red / blue glasses and check out this remarkable stereo view from lunar orbit .
Created from two photographs ( AS11-44-6633 , AS11-44-6634 ) taken by astronaut Michael Collins during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission , the 3D anaglyph features the lunar module ascent stage , dubbed The Eagle , as it rises to meet the command module in lunar orbit .
Aboard the ascent stage are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin , the first to walk on the Moon .
The smooth , dark area on the lunar surface is Mare Smythii located just below the equator on the extreme eastern edge of the Moon 's near side .
Poised beyond the lunar horizon , is our fair planet Earth .
A cloned dog , a Mormon in mink - lined handcuffs and a tantalising mystery
The saucy Joyce McKinney
At first it seemed a straightforward example of the oddball stories which emerge during the long , slow , news days of high summer .
A ' Californian woman ' had paid £ 25,000 to a South Korean laboratory to have her dead pitbull terrier cloned , in the first transaction of its kind .
' Bernann McKinney ' had saved tissue from the ear of her beloved ' Booger ' , which was frozen after the dog died , and then used as DNA source material to produce five pitbull pups .
So far , so silly season .
( But as the eccentric Miss McKinney beamed joyfully from the world 's television screens on Tuesday , vague bells began to ring . )
The face was familiar , albeit older and heavier .
The surname was the same .
So was the alleged American , ex-beauty queen background and the unusual devotion to pitbull dogs .
Surely it was n't ?
Could the new owner of the world 's first commercially cloned pups be the same woman who had gone on the run from British justice 30 years ago , having been the star of one of the most bizarre , entertaining and downright saucy court cases in living memory ?
In 1978 , Joyce McKinney jumped bail and disappeared after being charged with kidnapping a 17 - stone male Mormon missionary , whom she had chained to a Devon cottage bed with mink handcuffs and forced to have sex .
At the time , she famously said of her victim : ' I loved him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to . '
Were these two blonde , American , dog- loving and , yes , quite possibly barking mad , Miss McKinneys one and the same person ?
Last night , when we spoke to ' Bernann ' on the telephone , having tracked her down to a Seoul hotel room , her hostile reaction hardly quashed the intrigue .
Asked : ' Are you really Joyce McKinney ? ' she snapped : " Are you going to ask me about my dogs , or not ?
Because that 's all I 'm prepared to talk to you about . "
Not exactly a flat - out denial , then .
Puppy love : ' Bernann ' with one of the pitbull pups cloned from the ear of her beloved ' Booger '
So , dear readers , let us turn back the clock 30 years to Joyce and the sensational circumstances of what became known as the ' Mormon Sex Slave Case ' .
Joyce McKinney was born in Avery County , North Carolina , in August 1949 , the daughter of two school teachers .
She first made the headlines , albeit local ones , in 1972 when she was crowned Miss Wyoming , but soon tired of the world of beauty pageants and enrolled as a drama student at Brigham Young University , in Utah , the heartland of Mormon America .
It was there that she met 19 - year - old Kirk Anderson , a 6ft 4in fellow drama undergraduate , some seven years her junior , from a small town near Salt Lake City .
There was a brief fling , and McKinney later claimed that she had miscarried his baby .
Overcome by guilt , Anderson , a devout Mormon , apparently sought advice from his bishop , who told him to sever ties with McKinney and move away from Utah .
A topless Joyce poses for the camera
She was not prepared to be spurned so easily .
Private detectives were hired to trace Anderson from the U.S. to Ewell in Surrey , where he was living as a door - to - door Mormon missionary .
In the summer of 1977 , McKinney flew to England with an architect friend called Keith May .
Armed with an imitation revolver , May confronted 21 - year - old Anderson on the steps of Ewell 's Church of the Latter Day Saints , and frog - marched him to a car in which McKinney was waiting .
Chloroformed and hidden under a blanket , the bespectacled Mormon was driven some 200 miles to Okehampton , where his kidnappers had hired a 17th - century ' honeymoon ' cottage for £ 50 a week .
McKinney later said that she had packed the fridge with Anderson 's favourite food and studied The Joy Of Sex in preparation for what was to come .
Joyce McKinney was a beauty queen in the 1970s and was a former Miss Wyoming before going to Brigham Young University , in Utah , to study drama
May chained the prisoner to a bed .
For two days , McKinney tried to persuade the missionary to marry her and father her children .
She even read Scriptures with him in bed .
When this failed to melt his opposition , McKinney reverted to Plan B .
This involved slipping into a ' see - through nightie ' , playing a cassette of ' romantic music ' , having Anderson ' spread- eagled ' and sexually stimulating him .
She claimed this was a bondage ' game ' played with his full consent .
He later told a court : ' I could n't move .
She grabbed the top of my pyjamas and tore them from my body until I was naked .
' I did n't wish it to happen .
I was extremely depressed and upset after being forced to have sex . '
This ' rape ' occurred three times .
Victim : Kirk Anderson was kidnapped and forced to have sex with Joyce
For the record , his pyjamas , later produced in court , were light blue and ' silky ' .
He also claimed to have been wearing some kind of Mormon chastity belt underneath .
Alas , to no avail .
Fearing he would be kept prisoner for weeks ( later there would be a body of male opinion which felt pangs of severe jealousy at his plight ) , Anderson promised to marry her .
But after she loosened his chains , he escaped and went straight to the police .
McKinney and May were arrested at a roadblock three days later and charged with false imprisonment and possessing an imitation firearm .
There was an entertaining , if not downright titillating , committal hearing at Epsom Magistrates '
Court , during which her counsel said of Anderson : ' Methinks the Mormon doth protest too much ... you have seen the size of Mr Anderson and you have seen the size of my client . '
McKinney spent three months on remand in Holloway Prison - to which she had been driven weeping through the bars of a Black Maria - before being released on bail on grounds of her failing mental health .
Now the case , which had already become a worldwide cause celebre , was about to be given a new lease of life with a sensational twist .
McKinney met the similarly bailed May and the pair fled to Canada , using false passports and disguised as deaf - mute mime artistes .
It was later alleged that McKinney was helped to escape by her former landlady , an Irish woman , who went with her to a West End theatrical outfitters .
There , they bought the wigs and glasses which were later used in their flight from justice .
By now an international fugitive , McKinney reappeared staying at the Hilton hotel in Atlanta , Georgia , disguised as a nun .
Before long , the Press caught up with her and she dropped her disguise to revel in her sexual notoriety - she posed topless for a number of glamour magazines before the U.S. authorities finally caught up with her and she was arrested .
Mysterious minx : Joyce with a carnation .
She famously said she would ski naked down Mount Everest with a carnation up her nose if Kirk Anderson asked her to
Once again , she was freed on bail and , by now - 1979 - there seemed to be no appetite in the UK for forcing her extradition .
McKinney , meanwhile , had allegedly vanished into an increasingly desperate world of prostitution , drug abuse and psychiatric problems .
She resurfaced once more in 1984 , when she was arrested near Salt Lake City Airport , where Kirk Anderson - the Mormon she had kidnapped - was working .
In her car , police found a length of rope and a pair of handcuffs .
The implication was clear that she was about to make a second kidnap attempt , but she failed to show up in court and the case was dropped .
By the late Nineties , McKinney was back in North Carolina , dogged by ill health and often in a wheelchair , living on benefits in a remote smallholding with only three ponies and a fiercely devoted pitbull called Hamburger for company .
On one occasion , she had broken into a dog pound to rescue a pitbull terrier - possibly Hamburger - which was to be put down for mauling a jogger .
' I love those pitbulls , ' she explained .
' They 're such sympathetic animals . '
Locals , who knew of her racy past , treated her with suspicion , if not fear .
She had a taste for litigation and was described as ' one wild woman ' .
In a rare comment on the Mormon affair , she said in 1999 : ' I loved Kirk and all I really wanted was to see his blond - haired babies running round my home .
' Nobody can understand what it is to lose the man you love to a cult , and I believe that is what the Mormons are .
Back in Britain [ then ] nobody knew what a cult was . '
May was last heard of selling plumbing supplies in California , while Anderson was an estate agent in Utah and understandably reluctant to rake over his past misfortunes .
What , then , of ' Bernann McKinney ' who has had her pitbull Booger cloned and claims to be a Hollywood scriptwriter and university lecturer ?
She says she is 57 and a former beauty queen .
In an interview in a Korean newspaper , she was described as a grandmother , and initially alleged that she had sold her home to pay for the cloning .
( The company responsible says that it would normally charge £ 75,000 for the controversial procedure , but that it has cut the fee in return for Miss McKinney 's co-operation in their publicity campaign . )
In another Korean interview , she described being the victim of an horrific attack by an enraged bull mastiff , that shredded her left arm to the elbow , tore open a leg and ripped three fingers from her left hand .
She survived only because her faithful Booger chased it off .
Even then , the injuries were so bad that she was confined to a wheelchair while surgeons reconstructed her left hand and arm .
Booger remained by her side throughout her recuperation and gave her the will to go on .
She claimed to have been a university drama teacher before the accident .
Now she planned to write a Hollywood film script about the cloning .
Let us look then at the similarities between our two Miss McKinneys .
Joyce will be celebrating her 59th birthday this week , while Bernann claims to be two years younger .
It is a fact , though , that former beauty queens ( and even less celebrated mortals ) often reduce their ages later in life .
Both Joyce and Bernann use wheelchairs , while the latter 's late pitbull Booger sounds very similar in name to Joyce 's faithful Hamburger .
There is no record of a Bernann McKinney living in Los Angeles , nor does anyone of that name belong to the Screenwriters ' Guild .
No university drama department we contacted has heard of any such teacher .
It is an undisputable fact , however , that Joyce was once a drama student .
But perhaps the most persuasive circumstantial evidence to suggest that Joyce and Bernann are the same woman , is that a Joyce Bernann McKinney is registered as living in Avery County , North Carolina - birthplace of the Mormon sex slave kidnapper .
She has been on the voters ' register there since 1988 .
' Who started all this ? '
Miss ' Bernann '
McKinney demanded to know when she was phoned in Seoul , as she prepared to return to the U.S. with one of the puppies .
( The others will remain in care among the scientists who have cloned them in the short - term . )
Told that there was a growing internet debate about whether she was indeed the Mormon kidnapper , Miss McKinney replied : ' I 'm only going to talk to you about the dogs and the death of Booger .
I 've got people waiting to dine with me .
I 'm not talking about anything else . '
And that was that .
She would neither confirm nor deny the link .
And yet , weighing the body of evidence , it would seem that 30 years on , the notorious Miss McKinney had once again gone to extraordinary lengths to get her longed - for ' babies ' .
In the end , they were to be the offspring of a dead pitbull ear , rather than that of a bespectacled Mormon trussed in the missionary position in a honeymoon cottage on Dartmoor , next to a pair of ripped , light blue silk pyjamas .

September 29 , 2008
WASHINGTON — House lawmakers voted 205 to 228 Monday against approving the historic $ 700 billion financial rescue plan , a sharp blow to the administration and bipartisan rallying efforts from leaders in Congress who warn that the country is on the brink of an economic precipice .
With elections approaching , some lawmakers — both Democrats and Republicans — may feel nervous about voting for a plan that risks so much taxpayer money and ca n’t promise success .
But the president has lobbied hard to approve the plan , and U.S. officials also have stressed the dire consequences of taking no action .
Critics say the plan does not adequately address problems such as job losses and a distressed housing market that underlie current economic weakness .
U.S. officials had hoped the plan would ease the credit crunch and restore confidence in the markets , even as markets plunged around the world .
Those in favor of the rescue plan may have been trying to treat the most manageable symptom — a frozen credit market — if not the actual disease .
A vote in the Senate was expected Wednesday , and the president would have followed with a speedy signature .
Earlier Monday , doubt emerged over whether enough representatives would vote in favor of the plan and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appealed to colleagues in the early afternoon , stressing that representatives will continue to monitor financial issues and pursue additional strategies .
She said it ’s imperative that the measure on the floor receives bipartisan support .
“ That is the only message that will send a message of confidence to the markets , ” Pelosi said .
Colleagues applauded after appeals for bipartisan agreement on the rescue plan from Rep. John Boehner , House minority leader , and Rep. Barney Frank , chairman of the financial - services committee .
The risk of not acting is much higher than the risk of acting , according to Boehner .
“ I did n’t come here to vote for bills like this .
Let me tell you this : I believe Congress has to act and that means each and everyone of use , ” he said .

U.S. officials sent Canadian rendition survivor Maher Arar to Syria to be tortured .
Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) lawyer Maria LaHood represents him in his struggle for justice .
The Second Circuit Appellate Court has issued extremely rare order last month that approximately 12 judges will rehear Arar ’s case on December 9 , 2008 .
Mr. Arar and CCR seek to hold accountable the high - level administration officials responsible for sending him to be tortured and detained in Syria for a year – a practice known as extraordinary rendition .
For more information on Maher Arar ’s case , click here .
In 2002 , Maher Arar , a Canadian citizen , was detained at a New York airport on his way home from a family trip .
He was interrogated by U.S. officials about alleged links to al - Qaeda and was prevented from getting assistance from a lawyer .
He was then delivered to Syria , a country renowned for torture .
Mr. Arar was interrogated , brutally tortured and held in a grave - like cell in Syria for over ten months .
No country , including the U.S. , has ever charged him with any crime .
CCR originally filed the case in the Eastern District of New York in January 2004 ; the first ruling , in February 2006 , dismissed the case because letting it proceed might harm national security and foreign relations .
CCR appealed the decision , arguing before a three - judge panel in November 2007 , but the Court of Appeals issued a 2 - 1 decision in June 2008 along similar lines .
The dissenting judge found that the majority decision gives federal officials the license to “ violate constitutional rights with virtual impunity . ”
In stark contrast to the response of the U.S. government , the Canadian government conducted an exhaustive inquiry in response to public outcry , found that Mr. Arar had no connection to terrorism , and , in January 2007 , apologized to him for its role in what happened and awarded him $ 10 million compensation .

This makes sense on very many levels , but at the same time we 've gotta think those long - suffering PS3 owners will be a bit " hacked off " by Sony 's announcement of a motion - tracking sword game headed for ... the PS2 .
The PS2's market saturation ( every man , woman and child on earth has at least two ) , and the EyeToy 's general success ( 10.5 million units sold ) make the combo the perfect trojan horse for fighting the good fight against Wii world domination .
Sony 's using new ( sort of ) color tracking technology to beef up the EyeToy 's motion tracking that will let it detect and track brightly colored objects , instead of just motion , for two new EyeToy : Play games due for the holidays this year .
The one we 've really got our eye on is the kiddie - oriented Hero which is a first person perspective sword fighting game that comes complete with a fluorescent toy sword for battling kinda - almost - evil antagonists .
Of course , none of this would be disappointing in the slightest if Sony would just work PS2 backwards compatibility into its fully capable PS3 , and hey , maybe they 'll surprise us .
Nudge , comma , nudge .
Wink .
Wink .

As you may recall , the Republicans in Congress want to amend the US Constitution with anti-gay language that would supposedly “ ban gay marriage . ”
In fact , the amendment would likely rescind state and local laws that outlaw job discrimination against gays and provide gay partners with health benefits , and it would likely rescind laws protecting unmarried women from things such as being beaten to a bloody pulp by their boyfriends ( this actually happened in Ohio , where the state court found that the local anti-gay - marriage amendment invalidated state laws covering the domestic abuse of unmarried women ) .
Anyway , who is on the very short list of Senators introducing the “ Marriage Protection Amendment ” in the Senate ?
Why none other than foot - tapping Senator Larry Craig ( R - ID ) , and whore - mongering Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) .
You ’ll recall that the very - married Larry Craig was caught tapping his foot alongside a really hot male cop in an airport bathroom .
And the very - married and very - family - values - proclaiming David Vitter , we now know , has repeatedly frequented female hookers .
So there you have it .
Two of the Republicans ’ biggest marriage hypocrites – Larry Craig , who was accused of trying to have sex with a man ( who was not his wife ) in a bathroom , and David Vitter who has been repeatedly accused of frequenting hookers ( who also were not his wife ) – want to amend the Constitution to “ protect ” marriage .
Perhaps you all should call Larry Craig ’s and David Vitter ’s offices and ask them the following :
Senator Larry Craig
tel : 202-224-2752
Message : Can a married guy give handjobs and blowjobs to other guys in bathrooms and still defend heterosexual marriage ?
Senator David Vitter
Phone : ( 202 ) 224-4623
Message :
How many whores does a married guy have to sleep with before he ’s no longer defending marriage ?
And does the price of the whore matter ?
Oh , and please do report back in the comments how your phone calls went with Craig ’s and Vitter ’s offices .

This article first published by Tanda.co is republished with approval of Roses Only , specialists at Mother 's Day Flowers and , as you read below , flowers for Valentines Day !
Everything ’s coming up Roses Only : How Tanda helps retailers save 100 + hours a week
Valentine ’s Day :
On this day celebrating love and relationships , couples , friends , and family prepare their choice of gifts for the special people in their lives .
Hearts adorn storefronts , packages and discounts abound , and behind the bustle and celebration are the retailers that make it all happen .
Today is one of the busiest days of the year for the Roses Only Group , a business founded in 1995 that has grown into Australia ’s leading flower retailer .
It brings together more than 45 years of floristry and retail experience to create a business that provides gifts of all kinds to those who want to share the love : boxed roses , seasonal flowers , full arrangements , wines and champagnes , chocolates , and more .
We caught up with Chief Operating Officer Kelly Taggart as she prepared for the busy season to ask about how she manages it all .
“ A day in the life of me , ” Kelly says , “ no two days are the same . ”
The search for the perfect software fit
Not everything was always wrapped up neatly at the Roses Only headquarters .
“ Our biggest time and attendance problem was really about planning rostering , ” Kelly says .
“ Previously we were working in spreadsheets , and as a growing team , you tend to spend a lot of time in those spreadsheets .
That time would be much better spent elsewhere , on making the business more productive . ”
Using spreadsheets was an ordeal .
Roses
Only holds multiple warehouse locations throughout Australia , and an online store .
With many teams and all 300 - plus staff working in - house , balancing administrative tasks without a good platform was challenging .
That search for better shift scheduling software led them to Tanda .
Kelly recalls : “ When we were comparing solutions , what actually stood out was the feedback Tanda had received from all of their existing clients .
And for me personally , and for us as a business , recommendations are so important .
For Tanda to get that client feedback , that was a big factor in our decision . ”
They implemented Tanda across the organisation to positive reception .
Changing from a manual process to a technology solution suited the team , with them even having some fun with the selfie photos in the employee time clock .
The integrations the platform offered was a big part of that decision , as Roses Only uses bespoke systems and they found it fit neatly in alongside their preferred payroll software .
Trimming hundreds of hours from rostering means more time for operations
Roses
Only has been using Tanda for so long , the team barely thinks of the problems it helped solve .
“ They would be things like the administration time managers take to look at what time people show up to work every day .
You really want your managers to be leading the team and making them more productive and hitting those business targets , not clock - watching . ”
All in all , Kelly estimates Tanda saves them 100 hours a week across all locations .
These saved hours go a long way — especially on huge business days like today , Valentine ’s Day , and other peak periods like Mother ’s Day and Christmas where they use the shift scheduling software to compare labour data from the previous year .
Roses
Only uses a significant amount of big data in its operations , and that ’s essential to their success each peak season .
Understanding their processes and building efficiency into them is key to scaling for significant events .
By having efficient operations already set in place , they do n’t need to make too many changes : it ’s just the same , only bigger .
“ We found it ’s even more beneficial with the extreme growth that we ’ve had in the last 2 years , that our managers have been able to focus on other things besides managing people ’s time and rosters because they have such a great platform in Tanda , ” Kelly adds .
Blooming in a competitive industry
So what ’s next for the retailer ?
As the market leader in delivered flowers and gifts , the organisation is setting its sights on supporting the future of its business through leadership development .
They ’ll also continue to serve their customers in the best way they know : with efficiency , productivity , and excellent service .
“ Everyone ’s collecting information , and you ’ve got to be able to put that information through in the right way and understand what customers are trying to do , so you can provide them with what they ’re looking for .
Then look at your own infrastructure and the way that your operations are set out , the way that your teams are set out , to support that offering to your customers . ”
“ This business , in particular , has been in the industry for the past 12 years , and we have been online in a big way from the beginning .
So we ’ve already experienced many of these learnings and we ’re making sure our infrastructure is supporting what we ’re learning from that big data so that we can be the most productive that we can . ”

Are you travelling to the United States of America
If you travelling to the United States of America for a period no longer than 90 days , you need to know you must have an ESTA Visa prior to going there to gain entry .
From January 12th 2009 , all citizens of countries belonging to the VWP ( USA Visa Waiver Program ) must obtain this online agency travel authorization before entering the territory of the United States of America .
The blog team have prepared some questions and answers below to help travelers to the USA understand what and ESTA Visa is and what they need to do before they travel to the US .
What is an ESTA visa ?
The Electronic System for Travel Authorization ( ESTA ) is an automated system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program ( VWP ) and whether such travel poses any law enforcement or security risk .
How long is a ESTA visa valid for ?
Your ESTA Visa authorization is generally valid for multiple trips over a period of two years ( starting the date that you are approved ) or until your passport expires , whichever comes first * .
This means that as long as you received an ESTA authorization to travel , you do not have to reapply during the validity period .
Who can apply for an ESTA ?
ESTA is a mandatory travel authorization for travelers visiting the United States either by Sea or Air for tourism , transit or business visits under 90 days .
Only travelers who hold a valid nationality from countries covered under the Visa Waiver Program are eligible to apply for an ESTA .
Why would esta be denied ?
A denied ESTA is most likely due to one or more of the following reasons :
On a previous visit to the United States , you overstayed beyond the amount of time allowable for your visa or visa waiver .
...
The answers you provided on your ESTA application form were incorrect , once cross-checked with the US government systems .
How long can I stay in US with ESTA ?
When traveling to the U.S. with the approved ESTA , you may only stay for up to 90 days at a time - and there should be a reasonable amount of time between visits so that the CBP Officer does not think you are trying to live here .
There is no set requirement for how long you must wait between visits .
When should I apply for ESTA ?
When should I apply for ESTA ?
Although your ESTA application can be approved in seconds , it 's recommended that you apply at least 72 hours before departure .
In fact , you may want to apply as soon as you decide on travel dates , just in case your travel authorisation is denied .
Do I need to print my esta ?
Many applicants are confused by the fact that ESTA is an electronic travel authorization linked to their passport .
Nevertheless , all travelers need an ESTA printout .
Why do you need to print out your ESTA you may ask ?
The truth is that it is not necessary to have an ESTA printed out and we will explain why .
If you are Australian , you can learn more about the Electronic System for Travel Authorization Program by visiting EstaVisa.com.au , the online agency that provides assistance in obtaining the Electronic System for Travel Authorization that is necessary for entering the United States of America .
EstaVisa.com.auis a professional visa agency that our team have had positive experience with .

Lost middle - class tribe 's ' secret ' eco-village in Wales spotted in aerial photograph taken by plane
For five happy years they enjoyed simple lives in their straw and mud huts .
Generating their own power and growing their own food , they strived for self - sufficiency and thrived in homes that looked more suited to the hobbits from The Lord of the Rings .
Then a survey plane chanced upon the ' lost tribe ' ... and they were plunged into a decade - long battle with officialdom .
Pioneering : Eco-dweller Emma Orbach is delighted planning has been approved
Yesterday that fight , backed by more modern support for green issues , ended in victory .
The eco-community in the Preseli mountains of west Wales was set up in 1993 and lived contentedly away from the rat race round a 180 - acre farm bought by Julian and Emma Orbach .
In 1998 , it was spotted when sunlight was seen glinting off a solar panel on the main building , which was built from straw bales , timber and recycled glass .
When the pilot reported back , officials were unable to find any records , let alone planning permission , for the mystery hillside village surrounded by trees and bushes .
Brainchild : Architectural historian Julian Orbach came up with the idea
They insisted the grass - covered buildings should be demolished .
The eco-community endured a decade of inquiries , court cases and planning hearings .
The 22 villagers fought planners even when they were within hours of the bulldozers moving in to demolish their eight homes .
Now , however , they can celebrate , thanks to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority 's ' sustainability ' policy .
With green issues now getting a more sympathetic hearing , the commune has been given planning approval for its roundhouses along with lavatories , agricultural buildings and workshops .
Community founder Emma Orbach , a 52 - year - old mother of three , said yesterday : ' We are really excited and happy as it has been a very long battle .
' Even when planning inquiries and court hearings went against us we were determined to fight on .
' The villagers are pioneering a new lifestyle and are determined to prove it 's possible for people to live more simply . '
Tony Wrench , 62 , who lives in the original roundhouse with his partner Jane , said : ' We are very relieved and delighted .
' We have been able to prove to the planners that it is possible to have a sustainable and low - impact community in the countryside .
Green :
The houses use only solar power and get light from a roof window
' We had to prove we were improving the biodiversity of the area and conserving the woodland and we did that .
It 's great that our efforts to build a community using renewable resources have now been supported by the planners .
' The planners have worked miracles in making a new policy which enables communities which are self sufficient to exist . '
Amid the celebrations over the victory , however , it seems that life away from the rat race has not run entirely smoothly for the pioneers of simple living .
The two founders , architectural historian Julian Orbach , 55 , and his wife Emma are divorced , and the commune has been split into three entities .
Caught out :
An aerial view of eco village Brithdir Mawr .
The complex could not be seen from the road
The original 180 - acre farm was divided up into the area around the farm , a section around the original roundhouse known as Tir Ysbrydol ( Spirit Land ) where Mrs Orbach lives , and 80 acres of pasture and woodland run by a community known as Brithdir Mawr .
Each community is independent and they co-exist as neighbours in a more traditional style .
Brithdir Mawr continues to support sustainable living based around the original farmhouse , with eight adults and four children sharing communal meals , looking after goats , horses and chickens - and also holding down part - time jobs to raise the £ 200 per month rent they each pay Mr Orbach , who lives in a house in nearby Newport .
The current residents now run businesses such as courses in furniture making and sustainable living for around £ 95 a head .
On their website they explain : ' We are eight big people and four little ones who choose to live here : working , eating , meeting and laughing together .
Being a community is a large part of what we do .
To sum up the rest ; we are striving towards a life in which our footprints are as light as they can be . '
One resident , Ben Gabel , 38 , who runs a seed business with his partner Kate , said : ' It is completely different to what it was .
Most people would consider the set - up quite normal .
' The kids watch DVDs and we run a business from the farm . '

Motherwort is commonly known as “ Mother ’s Little Helper ” because of her ability to help ease stress and tension for weary moms .
While Motherwort is wonderful for this aspect , she is also useful for many other ailments as well .
A member of the Lamiaceae family , Motherwort ’s botanical name is Leonurus cardiaca , “ leonurus ” referring to lion and “ cardiaca ” to the heart , giving another indication for her use .
Do you have Motherwort growing in your garden ?
If so , pick a leaf and try this experiment : chew the leaf and notice the flavors of Motherwort .
What do you notice ?
Bitter ?
Yes , pungent too ?
Yes .
How does the leaf make your mouth feel ?
Does it seem a bit dry ?
Cooler ?
We describe Motherwort ’s energetics as bitter , pungent , drying and cooling .
Nutritionally , sources indicate Motherwort contains beta carotene , calcium , choline , cobalt , copper , iodine , manganese and potassium .
Motherwort contains many constituents that give her healing power : alkaloids such as leonurine , stachydrin , betonin and turicin , flavonoids such as rutin , apigenin , and quercetin , bitter glycosides , volatile oils , resins , tannins , and acids such as magic , citric and vinitic .
Motherwort has an affinity for the reproductive system and the heart .
Medicinally , Motherwort is considered to be analgesic , antibacterial , antifungal , antioxidant , antirheumatic , antispasmodic , astringent , bitter , cardiotonic , circulatory stimulant , diaphoretic , diuretic , emmenagogue , hemostatic , hypotensive , immune stimulant , laxative , nervine , parturient , sedative , stomachic , tonic , uterine tonic and vasodilator .
Let ’s talk about these actions in greater depth …
Motherwort is one of the first medicinal plants that I used after I started seriously studying herbs for the medicinal uses .
My first plants were patiently grown from seed and I have happily grown her ever since .
Focusing on the common name , indicating her use for mothers ( wort means ‘ herb or plant ’ indicating her common name to be mother ’s herb or plant ) , I found this herb to be very helpful as a new mother , as well as mama ’s little helper during my cycle .
Motherwort has an uncanny way of making everything seem alright for mothers and women who become tense and irritated due to hormonal changes .
Motherwort is wonderful for women of all ages .
Young women , coming into womanhood , will find Motherwort to be a powerful ally while they adjust to the extra hormones that are flooding their bodies .
Menopausal women will find Motherwort to be just as supportive when their hormones once again wildly fluctuate , by helping to moderate hormone levels , calm hot flashes and night sweats and emotional mood swings as well as easing heart palpitations , insomnia and depression , which are often a common part of the menopausal journey .
Mothers laboring in childbirth may find Motherwort beneficial for a smooth birthing process .
At the same time , Motherwort is also a uterine tonic , supporting the uterus and toning it .
Menstrual cramps are often eased with doses of Motherwort .
Motherwort can also help to bring on delayed menses , especially when the delay is caused by clots in the uterus , or when menses is scanty .
For those stuck in extreme emotional upset , whether due to hormones , grief or even unexplainable reasons , Motherwort will gently bring you back to a more calm emotional point of wellbeing .
Motherwort is not just for women though .
Men can also benefit from her hormone balancing actions .
As a reproductive tonic , Motherwort not only tones the female reproductive system but also the male reproductive system .
Motherwort is also very supportive to our hearts .
Her botanical name Leonurus cardiaca , lionhearted , refers to her support of the cardiac system .
Motherwort strengthens the heart muscle , calms palpitations , relaxes the heart , can slow a rapid heartbeat and improves circulation .
As a mild hypotensive , Motherwort combines well with Hawthorn , Linden and Black Haw .
Emotionally , the name infers courage and Motherwort is wonderful for helping those navigate through dark times and periods of intense grief .
David Winston recommends the combination of Motherwort , Bugleweed ( Lycopus americanus ) and Lemon Balm ( Melissa officinalis ) to help with hyperthyroidism , especially when nervousness and palpitations are present .
Lesser known and utilized uses of Motherwort include her effectiveness as an analgesic , especially for post partum pain .
Motherwort is also good for treating digestive system upsets , especially when tied into the nervous system such as nervous dyspepsia , as well as indigestion and liver / gallbladder stagnation due to her bitter and digestive actions .
Some may also find relief from chronic skin conditions such as acne , psoriasis and eczema .
As an antispasmodic , Motherwort is also great for working with spasmodic conditions in the respiratory system , including asthma .
I like to combine her with New England Aster for this .
Motherwort should not be used by pregnant women as Motherwort is a uterine stimulant but is safe during lactation .
Harvest Motherwort when she begins to bloom .
The flowering tops , leaves and stalks can all be used .
Motherwort Extract
You can make Motherwort with fresh or dried herb .
Both are equally powerful .
This is often the preferred method of taking Motherwort as the tea alone is quite bitter .
Fresh or dried flowering tops
Grain alcohol
Water ( if using dried )
Fresh : Chop and fill your jar halfway with fresh plant material .
Fill the jar with grain alcohol .
Have an adult help you chop this plant as it can be hard to chop up .
Watch out for the spiny bracts .
Dried :
Fill your jar about 1/4 with the dried plant material .
Add enough grain alcohol to fill the jar slightly over half .
Top off with water .
Screw the lid on tightly and label your jar .
You should include : the name of the plant you are extracting , if it was fresh or dried , how much alcohol vs. water and the date it was started .
Let steep for 4 weeks , shaking daily .
After 4 weeks , you can strain off or leave the herbs in and the extract will continue to get stronger with time .
Dosage : Adults 15 - 30 drops 3 - 4 times daily .
Children 7 - 12 10 - 20 drops 3 - 4 times daily .
Happy Heart Tea
A daily cup of tea nourished the heart .
Dried Motherwort
Dried Tilia ( Linden )
Dried Hawthorn leaves and flowers
Mix equal parts of each herb in a jar and mix well .
Label the jar .
To make tea , add 2 teaspoons tea to a tea ball and steep in boiling water for 10 - 20 minutes .
Motherwort Infused Oil
This oil can be used on cramps , muscle spasms , and on achy rheumatic joints .
1/2 cup freshly dried Motherwort flowers and leaves
2 cups olive oil
Place the Motherwort in the bottom of the crockpot and pour enough oil to completely cover the plant material .
Plug the crockpot in for an hour or two then unplug and let cool .
Repeat this step several times until the oil has taken on the properties of the Motherwort .
It should be a lot greener than when you started .
Strain off the plant material from the oil and pour the oil into a jar .
Let it sit for 24 hours then check for any moisture that may have settled to the bottom .
If you do not see any , your oil is ready to use and you can label and store it in the refrigerator until you need it .
If there is a layer of moisture at the bottom , pour off the oil into a new jar and discard the moisture layer .
Label the jar and store it in the refrigerator until you need it .
Motherwort Pendant
Make this pendant to wear near to your heart for protection .
These make thoughtful gifts for someone who needs heart protection .
Air dry clay
Fresh Motherwort leaves
Small eye screw
Acrylic paint : green , metallic gold or copper , tan , brown
Waxed paper
Paint brush with thin tip
Stiff brush such as an old toothbrush or stencil brush
Small jar of water
Mod podge
Cord such as hemp , leather or silk
Begin by pinching off a piece of clay about the size of a cherry .
Depending on the size of your leaf , you may want it bigger or smaller .
Roll the clay into a ball , place it on the waxed paper then gently press flat with your hand until the clay is about 1 /4 inch thick .
Place the Motherwort leaf vein side down onto the clay and gently press with your hand or the bottom of a glass .
Using the end of the stem , remove the leaf from the clay .
You should have an imprint of the leaf on your clay .
Repeat as many times as you ’d like .
Decide which way is up then insert an eye screw in the top , turning it so the hole of the eye screw is not visible when you look at it .
Repeat with all the pendants you are making .
Let the clay dry .
Once the clay is dry , squeeze out a dot of paint onto the waxed paper , one for each color .
Use some water from the jar to thin the tan paint and create a wash for the pendant ’s background .
Let dry .
Do the same with the green then fill in the leaf with the green .
Let dry .
Use a touch of the metallic paint to make details .
You may wish to highlight the veins , or create a wash to coat the entire leaf .
If you would like your pendant to be a bit more stone - like in appearance , use a bigger brush to flick paint over the top of the pendant .
Practice on the waxed paper first .
To flick paint , dip the brush into the paint then use your finger to flick the paint .
There is a quick tutorial on how to do this on the resource page .
After the paint dries , paint a coat or two of mod podge to seal the paint .
Measure out a piece of cord long enough to hang your pendant from .
Make sure it will fit over your head after you tie a knot in the end .
Slip the cord through the eye screw then tie the ends in a knot .
Obama needs to become much more aggressive against the McCain campaign since they have begun a huge smear campaign against him .
Saying " we 're above it " wo n't work .
Here 's Rick 's article called ' The anatomy of a smear campaign ' in the Boston Globe back in 2004 :
All campaigns do extensive research into their opponent 's voting record and personal life .
This so - called " oppo research " involves searching databases , combing through press clips , and asking questions of people who know ( and preferably dislike ) your opponent .
It 's not hard to turn up something a candidate would rather not see on the front page of The Boston Globe .
It 's not necessary , however , for a smear to be true to be effective .
The most effective smears are based on a kernel of truth and applied in a way that exploits a candidate 's political weakness .
Having run Senator John McCain 's campaign for president , I can recount a textbook example of a smear made against McCain in South Carolina during the 2000 presidential primary .
We had just swept into the state from New Hampshire , where we had racked up a shocking , 19 - point win over the heavily favored George W. Bush .
What followed was a primary campaign that would make history for its negativity .
And here is what they did to try and stop the smears and how they failed :
We chose to address the attacks by trying to get the media to focus on the dishonesty of the allegations and to find out who was making them .
We also pledged to raise the level of debate by refusing to run any further negative ads -- a promise we kept , though it probably cost us the race .
We never did find out who perpetrated these smears , but they worked :
We lost South Carolina by a wide margin .
Read the whole article .
Obama can't let the media try to clean up the smears coming from McCain for him .
Having Andrea argue with Davis is n't enough .
He has to hit back and hit back hard every time Davis and friends goes on the attack .
It does n't have to get personal because McCain has given Obama plenty to work with .
Produce an ad with McCain standing in an oil spill , ( where he was supposed to go and do a photo op ) list all the money he 's getting from big oil since he became the nominee , list the incredible profits that big oil just reported , then say something like :
Is Driving to work costing you a fortune while Big Oil reaps in record profits ?
John McCain 's solution to the rising gas prices that we face is to reward Big Oil with incredible tax breaks after he received thousands of dollars in contributions .
That 's the real Straight talk about John McCain .
John McCain , he 's looking out for Big Oil , but who will look out for you ?
You get the idea .
Why do n't you guys write some copy and post it down below .
Maybe we can do a little Youtube contest .
See what we come up with ...

Blind 5 Year - Old Pianist Next Mozart ?
Yoo Ye-eun , a 5 year - old South Korean girl is being talked about as though she might be the next Mozart .
Ye -eun was born without eyes and was abandoned by her parents .
She has never received formal piano lessons , yet even at the age of 3 , she could play any song she heard after listening to it a single time .
The blind pianist received a large amount of recognition after a video of her performance received more than 27 million views on a popular Korean website called Pandora TV .
A similar clip on YouTube had received two million hits before it was removed .
‘ She has perfect pitch even though she has never learnt to play .
We never taught her , ’ said Ye - eun ’s adoptive mother , Park Jung Soon .
In May she performed a duet of ‘ You Raise me Up ’ with 7 year - old British singer Connie Talbot , who last year starred in reality show Britain ’s Got Talent .

The original version of this article was printed in the Genesis issue of Bitch magazine , Summer 2008 .
It appears here with a new introduction from original author Deesha Philyaw as a part of the special 20th anniversary edition of Bitch magazine .
The publishing industry ’s interest in stories about Black motherhood remains as much a mixed bag as it was when I first wrote “ Ain’t I a Mommy ? ”
Today ’s literary landscape includes more Black mothers writing about motherhood in general , and their own experiences in particular .
I contributed an essay on parenting and race to Motherhood Memoirs : Mothers Creating / Writing Lives ; other books published since 2008 include Kim McLarin ’s Divorce Dog : Motherhood , Men , & Midlife ; Ylonda Gault Caviness ’s memoir , Child , Please : How Mama ’s Old - School Lessons Helped Me Check Myself Before I Wrecked Myself ; and Riché J. Daniel Barnes ’s Raising the Race : Black Career Women Redefine Marriage , Motherhood , and Community .
Author Lori Tharps , whom I interviewed for “ Ain’t I a Mommy ? ” notes that , “ As usual , in the wake of mainstream publishing ignoring a very important audience , [ that ] audience created what they wanted and needed to hear about parenting in color . ”
In 2010 , Tharps released Substitute Me , a novel about juggling motherhood , marriage , and career .
Writer Carolyn
Edgar thinks that the mother - writing genre , overall , “ has grown a bit stale , ” but points out exceptions like Honest Toddler : A Child ’s Guide to Parenting , a book based on the wildly popular Twitter account of formerly anonymous Black mother Bunmi Laditan .
I find Honest Toddler ’s popularity bitterweet : I love that the musings of a Black mother are regarded as universal , but I also wonder if they would have been as enthusiastically received had Laditan ’s identity been known from the start .
After all , the baby on the cover of the book is white , as was Honest Toddler ’s original Twitter avatar .
Was anonymity the only way a Black mother ’s parenting commentary could be seen as something other than niche ?
If I were to rewrite “ Ain’t I a Mommy ? ” today , I would definitely ask Laditan for her thoughts .
Shortly before the birth of my first child nine years ago , while browsing the bookstore for mommy wisdom , I discovered Anne Lamott ’s Operating Instructions : A Journal of My Son ’s First Year and fell in love with the author and the book .
More than any parenting truisms the book might have contained , it was Lamott ’s writing style — funny , self - deprecating , and brutally honest — that kept me reading .
The big mommy insight I gleaned from Operating Instructions was that I was n’t quite as neurotic as Anne , so my kid and I would probably be all right .
This was the only book of its type that I read all the way through back then because , like a copy of a copy , subsequent mommy memoirs just were n’t as sharp .
I found them to be one - note and lacking in whatever essential quality had drawn me to Operating Instructions in the first place .
In the absence of top - notch writing , I really needed to see myself in those pages .
In other memoirs , I saw college - educated stay - at - home moms who felt equal parts gratitude , mental fatigue , and boredom , but I did n’t see any women who were Black like me .
Now , with two kids and a freelance writing career under my belt , the current mommy memoir offerings whose titles I skim on bookstore shelves are even less appealing .
A sample : Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind , Finding Your Soul ; The Second Nine Months : One Woman Tells the REAL Truth About Becoming a Mom — Finally ; Let the Baby Drive : Navigating the Road of New Motherhood ; Dispatches from a Not - So - Perfect Life : Or How I Learned to Love the House , the Man , the Child .
A “ funny ” mommy memoir subgenre has emerged ( notably Mommies Who Drink : Sex , Drugs , and Other Distant Memories of an Ordinary Mom , and Jenny McCarthy ’s Belly Laughs and Baby Laughs ) .
Some of these books reference alcohol in the title ( Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay ; The Three - Martini Playdate ) in an attempt to differentiate these authors as the fun - time gals of the momoir world .
But I ’m still not buying .
A cursory look at the descriptions and reviews of post–Operating Instructions mommy memoirs reveals that the messages espoused in them has n’t changed much over the decade : Childhood is fleeting , so cherish every moment .
But do n’t lose yourself in your kids .
Know what ’s really important ( which varies depending on which author you ask ) .
Cater to your husband .
Do n’t cater to your husband ; make him help with the kids .
Ignore the parenting experts — but listen to my story .
And , it appears , these books are still written almost exclusively by white women .
A few years ago , Lori L. Tharps , author of the combination travel memoir and racial coming - of - age story Kinky Gazpacho : Love , Life and Spain , approached her agent with the idea of writing a mommy memoir .
The response was less than enthusiastic , Tharps recalls : “ She told me , ‘ Please do n’t do that . ’”
The market was glutted with these books , the agent lamented — and Tharps , who admits the idea came to her in the midst of her postpartum hormonal haze and love affair with her first child , let it go .
I can see the agent ’s point about the glut , but in the 15 years since the publication of Operating Instructions , why were n’t Black - authored mommy memoirs part of that oversaturation ?
Did publishers think no one wanted to read about a Black mommy with a Yale degree like me gritting her teeth through endless games of Candyland ?
Did they presume that a minority of middle - class and upper - middle - class married white women could speak for all mothers ?
Or was Tharps an anomaly — were Black women just not interested in penning these types of books ?
The absence of Black mommy memoirs mirrors the relative absence of Black women ’s voices in mainstream U.S. media discourse about motherhood in general .
In particular , this discourse is concerned with how women balance the demands of family and careers , and with the decision by some college - educated women to opt out of the labor force altogether and remain at home with their children .
When this discourse ceased to be polite , the explosion was dubbed “ the mommy wars . ”
The genesis of the mommy wars can be traced back to the “ cult of true womanhood ” ( also known as the “ cult of domesticity ” ) , the 19th - century view that delicate white women bore the sole responsibility for housekeeping and childcare , and were to be placed on pedestals at home and kept out of the public sphere .
By contrast , since 1619 when the first slaves arrived on the shores of what is now the United States , most Black mothers have had no choice but to work .
Instead of being placed on pedestals , Black women watched as our babies were placed on auction blocks .
And yet , we pressed on through the most dehumanizing conditions , working on the plantations , and caring for the children who remained .
Speaking at the Ohio Women ’s Rights Convention in 1851 , abolitionist and former slave Sojourner Truth reportedly asked the assembly of white men and women where her pedestal was .
Over the objections of the white women ’s - rights advocates who sought to silence her that day , Truth spoke of the brutality she endured in slavery and wondered aloud why she did n’t receive preferential treatment as a member of the fairer sex — asking , famously , “ Ain’t I a woman ? ”
Shortly after Emancipation , most rural Black women attempted to adopt the cult of true womanhood , tending to home and hearth with the blessing of their husbands .
But this experiment was short - lived , as white politicians and plantation owners sought to rebuild the cotton economy in the post–Civil War era .
With the 1865 enactment of the federal Black Codes ( a precursor to Jim Crow segregation laws ) , the labor of newly freed slaves was once again controlled by white people through exploitative sharecropping arrangements .
As a result , Black mothers and their children were forced back into the fields .
Less than a century later , when World War II moved record numbers of married white women into the labor force to take the place of their deployed husbands , the cult of true womanhood mostly died in practice .
It left in its wake decades of public and private debate over whether women — white women — can be good mothers while also pursuing successful careers .
The current mommy wars resurrect this hand - wringing for a new century .
Profit - seeking magazines , book publishers , and talk shows capitalize on the guilt and fears expressed by some working mothers , and on the “ Should I go back to work ? ” doubts of some at - home mothers .
From Dr. Phil to the New York Times , the media shamelessly pit the two camps against each other , fueling the flames of their anxieties .
Never mind that after a year or so of maternity leave , most women return to work , and 75 percent of mothers with school - age children work — most doing so because they have to .
Never mind that most at - home mothers are n’t interested in bashing their working counterparts .
Magazine articles begat inflammatory books begat appearances on TV morning shows .
In 2004 , Caitlin Flanagan turned a New Yorker article into a book , To Hell with All That : Loving and Loathing Our Inner Housewife , in which she — a wealthy , white , self - described antifeminist who once employed a nanny and a maid and has never changed her own sheets or cleaned her own house — had the nerve to write , “ Women have a deeply felt emotional connection to housekeeping , ” and therefore , should stay at home .
In the other corner was Linda R. Hirshman ’s Get to Work : A Manifesto for Women of the World , which also began life as a magazine article ( “ Homeward Bound , ” published in the American Prospect ) .
Released in 2006 , this book speaks mainly to affluent , highly educated women , essentially arguing that the only worthwhile life for them is one driven by professional ambition .
By staying at home , a woman is creating her own glass ceiling and harming society as a whole , says Hirshman .
The book was re-released last year in paperback with the kinder , gentler title Get to Work … And Get a Life , Before It ’s Too Late .
Last year saw the release of Leslie Bennetts ’s The Feminine Mistake : Are We Giving Up Too Much ? , which , like Get to Work , predicts doom and gloom for educated women who opt to stay home with their children rather than stay in the office .
Bennetts warns of long - term loss of income and retirement funds , difficulty reentering the workforce after a long absence , and the risky venture of total financial dependence on men .
While these book - length volleys in the mommy wars tended not to be bestsellers , they still managed to capture the attention of media outlets hungry for ratings , magazine sales , and website hits .
Despite selling only about 4,000 copies ( as of April 2007 ) , Hirshman ’s book landed her on The View and Good Morning America .
Flanagan ’s book only sold 5,000 copies more than Hirshman ’s , but she got to hawk it on The Colbert Report and whine about her critics in an essay for Time .
The abundance of ink and airtime devoted to a vocal minority of women promotes the idea that this minority ’s experience is somehow universal .
Low - income and working - class women , Black women , and other women of color do n’t see their mothering experiences and concerns reflected in the mommy media machine , and we get the cultural message loud and clear :
Affluent white women are the only mothers who really matter .
Further , media overexposure of these women bolsters the perception of them as self - absorbed brewers of tempests in teapots .
Thankfully , there have been some more temperate voices in the wilderness of all this judgment about motherhood and work .
Though still mommy - centric , books like Judith Warner ’s Perfect Madness : Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety and The Mommy Myth : The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women by Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels do not shove women into boxes labeled “ stay - at - home ” and “ working , ” respecting the fact that many mothers move in and out of full and part - time employment throughout their lifetimes .
Two anthologies , The Bitch in the House : 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex , Solitude , Work , Motherhood and Marriage and Mommy Wars , also steer clear of the finger - pointing .
The former includes essays by at least two women of color , though neither appears in the book ’s “ Mommy Maddest ” section .
Black writers Veronica Chambers , Lonnae O’Neal Parker , and Sydney Trent contribute to Mommy Wars , a collection that explicitly seeks to bridge the gap between alleged “ warring factions . ”
And yet Random House subtitled it , over the editor ’s objections , with the mommy wars - ian descriptor Stay - at - Home and Career Moms Face Off on Their Choices , Their Lives , Their Families .
That Black mothers were not among the combatants on the fake battlefield of the mommy wars is not coincidental .
This simply was n’t our fight .
In her book Having It All : Black Women and Success , Veronica Chambers notes , “ Guilt just is n’t a currency in our lives the way it is in the lives of white women . ”
Further , as economist Julianne Malveaux observed in USA Today , “ Some African American women want to yawn at the angst about shouldering multiple burdens and juggling multiple roles .
Been there , done that , got the t- shirt so long ago that I recycled it . ”
Since the 1940s , Black women have outnumbered white women in the labor force .
According to some reports , the Black middle class owes its existence to Black women ’s presence in the workplace .
After Emancipation , those Black women fortunate enough to pursue higher education took advantage of the professional opportunities available to them .
Many of these middle - class , college - educated women embodied the “ lifting as we climb ” motto coined by the National Association of Colored Women ( NACW ) in 1896 .
The NACW and other organizations in the Black women ’s club movement served on the front lines of the antilynching crusade , advocated for workers ’ rights , and sought to improve the quality of life for their impoverished brothers and sisters .
Fast forward to the present day and this “ we ’re all in this together ” legacy lives on .
Professional Black mothers can generally count on other Black women they know to cheer them on as they advance in their careers , and they in turn may lend a financial hand to extended family members who need it .
Mocha Moms , a support group for at - home mothers of color with more than 120 chapters nationwide , lobbies for quality childcare for low - income working women .
Instead of deriding working mothers , the organization makes this statement on its website : “ We support the choices our members are making … but respect every parent ’s right to make different decisions . ”
I asked one Mocha Mom I know , Jennifer , what she thought about mommy memoirs and the mommy wars .
She responded , “ Historically , we ’ve had to take care of our kids and their kids , ” referring to Black women ’s roles during slavery and as domestic workers in white households after slavery and throughout the ’50s and ’60s .
“ Now we only have to take care of our kids , and we just do n’t have the same level of angst as white women do .
Definitely not enough to write a whole book about it . ”
Jennifer , a married mother of two with an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a law degree from Columbia , adds , “ I struggle with the daily demands of mothering .
But I also remember that I ’m standing on the shoulders of my great - great - grandmothers who were enslaved , beaten , raped , and they pulled through and made it .
My existence is proof of their survival , their victory and perseverance .
So how can I have a meltdown because my kid is having a tantrum when I ’m trying to cook ?
Of course our grown - up needs have to be met , too , but still .
We do what we have to do . ”
Of course , Black mothers are not endless founts of strength .
Nor do we live charmed , guilt - free lives .
Some Black at - home mothers are asked by family and friends to justify the decision to “ waste ” their educations .
Professional Black mothers may have to forego material comforts and greater financial security in exchange for more flexibility and time at home with their kids .
But all this struggling and striving happens in the context of our history .
If a Black mother ’s household income is such that she can afford to stay at home with her kids or opt to pursue a career full - time instead — either way , we ’ve arrived at a profound historical moment .
Either way , she is living a life her foremothers could only dream about .
So if Black women have n’t beaten down publishers ’ doors with manuscripts about mothering or about pulling second shifts , it ’s probably because this is what we ’ve always done , without fanfare and without the luxury of “ what about the children ? ” pearl - clutching .
Perhaps because many of us are only a generation or two removed from poverty , we ca n’t in good conscience write unconcerned screeds that ignore the hard realities for poor women and children .
Maybe we look at our girlfriends — working women who are n’t mothers — and are reminded that it ’s not all about the mommies .
Maybe we realize that mommy - centrism lets employers and policy - makers off the hook with regard to family - friendly workplace changes that would allow mothers and fathers to work more flexible hours without sacrificing their careers in the process .
This is not to say that Black women never sweat the career - family stuff , nor is it to say we are n’t writing about motherhood at all these days .
However , the number of such books is woefully small , and the results are not as shrill or as navel - gazing as the typical mommy book tends to be .
Said navel - gazing was what motivated Washington Post reporter Lonnae O’Neal Parker to write her first book .
In 2002 , Parker penned an article for the Post called “ The Donna Reed Syndrome ” about her decision — reached when she fell asleep in her driveway one night after covering an event for work — to take a yearlong break from her job in order “ to have gleaming hardwood floors and to hang out with the kids . ”
Parker recalls , “ I wrote about what that year meant to me , and how at the end of it , I returned to who I was — a reporter .
I returned to my career …with a better set of tools in place to give myself more rest and a greater ability to do what I do . ”
Among the responses to that piece was a letter from a woman who wrote : “ I suppose you think I ’m pathetic .
I have stayed at home since the birth of my son three years ago . ”
Parker was floored .
“ As if what I wrote was an indictment of her !
The total obliviousness to Black women ’s history , and that it had always included work , was just galling . ”
The encounter led Parker to write I ’m Every Woman : Remixed Stories of Marriage , Motherhood , and Work , a book that combines memoir with the stuff good U.S. history texts should be made of .
In it , Parker presents her personal experiences as a mother , wife , and professional woman , as well as the larger historical legacy of Black women and work .
Of the mommy wars , she writes : “ Understand , it ’s not that I think that black women have all the answers — only that we have struggled with the questions longer and that sometimes our tool sets are more expansive .
I am clear that in all cultures there are other committed women who deeply believe they must stand on one or another side of a work - family divide and agitate in order to create a better world for their children .
And really , I can dig it .
I ’m actually quite grateful that I can skim some of their best parts off the top .
But these women must never , ever try to give me any of their excess baggage . ”
Parker approached three publishing houses about her book .
Two immediately “ got it ” and , of the two , Parker ultimately chose Amistad because the head of that HarperCollins imprint was living a life parallel to hers : a Black woman and mother who recognized the book ’s cultural touchstones .
“ Both houses were enthusiastic about the book , but there was a layer of translation that I did n’t have to do with [ the Amistad head ] . ”
Black women readers embraced I ’m Every Woman , hungry for a perspective different from that found in the usual mommy - book fare .
And , as Parker had hoped , some white women “ tired of the echo chamber ” are now teaching the book in university classrooms .
“ This is n’t just about the mommy wars , ” Parker says .
“ It ’s …necessary to hear other voices .
It ’s human , it ’s sisterly , it ’s progressive . ”
Then there ’s writer Kim McLarin , who placed the main character in her 2007 novel , Jump at the Sun , squarely within the historical context of Black mothers and work .
Grace is a sociologist who becomes a stay - at - home mother after being denied tenure .
Ambivalence about her new role is further complicated by her mother and grandmother ’s differing takes on motherhood and its sacrifices .
And in her second memoir , Baby Love , biracial writer Rebecca Walker used a journal format to chronicle her pregnancy .
The book ’s subtitle — Choosing Motherhood After a Lifetime of Ambivalence — reflects Walker ’s uncertainty about how , when , and if she wanted to parent .
During the course of the pregnancy , the author ’s mother , writer Alice Walker , decides to sever their already strained relationship , disagreeing with Rebecca ’s decision to have a child and with Rebecca ’s account of their relationship in her first memoir , Black , White , and Jewish : Autobiography of a Shifting Self .
Black women ’s writing on motherhood has been anthologized twice , most recently in Rise Up Singing : Black Women Writers on Motherhood .
This collection of short fiction , poems , and essays is edited by Cecelie Berry , a freelance writer and stay - at - home mom .
Berry sought out a diverse array of well - known and lesser - known contributors including journalists , Internet columnists , a doctor , and a minister — some to discuss their everyday lives and others to address how social and political influences shaped their motherhood experiences .
Still , when compared with the vast number of memoirs and nonfiction books about motherhood written by white women , these books still seem tiny in number .
It ’s possible that these books exist in theory — that other black women have written motherhood - themed books only to be rejected by publishing houses like the one Parker encountered where “ they just did n’t get it , ” or because of outright racism .
Is it likely ?
Nicholas Lewis , a Black entertainment lawyer and literary agent , says , “ The publishing industry is no more racist than any other industry in this country .
The industry is actually aware of issues pertaining to race and publishes books that confront America ’s race problems .
There are also imprints like Harlem Moon and Amistad that do really wonderful books .
But there ’s only so much that can be published .
The market is competitive , and you have to go with what you think is going to sell . ”
Lewis wonders if there are n’t more Black mommy books because “ we forgot about Claire Huxtable , ” the Black lawyer and mother of five featured on The Cosby Show , whose iconography stood in stark contrast to the stereotypical imagery of the Mammy figure and Reagan ’s Cadillac - driving “ welfare queen . ”
The 1980s TV hit , after all , generated national discussion about the Black middle class and challenged the notion that families like the Huxtables were an anomaly .
By contrast , today ’s Black TV moms are more likely to hover in the background in sitcoms that are vehicles for the comedians - turned - actors who portray their husbands .
While most of us know that she never left the building in the first place , Lewis thinks the media is ready to declare that the sophisticated , educated Black mother is back , and would - be First Lady Michelle Obama is Exhibit A .
In a 2007 Washington Post article , Obama revealed not only ambivalence about leaving her job to support her husband ’s presidential candidacy , but a long - time internal debate as well : “ Every other month [ since ]
I ’ve had children I ’ve struggled with the notion of ‘ Am I being a good parent ?
Can I stay home ?
Should I stay home ?
How do I balance it all ? ’”
This admission inspired more than a little feminist tsk - tsking .
Yet in a subsequent interview in Vanity Fair , Obama asserted that both she and her husband weigh such concerns and make their daughters ’ well - being their top priority .
In another article , Obama said she viewed the position of First Lady as a full - time job , but she reserved the right to change her mind about that if she assumes the role .
For Lewis , embracing the crossover appeal of the Michelle Obamas of the world looks like a catalyst for change .
“ Now is a great time for books about Black mothers with careers , ” he says .
We ’ll see if Black women choose to seize this literary moment .
I 've always been a Windows user , which means I 've always been subjected to the ridicule of holier - than - thou Apple fans .
You know what I 'm talking about : blue screen of death jokes , spelling Microsoft with a $ in place of the S , saying " it just works " with a smug , chubby - faced smirk .
It 's always been annoying , and it 's always made me want to avoid using Apple products just so I would n't turn into one of those people .
But then the iPhone came out , and I wanted it .
But I being a Windows dude , I knew to wait a year for what I thought would be a more complete , less buggy version .
It was Apple 's opportunity to get me into the fold , to make me a member of the cult .
And boy , did they blow it .
Advertisement
I really would love to know where Apple got this reputation of creating lily - white products that never need fixing , created by a company that cradles its customers in fluffy clouds of superior technology .
According to my first experiences with an Apple OS , that 's a whole lot of bullshit .
The iPhone 3G is infuriatingly buggy .
It crashes .
It does n't get great speeds when it should , switching to EDGE in areas that have 3G coverage .
Coming out of the subway , it takes minutes to find a signal again and stop claiming to get " No Service " in the middle of Manhattan , often requiring a restart .
Requiring a restart to get service !
What is this crap ?
And when I do have service , calls still drop and fail all the time .
The keyboard lags so much that writing text messages is more annoying than using T9 texting on a number pad .
The orientation switching when you rotate the phone is inconsistent at best .
Backups take minutes , sometimes hours .
Sometimes , the audio output dies and it needs to be restarted to listen to music through headphones .
If you 've got an iPhone 3G or have been reading news on Giz , none of this will come as a surprise to you .
What 's surprising to me is how they 're reacting to to the problems .
Advertisement
I called Apple famed customer support to see if they had any solutions for these bugs .
Their fix for my problem getting service when coming out of the subway ?
Turn Airplane Mode on and off .
If there 's a more ghetto fix for a problem than that , I 'd like to hear it .
Last time I checked the C train did n't have wings .
As for when all of these bugs will be fixed , the guy on the phone said " Sooner or later it 'll be working to its full potential . "
Oh , great .
How helpful .
When asked if I could revert to a previous firmware version , I was told to just wait for the next release .
Great , thanks for nothing !
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Overall , the customer service reps I talked to were friendly , but they 've clearly been overwhelmed with calls about the iPhone ( my average wait time was about nine minutes for the iPhone support number ) .
They 're overwhelmed because they 're the only facet of Apple that 's available to talk about just what 's going on with the iPhone .
Officially , Apple has n't recognized any problems , only releasing two patches that say they offer " bug fixes " without going into any more detail .
It 's the standard Apple technique ; giving no information whatsoever unless they feel like it suits them .
And this arrogant company causes such heart palpitations in you fanboys ?
If you try to go through the PR channels , you get the Apple standard " no comment . "
Supposedly , Steve Jobs himself emailed one single person and promised fixes next month .
That does n't count as an official statement .
In fact , that 's worse than nothing at all , because it just shows how little respect Jobs has for all of us .
He has time to tell one jerkoff who files a bug report that fixes are coming in September but can't release a statement that says just that ?
Screw you , Steve .

When the Playstation 3 got some new firmware that bricked a number of consoles , Sony did n't keep mum on the subject .
They rushed a new firmware out in a matter of days and kept in touch with reporters about what was going on .
They even apologized : " We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you and appreciate your understanding and continued support . "
Apple has n't acknowledged the iPhone issues to the press , let alone saying sorry for them .
Because saying sorry would mean admitting that they screwed up .
Advertisement
The problem is that Apple has this reality distortion field that they use , which is a brilliant handling of PR most of the time .
They give out tiny amounts of information , and by being so stingy they make everyone beg and salivate for little scraps
But in the end , Apple is just a company like every other company .
They screw up , they release things before they 're ready and they botch crisis control .
The reality distortion field can't cover for things like that .
Their shit still stinks .
Before I got my iPhone , I was actually considering buying an Apple laptop .
Can you believe it ?
Me , the Windows guy on the Giz staff , thinking of switching .
Eventually , when the time comes to buy a new computer , I probably wo n't want to jump to Vista , after all .
Why not try a Mac ?
Advertisement
Now , after this experience , there 's no way I will .
I do n't trust the computers to " just work , " and if problems arise I do n't trust Apple to handle them in an open way with customers .
In fact , I expect them to try to keep things from me , I expect to continue to feel disrespected by King Jobs and his merry minions .
And I 'm not alone on this one .
What could have been an amazing opportunity to introduce thousands of people to the Apple OS experience has turned people off rather than getting them hooked .
Hail Scott Adams By Bryan Caplan
If you have n’t heard , Scott Adams of Dilbert fame has commissioned a survey of professional economists .
His explicit hope is to raise the quality of policy :
So how does a voter decide which candidate would be best for the economy ? [… ]
Forgive me for not caring what your grandma thinks of NAFTA .
I want to know which economic policies seem best according to the majority of economists .
I got tired of waiting for someone else to give me some useful information and decided to go get it myself .
[ I sent him a copy of my book , but I assume it got filtered out .
- B.C. ]
I woke up this morning with the strange feeling that I might own the most important information in the world .
Although 90 % of voters have made up their mind , the race is so tight that the remaining 10 % will settle things .
If the media reports the results of my survey of economists , will it influence independent voters and thus the arrow of history ?
Probably not .
But you ca n’t rule it out .
I ’m particularly pleased to see that Adams is trying hard to be more elitist than me :
But if you ignore the opinions of 500 economists you are either a well - informed genius who needs no advice , or an idiot who does n’t realize it would be helpful .
If you know anything about the econ profession , it ’s clear that Obama will crush McCain .
After all , the typical economist is a moderate Democrat ; he just happens to be a moderate Democrat who thinks that downsizing has important long - run economic benefits .
The real contribution of an Adams - like survey is the information it provides about economists ’ specific policy views .
NAFTA , for example , enjoys economists ’ bipartisan support .
If the public merely deferred to policies enjoying such support , we ’d live in a very different and vastly better world .
The results from Adams ’ survey are n’t yet in , and I ’ve heard some complaints about his questions .
Even so , I ’m excited to see how his survey of economists turns out .
Stay tuned .

FBI admits spying on multiple US reporters , apologizes John Byrne
Published : Saturday August 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Offers no explanation for spying We 're sorry .
That 's the message from FBI Director Robert Mueller to the executive editors of the New York Times and the Washington Post , after an inspector general discovered that the agency had seized telephone records from four US reporters without a grand jury .
Mueller called Times ' editor Bill Keller and Post chief Len Downie Friday , " expressing regret " that agents had not followed " proper procedures .
The " lapse " occurred nearly four years ago and involved four staff members of the papers .
" The FBI discontinued use of the emergency letters after privacy advocates and internal watchdogs cited hundreds of cases in which agents intentionally , or out of sloppiness , did not follow up their ' exigent ' requests with paperwork that linked the submission to a genuine matter of national security , " Washington Post reporter Carrie Johnson wrote in an article Saturday .
The bureau obtained phone records for a Post reporter and a researcher in Indonesia , and Times reporters Raymond Bonner and Jane Perlez , also in the country at the time .
The records were obtained through what is called an exigent circumstances letter , a demand made by the agency in a practice that skirts civil liberties protections that has flourished in the wake of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Neither Mueller nor his agency offered any explanations regarding the nature of the subject of the investigation that involved spying on American reporters based overseas .
Writing in the Post today , Johnson noted that the reporters were writing about Islamic terrorism in Southeast Asia .
" Efforts to obtain phone records for reporters are subject to special rules at the Justice Department , generally requiring approval by the attorney general or another top official , " Johnson added .
" But such procedures were not followed in the two incidents found by Inspector General Glenn A. Fine , bureau officials said yesterday . "
" FBI agents involved in the undisclosed national security probe stated at the time of the request that they would follow up with subpoenas from a U.S. attorney , but ' no subpoena was ever issued for your telephone toll records , ' according to a letter that Post Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. received yesterday from FBI General Counsel Valerie Caprone , " she added .
Such records listed the phone numbers the reporters called and received , but not the actual conversation , similar to the warrantless wiretapping program the Bush Administration has employed in tracking calls American citizens have placed to overseas destinations .
An FBI spokesman said the records have been expunged .
" I thanked Director Mueller for calling and informing us of this and apologizing , " Post editor Downie told his paper .
" I told him that we would be asking our general counsel to look into this . "
His editors placed the story on page 4 of Saturday 's edition .
Campaign Notebook : GOP 's Hagel says Palin is n't qualified CAMPAIGN NOTEBOOK
Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel said his party 's vice - presidential nominee , Sarah Palin , lacks foreign policy experience and called it a " stretch " to say she 's qualified to be president .
" She does n't have any foreign policy credentials , " Hagel said in an interview published Thursday by the Omaha World - Herald .
" You get a passport for the first time in your life last year ?
I mean , I do n't know what you can say .
You ca n't say anything . "
Could Palin lead the country if GOP presidential nominee John McCain could not ?
" I think it 's a stretch to , in any way , to say that she 's got the experience to be president of the United States , " Hagel said .
Hagel , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in July and had said he would have considered serving as Obama 's running mate .
Michelle Obama targets female voters
asked voters Thursday to make their choice on the issues , not for such reasons as " I like that guy " or " She 's cute . "
Might she be talking about Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin ?
" I 'm talking about me , " she said with a smile .
Barack Obama 's wife , however , is not on the ticket in the presidential election .
Palin is .
Michelle Obama is part of a concerted effort involving her husband , his running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to neutralize the appeal that Palin has brought to John McCain 's ticket for some female voters .
They are doing so unmistakably but gingerly , so as to not appear sexist or invite another " lipstick - on - a - pig " tempest .
Michelle Obama 's remarks came at a women 's roundtable on the economy .
In a series of experiments , Vohs and her colleagues found ways to get people to think about money without explicitly telling them to do so .
They gave some people tasks that involved unscrambling phrases about money .
With others , they left piles of Monopoly money nearby .
Another group saw a screensaver with various denominations of money .
Other people , randomly selected , unscrambled phrases that were not about money , did not see Monopoly money , and saw different screensavers .
In each case , those who had been led to think about money – let ’s call them “ the money group ” – behaved differently from those who had not .
When given a difficult task and told that help was available , people in the money group took longer to ask for help .
When asked for help , people in the money group spent less time helping .
When told to move their chair so that they could talk with someone else , people in the money group left a greater distance between chairs .
When asked to choose a leisure activity , people in the money group were more likely to choose an activity that could be enjoyed alone , rather than one that involved others .
Finally , when people in the money group were invited to donate some of the money they had been paid for participation in the experiment , they gave less than those who had not been induced to think about money .
Trivial reminders of money made a surprisingly large difference .
For example , where the control group would offer to spend an average of 42 minutes helping someone with a task , those primed to think about money offered only 25 minutes .
Similarly , when someone pretending to be another participant in the experiment asked for help , the money group spent only half as much time helping her .
When asked to make a donation from their earnings , the money group gave just a little over half as much as the control group .
Why does money makes us less willing to seek or give help , or even to sit close to others ?
Vohs and her colleagues suggest that as societies began to use money , the necessity of relying on family and friends diminished , and people were able to become more self - sufficient .
“ In this way , ” they conclude , “ money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations , an effect that is still apparent in people ’s responses today . ”
Biologists at the University of Rochester writing in Aging Cell have found that small - bodied rodents with long lifespans have evolved a previously unknown anti-cancer mechanism that appears to be different from any anti-cancer mechanisms employed by humans or other large mammals .
Understanding this mechanism may help prevent cancer in humans because many human cancers originate from stem cells and similar mechanisms may regulate stem cell division .
" We have n't come across this anti-cancer mechanism before because it does n't exist in the two species most often used for cancer research : mice and humans , " says Vera Gorbunova , assistant professor of biology at the University of Rochester , a principal investigator of this study .
" Mice are short - lived and humans are large - bodied .
But this mechanism appears to exist only in small , long - lived animals . "
Gorbunova believes that cells of long - lived , small - bodied rodents are hypersensitive to cues from the surrounding tissue .
If the cells sense that conditions are inappropriate for growth , they slow down cell division .
Such a mechanism would arrest tumor growth and prevent metastases .
Gorbunova 's team has worked at length investigating the links between body size and lifespan in rodents because rodents range in size from tiny field mice to the human - sized capybara of Brazil .
She can use them to compare size and lifespan across several different - sized but closely related animals .
She discovered that telomerase — an enzyme that can lengthen the lives of cells , but can also increase the rate of cancer — is highly active in small rodents , but not in large ones .
Until Gorbunova 's research , the prevailing wisdom has assumed that an animal that lived as long as we humans do needed to suppress telomerase activity to guard against cancer .
Telomerase helps cells reproduce , and cancer is essentially runaway cellular reproduction , so an animal living for 70 years has a lot of chances for its cells to mutate into cancer .
A mouse 's life expectancy is shortened by other factors in nature , such as predation , so it was thought the mouse could afford the slim cancer risk to benefit from telomerase 's ability to speed healing .
But Gorbunova and colleagues showed that it was not life expectancy , but body mass that regulated the expression of telomerase .
Simply having more cells increases the likelihood that one will become cancerous .
We humans , as large animals , would likely develop cancer much more often and much earlier if we did n't suppress our telomerase .
While the findings were a surprise , they revealed another question :
What about small animals like the common grey squirrel that live for 24 years or more ?
With telomerase fully active over such a long period , why is n't cancer rampant in these creatures ?
Gorbunova found that the squirrel , naked mole - rat , chipmunk , muskrat , and chinchilla express high levels of telomerase , which would be expected to increase their cancer risk over their long lifetimes .
But these species have developed a mechanism to counteract the high telomerase activity and remain cancer free for the duration of their lifespans .
" Squirrels know a cure for cancer , " says Gorbunova .
" Short - lived small species display continuous rapid proliferation of their cells , but these long - lived rodents have somehow found a way to slow down that proliferation when they need to . "
Gorbunova thinks that squirrels and similar rodents have evolved a strict monitoring function within their cells that may be able to sense appropriate and inappropriate cell division — i.e. , healthy reproduction and runaway cancerous reproduction — and slow or inhibit the division if necessary .
Gorbunova is now looking to isolate and understand this mechanism with the hope that it may be applicable to help human cells thwart the onset of tumor growth .
Along with Gorbunova and the first author Andrei Seluanov , the paper was co-authored by their long - time collaborator Daven Presgraves , all from the University of Rochester ; members of the Gorbunova laboratory : Chris Hine , Michael Bozzella , and Amelia Hall ; and Tais Sasahara and Antonio Ribeiro from the University of San Paulo , and Ken Catania from Vanderbilt University .

The United States loudly and proudly boasted this month of its new bomb currently being used against al - Qaida hold - outs in Afghanistan ; it sucks the air from underground installations , suffocating those within .
The US has also admitted that it has used depleted uranium weaponry over the last decade against bunkers in Iraq , Kosovo , and now Afghanistan .
“ The immediate concern for medical professionals and employees of aid organisations remains the threat of extensive depleted uranium ( DU ) contamination in Afghanistan . ”
This is one of the conclusions of a 130 - page report , Mystery Metal Nightmare in Afghanistan ?
( 1 ) , by Dai Williams , an independent researcher and occupational psychologist .
It is the result of more than a year of research into DU and its effects on those exposed to it .
Using internet sites of both NGOs ( 2 ) and arms manufacturers , Williams has come up with information that he has cross-checked and compared with weapons that the Pentagon has reported — indeed boasted about — using during the war .
What emerges is a startling and frightening vision of war , both in Afghanistan and in the future .
Since 1997 the United States has been modifying and upgrading its missiles and guided ( smart ) bombs .
Prototypes of these bombs were tested in the Kosovo mountains in 1999 , but a far greater range has been tested in Afghanistan .
The upgrade involves replacing a conventional warhead by a heavy , dense metal one ( 3 ) .
Calculating the volume and the weight of this mystery metal leads to two possible conclusions : it is either tungsten or depleted uranium .
Tungsten poses problems .
Its melting point ( 3,422 °C ) makes it very hard to work ; it is expensive ; it is produced mostly by China ; and it does not burn .
DU is pyrophoric , burning on impact or if it is ignited , with a melting point of 1,132 °C ; it is much easier to process ; and as nuclear waste , it is available free to arms manufacturers .
Further , using it in a range of weapons significantly reduces the US nuclear waste storage problem .
This type of weapon can penetrate many metres of reinforced concrete or rock in seconds .
It is equipped with a detonator controlled by a computer that measures the density of the material passed through and , when the warhead reaches the targeted void or a set depth , detonates the warhead , which then has an explosive and incendiary (...)
The demonstrated applications include :
(1 ) an application to show the degree of brain 's relaxation on the screen of a mobile phone by using a visualizer
( 2 ) an application to show the degree of brain 's tension in chronological order after a user solves about 10 arithmetical problems ( addition , multiplication , etc ) shown on the screen of a mobile phone
(3 ) a game application to move a video game character to an intended place as quickly as possible on the screen of a mobile phone .
The more the degree of brain 's concentration , the more quickly the character moves .
As for ( 1 ) , when a user calms his or her mind on purpose , the curving lines drawn by the visualizer change to various colors .
With regard to ( 2 ) , if an appropriate application is developed , it will be possible to realize a brain training game in which the challenge level changes in real time in accordance with the degree of brain 's tension .
A company called NeuroSky Inc , has built a prototype of a system that reads brain waves and uses them to control a mobile phone !
They held a demonstration at CTIA Wireless IT & Entertainment 2008 in San Francisco last week .

Word to the wise :
It looks like if you update your Wii , the Twilight Princess save data will be deleted if it corrupted by the well - known exploit .
A new update to the Wii system will “ check for and automatically remove such save files ” that are unauthorized save files .
So , it looks like those who wish to update their Wii system will no longer be able to take advantage of the notorious Twilight Princess hack in the future .
Update : “ With this update , you can now move a Mii from the Mii plaza to the Mii parade in the Mii Channel .
To do this , simply pick up a Mii using the A and B buttons and then release it over the Mii Parade icon in the upper right corner of the screen . ”
– Nintendo Wii email
Update 2 : Reports are coming in that the Wii Freeloader no longer works with this new update .
Also , most have been able to use the homebrew channel , but if it was not installed before the update , it still seems that you will be unable to install it after the update .

Researchers at the University of Southern California have made a breakthrough in computer - generated music that involves generating harmonies in a number of specific styles for any melody .
Similar work has been done along these lines but this is the first time the styles of various rock bands have been part of the equation .
Amateur musicians should eventually be able to use similar technology create entire songs using only a vocal melody and an idea of which band – or mix of bands – would sound right playing the accompaniment .
Want a backing track for your " Somewhere Over the Rainbow " cover that sounds like a mix of Radiohead and Green Day ?
Soon , you could be able to click a button and make it so .
Pianist and professor Elaine Chew and Taiwanese rock guitarist and graduate student Ching - Hua Chuan ( pictured to the right ) have been working on " AutomaticStyle Specific Accompaniment " ( ASSA ) at the USC Viterbi School Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering for two years .
So far , they have used the system on the music of Radiohead , Green Day and Keane .
This video compares the original accompaniment in Radiohead 's " Creep " with a version automatically generated by ASSA .
The system does not come up with every note laid down by Thom Yorke , Jonny Greenwood and the others , but 82 percent of the notes in a 54 - note sample were precisely correct .
More importantly , the computer - generated version comes close to the original in overall feel .
" We describe an automatic style specific accompaniment system thatmakessongwriting accessible to both experts and novices ... the systemshould be able to identify the features important to the stylespecified by the user , [ enabling the user to ] ask for harmonizationsimilar to some particular songs , " explained Chew and Chuan in a jointpaper submitted to the International Joint Workshop on ComputationalCreativity in London .
Even better , the system can learn how a specific band tends to dealwith harmony , so humans need not enter parameters to describe a specific band 's harmonic tendencies .
Instead , one must only feed songs by a given band into the system .
In the Radiohead example video linked above , for example , ASSA
listened to only three other Radiohead songs ( " High and Dry , " " Fake PlasticTrees " and " Airbag " ) before figuring out the harmonies for " Creep . "
Ostensibly , this system could be aimed at any song that hasbeen converted into MID , but eventually it could work on audio files aswell , given promising developments in automatic chord analysis .
Here 's how ASSA works ( image to the right ) .
After ascertaining which chord sequences are possiblegiven a melody , the analysis portion of the system determines whichbranches were followed by a particular band on a chord - by - chord basis .
The second , generative part of the process then applies these choicesto the new melody to generate accompaniment consistent with the choicesthe band presumably would have made .
It 's a bit more complicated thanthat , also involving the insertion of checkpoints where the harmony iseasily understood by the system to anchor the generated chordsmore tightly to the melody , but that 's about it .
If all you need is a melody , lyrics and a concept of which band orbands you want your accompaniment to resemble , the bar to songwritingwill be lowered .
People are already recording much moremusic than they used to ; if this system becomes polished , expect thenumber of new songs in circulation to increase even faster .
Who knows , maybe bands will eventually be able to license their harmonic styles to other songwriters and performers .
Chuan and Chew plan to keep developing ASSA .
One of their ideas involves " an end - to - end interactive prototype that will take userhumming input , create the accompaniment , and render it with theappropriate instruments . "
Chuan claims that the processing demands of their system are not too steep and that the average PC should be able to run it .

Congress hopes to pass the $ 700 Billion bailout bill by Friday , according to an article in Bloomberg .
In case you have n’t heard , the bill would not only stick up American taxpayers for an additional $ 700 billion , but would literally give Paulson and the government fascist powers .
Do n’t believe me ?
Well , as the Bloomberg article notes : “ The bill would bar courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority . ”
Bloomberg includes the following quotes by people who understand the significance of the bill :
It sounds like Paulson is asking to be a financial dictator , for a limited period of time , ” said historian John Steele Gordon . . . . ***
The Bush administration seeks “ dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts , to try to resolve the crisis , ” said Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission now at Pepper Hamilton LLP in Washington .
“ We are taking a huge leap of faith . ”
This power grab is so serious that investigative reporter Larisa Alexandrovna calls it “ the final stages of the coup “ .
We have days to stop this bill .
March on Congress .
Educate and motivate everyone around you .
Do everything you can to prevent this disaster before it is too late .

We have security cameras watching our daily habits , we watch voyeuristic TV shows of social misfits trapped in a house , we use webcams to transmit our musings on Youtube and we are constantly being monitored by hi-res satellite cameras .
What can we possibly survey now ?
Surely every inch of the planet is under someone ’s watchful eye ?
This planet maybe .
By a stroke of luck , ESA scientists have just realised that a surplus camera on board the Mars Express orbiter could be switched back on and used as an interplanetary webcam .
Big Brother is now keeping a watchful eye on the Red Planet too …
Back in 2003 , the Visual Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) had one task and one task only : keep a watchful eye over the UK ’s Beagle 2 Mars lander as it separated from Mars Express and began its descent to the planet ’s atmosphere .
This fairly “ normal ” camera was only intended to verify that Beagle 2 had separated and begun on its correct trajectory .
According to the only VMC / Beagle 2 image below , separation went as planned as we see the bright lander disk to the left of the image .
The problems started later on for the lander as something happened to the robot on re-entry .
So , task complete , the VMC was switched off and forgotten about .
After all , who needs a comparatively low - tech , glorified webcam orbiting Mars anyhow ?
Hold on , an orbital webcam is actually pretty cool !
It would appear ESA scientists thought the same thing , pointing out that the VMC is “ an ordinary camera in an extraordinary location . ”
For three years the VMC had been left dormant , until in 2007 the Mars Express Flight Control Team based at ESA ’s European Space Operations Centre ( ESOC ) in Germany began testing the camera to see if it could be powered up again .
The team could n’t be sure if this little camera would even function as it was designed as a single - use instrument and it had been frozen in deep space for years .
But determined to make use of this instrument , the ESOC team were successful at bringing the VMC back online .
For the last few months , scientists have been fine tuning the cameras optics to make it better at observing orbital features , and now this “ ordinary ” camera has been taking some “ extraordinary ” pictures .
Geological features , Mars crescents and the Martian dynamic weather have been captured , making this a great little tool to see Mars from orbit .
Now , the VMC is online and taking pictures of Mars for us to see at home .
What ’s more ESA is inviting us to help with processing the raw images to come from the “ Mars Webcam . ”
For more information , see the ESA VMC page .

Oil company employees are suspected of selling their skills to oil bunkerers
Under cover of night dozens of barges queue up to dock at a jetty in a creek somewhere in Nigeria 's oil - rich Niger Delta .
Their holds are filled with stolen oil running from valves illegally installed into a pipeline .
Full , they chug downstream to meet around 10 larger ships near the oil export terminal in Bonny , Rivers State , where they disgorge their cargo .
By 0500 , in the darkness before dawn , the ships uncouple from the barges and move out in a convoy to sea to rendezvous with a tanker which will spirit away the stolen oil , making it disappear into another cargo , bound for sale on the world market .
It is likely the tanker arrived partly loaded with guns , cocaine to be trafficked into Europe and cash , which they will use to pay for the oil .
Bogus shipping documents make their load - possibly tens of thousands of tons of crude oil - disappear into legitimate markets in Eastern Europe or America .
This is an industry that makes £ 30 m ( $ 60 m ) a day , they 'd kill you , me , anyone , in order to protect it
Analyst close to former government of Olusegun Obasanjo
This , according to activists and former Nigerian government advisers , is the process by which Nigeria is losing billions of dollars every year to oil smuggling .
The illegal " bunkering " , as it is known , makes a huge profit for Nigerian syndicates and rogue international traders .
It leaves in its wake chaos and misery for the people of the Niger Delta .
' Godfathers ' According to Nigeria 's President Umaru Yar 'Adua this is " blood oil " , akin to the trade in " blood diamonds " that fuelled bloody civil wars in West African neighbours Liberia and Sierra Leone .
Gordon Brown promised to help Nigeria tackle the unrest in the Delta He is calling on the international community to help Nigeria end the trade .
Britain has promised military training to improve the Nigerian military Joint Task Force 's ability to police the Delta region .
But a source close to the former government of President Olusegun Obasanjo says the problem is not about quashing militants in boats .
Some of the people who run the cartels are among Nigeria 's top political " godfathers " , who wield massive political influence .
" If the president goes after them , they could destabilise the country , cause a coup , a civil war .
They are that powerful , they could bring the state down , " said the source , who did not want to be identified .
He says that attempts in the past to bring the trade under control were stopped for that reason .
" This is an industry that makes £ 30 m ( $ 60 m ) a day , they 'd kill you , me , anyone , in order to protect it , " he said .
The militant connection
In order to get away with the theft , the bunkering syndicates operate under the cloak of the conflict between militants and oil companies in the Niger Delta .
They need " security " - gangs of armed heavies to protect their cargos - and threaten anyone who tries to interfere .
Barges like this one are filled with crude and then take it to larger ships
They do n't have to look far to find large groups of unemployed youths willing to do what they are told for a little money .
State governments in the Delta armed militias to carry out widespread rigging during the 2003 elections .
But the militiamen say they were abandoned , so they turned to oil theft to fund their activities .
Although they are referred to in the media as " militants " there are few coherent groups .
Most are gangs , led by commanders who are perpetually at war with each other .
These youths protect bunkering ships , force local community leaders to let bunkerers pass and bribe the Nigerian military .
The thieves may also need " the boys " to blow up pipelines , forcing the oil company to shut down the flow , allowing them to install a tap in the pipe .
" Hot - tapping " , as it is known , requires considerable expertise , usually supplied by a former oil company employee .
These militants do n't see the process of oil theft as stealing , observers say .
They believe they are taking what is legitimately theirs from the companies and the government .
They organise themselves in " bunkering turfs " , but outbreaks of violence between them have been frequent and bloody .
' Legal theft '
But militant - assisted theft is not the only way oil is stolen .
According to a source close to the government of former President Olusegun Obasanjo , the heavy military presence in the Delta has led oil bunkerers to find other ways to extract more oil .
ILLEGAL BUNKERING
Oil theft costs Nigeria an estimated $ 5 bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) every year Estimates of how many barrels of oil are stolen range from 70,000 to 500,000 Official estimates are made by subtracting the amount of oil delivered from the amount expected from a well head Nigeria has proven reserves of over 31bn barrels
Its production capacity is 3.2 m barrels per day Its current production rate is 1.9 m bpd Source : Legaloil.com
Simply put , they just load more onto a ship than they are allowed to .
With the connivance of officials from international oil companies , national oil parastatal officials and ships ' captains , oil can be stolen through the legitimate process of lifting oil from the dock to the ship .
One oil company employee told the BBC that his company had discovered a vessel they were using had a secret compartment behind the bridge , where tens of thousands of barrels could be redirected at the flick of a switch while the hold was being filled .
Other ways include almost filling the ship with legitimate oil , then topping it up with oil that has n't been paid for legitimately , according to government sources .
Or a whole ship can be filled with stolen crude using fake documents .
Estimates on how much oil is stolen in this manner vary , but according to the International Maritime Organisation last year it amounted to 80,000 barrels every day .
Part of the problem is that no one can be sure how much oil is being taken out of the ground .
Shipping documents can be forged .
Also ownership of a shipment can be transferred while the vessel is on the high seas , making cargo tracking incredibly difficult .
Possible solution ?
The only way to shut down the oil cartels , observers say , is a tighter regulatory framework .
This would involve electronic bills of how much oil a ship has loaded , which would record if they had been tampered with .
The environmental effects of oil bunkering are disastrous Oil can also be " fingerprinted " .
The technology to distinguish between different types of oil exists already , says Patrick Dele Cole , a former adviser to Mr Obasanjo .
Oil companies do this routinely already , sources say .
All that would be needed is a database of all the different types of Nigerian crude .
The UK has offered to train the military , and President Yar 'Adua wants to form a " maritime academy " naval installation in the Delta .
But activists in the Delta say that increasing the military presence would be counterproductive .
It would increase resentment and militants ' numbers - the level of violence would rise , they say .
And the Nigerian military is part of that violence , observers say .
Soldiers have indiscriminately burned whole towns and killed civilians , according to activists .
The high price of oil today is partly a result of Nigeria 's complex and shadowy world of corruption and violence .
It is into this chaotic shadow world that the UK is about to commit itself .

What are these ?
In 45 years of writing about medicine and health , I ’ve heard more than my share of myths and misinformation , from the merely nonsensical to the downright dangerous .
And until I explored the evidence , I too occasionally fell for a “ fact ” that turned out to be less than met the eye .
Lately a number of medical writers have taken on these commonplaces and old wives ’ tales .
Last year , Anahad O’Connor , who does so every week in his “ Really ? ” column for Science Times , published “ Never Shower in a Thunderstorm : Surprising Facts and Misleading Myths About Our Health and the World We Live In ” ( Times Books ) .
Now , Dr. Nancy L. Snyderman , a surgical oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania and a medical correspondent for NBC News , has a new book , “ Medical Myths That Can Kill You 
And the 101 Truths That Will Save , Extend , and Improve Your Life ” ( Crown ) .
The following myths owe something to both authors , and also to my own research .
How well informed are you ?
Esther ( not her real name ) , 28 , a professional living and working in Zimbabwe 's capital , Harare , is writing a regular diary on the challenges of leading a normal life .
Zimbabwe is suffering from an acute economic crisis .
The country has the world 's highest rate of inflation and just one in five has an official job .
At midnight , my bank stripped me of my trillionaire status - the Z$5 trillion sitting in my account became Z$500 .
Coins are coming back , we have not used those in close to a decade
So no more talk of trillionaires , quandrillionaires and quintillionaires .
At least , not for another six months or so .
People are relieved , while taking 10 zeros off our currency does nothing to address hyper - hyper inflation , at least writing cheques no longer require a maths wiz at your side , telling you if you 've put too many , too little or just enough zeros .
And coins are coming back , we have not used those in close to a decade !
The sad thing is that it is deja vu .
We have been here before .

Last August , the governor of the Reserve Bank knocked off three zeros , and we were paying a few hundred bucks for bread , milk , and transport .
By December , it was hundreds of thousands , then millions in January , and billions by April .
So while we welcome the convenience that 's coming with dealing with smaller figures , the general feeling is that something really has to be done about inflation .
Just last week , bus fares changed three times !
We started the week paying Z$ 50bn , then it was Z$ 70bn , then Z$ 100bn .
Thankfully it stopped there , but that was probably because the Reserve Bank failed to change the daily withdrawal limit in that time , keeping it at Z$ 100bn - just enough for one fare !
I know at least three professionals who failed to go to work at least once in the week because they simply did not have the cash to commute while their trillions were sitting in their accounts .
Rumours abound
Another thing that gives us a feeling of deja vu are the ongoing talks between the ruling Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Some parts of Harare have been without running water for months now A unity accord was signed in 1987 between Zanu and the late nationalist leader Joshua Nkoma 's Zapu party .
Zapu is now but a distant memory in our minds , that unity accord just gobbled it up .
Only the negotiators are so tight lipped ...
I 've never seen a media blackout that works that well !
We do n't know what 's going on with those talks .
That of course means rumours abound - we hear the talks have collapsed because Zanu - PF wants MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai to take a vice president 's post , or because President Robert Mugabe refuses to accept just a ceremonial role .
Most of us have no idea what is going on , we just do not have much faith in the process .
People in some sections of the capital have been without a constant supply of running water for months now .
I know women who wake up in the dead of the night to fill up their water containers and do their laundry because that 's the only time running water is available .
Is a power - sharing deal going to address that , as well as the power shortage , the rampant inflation and the 90 % unemployment ?
Will it depoliticise the security forces ?
So many of us wanted change , not compromise .
How come our voices are not respected ?

To listen to many of the antsy poll - following Democrats gathered here in Colorado , you might think you stumbled into a Dear Abby conference instead of a political convention .
Just about everyone outside of the Obama true believers has a piece of advice for what the change candidate should change about his campaign to regain his mojo and avoid blowing what should be a sure thing .
Do n't ...
Another crisis unfolding in the US , if this is likely to give you sleepless nights and you ponder on whether to sell or hold on to your equity portfolio , here ’s a word of advice .
Stay calm and invested , do n’t panic and sell .
You do n’t incur losses till the time you book them .
Equity markets behave in this fashion and investors should take such falls in their stride .
If you are a long - term investor , you are likely to get the best returns in such turbulent times .
At such low levels , markets look quite attractive .
For investors waiting to venture into the markets , this is an ideal time to average out the cost of purchase .
Invest in stocks that are fundamentally strong , preferably in a broad - based index that gives you exposure to large cap stocks .
Avoid small or mid-cap companies .
But if you lack understanding or do n’t have much information , then take the help of professionals or try the mutual fund way .
To start off , one can look at index funds that mirror the movement of an index .
Index funds should form the nucleus of your equity investments and other funds should surround it .
These funds act as a stabilizing factor in an equity portfolio and should not be always seen as a return - giving factor .
But how about those who are already neck - deep into equities ?
“ Stay invested .
Do n’t change the investment strategy and keep investing in a staggered manner . ”

The global stock markets , after a sustained bull run of almost four years , have behaved erratically since the beginning of this year .
Plagued by global ills , the markets have shed a lot since January this year .
The present situation might look grim to investors , but there is no reason to worry .
Stock markets right now are being driven by sentiments rather than fundamentals .
Markets are largely driven by demand and consumption and the present conditions look good .
MARSEILLE , France 
The bright cafeteria of St. Mauront Catholic School is conspicuously quiet :
It is Ramadan , and 80 percent of the students are Muslim .
When the lunch bell rings , girls and boys stream out past the crucifixes and the large wooden cross in the corridor , heading for Muslim midday prayer .
“ There is respect for our religion here , ” said Nadia Oualane , 14 , a student of Algerian descent who wears her hair hidden under a black head scarf .
“ In the public school , ” she added , gesturing at nearby buildings , “ I would not be allowed to wear a veil . ”
In France , which has only four Muslim schools , some of the country ’s 8,847 Roman Catholic schools have become refuges for Muslims seeking what an overburdened , secularist public sector often lacks : spirituality , an environment in which good manners count alongside mathematics , and higher academic standards .
No national statistics are kept , but Muslim and Catholic educators estimate that Muslim students now make up more than 10 percent of the two million students in Catholic schools .
In ethnically mixed neighborhoods in Marseille and the industrial north , the proportion can be more than half .
Aristotle 's law petition confounds blase Berkeley
Berkeley , the first city to ban Styrofoam and wood - fired pizza ovens , could become the first to enact Aristotle 's ancient law of logic -- that every entity is equal to itself .
In a philosophical effort to come up with a city law that no one could ever break , conceptual artist Jonathon Keats wants Berkeley to legally acknowledge Aristotle 's law , commonly expressed as A=A .
More plainly put , it means a table is a table .
A blade of grass is a blade of grass .
The mayor is the mayor .
Mayor Shirley Dean was dumbfounded .
" I have n't a clue what that means , " Dean said of Keats ' proposition .
Few others did either as Keats tried to get them to sign his sidewalk petition Saturday near the downtown Berkeley BART station .
" Why do you need a law to say that ? " asked one passer - by .
Sweating in a three - piece wool suit , bow tie and penny loafers , Keats explained that a simplistic law challenges society 's notion of what laws are , why they are made , and why we follow them .
It makes perfect sense to Keats , who is the kind of guy who likes to do things like sit in an art gallery for 24 hours and and sell his thoughts to museumgoers .
The San Francisco Arts Commission once paid him to do portraits , and because he can't paint , draw or take good photographs , he took fingerprints instead .
His latest A=A idea , timed to coincide with the annual Berkeley Arts Festival , was a harder sell .
His six - hour effort netted 65 signatures , 42 of which belonged to actual Berkeley residents .
There were many head - shakers , a couple of yellers , and a handful of people who signed just to get away from Keats ' long discourses on tautology -- which is a fancy word for A=A theory .
One guy shouted that Keats needed therapy .
Keats offered to do sidewalk therapy with the man , who stomped away in frustration .
" I see the law I 've proposed as an ( art ) installation , one which has the potential to operate in infinite space while occupying no space , " said the 30 - year - old performance artist , who lives in San Francisco .
" I offer it as a donation to the people of Berkeley , " Keats said .
Michelle Grisat , who has a doctorate in philosophy , signed .
" I think A=A is a basic truism , and it 's interesting to have him out here arguing with people . "
Keats plans to present his petition to the City Council when it reconvenes in September .
He wants the council to place the proposal on the November ballot for a vote .
Although his law can't be broken , a misdemeanor fine of up to one - tenth of a cent would be imposed on anyone or anything caught being unidentical to itself within city limits .
" All laws have rules , so mine needs them , too , " he said .
Myrna Sokolinksy listened , trying to bend her brain around his logic .
" It 's silly , but I 'll sign anyway , " she said .
She signed , she said , because she was spending her day outside in the lovely Saturday weather , and she simply wants to have a good time without confrontations .
As with any philosophical question , A=A is already generating scholarly debate .
The proposed law has been vetted by Yale philosophy scholar Matthew D. Walker , and noted Amherst College logician Alexander George has praised A=A as " the simplest of identity 's properties . "
But a philosophy professor at UC Berkeley is n't even sure A=A is the brainchild of Aristotle .
" It 's a bit of a stretch to attribute it to Aristotle , " said John MacFarlane .
MacFarlane also took issue with Point C in the proposed law which defines identical as " exactly alike . "
He said two people could be wearing shirts that are " exactly alike " but not identical .
" A does not equal A , and I can prove it ! " shouted Elliot Clayton , who rushed to Keats ' card table .
" Look at your own petition !
There 's a capital A and a small case a , all throughout it .
See ?
A is sometimes a , not A . "
GERMANS & RUSSIANS USED FLUORIDE TO MAKE PRISONERS 'STUPID & DOCILE
By : Devvy May 14 , 2005 NewsWithViews.com
" To whom it may concern : I , Oliver Kenneth Goff , was a member of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League from May 2 , 1936 to October 9 , 1939 .
During this period of time , I operated under the alias of John Keats and the number 18 - B - 2 .
My testimony before the Government is incorporated in Volume 9 of the Un- American Activities Report for the year 1939 .
" While a member of the Communist Party , I attended Communist underground training schools outside the City of New York in the Bues Hall and 113 East Wells Street , Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
The East Wells Street School operated under the name of the Eugene Debs School .
Here , under the tutoring of Eugene Dennis , M. Sparks , Morris Chyilds , Jack Kling and others , we were schooled in the art of revolutionary overthrow of the established Government .
" We discussed quite thoroughly the fluoridation of water supplies and how we were using it in Russia as a tranquilizer in the prison camps .
The leaders of our school felt that if it could be induced into the American water supply , it would bring about a spirit of lethargy in the nation ; where it would keep the general public docile during a steady encroachment of Communism .
We also discussed the fact that keeping a store of deadly fluoride near the water reservoir would be advantageous during the time of the revolution , as it would give us opportunity to dump this poison into the water supply and either kill off the populace or threaten them with liquidation , so that they would surrender to obtain fresh water .
" We discussed in these schools , the complete art of revolution : the seizure of the main utilities , such as light , power , gas and water , but it was felt by the leadership that if a program of fluoridating the water could be carried out in the nation , it would go a long way toward the advancement of the revolution . "
Oliver Kenneth Goff , 1957 Matrix III - Volume Two - Use of Sodium Fluoride for Population Behavior Control
" It is a matter of record that sodium fluoride has been used for behavior control of populations .
In an " Address in reply to the Governor 's Speech to Parliament , " [ Victorian Hanstard , August 12 , 1987 , Nexus , Aug / Sept 1995 ] , Mr. Harley Rivers Dickinson , Liberal Party Member of the Victorian Parliament for South Barwon , Australia , made a statement on the historical use of fluorides for behavior control .
" Mr. Dickinson reveals that , " At the end of the Second World War , the United States Government sent Charles Elliot Perkins , a research worker in chemistry , biochemistry , physiology and pathology , to take charge of the vast Farven chemical plants in Germany .
While there , he was told by German chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the German General Staff .
This scheme was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water .
In this scheme , sodium fluoride will in time reduce an individual 's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain , and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him .
Both the Germans and the Russians added fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile . "
" According to Chemical Engineering News in 1988 , each year in the United States , 80,000 tons of hydrofluosilicic acid , 60,000 tons of sodium silicofluoride and 3,000 tons of sodium fluorides are put into public water supplies ( Chemical Engineering News , Vol 66 , August 1 , 1988 , pg. 39 ) .
In view of all known research , it would be safe and accurate to rephrase the previous sentence and say that each year the United States Government allows 143,000 tons of fluoride products to be added to public water supplies in order to numb , disempower , and render docile a large percentage of the population .
Present estimates in 1995 run about 200,000 tons annually .
Now , why on earth would any oligarchic group ( a small group ) want to do this to tens of millions of people , deliberately and knowingly ?
" All of these fluoride chemicals are byproducts of the aluminum and chemical fertilization industries that are considered to be hazardous wastes by the EPA , says the scientific assessment of the health risks of fluorides in 1985 " omits 90 % of the literature which suggests fluoride is a mutagen - causes cellular and genetic mutation . "
( Water Fluoridation : A Case of Truth Decay ) .
Several scientists in the United States and other countries have done research or written reports questioning the benefits of water fluoridation or suggesting health risks , were discouraged by their employers from actually publishing their findings . "
Anyone who questions the use of fluoride in the drinking water is labeled a nut case .
Fluoride helps prevent tooth decay !
I have been drinking bottled water for 30 years .
In 1991 , I woke up and besides researching the " Federal " Reserve , the IRS , the UN and other one world government mechanisms , I also began looking at the fluoride issue .
In 1993 , I had all the metal fillings removed from my teeth and my daughter's .
These metal fillings were replaced with gold ; a very expensive undertaking .
We also stopped using any products with fluoride , i.e. toothpaste , mouthwash and any application from our dentist .
The difference in our dental health changed dramatically .
My mother , her brother and my grandparents ( from Sicily ) never used toothpaste in their lifetime , they used baking soda .
Same as my father 's side of the family who came over from Munich .
Both sets of grandparents died with all their teeth and never had gum disease .
My mom and my uncle both have their own teeth , no bridges , no root canals , no gum disease .
To this day , they use baking soda .
They live in areas where the water has never been fluoridated .
My four brothers and sisters have all had gum disease to some degree and huge problems with their teeth .
They all use products with fluoride , all have metal fillings and two of them still drink tap water .
I find these differences interesting .
Some may think it 's just a bunch of conspiracy fodder , but having read thousands of pages from hundreds of documents , both historical and from research , there 's no doubt in my mind that fluoride is deadly and explains much about why Americans are so apathetic and lethargic about the very real dangers crushing our Republic .
The American people simply have no will to resist and you can see it all across this country .
Fluoride was introduced into the drinking water in this country around 1954 .
Think about it .
Add into the mix the millions of gallons of diet soda pop consumed by Americans every day , ingesting deadly aspartame , also contained in more than 5,000 food products being eaten everyday , along with Splenda to " sweeten " and what you have is a population loading their bodies with deadly poisons .
See the video ' Sweet Misery '
While I have n't drank more than a half dozen cans of soda in my entire life , I did use toothpaste and mouthwash which contains fluoride until 1993 when I made major changes .
Everyday I thank God for my good health , but I also have worked very hard at staying healthy and keeping my weight within seven pounds from the day I graduated from high school .
It 's not easy , but it all boils down to will power , self control and a desire not to be a burden to myself or my family in my later years .
Education is everything .
Research means giving up your fun times to thoroughly explore an issue .
I have taken the time to scan several documents which contain thoroughly researched documentation and data on fluoride .
Dentists all across this country will tell you that fluoride is good for your teeth and gums .
City fathers will continue to tell you fluoridating the drinking water is good for you .
Most of them refuse to even look at all the scientific research that 's available .
Thousands of cities across this country fluoridate their water .
Conversely , hundreds of of cities in the U.S. refuse to fluoridate their water and dozens of countries refuse to poison their citizenry by fluoridating their water supply .
For the sake of your health and your family , I urge you to take the time to read all this important , fully documented research .
You will see the major players and recognize names and companies ( like Alcoa ) who have been involved in this fluoride scam for decades .
Americans deserve the truth and they deserve accurate information so they can make informed choices .
Also , read the book The Fluoride Deception .
Click here to my Reading Room and you will see the section on fluoride .
Read on - line or print out the 73 pages and share it with others .
Friendly advice : keep your body free of toxic poisons - no matter how " good " you think it tastes .
In my humble opinion , if the FDA says it 's okay , that 's the product to keep out of your body .
Go natural !

BALTIMORE – Manny Ramirez kept saying ‘ Do n’t worry about it !’
Well , no need to ask the question again .
Ramirez has sent this large Red Sox crowd here at Camden Yards into a frenzy by stroking his 500th homer in the seventh inning .
The home run came on the first pitch from submariner Chad Bradford , a former Red Sox teammate , who watched the ball land several rows up the right - center field bleachers .
Ramirez did not cheat himself .
In fact , it was a patented Ramirez homer , struck solidly to the right side , as so many of his blasts have been through his career .
The homer was estimated at 410 feet .
It was his 10th of the season .

It also gave the Sox a 5 - 3 lead .
Ramirez ran around the bases at a swift pace with his head down .
When he got to home he jumped on the plate and hugged on - deck hitter Mike Lowell .
Then he proceeded to hug and jump up and down with David Ortiz and Julio Lugo before going through the rest of the team .
Ramirez received another loud ovation as he took the field for the bottom of the seventh .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Women would rather carpool or go on vacation with Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama than with his Republican rival John McCain , a new poll of U.S. women voters showed on Tuesday .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) greets supporters after a speech at the Victory Column in Tiergarten Park in Berlin July 24 , 2008 .

The poll showed Obama holds a strong lead among all women voters but McCain polls better with white women , seniors and stay - at - home moms .
“ There ’s no question that Senator Obama wins the likability contest , ” said pollster Kellyanne Conway , adding that those who like Obama cited his personal attributes , while those who like McCain cited his experience and qualifications .
The poll , commissioned by Lifetime Network as part of its “ Every Woman Counts ” campaign to engage women in politics , showed Obama leading McCain by 49 percent to 38 percent .
“ The race for women is not decided yet , ” said pollster Celinda Lake , noting that 10 percent were undecided .
Asked who they would prefer to carpool with , 51 percent said Obama and 31 percent picked McCain .
Asked if they would rather go on a summer vacation with the Obama family or the McCain family , 49 percent picked the Obamas and 26 percent the McCains .
Eighteen percent said neither .
Asked who they planned to vote for in November , Obama led in all age groups except the over - 65s , where McCain led by 46 percent to 37 percent .
Women were split on racial lines , with blacks picking Obama by 89 percent to 4 percent and Hispanics by 62 percent to 21 percent .
White women favored McCain by 47 percent to 38 percent .
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , led among professionals , white collar and blue collar workers , part time workers and retired women .
The only occupation category where McCain led was “ stay home , ” 51 percent to 34 percent .
Both candidates have been competing for supporters of New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton who may be angry or disappointed at her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Asked who they voted for in the primary elections or caucus , 29 percent said they voted for Obama , 15 percent for McCain and 21 percent for Clinton , who would have been the first woman president of the United States .
Of those who voted for Clinton , 76 percent said they would vote for Obama while 18 percent would vote for McCain .
Asked when they expect a woman to be elected president , 44 percent said it could happen within eight years .
Three in 10 said they still believe Clinton will be the first female U.S. president , even though she lost the nomination this year .
The national poll of 500 women was conducted on July 25 - 29 and the margin of error was 4.4 percent .

Getting sucked into television marathons happens more than I 'd like to admit .
America 's Next Top Model will suck me in every time if I do n't have a really good reason to be pulled away from the T.V .
But a couple of weekends ago , I had so many marathons to choose from I did n't know what to do with myself .
I ended up watching bits and pieces of What Not to Wear , The Twilight Zone , Most Evil and something on the History Channel about Depression - era gangsters .
I know !
I should have been outside .
But in my defense , it was a very nasty , humid weekend .
At least a couple of the shows were educational - I found the gangsters documentary oddly fascinating , and thought that you guys would too .
Here 's what I learned : America was kind of in love with many of the gangsters of the era – times were really rough and they viewed the robbers as sticking it to the Man.
Bonnie and Clyde were no exception .
They were an unlikely duo , really .
Bonnie was an honor roll student who won literary arts contests .
Clyde , on the other hand , had a history of running from police , cracking safes and stealing cars .
How the mismatched pair met is n't totally clear .
Legend says she was a waitress and Clyde met her at the diner ; another story says Bonnie was staying with a friend when Clyde dropped by the friend 's house .
Some more factoids :• Interviews with the surviving gang members imply Bonnie never fired a gun . •
The gang killed a total of 13 people , including nine police officers . •
Bonnie and Clyde finally met their match on May 23 , 1934 , when six police officers ambushed them and shot about 130 rounds into the car . •
John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd reportedly sent flowers to the funeral home . •
When the movie Bonnie and Clyde was made , Warren Beatty consulted Blanche Barrow ( Clyde 's sister - in - law and a member of the gang ) and eventually became good friends with her .
She felt that she was portrayed as " a screaming horse 's ass " in the movie . •
Clyde may have sent a letter to the Ford Motor Company thanking them for making such a " dandy car " .
They used it in advertisements , but it was never authenticated .
Snopes classifies it as " undetermined " .
Dillinger outlasted Bonnie and Clyde by about two months – he met his maker on July 22 , 1934 .
He was another criminal who somehow got the reputation for being a modern - day Robin Hood .
He was arrested for robbing a grocer in Mooresville , Indiana , and served eight - and - a - half years in prison .
He took advantage of the situation to learn all he could from the men incarcerated there and began planning his robberies .
When he was released in 1934 , he robbed a bank almost immediately .
His legendary reign was actually pretty short – from September , 1933 until his death in July , 1934 .
During this time he and his gang killed three men , wounded seven , stole about $ 5 million ( adjusted for inflation ) and executed three jail breaks .
More dirt on Dillinger : • Dillinger enlisted in the Navy but deserted after only a few months . •
He was quite creative in his methods – one of his most famous exploits was pretending to be a sales rep for a company selling bank alarm systems and waltzed right into the vault .
Another time , he and his gang pretended to be a film crew scouting out locations for a bank robbery scene . •
He once escaped from jail by carving a fake gun out of soap or wood and blackening it with shoe polish . •
On his last day alive , he saw a gangster flick , Manhattan Melodrama , at the Biograph Theater in Chicago .
On the way out of the theater , Dillinger was shot three times by FBI agents who had been tipped off by Anna Sage , one of the ladies accompanying him to the theater . •
Much like Elvis and Andy Kaufman , some people think Dillinger faked his death and lived a fruitful life long after his body double was put on ice .
The corpse apparently had brown eyes whereas Dillinger supposedly had grey ; the body showed signs of a childhood illness that Dillinger never had and also showed a heart condition that the extremely active gangster probably would n't have had .
However , the body was identified by Dillinger 's sister , who said she knew it was him from a scar on his leg that he had gotten as a kid .
Hmm . •
There is an urban legend that John Dillinger 's penis is at the Smithsonian .
Snopes says no way .•
Other rumors have Dillinger sending J. Edgar Hoover , who was obsessed with nabbing him , Christmas cards and collect phone calls .
After his death , Hoover kept a mini-museum of Dillinger artifacts , including the glasses , hat , gun and pocket change he had on him when he died .
For a little guy ( he was only 5 ' 3 " ) with a sweet face , Baby Face Nelson sure was tough .
His real name was Lester M. Gillis and he hated his childish nickname .
By his early teens , he already had a reputation as a car thief .
But things would get much worse : • Baby Face worked for Al Capone for a while , but had to be let go because Capone could n't control him . •
He was definitely not one of the feel - good gangsters like Bonnie and Clyde and John Dillinger .
He had no qualms about shooting innocent bystanders .
He killed at least 12 police officers . •
He often hauled his wife and kids along with him when on the lam . •
After Dillinger died , Baby Face was Public Enemy Number One . •
He actively " hunted " police and feds .
He kept a list of license plates and chased down cars when he recognized the plates .
This was how he met his end – after chasing down one such vehicle on November 17 , 1934 , he was shot 17 times .
He made it back to the car after being shot but died shortly thereafter .
His wife wrapped him up in a blanket and left him in a ditch in front of St. Peter Catholic Cemetery in Skokie , Illinois .
When Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson got together , I bet one of the conversation topic was nicknames .
They both loathed their monikers with a passion .
Charles Arthur Floyd was a pretty typical guy from Adairsville , Georgia .
He got married at the age of 17 and most reports say he got into the lift of crime because he needed to pay the bills .
His first known robbery was $ 3.50 in pennies from a local post office in 1922 .
Here are the details about the rest of his exploits : •
After his first stint in prison for a payroll robbery , he vowed he would never see the inside of a prison again . •
He would hide out near his hometown because the locals protected him from the law .
Some say it 's because they hated the banks , which were foreclosing on their farms .
Others say he bribed them .
Either way , the method worked . • 1934 was a bad year for gangsters .
On October 18th of that year , Pretty Boy and his gang hit a telephone pole while driving in a heavy fog .
The car would n't run after that .
The gang sent their girls into town to get a wrecker and waited in a ditch for them to return , but not before they were spotted .
The police were informed that a couple of suspicious men in suits were lying in a ditch .
Ultimately , there was a shootout and Pretty Boy fled into the woods .
He was able to hide out for a few days by eating fruit and traveling on foot , but on October 22nd he was spotted hitching a ride and was shot multiple times . •
When he realized he was shot , he supposedly said , " I 'm done for ; you 've hit me twice . " •
Somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 people attended his funeral .•
You can see Pretty Boy 's death mask in East Liverpool , Ohio .
It 's hanging over the washer and dryer at the Sturgis House Bed and Breakfast .
Sturgis House used to be the Sturgis Funeral Home , and the basement that houses the washer and dryer used to be the morgue where Pretty Boy was embalmed .
No one would have suspected that George Kelly Barnes would have turned to a live of crime – he was born into a very wealthy family from Memphis and had a quiet , " normal " childhood .
He even went to Mississippi State University in 1917 for agriculture .
But this is where things went awry .
He flunked out , so his dad stopped giving him money .
Kelly became a bootlegger and had some encounters with the local police , so he moved and changed his name to George R. Kelly .
His first arrest was in Tulsa , Oklahoma , for smuggling liquor onto an Indian Reservation and things went downhill from there : •
He served time in Leavenworth Penitentiary for his first arrest but was released on good behavior . •
His second wife , Kathryn Thorne , is the one who bought Kelly his first machine gun and possibly gave him the Machine Gun nickname . •
His undoing was when he and his gang kidnapped Charles Urschel , a rich man living in Oklahoma City .
The gang demanded $ 200,000 in ransom and released Urschel when they received it .
Urschel was able to help police locate one of Machine Gun Kelly 's accomplices and eventually they found Kelly himself . •
Machine Gun Kelly accidentally peed on a police officer when he was arrested for the kidnapping . •
He served as an altar boy at the chapel at Alcatraz when he was incarcerated there .
He also received the nickname " Pop Gun Kelly " because he was n't nearly as tough as he was made out to be . •
He died at Leavenworth on July 18 , 1954 , at the age of 59 .
Finally , no list of Prohibition Era gangsters is complete without Alphonse Capone .
He was one of nine Capone kids , so it probably was n't too hard for him to escape attention and get into mischief .
He was born in Brooklyn and lived in Canada briefly before the Capones moved back to Brooklyn , this time to the Park Slope area .
He left school at 14 because he punched a teacher , which was the first of many indiscretions : • Capone was a member of a number of gangs in his youth , including the Junior Forty Thieves , the Five Points Juniors and then the Five Points Gang . •
As a bouncer at a Brooklyn club , he got in a fight with a man who slashed his face three times , giving him the scars that would earn him his Scarface nickname .
He later hired the guy as a bodyguard . •
His friends called him " Snorky " . •
His retreats and hideouts included Brookfield , Wisconsin ; Saint Paul , Minnesota ; Olean , New York ; Terre Haute , Indiana ; Dubuque , Iowa ; Hot Springs , Arkansas ; Johnson City , Tennessee ; Lansing , Michigan ; and Palm Island , Florida .
Tunnels found under the city of Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , are said to have been another hideout of Capone's . •
After his Valentine 's Day Massacre failed to kill rival Bugs Moran , Capone had himself put in prison in Philadelphia for a year to avoid any of Moran 's assassination attempts .
This was smart of him , because on the anniversary of the Massacre , one of the men involved was gunned down at a bowling alley and two others disappeared . •
Capone was famously brought down for tax evasion , not bootlegging or murders or any of his other numerous crimes .
He received 11 years in federal prison , one year in the county jail and six months •
In Chicago , he was one of the first to shake Charles Lindbergh 's hand after his successful transatlantic flight . •
He tried to position himself as a community leader and opened up soup kitchens after the Great Depression .
He also set up a program to provide milk daily for Chicago kids in school .
He would also buy large blocks of tickets when circuses and rodeos were in town and distribute them to kids from low - income areas of town . •
He could often be found watching White Sox and Cubs games from box seats , giving autographs to baseball players . •
He was stabbed in the back in prison by James Lucas , a bank robber from Texas .
He spent a week in the hospital recovering .
This was just one of multiple murder attempts – others included lye in his coffee and an attack as he went to the dentist . •
He died of cardiac arrest ( from complications of syphilis ) on January 25 , 1947 .
3 motherboards set on side and 9 of them on a circle .
Heat pipes to a complete side in copper .
One heat pipe to every warm chip .
Titled on an upward angle for proper gas - condensation inside heat pipe .
Three very warm sides .
6 levels of 9 motherboards with each 4 graphic cards = 216 graphic cards , and if every cards have 2 TFLOPS , this is 432 TFLOPS .
We need 3 if these towers to break the world record ....
... but why just 3 when we can use 10 :)
Copper sides face each other .
This will be a very hot place .
Here cooling water pipe is places .
The cooling water will get warmer higher up , so a small circulation system is needed to distribute the heat evenly .
This will be a completely quiet system .
All that you can hear is the water in the pipes .
It 'll use about 400 000W , and cost $ 900 000 .
4 PFLOPS easy :)

The First F / A - 22 Delivering to Langley AFB
These are Great In - flight Photos of the F / A - 22 as the first Aircraft Delivery was being made on April 27 , 2001 to Langley AFB in VA .
Langley was the first Operational AFB for the F / A - 22 .
It is a very Beautiful AFB , located in a picturesque location , as you can see in these photos , near Norfolk and Hampton , Va .
The Aircraft flying along with the F / A - 22 in the last photo is the F - 15 , which will be replaced by the F / A - 22 which is several times better than the F - 15 .
In Actual In - flight ( simulated ) Combat Operations against the F - 15 , two F / A - 22's were able to operate without detection while it went Head to Head against ( 8 ) F - 15's .
The F / A - 22's scored Missile Hits ( Kills ) against all the F - 15 Aircraft and the F / A - 22's were never Detected by either the F - 15's or Ground Based Radar .
Maj . Gen. Rick Lewis said : " The Raptor Operated Against All Adversaries with Virtual Impunity ; Ground Based Systems Could n't Engage and NO Adversary Aircraft Survived " !!!

Rare Syndrome Causes Woman to Speak With a Foreign Accent Canadian woman develops rare case of foreign accent syndrome after stroke .
July 10 , 2008  -- Rosemarie
Dore did n't feel as if anything was wrong that Thursday morning .
She took a shower , got dressed and headed off to the coffee and doughnut shop at which she worked .
But once she was at work , Dore felt weak , confused -- and she was acting a little funny .
" My girlfriend said I was playing with my hair , and I never do that kind of thing , " said Dore , a 52 - year - old Canadian resident of Hamilton , on the western shores of Lake Ontario .
Despite never feeling entirely awful , she chose to go to Hamilton General Hospital .
It turned out that Dore had had a stroke on the left side of her brain ; she would end up spending the entire summer and some of the fall of 2006 in stroke care .
Other stroke patients have similar stories , but what 's unusual about Dore 's case is what happened to her speech during her recovery -- she started to speak in a distinctively eastern Canadian accent .
But Dore has never been to the Maritime region and does not know anyone from that part of the country .
Health care workers who met with Dore after the stroke assumed she was from Canada 's east coast .
" [ There was a ] nurse that was from Newfoundland , " Dore told ABC News .
" She comes down the hall , and she come into the room and she says , ' Who 's the Newfie here ? ' " referring to Newfoundland .
" I said , ' There 's nobody here like that . ' "
" And she said , ' I think I 'm talking to her . ' "
Dore was n't trying to speak with anything other than her native southern Ontario accent , but she could n't help it .
And she could hear the difference in her speech -- almost as if the words were coming from someone else .
" My kids , they were all teasing me , " said Dore .
" They say I really make the ' O ' sound . "
Foreign Accent Syndrome
Doctors diagnosed
Dore with foreign accent syndrome -- a very literal description for a rare speech condition that can happen after a brain injury , usually after a stroke .
Researchers who 've studied the syndrome estimate there are only as many as 60 legitimate recorded cases .
One of the first known patients was reported after World War II by Norwegian neurologist Georg Herman Monrad - Krohn .
He described a Norwegian woman who was hit on the head by a bomb fragment during the war and began to speak with a German - like accent .
Due to her speech , she became the target of anti-German sentiment .
More recent cases include a Florida woman speaking with a British accent , a Japanese woman sounding to other Japanese as if she were Korean , and a South Carolina man developing a French - like accent .
" I have only seen a couple of people with [ foreign accent syndrome ] ... and I 've seen a lot of stroke patients in my time , " said Dr. Julius Fridriksson , an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of South Carolina who worked with the South Carolina patient .
While the seemingly instant change in dialect appears to be some magical transformation , to Fridriksson it 's straightforward science .
" These folks have brain damage that alters the way the neurological system works , " said Fridriksson .
It just so happens that the new way in which these recovering stroke victims speak sounds like a foreign accent .
And not everyone hears the same accent .
" Foreign accent syndrome is a speech disorder that is completely in the ear of the listener , " said Fridriksson .
" So , people from different backgrounds will hear different accents . "
This and ' Dat '
When researchers closely examined Dore , they noted -- with the help of family members -- that the overall pacing of her speech had slowed down and she pronounced vowels differently than before the stroke .
Researchers took acoustic measurements of Dore 's vowel sounds and found they compared closely but not exactly to the vowel sounds made by East Coast Canadians .
" It 's not exactly a true accent , " said Dr. Karin Humphreys , one of the researchers who worked with Dore and reported the case in the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences .
Humphreys likens
Dore 's new foreign accent to a trained musician playing an instrument a little out of tune .
" We 're all virtuosos at speaking , " said Humphreys .
" If you do just a slight detuning ... it 's going to shift the system around . "
Humphreys , an assistant professor of psychology , neuroscience and behavior at McMaster University in Ontario , noted other linguistic differences as well : " The consonants changed , so she was [ saying ] ' dat ' and ' dis ' instead of ' that ' and ' this . "
What was especially interesting to researchers was that Dore still made the " th " sound on occasion , so she was clearly capable of doing so .
This indicated to Humphreys that the change with Dore 's speech was n't caused by a malfunction with the muscles that moved her mouth and tongue .
Instead , the problem existed in how her brain was instructing those muscles to act .
The Brain of the Matter
Still , the exact cause of foreign accent syndrome is not clear .
Humphreys said the stroke probably affected Dore 's basal ganglia -- an area deep in the brain that 's involved in controlling movements .
Previous research has linked the basal ganglia to speech problems such as stuttering .
" That 's what we think is the most important thing going on here , " said Humphreys .
" This makes sense .
It 's all part of the speech motor circuit . "
Fridriksson 's patient also had brain damage in the basal ganglia .
And in addition to providing a window into how the brain plans speech , the syndrome also allows researchers to examine how the brain recovers after a stroke .
" When you have very small brain damage , the rest of the brain can sort of compensate in the long run and help you get better , " said Fridriksson , whose patient in South Carolina eventually lost his French accent .
Now two years after the stroke , Rosemarie Dore still has trouble walking and can't use her right hand .
The accent is still there , though she does n't notice it anymore .
In some ways , it 's the least of her concerns these days : " There are some people that ca n't talk at all [ after a stroke ] .
I talk , but it 's different . "
The Russian Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to recognise the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions , while President Dmitry Medvedev linked the Georgia conflict to tensions over another separatist region .
Both houses of Russia 's Parliament convened for emergency sessions to consider their stance on the future status of the two disputed regions in Georgia .
With Russian troops still inside Georgia and tensions heightened by the arrival in a Georgian port of a US warship carrying aid , Russia 's two Parliament chambers approved a resolution calling on Mr Medvedev formally to recognise the two regions .
Only the president can officially recognise a foreign state and so far , there has been no response to the vote from the Kremlin .
The Duma and Federation Council held special sessions to debate the region 's calls for recognition .
The two regions are internationally recognised as part of Georgia , where Russian troops rolled in on August 8 to fight off a Georgian offensive to retake South Ossetia .
' Genocide '
Addressing the Federation Council , South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity said Russia had saved his region from " genocide " .
He asserted there was more political and legal legitimacy to recognising South Ossetia 's independence than there had been for Kosovo , the Serbian province which broke free with EU and US backing .
The Abkhaz separatist leader , Sergei Bagapsh , said : " Neither Abkhazia nor South Ossetia will ever again live in one state with Georgia " .
The European Union , which has criticised Russia 's military intervention , called a special summit on the Georgia crisis .
Many European nations expressed concern at the Russian Parliament vote to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent .
The Russian President has signalled his support for independence and he has mentioned the South Ossetia case when he said a dispute with Moldova over the Transdniestr region could be settled .
" It 's reasonable to discuss already today the Transdniestr problem .
I see good chances for solving it , " Mr Medvedev told Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin at a meeting at the Russian leader 's Black Sea coastal residence at Sochi .
He said Transdniestr , which lies on Moldova 's eastern edge adjoining Ukraine , should be viewed in the context of the battle with Georgia .
Events in South Ossetia showed " how dangerous such so - called frozen conflicts can be , given that the Georgian leadership , as they say , went crazy , " Mr Medvedev said , quoted by Interfax news agency .
" This is a serious warning for us all .
It is in this context that we should view the question of Transdniestr resolution , " the Russian leader said .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Russia 's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia would be " an attempt to change Europe 's borders by force , " in an interview with French newspaper Liberation .
Meanwhile , the United States has announced that its Vice President , Dick Cheney , will travel to Georgia next week .
President George W Bush has also asked Mr Cheney to head to Ukraine and Azerbaijan for what the White House says will be discussions with key partners on issues of mutual interest .
Mr Cheney will be the most senior US official to visit the region since Russian troops crossed into Georgia more than two weeks ago .

How health chiefs plan to put fluoride in half our water supply to halt tooth decay
Nearly half our drinking water could have fluoride added to it under a ' secret ' Government plan .
Dental health chiefs want to add the chemical to 40 per cent of England 's water supply to combat high levels of tooth decay .
But critics said the ' mass medication ' of water without the population 's consent was an invasion of their human rights .
Concerns : Fluoride has been linked to a range of diseases
They also accused dentists of being in denial about the dangers of fluoride , which has been linked to diseases including brittle bones and cancer .
Dental experts , however , said there is overwhelming evidence that adding fluoride to water helps reduce tooth decay , with children the biggest beneficiaries .
Fluoride , which is tasteless and odourless , occurs naturally but is also found in drinking water supplies - usually at levels too low to affect dental health .
At present , only 10 per cent of tap water has fluoride added - in the West Midlands and the North East .
Although plans to add the chemical to more of the nation 's water supply were first announced by Health Secretary Alan Johnson in February , the scale of the Government 's intentions has remained under wraps until now .
In an interview with Dental Tribune magazine , chief dental officer Barry Cockcroft said : ' We only need to fluoridate 40 per cent of the country .
Greater Manchester is currently considering it and there are many other areas that are looking at it . '
But he dismissed the ' scaremongering that says it causes cancer ' .
' A total of 170 million people in America drink fluoridated water and it is the most litigious country in the world , ' he said .
But Peter Mansfield , a Lincolnshire - based GP and expert on the effects of fluoride , said : ' It does work a little bit , but nothing like as much as dentists say it does , and it causes as much damage as it does good .
' You are robbing Peter to pay Paul .
It is a very flawed science . '
Caroline Lucas , of the Green Party , said the European Convention on Human Rights states individuals have the right not to be medicated without their consent .
The party is taking legal advice on a possible challenge .
She said : ' Putting fluoride in everyone 's water amounts to mass medication , which would contravene human rights and medical ethics . '
The Government , which has earmarked £ 42 million to pay for the scheme , has agreed to pick up the costs of any legal claims .
The Department of Health said water companies would only start fluoridating water following consultation with local people .
Overall this is definitely an interesting read , and useful to anyone who has ever yelled " FSCKing LEGACY code ! "
It will be most useful to someone who already has some appreciation for TDD and wants to use it to ' pay down the technical debt ' in a legacy code project .
In my opinion adding unit tests ( a sort of retroactive TDD ) is the best ... err ... most effective approach for getting a legacy code project into a more malleable state .
One caveat is that most of the book is focused on working with object oriented programming languages .
There is some coverage of techniques for procedural languages ( mainly C ) , but this is not the main focus of the book .
In a way this is unfortunate , since there is a lot of really useful C code out there gathering dust .
But in the book he states that " the number of things you can do to introduce unit tests in procedural languages is pretty small . "
Unfortunately I would have to agree with him on this point .
One of the greatest things about this book is that it is written by someone who has worked with a lot of legacy code , and there are numerous real world anecdotes sprinkled throughout the text that really serve to help drive the points home .
The code examples are plentiful , but not verbose .
They all look like real code you might find lurking in a dark corner at work , not some fanciful made up snippet .
The high level goal of the book is show you how to write good unit tests for code that was n't designed with unit tests in mind .
The first step for writing unit tests is getting individual classes or functions into a test harness where you can apply known inputs , and check the outputs or behavior .
To do this you need to break dependencies in the original code .
The bulk of the book is dedicated to looking at different approaches to breaking dependencies .
Much of the book is organized like a FAQ .
There are chapter titles like : " I Need to Make a Change .
What Methods Should I Test ? " and " My Project Is Not Object Oriented .
How Do I Make Safe Changes ? " .
This organization makes the book work a bit better as reference than as learning material .
After the first few chapters there is very little flow to the book .
Each chapter tends to stand as an independent look into a particular problem common in legacy code .
As a result , you can read the table of contents and usually skip to a self - contained chapter that will help with the problem at hand .
The final chapter of the book is a listing of all the refactoring techniques used throughout the rest of book .
So if you have a particular dependency - breaking technique in mind , you can skip straight to the description of the technique you want to use .
This can be quite helpful when you need to perform a refactoring before you can get your code into a test harness .
The descriptions are straightforward and provide a little checklist at the end that will help you make sure you did n't miss anything .
In conclusion I would definitely recommend this book to a colleague who is trying to introduce unit tests into code that was not designed with testing in mind .
In fact I have already lent the book to several people at work , most of whom have bought their own copy .
You can purchase Working Effectively with Legacy Code from amazon.com .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Supporters of Barack Obama for president have views about the nation 's economy that differ strongly from those of John McCain supporters , with Obama 's supporters describing it in much more grave terms .
According to a Sept. 15-16 USA
Today / Gallup poll , most Obama voters ( 73 % ) , contrasted with less than half of McCain voters ( 45 % ) , believe the economy is in either a " recession " or a " depression . "
In sync with McCain 's often - stated view that the fundamentals of the economy are strong , voters who plan to back McCain in November are more likely to think the economy is at worst slowing down .
A combined 53 % of McCain supporters say the economy is either slowing down or , in fact , growing .
Only a quarter of Obama 's voters ( 26 % ) agree .
These voter differences in economic perceptions are similar to those seen between Republicans and Democrats , more broadly .
Importantly , political independents ( who represent the swing voting group potentially most influenced by the candidates ' stances on the issue ) are much more similar to Democrats than to Republicans on this question .
As a result , a majority of Americans overall -- 61 % -- now believe the U.S. economy is experiencing either a recession or a depression , up from 45 % holding one of these views in January .
Few Americans surveyed at either point have said the economy is growing , but in January the slight majority ( 53 % ) said it was either growing or slowing down .
Today , only 37 % hold either of those more positive views .
Although the United States is technically not in a " depression , " the current problems on Wall Street are being widely described as the " deepest crisis since the Depression . "
This could be contributing to the near - doubling since January of public perceptions that the economy is in a depression , from 12 % to 23 % .
Slightly more Americans today also believe that the economy is in recession -- something many economists have already pronounced is underway .
This is up five percentage points since January , from 33 % to 38 % .
The expansion since January in perceptions that the economy is in a recession or depression coincides with the decline in Americans ' more basic consumer confidence over the same period .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Jan.30 - Feb. 1 found 66 % of Americans classified as negative in their economic views and 11 % positive .
Today , those figures are 78 % negative and 7 % positive .
Better Days to Come
The consumer confidence picture is not entirely bleak , however .
In contrast to Americans ' grave views of current economic conditions , they are markedly upbeat about where the economy will be a year from now .
Nearly half believe the economy will be growing at that point .
Only 28 % believe it will be in a recession or depression .
This outlook is not much different from that measured in January , when Americans ' underlying perceptions of current economic conditions were much more positive than they are today .
Bottom Line
Americans as a whole have grown substantially more negative in their characterization of the U.S. economy than they were at the outset of 2008 .
While Republicans ( and McCain supporters ) view the current situation in less dire terms than do Democrats ( and Obama supporters ) , most political independents share most Democrats ' view that the economy is in either a recession or a depression .
From the standpoint of the election , it is clearly important , therefore , that the candidates demonstrate concern and competency on the issue .
At the same time , the fact that most Americans think the situation will improve markedly by this time next year suggests they have enough confidence left in the economy to believe it can recover fairly quickly .
That could have important implications for how Obama and McCain frame the current economic problems , and their proposed solutions .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,015 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Sept. 15 - 16 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Opposition to a California ballot measure to ban same - sex marriage is mounting following Attorney General Jerry Brown 's move to change the language on the initiative , according to a Field Poll to be released today .
The poll found that just 38 percent of likely voters support the measure , while 55 percent intend to vote no .
That compares with 42 percent in support and 51 percent opposed in July .
Brown amended the Proposition 8 summary language after the state Supreme Court 's decision on May 15 to overturn California 's previous ban on same - sex marriage .
The pollsters found the amended language played a role in that growing opposition , especially among the 30 percent of likely voters interviewed who had never heard of Prop .
8 .
Those voters were much more likely to oppose the measure when read Brown 's wording ( 58 percent against it and 30 percent for it ) than those in the same category who were read the old version of Prop. 8 ( 42 percent against and 37 percent for it ) , according to the Field Poll .
The Brown language reads , in part : " Eliminates the right of same - sex couples to marry . "
The original version read , in part : " Limit on marriage . "
Brown 's revision makes it clear that voters are taking away someone 's rights and that made the difference , said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo .
" People are generally in favor of rights for individuals , " said DiCamillo .
" So eliminating a right has a somewhat negative connotation .
It 's pulling people who were n't aware of the initiative more to the no side . "
Prop. 8 supporters sued unsuccessfully this summer to block Brown 's changes , saying he was trying to stack the deck against the Nov. 4 ballot measure .
The new Field Poll just confirms that , said Jennifer Kerns , spokeswoman for Yes on Proposition 8 .
" The figures are not surprising given Attorney General Jerry Brown 's latest attempts to influence the elections , " she said , adding that the Field Poll historically underestimates support for banning same - sex marriage .
And she also believes that polled voters may tell interviewers they support same - sex marriage but will " vote their conscience " in the ballot box .
" There 's no doubt the views on same - sex marriage have softened a bit over the last eight years , " she said .
" It 's our position that a majority of Californians still support marriage as between one man and one woman . "
Opponents of Prop. 8 said the Field Poll is heartening .
" The proponents are trying to eliminate a constitutional right from one group of people and treat them differently , " said Geoff Kors , executive director for Equality California .
" Once voters know the truth , it appears they are moving in the direction of voting no . "
As of a week ago , supporters of Prop. 8 reported contributions of $ 14.7 million and opponents had reported $ 13.5 million .
Actor Brad Pitt donated $ 100,000 on Wednesday to fight Prop. 8 .
" Because no one has the right to deny another their life even though they disagree with it , because everyone has the right to live the life they so desire if it does n't harm another , and because discrimination has no place in America , my vote will be for equality and against Proposition 8 , " Pitt said in a statement .
The Field Poll found that Democrats oppose the initiative nearly 4 - 1 ( 75 to 20 percent ) .
Conservatives support Prop. 8 by a greater than 3 - 1 ratio ( 72 to 21 percent ) .
Likely voters who live in coastal counties or those touching San Francisco Bay oppose Prop. 8 57 to 36 percent .
Protestants support the measure 52 to 40 percent , according to the poll , while a majority of Catholics ( 55 percent ) and those affiliated with other religions or who have no preference ( 71 percent ) plan to vote no .
Evangelical Christians back the initiative 60 to 34 percent .
The poll is based on a telephone survey of 830 likely voters , taken between Sept. 5 and 14 .
There is a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In May 1991 , Dr. Kenneth Kwong , a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital , became one of the first scientists to enjoy a new vision of the human brain .
The experiment was simple : Kwong would show a subject some visual stimuli - such as a sequence of flashing red lights - and then monitor the brain to see how it reacted .
To Kwong 's surprise , even a brief light show triggered a telltale pattern of activity in the visual cortex , as the brain processed the sensory information .
" It took a few months before I believed what I was seeing , " Kwong remembers .
" I was actually watching the brain at work . "
This ability to peer inside the mind was made possible by a new technology known as fMRI , or functional magnetic resonance imaging .
The technology quickly became one of the most popular tools of neuroscience .
Last year , an average of eight peer - reviewed papers using fMRI were published per day , and more than 19,000 fMRI papers have been published in the last 15 years .
The past few months have brought articles on everything from the neural substrate of sarcasm to the patterns of brain activation triggered by pornography .
The technique is invading other fields as well , as psychologists , psychiatrists , philosophers , and even economists increasingly rely on these powerful machines .
The brain scan image - a silhouette of the skull , highlighted with bright splotches of primary color - has also become a staple of popular culture , a symbol of how scientific advances are changing the way we think about ourselves .
For the first time in human history , the black box of the mind has been flung wide open , allowing researchers to search for the cortical source for every flickering thought .
The expensive scanners can even decode the hidden urges of the unconscious , revealing those secret feelings that we hide from ourselves .
The machine , in other words , knows more about you than you do :
It 's like a high - tech window into the soul .
" These [ fMRI ] images get people excited in a way that other research just doesn't , " says Kelly Joyce , a sociologist at the College of William & Mary .
" The pictures have a tremendous authority , not only among scientists but among people who might just glance at a brain scan picture in a newspaper . "
In recent weeks , however , several high - profile papers have ignited a fierce debate over whether brain scanners are being widely misused and their results over - interpreted .
Some eminent figures in the field have taken issue with the metaphors typically used to describe brain imaging , criticizing descriptions of scanners that rely on what Joyce refers to as the " myth of transparency . "
The scanners , they say , excel at measuring certain types of brain activity , but are also effectively blind when it comes to the detection of more subtle aspects of cognition .
As a result , the pictures that seem so precise are often deeply skewed snapshots of mental activity .
Furthermore , one of the most common uses of brain scanners - taking a complex psychological phenomenon and pinning it to a particular bit of cortex - is now being criticized as a potentially serious oversimplification of how the brain works .
These critics stress the interconnectivity of the brain , noting that virtually every thought and feeling emerges from the crosstalk of different areas spread across the cortex .
If fMRI is a window into the soul , these scientists say , then the glass is very , very dirty .
" There are so many bad brain imaging studies , it 's hard to believe , " says Nikos K. Logothetis , director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany .
" Too many of these experiments are being done by people who , unfortunately , do n't really understand what the technology can and cannot do . "
Logothetis and others believe that much of the misuse stems from the visual nature of the data .
One study , by researchers at Colorado State University , showed that simply giving neuroscience students images from an fMRI machine , even if the images were redundant or irrelevant , made the students significantly more likely to find the data credible .
According to Paul Bloom , a psychologist at Yale , this is because fMRI " has all the trappings of work with great lab - cred : big , expensive , and potentially dangerous machines , hospitals and medical centers , and a lot of people in white coats . "
The data looks rigorous - it has the veneer of cutting - edge science - and people assume it 's valid , even when the reasoning is shoddy .
" You ca n't just put people in a scanner and ask them whatever question you want , " Logothetis says .
" Many of these [ fMRI ] papers are such oversimplifications of what 's happening in the brain as to be worthless . "
A typical fMRI experiment goes like this : a subject is slipped into a tight space that 's about the size of a coffin .
The person is told to lie perfectly still , as even the slightest movement will muddy the results .
At first , the subject does nothing .
Then , he or she performs the experimental task , which might involve looking at a picture or making a decision .
While this is happening , noisy magnets whir overhead , as the machine detects the slightly different magnetic properties of blood with and without oxygen .
The underlying assumption is that more active neurons require more oxygenated blood .
Follow the oxygen , and you can construct precise maps of the brain at work .
Last year , the New York Times published an op -ed that used fMRI to investigate the brains of swing voters as they stared at photos and videos of presidential candidates .
For instance , the scientists found that pictures of Mitt Romney led to activity in the amygdala , while pictures of Hillary Clinton activated the anterior cingulate .
( Interestingly , the only two candidates who inspired " little activity in areas of the brain associated with thought or feeling " were Barack Obama and John McCain . )
Within days , 17 prominent cognitive neuroscientists signed a letter criticizing the study .
" We are distressed , " the scientists wrote , " by the publication of research . . . that uses flawed reasoning to draw unfounded conclusions about topics as important as the presidential election . "
The critics pointed out that a specific brain area , such as the amygdala , can be involved in the production of a wide variety of emotions , from fear to pleasure .
This makes it extremely difficult , if not impossible , to decipher the hidden feelings of people based on brain scans alone .
A Gulf War veteran and his wife say they 've been unfairly placed on a federal list that limits their commercial flight access and threatens his job as a commercial pilot .
To fight back , the couple , who are Muslim , filed a lawsuit today against a host of U.S. government agencies .
" We do n't know why they 're on the list .
They do n't know why they 're on the list .
The government wo n't tell us why they 're on the list , " said Amy Foerster , an attorney with Saul Ewing , who is providing pro bono counsel and working with the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and the Schuylkill County couple on the case , which was filed in U.S. district court .
The suit filed against the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Justice and the FBI , among others , is " unique " because Erich Scherfen , a New Jersey native who converted to Islam in the mid-1990s , is a commercial airline pilot whose flight privileges were revoked in April , said Witold Walczak , the legal director of the state ACLU chapter .
On Sept. 1 , Scherfen will be terminated by his employer , Colgan Air , despite the airline 's cooperation .
" My livelihood depends on getting off this list , " Scherfen said .
What list he is on and which government entity maintains it is unclear , Walczak said .
The federal government has declined to acknowledge flight restrictions placed on the pilot .
But Scherfen says he and his wife , Pakistan - born Rubina Tareen , have been detained for hours on several occasions in airports and even border crossings and been told by airport ticket agents and security personnel that they 're on a " terrorist watch list . "
In order for Scherfen to keep his job , Walczak additionally requested an emergency injunction , a move that could provide results as early as today but would only be a temporary fix .
" We would n't file a suit we did n't think we could win , " Walczak said .
Palin , the governor of Alaska , energized McCain 's campaign when he chose her as his running mate just before the Republican convention .
But polls show Palin 's popularity waning among some as she has struggled to answer questions about foreign policy in the few interviews she has given .

While the iPhone 3G definitely feels warmer than the original , it should n't get hot enough to cook human flesh .
Or melt .
But a MacRumors forum member says he fell asleep with his iPhone 3G in his pocket and woke up when he felt a burning sensation in his pants ( not the good kind either ) .
He says he pulled out the phone , which was incredibly hot .
Like , plastic - meltingly hot .
Check out the damage to the dock connector ( and his leg ) , where you can really see the bubbly , heat - warped plastic :

He says that he had 3G disabled , no push , and the screen set to lock after a minute - so the phone should n't have been active .
It 's definitely an anomaly we have n't heard of before , if this report is legit .
Has anyone else noticed their phone getting uncomfortably warm ?

1 El Colacho : the Baby - Jumping Festival ( Spain )
In celebration of the Catholic festival of Corpus Christi , grown men leap over newborns , with full parental consent .
Donning scary , vaguely Elvis - like costumes and wielding whips and truncheons , the men attempt to “ cleanse ” the babies of evil .
Evidently , recklessly leaping over them is the best way to achieve this .
The town has observed the strange practice ( called El Colacho ) since 1620 , and any onlookers who seem to be in need of a quick exorcism are pulled into the event , as well — so look normal , by God !
And leave your babies with the sitter .
2 Hadakamatsuri : The Naked Festival ( Japan )
A hadakamatsuri –naked festival– is a type of Japanese festival where participants wear a minimum amount of clothing ; usually just a Japanese loincloth ( called fundoshi ) , sometimes with a short happi coat , and very rarely completely naked .
Whatever the clothing , it is considered to be above vulgar , or everyday , undergarments , and on the level of holy Japanese shrine attire .
Naked festivals are held in dozens of places throughout Japan every year , usually in the summer or winter .
Hidden somewhere in the midst of all these men in loincloths is one fully naked man .
Touching him is believed to bring good luck and happiness .
3 Up Helly - Aa : the Fire Festival ( Shetland Islands )
A tribute to the islands ’ Viking Past , Up Helly - Aa ( “ End of the Holy Days ” ) , the fire festivals are held in Shetland annually in the middle of winter to mark the end of the yule season .
The festival involves a procession of up to a thousand guizers , and culminates with the burning of a 32 - ft. replica of a Viking longship .
Due to the often - flamboyant costumes and the large quantity of males dressing up as females , it has earned the joke name ‘ Transvestite Tuesday ’ .
4 The Monkey Buffet Festival ( Thailand )
Every year , all of the province ’s approximately 600 monkeys are invited to eat fruits and vegetables during an annual feast held in honor of Rama , a hero of the Ramayana , who , it is said , rewarded his friend and ally , Hanuman the Monkey King , with the fiefdom of what is now Lopburi .
Organizers of the annual monkey buffet use more than 3,000 kg of fruits and vegetables for the festival .
5 Holi : the Festival of Colors ( India )
Holi , also called the Festival of Colours , is a popular Hindu spring festival observed in India , Guyana , and Nepal .
On the second day , known as Dhulhendi , people spend the day throwing colored powder and water at each other .
The spring season , during which the weather changes , is believed to cause viral fever and cold .
Thus , the playful throwing of the colored powders has a medicinal significance : the colors are traditionally made of Neem , Kumkum , Haldi , Bilva , and other medicinal herbs prescribed by Ayurvedic doctors .
6 Cheese Rolling Festival ( England )
Though it sounds benign ( and kind of goofy ) , cheese - rolling is very dangerous .
Running full - tilt down a very steep hill behind a madly spinning 7 - pound wheel of cheese can be well - nigh lethal .
In fact , police have attempted to ban the event , but participants have refused to observe the ban .
Men and their cheese wheels can not be separated easily , evidently .
So what happens during a cheese roll ?
Simple : the cheese is set to rolling , and racers zoom down the hill after the cheese .
However , as the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70 mph , it rarely happens that someone catches the cheese .
First to the bottom wins the cheese .
Glorious .
7 Maslenitsa : free - for - all boxing match ( Russia )
In Orthodox countries , the week before Lent is marked with a series of celebrations , including a free - for - all boxing match in which there are no rules .
In centuries past , the fight ended only when the participates were covered with blood and bereft of clothes .
8 Tunarama : the Tuna Tossing Festival ( Australia )
The Tunarama festival is held in Port Lincoln , on the tip of Eyre Peninsula , over the Australia Day ( 26 January ) long weekend .
When the festival began in 1962 , it was intended to promote the emerging tuna fishing industry in Port Lincoln .
Tuna fishing is now one of the town ’s biggest industries and Australia ’s largest tuna cannery is located there .
The highlight of the festival is the tuna tossing competition .
Ex -Olympic hammer thrower , Sean Carlin , holds the record for the longest toss at 37.23 metres set in 1998 .
9 Roswell UFO Festival ( USA )
The Roswell UFO Festival celebrates the anniversary of the “ Roswell Incident , ” when a UFO was said to have crashed into military grounds nearby .
Featuring experts , authors , researchers , and lecturers dissecting the infamous incident , the celebration will also sport an alien parade , an alien costume contest , and an alien hot air balloon ride .
10 La Tomatina ( Spain )
In late August , thousands of people pelt each other with over 250 lbs. of tomatoes in a span of 60 minutes in an event modestly described as the world ’s largest tomato fight .
Every year , over 30,000 tourists come to Bunyol for this festival .
Rules of conduct keep the festivities from becoming a more dangerous brawl .
Everyday Systems Systematic Moderation for Sustainable Good Habits Search | Discuss | Podcast | HabitCal
What is an everyday system ?
An everyday system , TM , is a simple , commonsense solution to an everyday problem , grounded by a pun or metaphor .
What is an everyday problem ?
A common , personal problem that is amenable to self - discipline .
I know my problem , where 's the system ?
In this convenient problem index .
Do n't see your problem here ?
Check out the Everyday Systems Lab to see what 's in progress or request a new system on the bulletin board .
What is the relationship between the systems ?
The systems are independent but compatible .
I do all of them .
But you do n't have to .
Pick and choose just the ones you like .
Are there any guiding principles shared by all the systems ?
Yes .
Here they are :
Systematic Moderation .
Everybody from Aristotle to your Grandma agrees that moderation is a good idea .
It 's the wisdom of the philosophers and the virtue of the common folk .
At least , it used to be .
These days it 's no longer held in such high esteem -- and even more rarely practiced .
Instead , people look for ways to get around having to moderate their desires and inclinations : with pills , miracle products , even surgery .
Or they simply ignore their desires altogether and embark on impossibly ambitious and restrictive programs of self - discipline .
But if there 's a way around moderation , we clearly have n't found it yet ; as the relentless rise in obesity rates and other depressing metrics make plain , our modern workarounds simply do n't work .
In fairness to ourselves , it 's not as easy as it was for our ancestors .
They had little choice but to be moderate .
Sheer scarcity kept them in line .
If they did n't behave moderately they would die .
Powerful traditions formed an additional line of defense .
We , on the other hand , live in an age of material superabundance and declining traditions .
We are the first generation that can afford to be immoderate ( at least , in the short term ) .
So how , in the absence of the external pressures of scarcity and tradition , can we give moderation the teeth it needs to be effective ?
With systematic , " extremist " techniques .
Thinking in terms of Habit .
Like moderation , the concept of habit is n't as popular as it used to be .
For Aristotle , virtue itself was a habit .
We moderns tend to prefer to think in black and white terms of irresistible addiction on the one had , and total freedom on the other .
But that 's neither accurate as a description nor useful as a prescription .
Habit , with its varying directions and degrees is a far truer and more powerful concept .
Compliance with rules requires willpower , and willpower is a very limited commodity .
A good system of moderation will utilize this resource efficiently by focusing on building habits : semi-automatic behaviors that require little willpower to maintain once they 've been established .
Sustainable Minimum of Compliance .
Habit is n't about one - off acts of heroism .
It 's about establishing a consistent , almost automatic pattern of behavior over time .
Much of the challenge of successful self - discipline is throttling your enthusiasm so you do n't burn out .
Keep the focus on meeting some clearly - defined , rigorously un-ambitious daily " good enough . "
" Sustainability " is the buzzword of the moment when applied to macro issues of agriculture or energy .
But it 's just as important with respect to your purely personal habits of eating , moving , spending , and getting things done .
Overdoing it is a far bigger danger than under - doing it -- because it inevitably results in your not doing anything at all .
Sustainability has to be the first thing you consider when evaluating a habit you want to acquire - not the afterthought it usually is .
Maintenance is more important than progress .
Progress is intrinsically temporary ; maintenance is what you 'll be doing for the rest of your life .
Habit Branding .
A good system should be " branded " with a striking image , pun , or metaphor .
That way you 'll be much less likely to forget or ignore it , even when things get stressful .
A brand gets you irrationally fired up about what you 're doing .
Some Everyday Systems are little more than a striking brand .
Others have significantly more rules or back - story , but even these systems are well served by a brand : the brand gives you a handle , all you have to do is have the brand flash into your mind and you can easily retrieve all the rest .
If your system were just a bunch of prosaic rules , however sensible , you 'd have to continuously keep the whole thing in conscious " RAM . "
No keeping track of things .
The system should n't require you to keep track of anything beyond the day of the week , what planet you are on , etc .
You have too many things to keep track of already .
Sometimes it 's interesting to keep track of things for a week or two .
But it gets unbearably boring and onerous fast .
If you feel you must keep track of something , use my free online Habit Calendar to keep track of your daily compliance with the system 's rules .
Small temporal footprint .
Ideally , the system should free up time , not take more of it .
If your exercise routine , for example , competes in any significant way with your social life or even with your favorite television show , sooner or later your exercise routine is going to lose .
Socially Unobtrusive .
Unless you 're planning to become a hermit in the desert , you need to consider whether your habits are going to be unbearably irritating to the people around you .
It 's not simply a matter of common courtesy : the consciousness of others ' disapproval will quickly wear you down .
Free or cheap .
If you need anything at all , it should be nothing you can't pick up at your local hardware store .
Wasting money on some infomercial clutter is bad , but the worst part is that inevitable feeling of being a sucker .
Make " free or cheap " a point of pride , and you 'll never feel this way again .
Simple but specific .
Common sense is great , but too vague to be a practical guide .
Behaviors that involve complex decision making , on the other hand , might be precise , but can never be automated into unconscious habit .
A good system finds the happy medium : unforgettably simple but unambiguously precise .
Comic pragmatism .
Self - help tends to take itself dreadfully seriously , I guess in the hope that other people will .
But crazy is a great mnemonic device .
If something is a little nuts , you 'll remember it .
I call this the principle of comic pragmatism .
It 's a joke , but it 's also serious .
It 's effective because it 's a joke .
Enjoyable .
Successful self - discipline requires plenty of carrot as well as stick .
Too many systems of self - improvement programs treat pleasure as a necessary evil , to be reluctantly doled out in pitiful little doses .
Everyday systems make pleasure integral .
I encourage you to use these principles to come up with your own systems .
It 's fun , and there 's nothing like founder 's zeal to get you motivated .
Let us know if you do .
How can I connect with other everyday systems practioners ?
Visit the bulletin board .
There is also an archive of older posts from the previous bulletin board system .
So what 's next ?
I 've got several more systems in the oven , but it may be another age and a half before I 'm sufficiently satisfied with them to give them their own web sites .
Until then , you can examine their progress or lack thereof at the everyday systems lab .
Does it cost money to run these sites ?
Yes !
If you like any or all of these sites , help me pay for them .
Buy anything from amazon.com through this link , I get a tiny cut , and you do n't pay anything extra .
In particular , feel free to buy ( multiple copies of ! ) my No S Diet book .
Even if no -s is n't the system you 're most interested in , two of the seven chapters at least are directly relevant for any everyday system ( general advice on habit building , etc. ) -- and if I sell enough copies , your preferred system may be the subject of the next book .

Obama wins Maine
AP and NBC have called the Maine caucuses for Barack Obama , giving him a clean sweep of the five contests this weekend and denying Hillary Clinton one of her best shots at breaking his momentum and slowing the rate at which he 's building a lead among pledged delegates .
With 70 percent of precincts reporting , Obama led the tally of state delegates by 58 percent to 41 percent .
Obama 's victory comes despite being down in all four polls of the state , and despite his loss in the primary in neighboring Massachusetts .
Clinton had been thought to have a strong shot at winning in Maine , whose demographics -- largely white , heavily working - class -- are those that have typically favored her .
She also had the support of the state 's governor , John Baldacci , and of his organization .
But Obama demonstrated his edge , yet again , in states decided by caucuses , in which the key factors are organization and the intensity of support .
His supporters proved willing to trudge out in the Maine snow on a Sunday afternoon to support him , and they were rewarded with victory .
The Maine Democratic Party reported that with 78 percent of the results in , the turnout for the primary was 37,361 people ; the state 's overall population is 1.3 million .
The final number appears likely to be less than the 53,000 people who turned out for the 2006 gubernatorial primary -- though the fact that a similar number of people turned out for a caucus and a primary demonstrates the intensity of the interest in this race .
Obama 's prize : More delegates , and momentum headed into the Potomac Primary ( aka Chesapeake Primary ) Tuesday .

BBC News , Havana
The Cuban authorities have arrested one of the island 's leading punk rock musicians , Gorki Aguila of band Porno Para Ricardo .
He could face charges of dangerousness , which allow the authorities to detain people who are likely to commit crimes .
According to fellow band members , he was picked up by police at his home in Havana on Monday as the group were preparing to record their latest album .
The group 's lyrics are often critical of life on the communist island .
The head of Cuba 's illegal , but tolerated , Human Rights Commission , Elizardo Sanchez , confirmed the detention and said that so far no - one has been allowed access to visit him .
Another member of the band , which was formed about 10 years ago , lead guitarist Ciro Diaz , said he was told by the police that the 39 - year - old musician would face charges of dangerousness .
Under Cuba 's penal code , the charge covers behaviours contrary " to the standards of communist morality " .
Habitual drunkenness , drug addiction and anti-social behaviour are all signs of a state of dangerousness , which carries a sentence of up to four years in jail .
There has been no comment on the detention by the Cuban authorities .
It is believed that Gorki Aguila could come before a judge on Thursday , although he has yet to be formally charged .
FCC backs ' Net Neutrality , ' orders Comcast to cease tampering Associated Press
Published : Saturday August 2 , 2008
Print This Email This By JOHN DUNBAR WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A divided Federal Communications Commission has ruled that Comcast Corp. violated federal policy when it blocked Internet traffic for some subscribers and has ordered the cable giant to change the way it manages its network .
In a precedent - setting move , the FCC by a 3 - 2 vote on Friday enforced a policy that guarantees customers open access to the Internet .
The commission did not assess a fine , but ordered the company to stop cutting off transfers of large data files among customers who use a special type of " file - sharing " software .
Associated Press reports on Comcast 's activities led to the complaints filed with the FCC .
Comcast says its practices are reasonable  that it has delayed traffic , not blocked it  and that the FCC 's so - called network - neutrality " principles " are part of a policy statement and are not enforceable rules .
Republican FCC Chairman Kevin Martin proposed the enforcement action and was joined by Democratic commissioners Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps in voting for approval .
He was opposed by members of his own party , commissioners Robert McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate , who both issued lengthy dissents .
The commission 's authority to act stems from a policy statement adopted in September 2005 that outlined a set of principles meant to ensure that broadband networks are " widely deployed , open , affordable and accessible to all consumers . "
The principles are " subject to reasonable network management , " a concept the agency has not explicitly defined .
While the FCC action did not include a fine , it does require Comcast within 30 days of release of the order to disclose the details of its " discriminatory network management " ; submit a compliance plan describing how it intends to stop these practices by the end of the year ; and disclose to customers and the commission its new plan .
Martin said Comcast managers were not " simply managing their network , they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers ' access to it . "
The agency said that Comcast had a motive to interfere .
Peer - to - peer applications are used to load video that " poses a potential competitive threat to Comcast 's video - on - demand service , " it said .
Martin was particularly critical of the company 's failure to disclose to customers exactly how it was managing its traffic .
Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in a prepared statement that the company was " disappointed in the commission 's divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable .... "
She said the company believes the order " raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions . "
The FCC 's action means network operators are subject to the FCC 's enforcement process and the agency will act on consumer complaints .
Martin told The Associated Press in an interview before the meeting that the agency will consider fines for future violations , but he declined to speculate on how large they would be .
The FCC action arose when bloggers reported that Comcast customers who used file - sharing software like BitTorrent were noticing their transmissions were aborting prematurely .
AP ran tests and reported Comcast " actively interferes " with attempts by some subscribes to share files online , and that the practice involved " company computers masquerading as those of its users . "
The report led to a complaint by public interest group Free Press and others that the company was violating agency principles .
Comcast has said it did not block traffic , but delayed it , and only among users of the file - sharing , peer - to - peer programs that were responsible for taking up a disproportionate share of bandwidth and endangering service for other customers .
The company says it will stop using its network management practice by the end of the year and switch to a " protocol agnostic " technique that will not single out any particular type of traffic .
The enforceability of the agency 's " network neutrality " principles have been questioned by many , including Martin , who said when the policy statement was adopted in 2005 that they " do not establish rules nor are they enforceable documents . "
McDowell said in his dissent , " I agree that we do have jurisdiction , in general , over these areas .
However , we do not have any rules governing Internet network management to enforce . "
Tate said she would prefer that the FCC act as a " mediator " rather than an enforcer regarding Internet disputes .
Martin says the Supreme Court has recognized the agency 's power to enforce the principles under its " ancillary authority " outlined in communications law and that the full commission has agreed with that position .
Members of Congress , including presumed Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , have pushed for network neutrality legislation without success .
Large Internet service providers have fought such regulation , arguing that companies that spend billions on their networks must be free to manage traffic .
Verizon Communications Inc. , AT&T Inc. and the U.S. Telecom Association all released statements Friday saying the FCC action proved there was no need for federal network neutrality legislation .
Receptionist stunned to find a baby bat in her BRA
When Abbie Hawkins felt a strange vibrating sensation in her bra while at work she simply assumed that it was her mobile phone ringing .
The hotel receptionist was therefore rather taken aback to discover that it was actually a bat that had made its home in her underwear – and that it had been there all morning .
As amused hotel staff crowded around the front desk to get a better look , a shocked Miss Hawkins delved into her bra and pulled out the small furry creature .
Abbie poses with a plastic bat and shows off the bra that proved so appealing to the real thing
Miss Hawkins , 19 , who works at the Holiday Inn near Norwich International Airport said : ‘ Once I realised it was a bat I was shocked , but then I felt quite sorry for it really .
‘ It looked very snug in there and I thought how mean I was for disturbing it . "
The bat had remained hidden in her bra since she had got ready for work that morning and had lain undetected until lunchtime .
‘ I did not notice anything as I put my bra on .
The night before I had had one or two drinks and I was getting ready quickly .
‘ The bra was in my drawer but it had been on the washing line the day before , ’ said Abbie .
‘ When I was driving to work I felt a slight vibration but I thought it was just my mobile phone in my jacket pocket .
‘ It was quite a busy morning and I did not for one minute think it was anything other than my mobile . ’
It was n't until midday when she took her phone out of her pocket and still felt something moving .
A shocked Abbie Hawkins recreates the moment she realised she had a furry little guest in her bra
‘ I plucked up the courage to investigate and I pulled out a little baby bat .
I just lost my breath when I saw it and I did not know what it was at first , ’ said Miss Hawkins .
As the frightened creature tried to hide form the crowd of hotel staff the hotel ’s manager took it aside and set it free .
‘ I keep thinking how could I have not known it was there ? ’ said Miss Hawkins .
‘ Whenever I talk about it nobody believes me .
Thank goodness people at work saw what happened or people may have thought I was crazy ’
A spokesperson for the Bat Conservation Trust said they had never heard of a bat being found in a bra before .
But she said there had been cases of bats being found in a toiletry bag , an umbrella , and the lining of a coat that was not being worn .
She said : ‘ Bats hibernate during the winter but in May and June they have babies and that is when people are most likely to find bats .
‘ Bats often roost in trees or under roof tiles - anywhere that is dark or safe . ’
John McCain has opposed what he considers the wasteful spending of earmarks .
McCain must OK earmarks , says GOP
Out on the stump , John McCain gets wild applause each time he promises as president to veto every spending bill that contains an earmark .
But McCain will find it almost impossible to live up to his vow , and gridlock would result if Congress refused to go along with such an executive branch power grab .
Advertisement
And that ’s what members of McCain ’s own party are saying .
“ I do n’t think it ’s the right approach , ” said Rep. Ralph Regula , an Ohio Republican who has spent three decades on the House Appropriations Committee .
“ I have n’t done an earmark I would n’t be happy to have spread all over the front pages of the paper . ”
Rep. C.W. Bill Young ( R - Fla . ) , a former Appropriations Committee chairman , warns that both parties in Congress would protect their power against a no-earmark policy .
“ The Constitution is very specific and very clear about who appropriates money , ” Young said .
“ Not all earmarks are pork - barrel spending . ”
McCain has billed himself and his running mate as mavericks who will stand up to foolish spending .
The campaign has pitched Sarah Palin as a governor who said “ no thanks ” to an earmark for Alaska ’s “ bridge to nowhere , ” although press reports have established that she supported the earmark before she opposed it .
Rep. Jack Kingston , a Georgia Republican and member of the Appropriations Committee , says he understands McCain ’s desire to crack down on wasteful spending and kill the latest “ bridge to nowhere . ”
But if a McCain administration suddenly started shooting down every spending bill , lawmakers on both sides might revolt .
“ The realistic outlook is for a great reduction in earmarks and a real discussion about earmarks , ” Kingston said .
Because Congress has failed again to finish its spending bills on time , the new president will likely receive a new omnibus spending bill just after taking office .
If McCain makes good on his campaign promise , “ he could veto it , and we ’d probably override ” the veto , Kingston said .
Or , if there are n’t enough votes to override a veto , “ it could be like 1995 , ” when the government shut down , says David Williams , vice president of policy for Citizens Against Government Waste , a watchdog group .
The promise to veto any bill with congressional earmarks does n’t take into account executive branch earmarks , which come by the scores in the president ’s annual budget request .
McCain has not promised to get rid of the executive branch ’s line - item spending requests .
“ What we would be doing is handing over all of our authority to the administration , ” said Kirstin Brost , a spokeswoman for House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey ( D - Wis . ) .
“ We ’d be saying the White House , in its judgments , would decide what every community in America needs . ”
McCain is not new to this earmark debate .
It ’s one area where he can still legitimately claim the maverick label .
For years he has taken to the Senate floor and read long lists of ridiculous - sounding earmarks and clashed with Republican earmarkers such as Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens .
And his campaign is n’t backing away from the promise that he ’ll veto any bill with earmarks , even if it would create a massive showdown in his first days in office .
“ He ’s someone who dedicated his career to taking on the status quo and fighting an earmark process that breeds corruption , ” McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said when asked Tuesday about congressional resistance to an earmark ban .
“ If they ’re worthy [ projects ] , then they can be approved through an open process . ”
But as many veteran lawmakers point out , for every far - flung Alaskan bridge project or hippie museum , there are dozens of other earmarks that are politically palatable , like military base housing improvements , levee upgrades and Veterans Affairs hospital wings .
And many of these are never requested by the executive agencies or the White House .
Young points out that it was one of his earmarks back in the early 1990s that created the National Bone Marrow Registry .
And the Predator drone — an unmanned aircraft critical in the war on terrorism — was created by a congressional earmark .
“ What a President McCain could do is make Congress pay closer attention to earmarks , ” Young said .
Even the watchdog groups , whose sole existence is to track and criticize earmarks , admit that McCain ’s promise would be difficult to carry out .
“ It ’s going to be a challenge , ” said Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a group that tracks government spending .
“ It ’ll be a game of chicken [ with Congress ] .
If he ’s elected , he could claim a mandate on earmarks . ”
But that mandate would run smack into a handful of unmovable objects on Capitol Hill , especially in the Senate , where old bulls like Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) and former Chairmen Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) and Stevens ( R ) have shown no inclination to give up earmarks .
All of these senators are known as fierce defenders of the constitutionally granted power of Congress to appropriate money .
And they ’re all well known for their earmarks .
“ The idea that an all - knowing , all - powerful executive bureaucracy is more trustworthy than the elected representatives of the people when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars challenges the most basic tenet of our political system , ” Byrd said in a statement .
“ An earmark is an economic need that many times falls between the cracks of the Washington bureaucracy .
When that happens , the people we represent cannot call some unelected bureaucrat in the White House budget office . ”
Regula , a longtime appropriator who has been in the minority , the majority and back in the minority in Congress , says the endgame is simple — a compromise with the new president , whoever that is .
“ There are a lot of campaign promises that will come up against reality , ” Regula said .
“ It ’s one thing to go and say it on the trail .
It ’s another thing to do it in the real world . ”

Georgia and Russia were today on the brink of full - scale war after Russian tanks rolled across the border to back separatists in the breakaway South Ossetia region .
With many hundreds of people feared to have been killed and the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , reported to have been severely damaged , Georgia said it was pulling 1,000 of its troops out of Iraq to redeploy them against Russia .
Georgia , a strong US ally , currently has 2,000 soldiers in Iraq , but half would now be withdrawn , a Georgian official , who described them as " some of our best soldiers " , said .
The South Ossetian president , Eduard Kokoity , told Russian media that an estimated 1,400 people had died due to " Georgian aggression " against the region .
The figure could not be verified .
The Russian incursion began after Georgia launched a major military offensive to retake control of South Ossetia , which has enjoyed de facto autonomy since the early 1990s but officially remains part of the country .
Only Russia has recognised its self - declared independence .
The Georgian president , Mikhail Saakashvili , said the two countries were already effectively at war .
" Russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory , " he told CNN .
" We are a freedom - loving nation that is right now under attack . "
He called on the US to intervene , saying it was in Washington 's interests to help his country .
Tskhinvali was reported to have suffered badly under heavy bombardment .
An official from the breakaway government said 1,000 people had been killed , although there was no independent verification of the figure .
" I saw bodies lying on the streets , around ruined buildings , in cars , " one woman , Lyudmila Ostayeva , who fled with her family to a village near the Russian border , told the Associated Press .
" It 's impossible to count them now .
There is hardly a single building left undamaged . "
In the heaviest fighting to afflict South Ossetia since the 1991 - 92 war in which it broke away from Georgia , a Russian army spokesman said tank and artillery units had " destroyed " Georgian positions around Tskhinvali .
A truce , agreed in 1992 , is monitored by soldiers from Russia , Georgia and the neighbouring Russian region of North Ossetia , with which South Ossetia has close ties .
Earlier today , Saakashvili said 150 Russian tanks and armoured vehicles had entered the region and that his forces had shot down two Russian planes over Georgian territory .
At least 10 Russian peacekeepers were killed and 30 injured .

Russian forces moved towards Tskhinvali and bombed a military airbase outside the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , after the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , said it was his duty to punish those responsible for the deaths of his fellow nationals .
A majority of the roughly 70,000 people living in South Ossetia are ethnically distinct from Georgians , and many have Russian passports .
The US and EU urged an immediate end to hostilities .
" The European Union , in liaison with all the protagonists , is working towards a ceasefire so as to avoid an extension of the conflict , " an EU statement said .
The US state department said Washington was sending an envoy to the region .
" We support Georgia 's territorial integrity and call for an immediate ceasefire , " a spokesman added .
Russian forces moved across the border as Georgian troops held a three - hour ceasefire to allow civilians to be evacuated .
Before the Russian tanks rolled in , Medvedev told reporters : " Under the constitution and federal law ... I must protect the life and dignity of Russian citizens wherever they are . "
Early today , Georgian troops exchanged fire with convoys carrying volunteer fighters over the border to support the separatists .
Georgia said Russian SU - 24 jets had entered its airspace and bombed two locations , including Gori , the birthplace of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin , south of the Ossetian enclave .
Russia denied this .
Vladimir Putin , the Russian prime minister and former president , said " aggressive " action by Georgia would incur a " response " .
" The Georgian leadership has unleashed a dirty adventure , " a ministerial statement said .
" Blood spilled in South Ossetia will be blamed on these people and their associates . "
Speaking through the Interfax news agency from China , where he is attending the Olympics , Putin blamed the Georgian leadership for its aggressive stance .
" Heavy weapons and artillery have been sent there , and tanks have been added , " Putin said .
" Deaths and injuries have been reported , including among Russian peacekeepers .
It 's all very sad and alarming .
And , of course , there will be a response . "
The Kremlin decided to move into South Ossetia after Russia 's security council met to discuss how to restore peace and defend civilians .
Moscow has stressed it has a peacekeeping mandate and will act on it .
Saakashvili , who has ordered reservists into action , said " the greater part " of South Ossetia had been " liberated " .
Interfax said Georgian troops had entered Tskhinvali , but this was denied by Georgia .
The crisis in the Caucasus represents the first major test for Medvedev , but Putin 's comments from China suggest he is calling the shots .
Two weeks ago saw an extraordinarily successful , more - than - 72 hour Super Mario Marathon that raised more than $ 11,000 for a gamers ' charity for kids .
This week , four Mega Man enthusiasts are finding out how hard of an act that is to follow — as a fund drive anyway .
A new web site indicates that game marathons are a mushrooming craze , capitalizing partly on gamers who enjoy watching others fail at classic console titles .
The question is , how long will it last ?

Mario Marathon Raises More than $ 10,000 [ Updated ]
Early this afternoon , Brian Brinegar , Dan May and John Groth finished their seven - game Super Mario Read more
The Megamanathon was hatched " about five minutes after we started watching the Mario Marathon , " said Alex Willingham , one of the four gamers taking a tour of the Mega Man Series .
Three hours into their marathon , which began 9 pm EDT Friday in Nyack , N.Y. , they 'd raised $ 210 for Child 's Play , the same beneficiary of the Mario endeavor .
As of noon Saturday , they 'd upped that to $ 230 .

They 're still having fun , of course .
But the Super Mario Marathon logged more than 100,000 unique viewers and 120,000 viewing hours , and it sounds like a lot of others got the same idea from watching it .
A site , Gamemarathons , went online shortly after the Mario Marathon and is trying to be the go - to place for coordinating these contests , to cut down on overlap and redundancy .
There 's a Speed Gamers Marathon going on right now ; a Rare Marathon that just finished , and Guitar Hero and Metroid coming up next week .
" Every marathon right now will find the Mario Marathon tough to follow , " said Matt Hayden , who launched Gamemarathons.com .
He estimates 85 percent of the marathons listed there so far are being done for charity .
Those that are gaming for a cause are clearly differentiated from those that are n't .

" [ The Mario Marathon ] was so wildly successful and well advertised that no marathon can hope to achieve the numbers they did in terms of viewers and money , " Hayden said .
" But then again , the marathons should never really be about competition or one - upping the one before .
Each one is uinique , and even if it raises $ 5 , that 's $ 5 a charity did n't have before , and it was a weekend of entertainment for at least a handful of people . "
Willingham agrees , seeing more potential in the casual , drop - in entertainment value of a marathon .
" As far as fundraising goes , it may be an idea beaten to death , " Willingham said .
" As recreational marathoning entertainment , it 'll last as long as there are games to play . "

He and his cohorts — Cory Hunt , Charlie Basler and Damon Amador , all college - age guys — had the itch to do a marathon , cause or charity regardless .
But Willingham also thinks the marathon has some entertainment potential for viewers .
" It 's like a television show for geeks , " he said .
" You log on each weekend , and watch more dorks fail . "
Hayden sees it a little differently .
" Boring people who do n't interact will break a marathon and bore the viewers no matter what game they 're playing , " he said .
" Fun people will bring in viewers and retain them .
People did n't watch [ the Mario Marathon ] for hours on end to see Mario games .
They watched to see the guys , and became so enamored of them they were given nicknames .
Brian [ TK's ] dog and wife became the most popular characters . "

The Megamanathon , even if it has n't raised as much as the Mario Marathon , poured out the same kind of effort and has developed its own following .
hey 've earned afan art gallery ( including tributes to " Bagel Girl , " the only female on the scene . )
All the participants have gotten nicknames from those dropping in to watch .
A PR effort got our attention , and local news as well .
But at this point , barring any flood of donations , the marathon 's biggest success will likely be its completion , rather than the amount raised .
The Mega Man gamers have the will to finish out the series , but others might not .

" I 'm worried that upcoming marathons , especially the hastily prepared ones , will peter out once the inspiration from the Mario Marathon has worn off , " Hayden said .
" Just about every one that 's planned for the next 2 months admit they were directly inspired by it .
But that 's why I created GameMarathons .
I wanted the phenomenon to be more organized and be more widely accessible by everyone on the Internet , not just those who have to rely on word of mouth or a lucky mention on a popular site . "
The Megamanathon will likely last into Sunday , Willingham said .
They started with original Mega Man , and have been drawing titles out of a hat at random .
They 're playing the Mega Man Anniversary Collection and Mega Man X Collection on a Wii , using a HORI Digital GameCube pad .
You can follow their progress on their site .

John McCain spent Monday claiming as he had countless times before  that the economy was fundamentally sound .
Had he missed the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the sale of Merrill Lynch , which were announced the day before ?
Did he not notice the agonies of the American International Group ?
Was he unaware of the impending layoffs of tens of thousands of Wall Street employees on top of the growing numbers of unemployed workers throughout the United States ?
On Tuesday , he clarified his remarks .
The clarification was far more worrisome than his initial comments .
He said that by calling the economy fundamentally sound , what he really meant was that American workers are the best in the world .
In the best Karl Rovian fashion , he implied that if you dispute his statement about the economy ’s firm foundation , you are , in effect , insulting American workers .
“ I believe in American workers , and someone who disagrees with that  it ’s fine , ” he told NBC ’s Matt Lauer .
Let ’s get a few things straight .
First , no one who is currently running for president does not “ believe in American workers . ”
Paskov
House one of architectural jewels of Russia was under restoration for 19 years , was closed down due to its dilapidated state .
Pashkov
House is named after its first owner Petr Yegorovich Pashkov , the lieutenant commander of the Life Guards of Semenovsky Regiment and the son of Peter the Great ’s batman .
Designed by Vasily Bazhenov ( 1737-1799 ) , one of Russia ’s greatest architects , this mansion was erected between 1784 and 1786 for the wealthy Pashkov family .
The central building is topped by a round belvedere and flanked by two service wings .
The current building is a reconstruction of a private mansion that was badly damaged in the disastrous fire of 1812 , which swept through the city as the first of Napoleon ’s troops were arriving .
In the 19th century it housed the Rumyantsev collection of art and rare manuscripts and a library , and from 1925 it has been a part of the Lenin Library , the second largest in the world , after the Library of Congress , and a magnet for international scholars , even during the Soviet era .
Following the 1917 revolution , the museum was closed and the art collection was transferred to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and the Pushkin Museum of Fine Art .
The manuscripts were donated to the Russian State Library which now owns this building .
Pashkov
House is off - limits to the general public , but after years of neglect , the government finally pledged funds for restoration work , which began in 2003 .
Money for the state - financed restoration finally started to flow after the visit from Vladimir V. Putin , the former president .
In a city where architectural monuments are readily torn down or gaudily renovated beyond recognition , Pashkov House , which reopened in October after an $ 80 million renovation , is one of the few restoration projects lauded by preservationists .
The building is Classical in style , with columns , urns , and terraces reminiscent of Rome .
It stands on the high Vagankovsky hill , as if continuing the line of its ascent , on an open corner of two descending streets .
There is a story that Bazhenov was offended with Catherine the Great , and planned the house to make it standing with its back to the Kremlin , as the entrance from Starovaganovsky Lane was intended to be the main entrance .
And the façade looks on to Mokhovaya Street – i.e. on to the Kremlin .
The grand hall features elaborate plasterwork depicting mythical figures , candelabra that had been salvaged from the ruins and a retractable chandelier .
The magnificient house can be rented for special events for $ 100,000 or more .
Christie ’s held a pre-auction showing for rich Russian art collectors at Pashkov House last fall , and Boucheron , the French jewelry house , held an exhibition and soirée there in March .
There are no more secret collections here that were once off - limits in soviet times .
However , two rare busts of Socrates and Homer , from Pashkov House ’s final 19th - century iteration as the Rumyantsev Museum are still there and preserved .
The gleaming white Pashkov edifice rose three stories and was crowned with a belvedere .
The combination of rocco and Palladian splendor of Pashkov House was expressed strikingly in its Kremlin facade dominated by majestic four Corinthian column portico where the architect placed a statue next to the first and the fourth columns .

Is it possible that this time the October surprise was tried in August , and that the garbage issue of brave little Georgia struggling for its survival from the grasp of the Russian bear was stoked to influence the U.S. presidential election ?
Before you dismiss that possibility , consider the role of one Randy Scheunemann , for four years a paid lobbyist for the Georgian government who ended his official lobbying connection only in March , months after he became Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s senior foreign policy adviser .
Previously , Scheunemann was best known as one of the neoconservatives who engineered the war in Iraq when he was a director of the Project for a New American Century .
It was Scheunemann who , after working on the McCain 2000 presidential campaign , headed the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , which championed the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
There are telltale signs that he played a similar role in the recent Georgia flare - up .
How else to explain the folly of his close friend and former employer , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , in ordering an invasion of the breakaway region of South Ossetia , an invasion that clearly was expected to produce a Russian counterreaction ?
It is inconceivable that Saakashvili would have triggered this dangerous escalation without some assurance from influential Americans he trusted , like Scheunemann , that the United States would have his back .
Scheunemann long guided McCain in these matters , even before he was officially running foreign policy for McCain ’s presidential campaign .
In 2005 , while registered as a paid lobbyist for Georgia , Scheunemann worked with McCain to draft a congressional resolution pushing for Georgia ’s membership in NATO .
A year later , while still on the Georgian payroll , Scheunemann accompanied McCain on a trip to that country , where they met with Saakashvili and supported his bellicose views toward Russia ’s Vladimir Putin .
Scheunemann is at the center of the neoconservative cabal that has come to dominate the Republican candidate ’s foreign policy stance in a replay of the run-up to the war against Iraq .
These folks are always looking for a foreign enemy on which to base a new Cold War , and with the collapse of Saddam Hussein ’s regime , it was Putin ’s Russia that came increasingly to fit the bill .
Yes , it sounds diabolical , but that may be the most accurate way to assess the designs of the McCain campaign in matters of war and peace .
There is every indication that the candidate ’s demonization of Russian leader Putin is an even grander plan than the previous use of Saddam to fuel American militarism with the fearsome enemy that it desperately needs .
McCain gets to look tough with a new Cold War to fight while Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , scrambling to make sense of a more measured foreign policy posture , will seem weak in comparison .
Meanwhile , the dire consequences of the Bush legacy that McCain has inherited , from the disaster of Iraq to the economic meltdown , conveniently will be ignored .
But the military - industrial complex , which has helped bankroll the neoconservatives , will be provided with an excuse for ramping up a military budget that is already bigger than that of the rest of the world combined .
What is at work here is a neoconservative , self - fulfilling prophecy in which Russia is turned into an enemy that expands its largely reduced military , and Putin is cast as the new Josef Stalin bogeyman , evoking images of the old Soviet Union .
McCain has condemned a “ revanchist Russia ” that should once again be contained .
Although Putin has been the enormously popular elected leader of post - Communist Russia , it is assumed that imperialism is always lurking , not only in his DNA but in that of the Russian people .
How convenient to forget that Stalin was a Georgian , and indeed if Russian troops had occupied the threatened Georgian town of Gori they would have found a museum still honoring the local boy , who made good by seizing control of the Russian revolution .
Indeed five Russian bombs were allegedly dropped on Gori ’s Stalin Square on Tuesday .
It should also be mentioned that the post -Communist Georgians have imperial designs on South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
What a stark contradiction that the United States , which championed Kosovo ’s independence from Serbia , now is ignoring Georgia ’s invasion of its ethnically rebellious provinces .
For McCain to so fervently embrace Scheunemann ’s neoconservative line of demonizing Russia in the interest of appearing tough during an election campaign is a reminder that a senator can be old and yet wildly irresponsible .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - A French judge has ordered U.S. carrier Continental Airlines and five individuals to stand trial over the crash of an Air France Concorde that killed 113 people , a prosecutor ’s statement said on Thursday .

The judge said the defendants , including the man who oversaw the development of the Franco - British supersonic airliner , would be charged with involuntary manslaughter .
The Concorde crashed in flames minutes after take off from Paris ’ Charles de Gaulle airport on July 25 , 2000 , killing all 109 on board and four people on the ground .
Investigations concluded that the plane caught fire after one of its tires was punctured by a small piece of metal that had fallen off a departing Continental flight , sending debris flying into the fuel tanks of the delta - winged plane .
Prosecutors say the metal strip had been incorrectly fitted to the Continental DC10 and was made of tough titanium metal , rather than regulation aluminum , which is softer and less likely to cause punctures .
Continental has denied responsibility for the crash and has said it would fight the charges .
Judges have issued an international arrest warrant for a welder named John Taylor , who worked for Continental at the time of the disaster , after he failed to appear for questioning .
He and his supervisor , Stanley Ford , will both now stand trial .
Standing alongside them in the dock will be Henri Perrier , head of testing for Concorde before becoming director of the Concorde program , and Jacques Herubel , the plane ’s chief engineer in the 1990s .
The fifth defendant was a former head of France ’s civil aviation authority , Claude Frantzen .
A judicial report on the crash said the Concorde ’s manufacturer Aerospatiale , now part of plane - maker EADS , had failed to correct its design after more than 70 incidents involving the plane ’s tires occurred between 1979 and 2000 .
Prosecutors say Frantzen was negligent because he was ultimately responsible for letting Concorde take to the skies and had not appreciated the fragility of the plane ’s fuel tanks , which were strengthened only in the wake of the 2000 disaster .
The prosecutor ’s statement said the Continental workers failed to follow normal procedures over repairs to the DC10 .
The prosecutor said Continental itself had been negligent over the maintenance of its fleet of DC10 aircraft .
Concorde ’s two operators , Air France and British Airways , eventually took the plane out of service in 2003 .
French officials said earlier this year that any trial would need massive organization and would probably not begin until late this year or early 2009 .
As if the whole defective NVIDIA GPU situation could n't get any more confusing , The Inquirer is now reporting that the previous batch of bad GPUs may be far from the end of NVIDIA 's problems .
Apparently , four unspecified board partners are now saying that they 're seeing G92 and G94 chips going bad at " high rates " as well , and in both desktop and laptop cards no less .
That includes 8800GT , 8800GTS , 8800 GS graphics cards , " several mobile flavors " of the 8800 , " most " of the 9800 suffixes , and a few 9600 variants , all of which are based on the G92 .
As for the G94 , it seems the only card affected is the 9600GT .
Of course , none of this is nearly as set in stone as the previous lot of problems , but we have a sneaking suspicion this wo n't be last we hear about it .
Apparently , putting Alaska Governor Sarah Palin on the Republican presidential ticket was enough to take the state 's electoral votes out of play , but it may not be enough to save embattled Republicans running for re-election .
A new poll conducted by Research 2000 for the liberal blog DailyKos surveyed 600 likely voters between 9/15 - 17 for a margin of error of +/- 4 % . Incumbent Ted Stevens , the Republican , and Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , the Democrat , were tested in the race for Senate , while Rep. Don Young was matched up against former state House Democratic Leader Ethan Berkowitz .
General Election Matchup
( All / Dem / GOP / Ind / Men / Wom )
Berkowitz ...... 53 / 87 / 19 / 60 / 48 / 58
Young .......... 39 / 6 / 75 / 31 / 45 / 33
Begich ......... 50 / 87 / 14 / 57 / 46 / 54
Stevens ........ 44 / 6 / 82 / 36 / 49 / 39
McCain/ Palin...55 / 12 / 86 / 54 / 59 / 51
Obama / Biden ....38 / 84 / 7 / 38 / 34 / 42
Barack Obama 's early interest in competing in Alaska has all but disappeared .
Obama 's campaign initially sent staffers to the state , and some polls even showed the Democrat within striking distance of John McCain .
But once McCain picked Palin , the Republican ticket jumped to what looks like an insurmountable lead .
Just because the state 's electoral votes look like a lock for McCain does n't mean the state 's Congressional delegation is safe .
The investigation into influence - peddling by oil services company VECO Corp. has taken a measurable toll on both Stevens and Young.
58 % of Alaska voters see Young in a negative light , while 56 % see Stevens unfavorably .
Stevens , under indictment for offenses related to the VECO scandal , faces a trial in which jury selection begins on Monday .
Young has not been indicted , but is reportedly still under investigation .
Young won his primary last month by just a few hundred votes , as his primary opponent , Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell , conceded earlier this week .
Parnell would have been the stronger general election candidate , though .
Included in this survey , Berkowitz led Parnell by a 48% - 43 % margin .
Expect the next survey to show Young closing the gap with Berkowitz at least a little bit .
Because it took three weeks for Parnell to concede , this poll included matchups between Berkowitz and both Republicans .
Polls taken before primaries tend to capture a fractured base .
After the post - primary healing process , the party with the primary usually gets a boost .
Berkowitz and Begich are seen favorably by 56 % of Alaska voters , according to the poll .

The fossil was bought for just £ 20 A scientist who bought a fossilised insect on the web auction site eBay for £ 20 has discovered that it belongs to a previously unknown species of aphid .
Dr Richard Harrington , vice - president of the UK's Royal Entomological Society , bought the fossil from an individual in Lithuania .
He then sent it off to an aphid expert in Denmark , who confirmed the insect was a new species , now extinct .
The bug has been named Mindarus harringtoni after the scientist .
" I was interested to see what it was because I 've worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids , those of greenfly and their relatives in this country , " Dr Harrington told BBC News .
" I looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus , but we had no idea what the species was . "
I had thought it would be rather nice to call it Mindarus ebayi
Dr Richard Harrington , Rothamsted " Dr Harrington sent the specimen to Professor Ole Heie , a fossil aphid expert in Denmark .
" He discovered that it was something that had n't been described before , " Dr Harrington explained .
The insect itself is 3 - 4 mm long and is encased in a 40 - 50 million - year - old piece of amber about the size of a small pill .
" I had thought it would be rather nice to call it Mindarus ebayi , " said Dr Harrington .
" Unfortunately , using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days . "
Instead , Professor
Heie named the new species after Dr Harrington .
" It 's not uncommon to find insects in amber ... but I 'm not sure that one has turned up on eBay that has been undiscovered before .
It 's a rather unusual route to come by [ a new species ] , " the researcher , based at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire , explained .
He said the insect would have fed on a tree called Pinus succinifera which is itself now long since extinct .

Introduction
Dynamic - Link libraries ( DLL ) are an integrated part of the Windows platform from its very beginning .
DLLs allow encapsulation of a piece of functionality in a standalone module with an explicit list of C functions that are available for external users .
In 1980 ’s , when Windows DLLs were introduced to the world , the only viable option to speak to broad development audience was C language .
So , naturally , Windows DLLs exposed their functionality as C functions and data .
Internally , a DLL may be implemented in any language , but in order to be used from other languages and environments , a DLL interface should fall back to the lowest common denominator – the C language .
Using the C interface does not automatically mean that a developer should give up object oriented approach .
Even the C interface can be used for true object oriented programming , though it may be a tedious way of doing things .
Unsurprisingly , the second most used programming language in the world , namely C++ , could not help but to fall prey to the temptation of a DLL .
However , opposite to the C language , where the binary interface between a caller and a callee is well - defined and widely accepted , in the C++ world , there is no recognized application binary interface ( ABI ) .
In practice , it means that binary code that is generated by a C++ compiler is not compatible with other C++ compilers .
Moreover , the binary code of the same C++ compiler may be incompatible with other versions of this compiler .
All this makes exporting C++ classes from a DLL quite an adventure .
The purpose of this article is to show several methods of exporting C++ classes from a DLL module .
The source code demonstrates different techniques of exporting the imaginary Xyz object .
The Xyz object is very simple , and has only one method : Foo .
Here is the diagram of the object Xyz :
Xyz int Foo(int )
The implementation of the Xyz object is inside a DLL , which can be distributed to a wide range of clients .
A user can access Xyz functionality by :
Using pure C
Using a regular C++ class
Using an abstract C++ interface
The source code consists of two projects :
XyzLibrary – a DLL library project
– a DLL library project XyzExecutable – a Win32 console program that uses " XyzLibrary.dll "
The XyzLibrary project exports its code with the following handy macro :
# if defined ( XYZLIBRARY_EXPORT ) // inside DLL # define XYZAPI __declspec ( dllexport ) #else // outside DLL # define XYZAPI __declspec ( dllimport ) #endif // XYZLIBRARY_EXPORT
The XYZLIBRARY_EXPORT symbol is defined only for the XyzLibrary project , so the XYZAPI macro expands into __declspec( dllexport ) for the DLL build and into __declspec( dllimport ) for the client build .
C Language Approach
Handles
The classic C language approach to object oriented programming is the usage of opaque pointers , i.e. , handles .
A user calls a function that creates an object internally , and returns a handle to that object .
Then , the user calls various functions that accept the handle as a parameter and performs all kinds of operations on the object .
A good example of the handle usage is the Win32 windowing API that uses an HWND handle to represent a window .
The imaginary Xyz object is exported via a C interface , like this :
typedef tagXYZHANDLE {} * XYZHANDLE ; XYZAPI XYZHANDLE APIENTRY GetXyz( VOID ) ; XYZAPI INT APIENTRY XyzFoo( XYZHANDLE handle , INT n ) ; XYZAPI VOID APIENTRY XyzRelease ( XYZHANDLE handle ) ;
Here is an example of how a client 's C code might look like :
#include " XyzLibrary.h " ... XYZHANDLE hXyz = GetXyz( ) ; if ( hXyz ) { XyzFoo( hXyz , 42 ) ; XyzRelease ( hXyz ) ; hXyz = NULL ; }
With this approach , a DLL must provide explicit functions for object creation and deletion .
Calling Conventions
It is important to remember to specify the calling convention for all exported functions .
Omitted calling convention is a very common mistake that many beginners do .
As long as the default client 's calling convention matches that of the DLL , everything works .
But , once the client changes its calling convention , it goes unnoticed by the developer until runtime crashes occur .
The XyzLibrary project uses the APIENTRY macro , which is defined as __stdcall in the " WinDef.h " header file .
Exception Safety
No C++ exception is allowed to cross over the DLL boundary .
Period .
The C language knows nothing about C++ exceptions , and cannot handle them properly .
If an object method needs to report an error , then a return code should be used .
Advantages
A DLL can be used by the widest programming audience possible .
Almost every modern programming language supports interoperability with plain C functions .
C run-time libraries of a DLL and a client are independent of each other .
Since resource acquisition and freeing happens entirely inside a DLL module , a client is not affected by a DLL 's choice of CRT .
Disadvantages
The responsibility of calling the right methods on the right instance of an object rests on the user of a DLL .
For example , in the following code snippet , the compiler wo n't be able to catch the error : XYZHANDLE h = GetSomeOtherObject ( ) ; XyzFoo(h , 42 ) ;
Explicit function calls are required in order to create and destroy object instances .
This is especially annoying for deletion of an instance .
The client function must meticulously insert a call to XyzRelease at all points of exit from a function .
If the developer forgets to call XyzRelease , then resources are leaked because the compiler does n't help to track the lifetime of an object instance .
Programming languages that support destructors or have a garbage collector may mitigate this problem by making a wrapper over the C interface .
at all points of exit from a function .
If the developer forgets to call , then resources are leaked because the compiler does n't help to track the lifetime of an object instance .
Programming languages that support destructors or have a garbage collector may mitigate this problem by making a wrapper over the C interface .
If object methods return or accept other objects as parameters , then the DLL author has to provide a proper C interface for these objects , too .
The alternative is to fall back to the lowest common denominator , that is the C language , and use only built - in types ( like int , double , char* , etc. ) as return types and method parameters .
C++ Naive Approach : Exporting a Class
Almost every modern C++ compiler that exists on the Windows platform supports exporting a C++ class from a DLL .
Exporting a C++ class is quite similar to exporting C functions .
All that a developer is required to do is to use the __declspec( dllexport / dllimport ) specifier before the class name if the whole class needs to be exported , or before the method declarations if only specific class methods need to be exported .
Here is a code snippet :
class XYZAPI CXyz { public : int Foo( int n ) ; } ; class CXyz { public : XYZAPI int Foo( int n ) ; } ;
There is no need to explicitly specify a calling convention for exporting classes or their methods .
By default , the C++ compiler uses the __thiscall calling convention for class methods .
However , due to different naming decoration schemes that are used by different compilers , the exported C++ class can only be used by the same compiler and by the same version of the compiler .
Here is an example of a naming decoration that is applied by the MS Visual C++ compiler :
Notice how the decorated names are different from the original C++ names .
Following is a screenshot of the same DLL module with name decoration deciphered by the Dependency Walker tool :
Only the MS Visual C++ compiler can use this DLL now .
Both the DLL and the client code must be compiled with the same version of MS Visual C++ in order to ensure that the naming decoration scheme matches between the caller and the callee .
Here is an example of a client code that uses the Xyz object :
#include " XyzLibrary.h " ... CXyz xyz ; xyz . Foo ( 42 ) ;
As you can see , the usage of an exported class is pretty much the same as the usage of any other C++ class .
Nothing special .
Important : Using a DLL that exports C++ classes should be considered no different than using a static library .
All rules that apply to a static library that contains C++ code are fully applicable to a DLL that exports C++ classes .
What You See Is Not What You Get
A careful reader must have already noticed that the Dependency Walker tool showes an additional exported member , that is the CXyz& CXyz : : operator =( const CXyz& ) assignment operator .
What we see is our C++ money at work .
According to the C++ Standard , every class has four special member functions :
Default constructor
Copy constructor
Destructor
Assignment operator ( operator =)
If the author of a class does not declare and does not provide an implementation of these members , then the C++ compiler declares them , and generates an implicit default implementation .
In the case of the CXyz class , the compiler decided that the default constructor , copy constructor , and the destructor are trivial enough , and optimized them out .
However , the assignment operator survived optimization and got exported from a DLL .
Important : Marking the class as exported with the __declspec( dllexport ) specifier tells the compiler to attempt to export everything that is related to the class .
It includes all class data members , all class member functions ( either explicitly declared , or implicitly generated by the compiler ) , all base classes of the class , and all their members .
Consider :
class Base { ... } ; class Data { ... } ; class __declspec ( dllexport ) Derived : public Base { ... private : Data m_data ; } ;
In the above code snippet , the compiler will warn you about the not exported base class and the not exported class of the data member .
So , in order to export a C++ class successfully , a developer is required to export all the relevant base classes and all the classes that are used for the definition of the data members .
This snowball exporting requirement is a significant drawback .
That is why , for instance , it is very hard and tiresome to export classes that are derived from STL templates or to use STL templates as data members .
An instantiation of an STL container like std : : map <> , for example , may require tens of additional internal classes to be exported .
Exception Safety
An exported C++ class may throw an exception without any problem .
Because of the fact that the same version of the same C++ compiler is used both by a DLL and its client , C++ exceptions are thrown and caught across DLL boundaries as if there were no boundaries at all .
Remember , using a DLL that exports C++ code is the same as using a static library with the same code .
Advantages
An exported C++ class can be used in the same way as any other C++ class .
An exception that is thrown inside a DLL can be caught by the client without any problem .
When only small changes are made in a DLL module , no rebuild is required for other modules .
This can be very beneficial for big projects where huge amounts of code are involved .
Separating logical modules in a big project into DLL modules may be seen as the first step towards true module separation .
Overall , it is a rewarding activity that improves the modularity of a project .
Disadvantages
Exporting C++ classes from a DLL does not prevent very tight coupling between an object and its user .
The DLL should be seen as a static library with respect to code dependencies .
Both client code and a DLL must link dynamically with the same version of CRT .
It is necessary in order to enable correct bookkeeping of CRT resources between the modules .
If a client and DLL link to different versions of CRT , or link with CRT statically , then resources that have been acquired in one instance of the CRT will have been freed in a different instance of the CRT .
It will corrupt the internal state of the CRT instance that attempts to operate on foreign resources , and most likely will lead to crash .
Both the client code and the DLL must agree on the exception handling / propagating model , and use the same compiler settings with respect to C++ exceptions .
Exporting a C++ class requires exporting everything that is related to this class : all its base classes , all classes that are used for the definition of data members , etc .
C++ Mature Approach : Using an Abstract Interface
A C++ abstract interface ( i.e. , a C++ class that contains only pure virtual methods and no data members ) tries to get the best of both worlds : a compiler independent clean interface to an object , and a convenient object oriented way of method calls .
All that is required to do is to provide a header file with an interface declaration and implement a factory function that will return the newly created object instances .
Only the factory function has to be declared with the __declspec( dllexport / dllimport ) specifier .
The interface does not require any additional specifiers .
struct IXyz { virtual int Foo( int n ) = 0 ; virtual void Release ( ) = 0 ; } ; extern " C " XYZAPI IXyz * APIENTRY GetXyz( ) ;
In the above code snippet , the factory function GetXyz is declared as extern " C " .
It is required in order to prevent the mangling of the function name .
So , this function is exposed as a regular C function , and can be easily recognized by any C - compatible compiler .
This is how the client code looks like , when using an abstract interface :
#include " XyzLibrary.h " ... IXyz * pXyz = :: GetXyz( ) ; if ( pXyz ) { pXyz -> Foo ( 42 ) ; pXyz -> Release ( ) ; pXyz = NULL ; }
C++ does not provide a special notion for an interface as other programming languages do ( for example , C# or Java ) .
But it does not mean that C++ cannot declare and implement interfaces .
The common approach to make a C++ interface is to declare an abstract class without any data members .
Then , another separate class inherits from the interface and implements interface methods , but the implementation is hidden from the interface clients .
The interface client neither knows nor cares about how the interface is implemented .
All it knows is which methods are available and what they do .
How This Works
The idea behind this approach is very simple .
A member - less C++ class that consisting of pure virtual methods only is nothing more than a virtual table , i.e. , an array of function pointers .
This array of function pointers is filled within a DLL with whatever an author deems necessary to fill .
Then , this array of pointers is used outside of a DLL to call the actual implementation .
Bellow is the diagram that illustrates the IXyz interface usage .
Click on the image to view the full sized diagram in a new window :
The above diagram shows the IXyz interface that is used both by the DLL and the EXE modules .
Inside the DLL module , the XyzImpl class inherits from the IXyz interface , and implements its methods .
Method calls in the EXE module invoke the actual implementation in the DLL module via a virtual table .
Why This Works With Other Compilers
The short explanation is : because COM technology works with other compilers .
Now , for the long explanation .
Actually , using a member - less abstract class as an interface between modules is exactly what COM does in order to expose COM interfaces .
The notion of a virtual table , as we know it in the C++ language , fits nicely into the specification of the COM standard .
This is not a coincidence .
The C++ language , being the mainstream development language for at least over a decade now , has been used extensively with COM programming .
It is thanks to natural support for object oriented programming in the C++ language .
It is not surprising at all that Microsoft has considered the C++ language as the main heavy - duty instrument for industrial COM development .
Being the owner of the COM technology , Microsoft has ensured that the COM binary standard and their own C++ object model implementation in the Visual C++ compiler do match , with as little overhead as possible .
No wonder that other C++ compiler vendors jumped on the bandwagon and implemented the virtual table layout in their compilers in the same way as Microsoft did .
After all , everybody wanted to support COM technology , and to be compatible with the existing solution from Microsoft .
A hypothetical C++ compiler that fails to support COM efficiently is doomed to oblivion in the Windows market .
That is why , nowadays , exposing a C++ class from a DLL via an abstract interface will work reliably with every decent C++ compiler on the Windows platform .
Using a Smart Pointer
In order to ensure proper resource release , an abstract interface provides an additional method for the disposal of an instance .
Calling this method manually can be tedious and error prone .
We all know how common this error is in the C world where the developer has to remember to free the resources with an explicit function call .
That 's why typical C++ code uses RAII idiom generously with the help of smart pointers .
The XyzExecutable project uses the AutoClosePtr template , which is provided with the example .
The AutoClosePtr template is the simplest implementation of a smart pointer that calls an arbitrary method of a class to destroy an instance instead of operator delete .
Here is a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of a smart pointer with the IXyz interface :
#include " XyzLibrary.h " # include " AutoClose Ptr.h " ... typedef AutoClosePtr<IXyz , void , & IXyz:: Release > IXyzPtr ; IXyzPtr ptrXyz (:: GetXyz( ) ) ; if ( ptrXyz ) { ptrXyz -> Foo ( 42 ) ; }
Using a smart pointer will ensure that the Xyz object is properly released , no matter what .
A function can exit prematurely because of an error or an internal exception , but the C++ language guarantees that destructors of all local objects will be called upon the exit .
Using Standard C++ Smart Pointers
Recent versions of MS Visual C++ provide smart pointers with the Standard C++ library .
Here is the example of using Xyz object with std:: shared_ptr class :
#include " XyzLibrary.h " # include < memory > # include < functional > ... typedef std::shared_ptr<IXyz> IXyzPtr ; IXyzPtr ptrXyz (:: GetXyz( ) , std::mem_fn(&IXyz::Release ) ) ; if ( ptrXyz ) { ptrXyz -> Foo ( 42 ) ; }
Exception Safety
In the same way as a COM interface is not allowed to leak any internal exception , the abstract C++ interface cannot let any internal exception to break through DLL boundaries .
Class methods should use return codes to indicate an error .
The implementation for handling C++ exceptions is very specific to each compiler , and can not be shared .
So , in this respect , an abstract C++ interface should behave as a plain C function .
Advantages
An exported C++ class can be used via an abstract interface , with any C++ compiler .
C run-time libraries of a DLL and a client are independent of each other .
Since resource acquisition and freeing happens entirely inside a DLL module , a client is not affected by a DLL 's choice of CRT .
True module separation is achieved .
The resulting DLL module can be redesigned and rebuilt without affecting the rest of the project .
A DLL module can be easily converted to a full - fledged COM module , if required .
Disadvantages
An explicit function call is required to create a new object instance and to delete it .
A smart pointer can spare a developer of the latter call , though .
An abstract interface method cannot return or accept a regular C++ object as a parameter .
It has be either a built - in type ( like int , double , char* , etc. ) or another abstract interface .
It is the same limitation as for COM interfaces .
What About STL Template Classes ?
The Standard C++ Library containers ( like vector , list , or map ) and other templates were not designed with DLL modules in mind .
The C++ Standard is silent about DLLs because this is a platform specific technology , and it is not necessarily present on other platforms where the C++ language is used .
Currently , the MS Visual C++ compiler can export and import instantiations of STL classes which a developer explicitly marks with the __declspec( dllexport / dllimport ) specifier .
The compiler emits a couple of nasty warnings , but it works .
However , one must remember that exporting STL template instantiations is in no way different from exporting regular C++ classes , with all accompanying limitations .
So , there is nothing special about STL in that respect .
Summary
The article discussed different methods of exporting a C++ object from a DLL module .
Detailed description is given of the advantages and disadvantages for each method .
Exception safety considerations are outlined .
The following conclusions are made :
Exporting an object as a set of plain C functions has an advantage of being compatible with the widest range of development environments and programming languages .
However , a DLL user is required to use outdated C techniques or to provide additional wrappers over the C interface in order to use modern programming paradigms .
Exporting a regular C++ class is no different than providing a separate static library with the C++ code .
The usage is very simple and familiar ; however , there is a tight coupling between the DLL and its client .
The same version of the same C++ compiler must be used , both for the DLL and its client .
Declaring an abstract member - less class and implementing it inside a DLL module is the best approach to export C++ objects , so far .
This method provides a clean , well - defined object oriented interface between the DLL and its client .
Such a DLL can be used with any modern C++ compiler on the Windows platform .
The usage of an interface in conjunction with smart pointers is almost as easy as the usage of an exported C++ class .
The C++ programming language is a powerful , versatile , and flexible development instrument .
" Repeal the Second Amendment , " The Chicago Tribune editorialized .
" The Supreme Court on Thursday all but ensured that even more Americans will die , " said The New York Times .
" [ T ]he Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms only in relation to service in a state militia . " added The Washington Post .
Those are a few of many editorial expressions of disgust from the mainstream media over the Supreme Court 's ruling that when the Bill of Rights says that " the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , " it includes the right to possess guns for self - defense , and not merely a right to be armed as a member of the National Guard .
What has caused so much confusion about the Amendment is its preface : " A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state ... "
In striking down Washington , D.C. 's three - decade - old handgun ban , Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the preface merely " announces the purpose for which the right was codified : to prevent elimination of the militia " by the new national government .
" The prefatory clause , " he continued , " does not suggest that preserving the militia was the only reason Americans valued the ancient right ; most undoubtedly thought it even more important for self - defense and hunting . "
But for the four dissenters , the preface limits the right to keep and bear arms to military purposes .
In their view , if the Framers of the Second Amendment wanted private individuals to have guns for hunting and self - defense , they would have said so .
Justice John Paul Stevens points to " the Second Amendment 's omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self - defense . "
I suppose one could argue that the omission indicates the Framers of the Constitution did n't mean to protect that right .
But I find that hard to believe .
The right of self - defense -- against homegrown tyrants as well as common criminals -- was much on the minds of Americans in the late 18th century .
Thomas Jefferson said , " [ W ] hat country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance ?
Let them take arms . "
But there is something else that many analysts of the decision have missed .
The Bill of Rights did not create rights .
It acknowledged them .
Right before the July 4 holiday , it should n't have been necessary to remind the four Supreme Court dissenters of what Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence :
" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
... "
The Framers of the Second Amendment did not say , " The people shall have the right to keep and bear arms . "
They wrote , " the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
This is n't just theory .
The Cato's Institute 's [ www.cato.org]
Tom Palmer , an early plaintiff in the D.C. gun case , told " 20/20 " he is alive today because he was carrying a handgun when he was approached on the street by some toughs .
" They told us , ' We 're going to kill you . '
I showed them the business end of a pistol .
They turned around , went away . "
The four dissenting justices fear the Supreme Court 's decision will unleash a flood of gun violence .
Unlikely .
" Criminals do not have a problem getting guns , " Palmer reminded me .
It 's law - abiding people who suffer when guns are banned .
The victims of gun crimes are easy to count .
What can not be counted are the lives saved because would - be victims were armed .
Palmer 's confrontation is one of many that did n't make the news .
He asks , " If someone gets into your house , which would you rather have , a handgun or a telephone ?
You can call the police if you want , and they 'll get there and they 'll make a crime report and take a picture of your dead body .
" They can't get there in time to save your life . "

The Art of the Metaobject Protocol is one of the most important books ever written on the subject of building abstractions with objects .
The Metaobject Protocol is a system for defining your own object semantics , such as the simple aspects described here .
While you ’re learning how to make your programs better in your language , you just might pick up a little Common Lisp .
Highly recommended .
CLOS
class Manager : private Employee { ... }
delegate :calculate_annual_bonus , :something_serious , : to => @employee_helper
In a test - infected project , the meaning of “ Manager IS - AN Employee ” is external to the Employee class , it is in the tests .
Object Design : Roles , Responsibilities , and Collaborations focuses on the practice of designing objects as integral members of a community where each object has specific roles and responsibilities .
The authors present the latest practices and techniques of Responsibility - Driven Design and show how you can apply them as you develop modern object - based applications .
There are other approaches : Eiffel ’s Design by Contract implementation provides preconditions and post - conditions for methods .
As long as a subclass conforms to or narrows its superclass ’ post - conditions , and conforms to or widens its superclass ’ preconditions , it may override a method .
Design by Contract takes the view that the pre-conditions and post - conditions are the contract for a method .
Given that understanding of Liskov Equivalence , the language is provides both compiler and run-time enforcement options .
Code that adds notification or logging to a superclass ’ methods obviously conforms to its post - conditions , so Eiffel permits it without arguing about whether the method should be final or not .
Design by Contract also lies in between Plain and Strict Equivalence : Although the Employee class contains code , you cannot rely on it as a guide to what an Employee does .
In Eiffel , you can rely on the post - conditions to be enforced , which are typically looser than the method implementation but tighter than a method signature without conditions .
[ back ]
Maxims like this drive me crazy .
On the one hand , there in one sentence is some of the best advice I can imagine for designing Object - Oriented software .
On the other hand , following this advice without any idea why one favors one over the other , without any idea when class inheritance is the right thing to do …
As Basho said , “ Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old ; seek what they sought .
” Perhaps of the maxim “ Favor object composition over class inheritance ” is what happens when we seek what they sought , when we question the fundamentals , when we ask ourselves , “ So : What does it mean when we go to the design white board ( or pick up a 3x5 card in a design session ) and boldly write : ???
Commenting on IS - A IS - A HAS - A , Robert Fisher pointed out that there is no definitive meaning to inheritance in programming languages .
Another reader reminded him that Bertrand Meyer ’s Object - Oriented Software Construction identifies no fewer than twelve ( ! ) kinds of inheritance .
I took that to support Robert ’s point : if there really are twelve different kinds of inheritance , it is easy to see how two reasonable , intelligent people could each write “ A IS - A B ” and mean two completely different things .
There is one argument — the compiler always wins — where the only thing that matters is what a program does .
A program ’s code means whatever effect the program has when it runs .
So when you organize your code around a result like the fastest possible performance , or the smallest possible program , and in doing so you use features like inheritance strictly because they help your technical objective and not because you think they carry any meaning .
This practice is programming for the compiler .
Smeone who is programming for the compiler does n’t even think in terms of “ IS - A , ” , they think directly in their language ’s features — like interfaces , abstract classes , or modules .
I appreciate that point of view , but I believe that we can produce even better software if we decide that language features like inheritance have a semantic meaning above and beyond what the compiler does with them .
Especially when we are considering projects that have multiple programmers working on them over a substantial period of time .
Such projects must produce sustainable code , not just code that works today .
When we have a shared understanding of inheritance ’s semantic meaning , our code more closely resembles the problem it solves .
If it is just an engineering tool , a statement like Manager IS - AN Employee may have no parallel in the real world .
Are managers really employees ?
When we declare other relationships such as HAS - MANY , we work very hard to make our code model the real world .
Why would IS - AN be any different ?
That being said , there seem to be as many opinions of what class inheritance means as there are programmers .
Do any two programmers — much less a full team — agree on exactly what “ Manager IS - AN Employee ” means if Employee and Manager are both classes ?
All I can do is share is a meaning that has worked well for me : Strict Equivalence .
I ’m going to describe what I mean and illustrate some of the consequences of adopting this as the standard meaning of “ IS - A ” on your project .
( I am not trying to say that Strict Equivalence is the only or even best way to build OO systems : I have worked on many projects with a different understanding , and they worked out just fine . )
You know the Liskov Substitution Principle , of course .
In short , if X IS - A Y , then anywhere you could use a Y , you can substitute an X and things should Just Work .
So if every Manager IS - AN Employee , every piece of code that operates on Employees can operate on Managers and Just Work .
What I just said is the Liskov Substitution Principle , but there is a lot of room for discussion over what ‘ just works ’ means .
So here is something much more specific , Strict Equivalence .
A client is a piece of code that uses an entity .
Strict Equivalence is the following property : X IS - A Y if and only if it is the case that for every client that uses an object of class Y , you can substitute an object of class X and the results from the perspective of the client are indistinguishable .
Note that clients expecting an X can presumably distinguish an X from a Y , but that ’s because they know about the differences between X and Y .
Note also , and with emphasis , that we are talking about classes .
Specifically , concrete classes .
If X and Y are Java interfaces or C++ abstract base classes , there is no difference between Strict Equivalence and Liskov Substitutability , which leads to a completely different maxim , “ program to interfaces and not implementations , ” or my preferred interpretation —
“ Favour exposing interfaces over exposing implementations .
” This is not the same as Liskov Substitutability .
With Liskov Substitutability , X IS - A Y if and only if it is the case that for every client that uses an object of class Y , you can substitute an object of class X and the results will be semantically valid although they may differ from the perspective of the client .
Again , we are talking about a case where the client is using a Y , not using an interface .
For example : This code is a client that uses and depends on objects of class Y , not an interface that Y implements .
One of the nice properties of Strict Equivalence is that it also guarantees semantic validity :
It guarantees that you can substitute an X for a Y and since the results are indistinguishable to a client expecting a Y , the results will be semantically valid as well .
Therefore , Strict Equivalence is a specialization of Liskov Substitutability .
So if you like Liskov Substitutability , you ought to also like Strict Equivalence .
But it is still a specialization , and a very restricted specialization at that .
Let ’s see how .
Consider something very basic .
Overriding a method .
Is n’t that what you ’re supposed to do ?
You have a method in a superclass , but you need a different , more specialized behaviour in the subclass .
This is OOP 101 .
And it ’s usually wrong .
Okay , wrong is a strong word .
It ’s usually a violation of Strict Equivalence .
Let ’s have a look at why .
Take our Employees and Managers , where every Manager IS - AN Employee .
We want to have a calculate_annual_bonus method for employees .
You can imagine writing it , blah - blah personal goals set in performance review , blah - blah overall division profit .
Now what happens with managers ?
Perhaps the business rule is that managers get 10 % of the bonus of each of their reports , like anplan .
So you write something like : ( You can easily imagine the Java equivalent , starting with public class Manager extends Employee … )
With Liskov Substitutability , everything is fine : you have some code that transfers a bonus to an employee ’s bank account .
It asks the employee object to calculate the annual bonus , and it transfers that amount .
Nice .
But Strict Equivalence prohibits this simple and common construction .
The reason this is prohibited is that if we allow a subclass to override the bonus calculation , we have effectively declared that the amount of annual bonus is arbitrary for employees .
Our code says that the correct calculation is , but in reality when we have an employee object , that may not be true .
Overriding the annual bonus calculation breaks the declared behaviour of the Employee class .
It is no different than if some code in your Manager class reached out like a ninja and redefined the calculate_annual_bonus method in the employee class .
From the perspective of a client using an employee object , how is that different ?
With Strict Equivalence , you may only override the annual bonus calculation if client code like pay_annual_bonuses cannot tell the difference .
So when I am looking at the Employee class , I ca n’t tell whether someone has written a Manager class .
But I do have confidence that if they do write a Manager class , they are not to override the calculate_annual_bonus calculation in a way that breaks my code : whatever they do , it must be indistinguishable to me .
Strict Equivalence seems at first to violate the whole point of polymorphism .
Why should a client know or care what a method does ?
Why should it rely on a what an Employee defines as the correct calculation for an annual bonus ?
One argument in favour of overriding is to talk about the separation of interface and implementation .
Orthodox OO teaches that a class ’s interface is its collection of method signatures , and its implementation is what those methods happen to do .
The notion is that clients should program to the interface only : the implementation is the class ’s private business .
This practice is reified in C++ , where the public interface of a class is found in a separate header file from the implementation .
Sounds good .
Now what happens with Java ?
In Java , a class ’s interface and its implementation are in the same file .
But if you want to give someone just the collection of method signatures , Java provides interfaces .
So if you as the author wish to have clients program strictly to method signatures , you can give them an interface .
The point here is that Strict Equivalence is not in conflict with orthodox interface - oriented design : they can live happily side - by - side if you simply use interfaces when you mean interfaces , abstract methods when you mean abstract methods , and if you think twice before providing a concrete method in a class your provide to clients .
The difference comes up when you ask a client to use a class and provide an actual working method .
In our example , we deliberately put behaviour in the Employee class , even though we have alternatives .
In Ruby , we could borrow an idiom from Smalltalk and write :
In Java , we could declare it to be an abstract method :
Is that so hard ?
This conforms perfectly to Strict Equivalence .
The Employee class guarantees that there is a calculateAnnualBonus method , but it does n’t guarantee what it will be .
There is a protected helper method so that each subclass does n’t have to repeat the calculation .
And you can see that both the Contributor and Manager classes guarantee the exact calculation .
We chose to provide clients with an Employee class that defined the exact calculation for the annual bonus .
Given that we could have written our code another way , why should n’t a client assume that we deliberately wanted them to depend on the calculation ?
Why should n’t a client infer that the annual bonus calculation is part of the definition of what it means to be an employee ?
In Management Science , a Theory X manager believes “ workers need to be closely supervised and comprehensive systems of controls developed . ”
A Theory Y manager “ will try to remove the barriers that prevent workers from fully actualizing themselves .
” Some languages provide tools for enforcing some of the semantics of Liskov Equivalence .
I personally have mixed feelings about this .
I actually like this idea of the compiler noticing that I am trying to call the non-existent annual_bonus method of an Employee object .
And enforcing Strict Equivalence would be terrific .
But what I do n’t like is actually not the language ’s fault .
I do n’t like it when I have to deal with a code base where people assume that as long as they are following the language ’s rules , the result must be well - designed OO software .
So net - net , I like languages providing mechanisms for enforcing obvious things about inheritance .
But philosophically , I want to seek what the language designers sought and design to the principle of the law , not the letter of the law .
Let ’s talk about Java first .
Java provides two tools — the abstract and final keywords — for partially enforcing Strict Equivalence .
As shown above , an abstract method lets us declare that all Employees have a calculate_annual_bonus method without making any guarantee as to what it will return .
A final method lets us declare that its calculation is invariant .
If we write : Then we know that all Employees have the same calculation .
It is illegal to implement a different calculation for the Manager subclass .
And by extension , if we fail to mark a method final , we know that its implementation is not guaranteed .
A non-final method in a non-final Java class is unreliable , it ’s just like functionality without a test in a test - infected program .
It ispart of a class ’ contract with its clients .
I conjecture that this is the basis of the suggestion that methods should be final by default .
If a class is not final and it has a non-final method , you can override it and break Strict Equivalence .
So with Java , if you want a method ’s behaviour to be part of a class ’ contract with its clients , you have to make it final .
There is a shortcoming to this system .
It is possible to override a method without breaking Strict Equivalence .
The limitation of using the final keyword ( or whatever tool your compiler gives you to prevent overriding ) is that it prohibits a very large class of specializations that are useful and do not violate Strict Equivalence .
It is as if the Police Chief decided to fight crime by imposing a curfew on the entire town .
It is not that all ways of overriding a method break Strict Equivalence .
Let ’s go back to our employees for a moment :
This is a little contrived , but the point here is that although a Probationary Employee overrides the something_serious method , it does so in a way that is presumably indistinguishable from the perspective of client code .
It does something serious and returns the same result , but there is an extra side - effect that matters to probationary employees and their managers .
This conforms to Strict Equivalence because to a client method , the results are identical .
A Probationary Employee will pass the same tests and you can insert assertions as you see fit .
The only problem is , how do we know that Probationary Employee adheres to Strict Equivalence and Manager does not ?
How can programmers write code like something_serious ?
Just writing any old method , calling super , and hoping that you have n’t broken the Employee class is rather like tossing salt over your shoulder to ward off evil spirits .
And never overriding Employee methods is rather drastic .
What to do ?
Solving problems like this is a lot of the motivation behind Aspect - Oriented Programming systems like Lisp ’s Flavors & CLOS , the Decorator Pattern , and method chaining in Rails .
The principle is that a subclass does n’t really override a superclass ’ method , it extends its functionality .
Meaning , it typically does something before it , something after it , or something around it .
It decorates the method , it does n’t replace it .
In the example above , it is not really obvious that we are decorating the Employee # something_serious method .
That happens to be a side - effect of what we are doing , but it is not obvious at all .
Compare and contrast with a little easy AOP magic based on Rails ’ object life - cycle style of coding :
This style of coding makes it obvious that we are attempting to maintain Strict Equivalence .
Of course , we can abuse AOP and write advice that breaks our equivalence .
100 % enforcement of Strict Equivalence while permitting things like AOP is probably impossible in the compiler .
But we can make languages that encourage good programming .
I honestly believe that if I have a powerful way to write advice — like CLOS or AOP — I could live with never overriding methods .
Forget methods being final by default , I think I would be happy with methods always being final if I can have subclasses decorate them .
Ruby , of course , does not enforce anything .
Java provides some enforcement with its final keyword , but at a cost : subclasses cannot decorate final methods .
On the whole , Java is not worse than Ruby for enforcement , because if you do n’t declare a method final , you are no worse off than in Ruby .
In Ruby ’s favour , you can actually write things like EasyAOP in a few minutes .
Better still , you can tweak it to suit your project and its domain .
For Java , you probably need to use a heavyweight AOP framework to do the same thing .
Or maybe you can chuck all of that and use .
You could do a lot worse .
Wow , that ’s a lot of flummery over the statement “ Manager IS - AN Employee . ”
As we have seen , there are a lot of guarantees that statement makes , especially if you adopt Strict Equivalence .
You may not want to make those guarantees .
You may not really mean that a manager is an employee , you may mean that a manager has a lot in common with an employee .
So what to do ?
Well , all this trouble started because we said that a Manager IS - AN Employee .
What if it is n’t ?
What we want is a relationship often called WAS -A .
Or it ’s technical name , implementation inheritance .
We want to say that a Manager uses the code of an Employee , but it is n’t to be used where you expect an employee .
In C++ , you can use private inheritance .
The Manager class would obtain all of an Employee ’s members and methods , and it could expose the ones it wanted as part of its own interface : A Manager is not an employee .
It is its own thing that happens to behave a lot like an employee .
In languages like Java that do not provide a WAS - A construct , you can achieve the same thing with delegation .
You can say a Manager HAS - AN Employee .
It does n’t really have one in the sense of a manager having an executive assistant , but it uses an Employee object internally to handle some of its work .
This is very much like a manager who has two ‘ hats . ’
It works well if you have been careful to separate things like the implementation of database persistence from the semantic hierarchy of public inheritance .
In other words , you did n’t decide that an Employee IS - AN ActiveRecord : : Base .
In other words …
If a Manager is not an employee in the true sense of the word but is simply like an employee , we can use object composition to achieve code re-use and communicate to our fellow programmers what managers and employees have in common , without muddying the meaning of IS - A.
So what have we seen ?
First , that if you adopt Strict Equivalence , standard inheritance carries a great deal of meaning with it .
You can infer that the code in a class describes the behaviour of that class and all of its subclasses :
The Employee class describes all employees , even probationary employees and managers .
Subclasses extend functionality but never break it .
Second , that there are many alternatives to breaking Strict Equivalence , including refactoring the class hierarchy when you need polymorphism and using object composition when you do not .
This means that we never need to use inheritance , we only use it when we choose to make guarantees about equivalence .
In Programming conventions as signals , I advanced the view that when there was more than one way to do something , each should carry a different meaning .
And furthermore , when one way is the obvious way to do it , using the non-obvious way was a signal that there was something non-obvious going on .
This obviously applies to choosing between class inheritance and object composition .
Both can be used to express the idea that two classes or objects have something in common .
Class inheritance carries heavyweight baggage along with it about the semantics of IS - A. Object composition does not .
Therefore , class inheritance is the more “ expensive ” of the two to maintain , because it has the most serious implications and constraints on code .
Object composition is cheaper because it makes no guarantees , it is a convenience mechanism .
If class inheritance required a pattern and some boilerplate to establish , while object composition was as simple as writing :… then there would have been no need for the maxim .
Unluckily for us , the popular OO languages make class inheritance cheap to write in code even though it is expensive to maintain , while object composition is expensive to write in code while being cheap to maintain .
Thus , we need a maxim to remind ourselves that while class inheritance is seductively easy to write , it should be reserved for those cases where it expresses our actual semantic meaning and where imposing its implications and constraints on our code is going to make things cheaper and not more expensive to maintain .
Favor object composition over class inheritance .
Now we understand a little of where those six words are heading .
Digression : Test - Driven EquivalenceConsider the requirement that a user of the code be unable to distinguish a subclass from a superclass in a Test - Infected project .
You have dozens or even hundreds of tests for each major class .
What about all of those unit tests .
Should a unit test for the Employee class work when given Manager objects ?
Hmmm .
If a Manager IS - AN Employee , it follows that a Manager can be substituted for an Employee and the tests will pass .
If an Employee test breaks when given a manager , we must pick one of two possibilities :
First , it is possible that we were wrong to state that a Manager IS - AN Employee .
We should have chosen a different structure for our classes .
The second possibility is that the test is inappropriate .
We might say that the bonus calculation for an employee is uncertain , that the exact amount of the bonus is not part of the ‘ spec ’ for the Employee class .
Therefore , we should n’t have a test that validates the amount of an employee ’s bonus .
I can address this point easily : if we ca n’t test it , it does n’t work , therefore if there should n’t be a test that works for every employee , then there should n’t be code associated with every employee .
So above we stated that according to Strict Equivalence , the code in the Employee class makes a guarantee about all employees .
However in a test - infected project , we can take another line .
When I say test - infected , I mean specifically that the team has made a commitment to 100 % functional coverage in the project , and the team considers the tests to be a form of executable documentation for the code .
If this is the case for a project , it follows that the tests for a class must reflect the contractual obligations of that class to its clients .
If we write a test that only passes when an Employee ’s annual bonus is such - and - such an amount , that is the amount of bonus for all employees .
If we want subclasses of Employee to have their own bonus calculations , we are free to provide a default or base implementation , but we are prohibited from writing a unit test for it .
You may think “ That ’s ok , my unit test directly creates an Employee object , it does n’t create a Manager object , so the test is not making a guarantee about Managers . ”
If you take that line , you have removed all possibility of using the tests to make guarantees about Employees .
You cannot say anything about objects that are Employees , because your tests do n’t apply to all employees .
This effectively eliminates the IS - A relationship in your test - infected project , because when I am looking at a Manager class , the fact that it derives from Employee tells me nothing , because I ca n’t trust any of the Employee tests to tell me something about Managers .
Therefore , if you believe that an Employee test does not constrain the behaviour of a Manager object , you are required to duplicate all of the Employee tests that apply to Manager instances in Manager tests .
You have moved the problem of what is inherited and what is not inherited from the Employee and Manager classes into your test classes .
In a test - infected project , the meaning of “ Manager IS - AN Employee ” is external to the Employee class , it is in the tests .
It also conforms to the Liskov Substitution Principle : it demands that whatever the superclass provides its clients , all of its subclasses must also provide .
However , it is more relaxed than Strict Equivalence .
Most of us have already known this for years , but now it ’s been officially confirmed .
Ex -White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said in a recent interview that FOX News is often provided literal talking points by the White House for its “ primetime propagandists . ”
“ Does anyone actually believe the right wing stuff they spout ? ”
Asks the MSNBC anchor .
Now , it ’s not like McClellan is some hero here .
Obviously , he knew about this problem way beforehand , but only decided to come out about it after he was retired .
For God ’s sake look at the footage of him and Bush together !
They might as well be holding hands .
While it ’s not rare for Fox News to be humiliated ( in fact there is even a website dedicated to it ) , the video clearly shows how Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity are mere Ventriloquist Dummies for the Bush Administration .
It probably wo n’t happen , but I ’m hoping that this finally brings an end to the “ Fair and Balanced ” station for good .
Let us take this time to countdown the hours that FOX News has left to live .
For many people , losing weight seems like an impossible task .
“ I do n’t have the willpower ! ” they say .
But it does n’t have to be that hard .
The basic rule of weight loss is that you take in fewer calories than you burn — and if you want to turn a positive calorie balance into the calorie deficit you need to lose weight , just make some smart choices in what you eat and drink , and how you burn calories .
The second rule of weight loss is that if you take in 3,500 fewer calories than you burn , you ’ll ( generally ) lose a pound of fat .
So if you can have a calorie deficit of 500 calories a day , you ’ll burn a pound of fat a week ( 7 times 500 is 3,500 ) , which is about 50 pounds a year .
If you have been maintaining the same weight for a little while , you are taking in the same amount of calories as you ’re burning .
So you just need to choose a few of the options below to lose 50 pounds in a year .
However , if you ’ve been gaining weight , you ’ll need to choose a few more of the options below to go into calorie deficit .
Remember that 50 pounds a year is only about 4 pounds a month , so you wo n’t notice a huge drop in the first month .
Be patient , stick with it , and you ’ll start to see weight loss in the following months .
Also remember that with any of the changes below , it ’s hardest for the first few days .
After that , you get used to it , and it gets easier .
Drink water .
If you typically drink lots of juice or soda or alcohol , replacing these calorie - filled drinks with water will cut a few hundred calories a day .
Exercise for 15 - 20 minutes .
If you have a weight problem , chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise .
That ’s probably because you tried to do too much .
Just commit to 15 minutes a day .
That ’s not hard at all .
And do n’t do anything intense , especially for the first month .
Take it easy — do a few crunches , a few push ups , jog in place for a few minutes .
If you do this every day , you ’ll burn 100 - 150 calories , depending on your size and metabolism .
Replace a fatty snack with veggies .
Potato chips , fries , anything that ’s greasy — those are laden with calories .
Fat is the most calorie - filled food type there is .
If you eat a snack like this every day , replace it with cut - up carrots , broccoli , celery , or a salad ( with low - fat dressing , not anything fatty ) .
Have sex daily .
One of the best exercises there is .
Of course , you ’ll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes .
If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day , you can burn 150 calories .
You also might need to find a willing partner .
The exercise in the item above might help with that .
Replace a sugary snack with fruits .
If you eat Twinkies , Ding Dongs , donuts , candy bars , a carton of ice cream … you know you need to cut those out .
Try fruit instead .
Berries are my favorite .
Eat a healthy breakfast .
If you eat eggs and bacon , or something covered in syrup , or anything else sweet or fatty , replace it with something healthier .
Steel - cut oatmeal with blueberries , ground flaxseed and almonds is a great choice that is delicious .
Also try whole - grain cereal with low - fat milk or soy milk .
Walk , and use the stairs .
Park 5 - 7 minutes away from work , which adds up to about 10 - 15 minutes of walking a day , to and from work ( in addition to the exercise mentioned above ) .
Use the stairs instead of the elevator .
That ’s about 100 calories total .
Use non -fat milk in your latte .
If you use half - and - half in your latte , using non -fat milk will save you about 250 calories .
Skip butter .
If you put butter on your toast , your roll , and your baked potato , you can save 200- 300 calories a day if you skip the butter .
Plan snacks , do n’t snack randomly .
Munching on little things here and there , throughout the day , can add up to hundreds of calories .
Instead , plan on a midmorning and mid afternoon snack , and make at least one of them healthy .
Do n’t snack in between snacks .
.
Munching on little things here and there , throughout the day , can add up to hundreds of calories .
Instead , plan on a midmorning and mid afternoon snack , and make at least one of them healthy .
Do n’t snack in between snacks .
Go with red pasta sauce , not white .
Marinara sauce instead of Alfredo will save you a couple hundred calories .
Skip the meat too .
Eat baked chicken , not fried .
Fried chicken contains a lot of fat absorbed from frying oil , as well as the fatty skin .
Skip the skin , and bake the chicken .
Herb it up good , with some pepper , and it tastes great .
Skip seconds , and eat slower .
If you go back for an extra piece of meat and buttered bread , you ’re adding another few hundred calories .
Instead , eat slowly , and you ’ll get full faster .
Also , even if feel hungry after the first helping , wait for 20 minutes .
Often , the feeling of hunger will go away .
Air - pop popcorn .
Movie popcorn is full of oil and butter .
Tons of fat .
Instead , air - pop the popcorn .
You can put salt on it , but not butter .
Go for pretzels , not peanuts .
Nuts contain tons of calories .
Instead , snack on mini-pretzels ( not the soft kind ) , which can satisfy the salt craving without all of the fat .
Skip the muffin .
Muffins are just cake , if you buy them at a coffee shop , donut shop , or grocery store .
You can make your own muffins that do n’t contain all that fat and sugar , but instead , try eating the healthy breakfasts mentioned above .

Well my friends , JRuby is a world of mystery and amazement .
In the past few days the JRuby team has been working feverishly on their Java integration rewrite .
Along the way Charles Nutter managed to clean up the number of layers a Ruby call had to go through to get to Java .
The net result : my test case for Gemini that I posted about earlier when from a frame rate of 27 fps to 40 fps .
None of my actual code changed , I just swapped out the jruby .
jar for a newer build .
Swapping them back takes me back down to the 27 fps range .
So , mana does fall from heaven occasionally , at least in JRuby land .

On September 23 , join women and men across the country to call on the cleaning products industry to reveal their hidden ingredients .
You deserve to know if there are toxic chemicals in your cleaning products .
For the last year Women ’s Voices for the Earth ( WVE ) has been working directly with manufacturers and industry representatives to get this critical information to the public :
Read the first letter from WVE : First request to cleaning companies
: First request to cleaning companies
Read the responses from the companies : Company responses
: Company responses
Read the second request from WVE : Second request from companies
: Second request from companies Read Household Hazards , highlighting two health risks associated with chemicals in cleaning products , asthma and reproductive harm .
Because no laws exist requiring cleaning product companies to disclose their ingredients , we still do n’t know if the products we use every day will cause long - term health impacts .
Women ’s Voices for the Earth is asking for your help .
The Soap and Detergent Association ( SDA ) , the industry group that represents most major cleaning products manufacturers , is holding their fall conference in Washington , DC from September 23 – 25 .
One topic of discussion could be the hundreds of calls they get from people like you demanding to know what ingredients are in your cleaning products
Pledge now to make a call on Tuesday , September 23 .
What happens next Tuesday ?
On Tuesday , September 23 , we urge you to call the SDA at 202-347-2900 and leave the following message for SDA President Ernie Rosenberg :
“ I ’m a consumer and I want the SDA to support ingredient disclosure on cleaning product labels so I have the information I need to make informed choices . ”
I took the pledge to call .
Will you join us on September 23 ?
Let ’s make sure they hear us loud and clear !

Incredible pictures of Mars - and they look surprisingly like some parts of Earth
Ever since Victorian astronomers pointed their telescopes towards Mars and wrongly believed they had discovered canals , mankind has been obsessed by the red planet .
Now these astonishing new images - captured by a European spacecraft in orbit around Mars - are helping to fuel that fascination .
They show in astonishing detail a network of giant valleys , vast plains and towering waterfalls carved into the surface of our neighbouring planet , millions of miles away .
Spectacular : A view of Echus Chasma , one of the largest water source regions on Mars , showing a network of valleys
And while Mars today appears lifeless and parched , they are a reminder of how its surface was shaped by fast flowing streams , rivers and oceans .
The pictures were captured by the European Space Agency 's Mars Express Probe - a spacecraft the size of a large fridge - freezer that has been circling Mars since Christmas 2003 .
Mars Express infamously gave Britain 's ill - fated Beagle 2 probe a lift to Mars .
While that mission ended in disaster , the Mars Express has been a fantastic success .
Over the last five years its stereo , high resolution camera has taken thousands of images of the surface , revealing the planet 's awe inspiring beauty in unprecedented detail .
The latest images show the Echus Chasma , a vast valley just north of Mars equator around 62 miles long and six miles wide .
The feature is cut into a high plateau and its steep - sided cliffs - some 12,000 feet high - bear a striking resemblance to the canyons of North America .
Barren : Located on the eastern part of Echus Chasma is this cliff which is up to 4,000 metres high
Thunderous waterfalls may have once plunged over these cliffs , from the high Lunea Planum plateau that surrounds the Echus Chasma , on to the valley floor below .
Some of the images show a five mile wide impact crater formed when asteroids - lumps of floating rock in space - smashed into Mars .
Others show a 15 mile long dyke formed when molten rock , evidence of Mars 's volcanic past .
At the edges of the main valley lie smaller light - coloured tributary valleys or " sapping canyons " - around six miles long and 1800 feet deep .
The Echus Chasma - described by Nasa as one of the largest water sources on the planet - is connected to a much bigger valley system called the Kasei Valles which extends thousands of miles to the north .
Both valleys are impressive - but are dwarfed by an even larger canyon which lies to the south .
The Valles Marineris is four miles deep in places , around 120 miles wide and 2,500 miles long .
Echus Chasma is the source region of Kasei Valles , which extends 3,000 km to the north
The images were created by combining pictures taken from different orbits .
The images can be viewed from different angles in three dimensions
Mars Express launched in June 2003 .
The craft is a cube around 5 ft by 6ft by 5ft with two 60ft long radar antennae .
It is photographing the entire surface of Mars in high resolution , producing a detailed colour map of the minerals on the surface , mapping the atmosphere and probing beneath the surface using radar .
Interest in Mars is at an all time high .
Nasa and ESA have announced plans to bring back rocks and soil samples from Mars , while Nasa has three probes on the planet - two rovers and its Phoenix polar lander , which arrived in May .
The Phoenix has scraped ice from beneath the surface of Mars and is analysing samples in its laboratory to see if the planet has the right chemicals needed for life .
In 2013 , ESA is planning to launch ExoMars - a robotic rover than will explore the planet 's surface .
If successful , it will be Europe 's first mission to the Martian surface .
Scientists unveiled plans on Monday to bring back rocks from the Red Planet as a preliminary step to putting a man on Mars .
Professor Monica Grady , at the Open University , co-chaired the expert panel that wrote the mission proposal .
She said it was a vital next step before considering a crewed mission .
' If you can't bring a rock back you are not going to be able to bring people back , ' she said .
MIAMI ( AP ) —
Almost fifty - five years ago , Dr. Jorge Vallejo told his colleagues at a Havana hospital that he needed to rush home to check on one of his toddler sons who had a fever .
That was a lie .
He actually went home to pack some clothes before he , his wife and two boys boarded a torpedo boat named “ La Gaviota . ”
Before the sun rose the next day , the Vallejos and other Cuban refugees sailed across the Florida Straits , braving a storm that left them stranded at sea .
The U.S. Coast Guard rescued them and towed the boat into Key West , where Vallejo began a new chapter in the U.S. , eventually establishing himself as a prominent OB - GYN in a community of exiles and the patriarch of a family of Cuban American doctors .
“ He took a big chance , ” said his oldest son , Dr. Jorge Vallejo Jr. , who grew up hearing stories of the treacherous journey where waves rose as high as 12 feet ( 4 meters ) .
“ He came over with $ 100 in his pocket . ”
Jorge Jr. became a geriatric psychiatrist , and the younger boy on that voyage , Carlos , grew up to become a doctor of internal medicine .
A third son Freddy , born in Miami , is a dentist .
Described as a family man by his sons and grandchildren , Vallejo was hospitalized with the coronavirus in June — the night before Father ’s Day .
Hours later , his son Dr. Carlos Vallejo , who had been treating elderly people with COVID - 19 , was taken to another hospital with shortness of breath from the virus .
They both later died — at ages 89 and 57 .
“ This is the most pain we have endured in our lives , ” said Jorge Vallejo Jr .
___
EDITOR ’S NOTE :
This is part of an ongoing series of stories remembering people who have died from the coronavirus around the world .
___
The elder Vallejo was born in Guantanamo , Cuba , on June 12 , 1931 , and became a doctor at Havana ’s Calixto Garcia Hospital .
He was n’t part of the first postrevolutionary migrant wave , when Fidel Castro took power in 1959 and tens of thousands of Cubans left the island fearing political persecution .
After the revolution , he married Gisela Vallejo , an accountant 's daughter , and they lived in a high - rise condominium overlooking Havana ’s seafront Malecon , his surviving sons said .
Jorge Vallejo opposed Castro 's radical economic reforms but hoped they were only temporary .
He watched tensions grow between the U.S. and Cuba after Washington imposed a trade embargo .
Hope diminished after the failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later .
The 13 - day nuclear standoff in 1962 interrupted commercial flights between the countries .
As months went by with Castro still in power , Vallejo , who by then had two young boys , began plotting his way out .
In 1965 , his brother secured spots in an old navy torpedo boat out of Camarioca , a village east of Havana where the government had begun fixing a port after seeing Cubans risk their lives in homemade rafts .
Sailings by boat , however , also were dangerous and lasted less than a month after the Vallejos arrived in the Florida Keys .
Threatening weather , inexperienced crews and overcrowded boats marked this short - lived refugee crisis .
The risky expeditions prompted negotiations to allow U.S. - funded flights of thousands of Cubans per month for years to follow .
Jorge Vallejo recounted to his children and grandchildren the storm the family encountered before the Coast Guard rescued them and towed their boat into the Florida Keys .
The Vallejos settled in the Miami suburb of Hialeah — like many Cuban exiles — and he began working hospital jobs as a surgical assistant .
He studied to pass the exams needed as a foreign medical graduate to apply for a medical residency at Mount Sinai hospital in Miami Beach .
He learned English but preferred speaking his native Spanish , like most of his patients .
His family said he treated celebrities such as Cuban singer Celia Cruz , whose song “ La Vida es un Carnaval ” and her version of “ Guantanamera ” were his favorites .
Vallejo liked to wear guayabera shirts and frequent the same Cuban restaurants , and he also enjoyed simply chatting over a Cuban - style espresso .
“ I would make him a ‘ cafecito , ' and we would sit and talk , ” said his grandson Freddy Vallejo .
“ He was a very traditional man . ”
In 1992 , Jorge Vallejo and his team delivered a baby named Zascha , who was 18 weeks premature and at the time tied the U.S. record as the smallest to survive birth , weighing 12.5 ounces .
Jorge Vallejo told a Miami Herald reporter that holding Zascha “ made me feel near to God . ”
As Vallejo helped with the beginning of life , ultimately retiring in 2005 , son Carlos Vallejo was drawn to treating people nearing the end of theirs .
He went to medical school in the Dominican Republican and completed his residency in Chicago .
Carlos Vallejo had three children with wife Lissette , a psychiatrist ; the oldest is in nursing school , and the younger two are in medical school .
Together , they have walked inside the Egyptian pyramids and skied in Switzerland .
“ We have been blessed , ” his son Charlie said .
Carlos Vallejo was on the front lines of the pandemic , leading medical teams at three nursing homes , where residents were isolated from visitors for months .
When his adult children worried he would catch the virus , he told them his patients needed him .
“ I know he was a little worried , but my dad was fearless , ” Charlie Vallejo said .
“ He would go there with two masks , face shield and a gown .
He held their hands , told them they would be fine .
He cared a lot about his patients . ”
Jorge Vallejo was hospitalized June 20 , and Carlos Vallejo went in the next morning , on Father ’s Day .
Jorge died six days later .
The family thought Carlos would recover , but he died after 42 days in a hospital .
“ My dad died a hero , ” said Charlie Vallejo , who is in his third year of medical school .
“ He made the ultimate sacrifice . ”

There are only a few movies that break the norms and become something special because they did n’t do what everyone else did before them .
The latest Batman movie The Dark Knight is just one of those movies .
I should probably preface this post with the fact that honestly , I ’m not that much of a Batman fan .
Growing up I enjoyed the Old Skool Batman movie with Michael Keaton , but since then I ’ve had a hard time with all of the later Batman movies .
Still , I managed to snag a much - coveted ticket to a midnight showing of The Dark Knight , and was incredibly impressed .
I wo n’t give another gushing review , because you can read those anywhere .
But I do believe this movie will win actual awards ( Best Actor , Best Movie ? ) from the Academy later on .
The Dark Knight is an exceptional movie because the people who created it thought completely outside of the box .
Starting From Scratch
The writers of The Dark Knight completely tore down all stereotypes surrounding the Batman movies .
By completely re-thinking every aspect of the movie , they were able to create something exceptional and unlike any other comic movie ever .
Here ’s how they did it :
1. Sparse and creepy music – Instead of crafting a film score like other action / superhero blockbusters , The Dark Knight takes a minimalist approach to film score .
Instead of using loud , broad music to set the tone in the movie , the film score effectively steps out of the way , letting the incredible acting by Heath Ledger and Company take over the tone of the movie .
The music also has another interesting twist to it :
When music is actually present , it ’s done with almost a horror movie feel .
When the Joker is going to do something creepy , there is a slight buzzing sound that grows .
It ’s not an instrument , just a buzzing sound .
Very creepy , and very effective .
2. Going IMax – Shooting a film largely with IMAX cameras had been a goal of director Christopher Nolan for a long time , but the right project had n’t come along until The Dark Knight .
There are many obstacles to shooting in IMAX .
First , they ’re much heavier and bulkier than traditional cameras , so Nolan had to modify the camera arms so that they could support the weight .
However , an even bigger obstacle proved to be the limited film was the fact that IMAX cameras have 2 and a half minute load times .
Even though there were many obstacles to filming the movie in IMAX , the results are breathtaking .
The frames are much larger and clearer , and everything comes to life .
By overcoming obstacles with IMAX technology , The Dark Knight was allowed to reach a whole new level of engagement .
3. NOT geared towards children – Children are what put the dollars in the bank for hero movies .
It seems almost crazy for a comic book company to not market their movie towards children and add dialogue and sequences ( a la some guy getting hit in the nuts ) that children love .
Not so with The Dark Knight .
As a matter of fact , it ’s as though the writers completely ignored the children that would be watching the movie .
This was an adult film , through and through .
Yet I do n’t think that ignoring the kiddies is going to hurt the money made from this movie .
Kids will still buy all the toys , memorabilia and everything else that they normally would ( if not more ) .
The only difference is that parents are loving the movie just as much as the kids .
( Note : I would n’t recommend the movie to small children , as it ’s really dark . )
4 . No cheese – Comic book movies ( X - Men , Spider Man , etc. ) tend to have a lot of “ cheese ” written in to the dialogue .
There always tend to be dumb one - liners thrown in , either to appeal to kids ( see # 3 ) or to make the movie like the comic book .
Yet I could n’t count a single one in The Dark Knight .
And there were plenty of opportunities for it too .
But the writers made a savvy move by not making the movie seem like a bunch of action sequences thrown together with cheesy dialogue , like most action movies .
5 . Relied on real acting as opposed to special effects – I ’ve never walked away from a movie and been so amazed by the quality of acting from all actors in the movie .
This is not usually the case for action movies , or any movies for that matter .
By holding out for the best actors and getting the right chemisty between them , the writers and cast and crew ensured that the movie was a step - above all other action movies this summer .
6 . Re-working the Joker ’s character from the ground - up – A common theme to the direction of the movie was to “ re- work ” every aspect of the movie .
There ’s no better example of this than Heath Ledger ’s portrayal of the Joker .
Instead of taking the typical , mostly - funny and hardly scary crack at one of the most portrayed villains , Ledger created something altogether different .
The Joker is insane .
He is by far scarier and altogether demented .
In fact , that ’s what makes him so scary .
You can still tell he ’s a person .
Just the most twisted person you ’ve ever seen .
Instead of a playful villian , he ’s something that any city would fear to have running loose .
7 . Less like a comic book – Instead of making the movie a grandiose production like Spider Man , The Dark Knight felt almost nothing like a comic book .
The writers of the movie realized that the over - the - top approach had been flogged to death , so they made the whole movie feel more believable .
Sure , there are some pretty outlandish aspects of the movie ( Batman ’s “ toys ” , Two Face ’s charred face , etc. ) , but as a whole the movie was much more believable than any other comic book movie .
And the fact that it was more believable made the story more scary and gripping .
8 . A lot more detail about the characters – Instead of placing the sole emphasis of the movie on limitless special effects budgets , the writers of The Dark Knight brought out the storyline of the characters more than any other Batman movie .
This allowed you to identify with the characters much better , pulling you in to the movie as opposed to being a spectator .
It ’s ALL about risks
It ’s safe to say that the actors , writers and directors of The Dark Knight took some huge risks by completely doing away with comic movie norms .
Heath Ledger could have played the Joker just like Jack Nicholson .
The film score could have been huge and in the way , and they could have ensured success by writing the dialogue with children in mind .
But they did n’t .
Instead , they have an unprecedented blockbuster , and the movie is only 3 days old .
The Dark Knight has already broken opening weekend records , and I think it ’s safe to say that it will be breaking many more , plus being mentioned for some major awards .
Did it pay for Christopher Nolan and Company to think outside the box while making the movie ?
You bet your sweet movie popcorn it did .
How are you thinking outside the box ?

Emergency Order amended
WASHINGTON ( Dow Jones ) -- An emergency order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose new restrictions on short sales in 19 stocks will not apply to bona fide market makers , the SEC announced Friday .
The SEC amended the order at the recommendation of its staff to shield market makers from the new restrictions , which will take effect on Monday and could last for up to 30 days .
It said the change was made to allow market makers " to facilitate customer orders in a fast - moving market without possible delays " that might come from complying with the emergency order " and to prevent substantial disruption to securities markets . "
The SEC said the exemption covers registered market makers , block positioners and other market makers that sell short as part of their bona fide market making and hedging activities in the affected shares , as well as standardized options on the shares and exchange - traded funds that include the affected shares .

“ You do not belong to you .
You belong to the universe . ”
Buckminster Fuller
Every one is looking for their purpose .
Must have a purpose !
There are a lot of gurus out there happy to sell you on the urgency of knowing your life purpose .
A story I often hear from motivational speakers is the story of Alice in Wonderland and Cheshire Cat .
Alice stands at a crossroads and asks the cat which path she should take .
He asks “ Where are you going ? ”
She says she does n’t know .
“ Well then , it does n’t really matter which path you take . ”
People treat this story like it ’s so profound , as if it ’s evidence that you should know where you ’re going .
You MUST know where you ’re going !
Really ?
I have a different take .
It does n’t really matter !
It ’s nice to know where you ’re going .
It ’s far more pleasant to have a clear direction , but the odds are you ’ll be getting lost along the way .
Your life has its purpose , and this purpose expresses itself as you meander .
The act of finding intermediary goals and getting into action will put you on the path of your larger purpose .
What is far more painful than not knowing your life purpose is beating yourself up for not knowing your life purpose .
Even worse than that is to have personal development people telling you that you have to have a life purpose .
Of course your life has purpose , whether you see it or not .
Let ’s cut the crap .
Your primary job in life : be happy .
Happiness is not for the faint of heart .
I ’m not talking an “ I got a Kindle ! ” happiness ( though I ’ll take it if you got it ) .
What is the quality of happiness that does n’t depend on changing circumstances ?
Happiness through serving , learning , loving , and becoming more truly yourself every day .
If you can learn to be happy , then you will be a model and a teacher for others to be happy .
And they will be models and teachers for others to be happy .
If we could all be Buddhas for happiness and fulfillment , abundance and prosperity , imagine the possibilities for the world .
It does n’t really matter if you get an MBA or paint flower pots .
Where is your joy ?
What brings you your true abundance and prosperity ?
That is your purpose .
Goals and accomplishments are important .
They give our lives direction , support us in our happiness .
Like a finger that points to the moon but is n’t the moon itself , our goals point to something bigger : our desire to be fully realized , loved , valued , happy beings .
The big cheese .
What do you desire ?
What would it take for you to be fully happy ?
Notice what naysayer thoughts pop into your head when you think about getting your dreams fulfilled .
We ’ll call those thoughts your naysayers .
Things to know about naysayers :
* Your naysayers show up when you care about something , so their presence can be a good clue that you ’re on the right track .
Kind of like a flag in the sand saying “ Treasure Here ! ! ! ”
* Naysayers represent a point of view , not THE TRUTH .
* If what your naysayer says does n’t empower you , say “ Thank you for sharing . ”
( Then give your naysayer a pat on the head and some apple juice and graham crackers–quiets them down .
Sit him in a corner .
Go back to your life .
Repeat as necessary . )
Get back to what you love .
Pursue goals .
Pay attention to clues from the universe .
That ’s how you live on purpose .
And tell those seminar leaders to fuck off .

Not too long ago the idea of artificial vision was little more than science fiction .
The concept has been portrayed time and time again in m ...
A new study has found that doctors are rarely criminally prosecuted or sanctioned in connection with the prescribing of narcotic painkillers .
The study , published this month in the journal Pain Medicine , found that 725 doctors , or about 0.1 percent of practicing physicians , had been prosecuted or sanctioned by state medical boards between 1998 and 2006 on charges arising from illegally or improperly prescribing narcotics .
Of that group , 25 doctors specialized in pain treatment .
“ The widely publicized chilling effect of physician prosecution on physicians concerned with legal scrutiny over prescribing opioids appears disproportionate to the relatively few cases , ” the study reported .
The study was undertaken by the Center for Practical Bioethics in Kansas City , Mo. , the Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Association of State Attorneys General .
As officials at the Treasury Department raced on Friday to draft legislative language for an ambitious plan for the government to buy billions of dollars of illiquid debt from ailing American financial institutions , legislators on Capitol Hill said they planned to work through the weekend reviewing the proposal and making efforts to bring a package of measures to the floor of the House and Senate by the end of next week .
Lawmakers in both parties described the meeting in Ms. Pelosi ’s office on Thursday night with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke as collaborative , and that they were prepared to put politics aside to address the needs of the American people .
While Democrats initially said after the meeting that they planned to use the administration ’s proposal of a huge rescue effort to win support for an economic stimulus package , they pulled back slightly on Friday morning , saying that their top priority was to help put together the bailout package and stabilize the economy .
But it was clear they continued to examine ways to make clear that the government was stepping up not just to help the major financial firms but also to protect the interests of American taxpayers and families by safeguarding their pensions and college savings , and by preventing any further drying up of consumer credit .
In addition to potential stimulus measures , which could include an extension of unemployment benefits and spending on public infrastructure projects , Democrats said they intended to consider measures to help stem home foreclosures and stabilize real estate values .
Among the potential steps Congress can take include approving legislation to allow bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of primary mortgages  authority that the bankruptcy laws do not currently allow and that the banking industry has strenuously opposed .
But the Democrats said it was too soon to discuss such details , and that they were awaiting a draft of the proposal from the Treasury Department .
The legendary oil entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens and Nobel Laureate Al Gore have announced bold plans to radically reduce America ’s use of fossil fuels .
Both Pickens and Gore want our country to rely much more on wind energy for electricity production .
Pickens envisions wind generators across the Midwest , from the Texas Panhandle to the Canadian border .
But despite the attraction of wind as a nearly pollution - free energy source , its performance is disappointing .
Even with heavy subsidies from ratepayers and taxpayers over the last two decades , wind supplies only about 1 percent of America ’s electricity and 2.3 percent in Kansas .
A study by the National Center for Policy Analysis determined that wind energy and other renewables and conservation received between $ 30 billion and $ 50 billion over the last 20 years .
This represents the largest governmental peacetime energy expenditure in U.S. history , outranking the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program as well as spending on the synthetic fuels program during the mid-1970s .
A short - term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year .
But the wind industry should not ask for more government support .
It should be made to stand on its own .
The disadvantage of wind - generated electricity is poor reliability because the weather does n’t always cooperate .
The most demanding need for energy is in the afternoons and during air - conditioned summers , but wind works best at night and during the other seasons , though intermittently .
Even when the wind is blowing , it takes a 13 mph wind to power a large turbine .
Kansas has 364 megawatts of wind energy .
But most of the year the wind is not blowing nearly hard enough to make 364 megawatts .
Last year wind generators nationally produced only 30 percent as much energy in a year as they would if they ran at full tilt , every hour of the year , a measure called “ capacity factor . ”
Unlike nuclear power plants such as Wolf Creek , which achieve capacity factors of 90 percent or more , the wind operator cannot decide when the wind generator will run .
Texas has more wind energy than any other state , and bigger problems as a result .
Last year the Electric Reliability Council of Texas said that wind power could be counted on as being reliable only 8.7 percent of the time during periods of peak demand .
The rest of the time electric utilities were forced to use backup power generation , usually high - priced natural gas .
During a summer heat spell two years ago in California , another state with a lot of wind energy , wind generators operated at only 5 percent of capacity or less , setting off a Level 1 emergency in which people were asked to conserve power by using less air conditioning .
Blackouts were barely averted when utilities decided to use gas turbines to provide emergency power .
Another problem with wind farms is their location .
Where the wind is best is often hundreds of miles from cities that most need the power , so high - cost transmission lines must be built to transmit the electricity .
Even if the wind industry could overcome some of the obstacles and survive without tax credits and government mandates , the capital cost of installing wind generators – now pushing $ 2.6 million per megawatt – is likely to continue to rise .
What ’s more , there is a danger that failure of the bold plans of Pickens and Gore could be taken incorrectly as proof that the job of radically cutting greenhouse - gas emissions and reducing U.S. dependence on imported oil cannot be done at all , when , in fact , a real commitment to nuclear power could help achieve both objectives .
No matter what happens , the end message will surely be that there ’s no real substitute for concerted national action to bring about a balanced mix of low - carbon , domestic energy sources .
Simply put , though Pickens and Gore deserve praise for attacking the problems of climate change and oil addiction head on , they may be counting too much on wind .
The learning curve is steep .
It ’s hard to know what to prioritize .
Perl makes life easier , though , in that the bottom 30 % of the language is so all around useful , you can get all kinds of things done even though you “ speak Perl like a three year old . ”
For the rest of it , I just stop every few weeks and take an hour to focus on the two or three things that bug me the most .
My theory has been , that as long as the combination of Unix - like shell , Emacs editor , and Perl scripting is applied to my daily work , there ’ll always be enough payoff that it ’s worth my while to learn the things I ’ve been putting off– so that in 6 to 8 months I ’ll actually start to gain some genuine skill .
Here ’s a few things like that that I finally took the time to address :
( global - font - lock - mode 1 )
Put this in your .emacs file to enjoy the wonders of syntax highlighting .
Yea .
( I wondered why the Windows version was in color where the Cygwin version was n’t …. )
There ’s also two Perl modes , for some reason .
I actually kind of liked the default one better than the M-x cperl - mode that you ’re supposed to use instead .
In color , your hashes look atrocious … and your useless spaces show of as abrasive underscore lines … .
I use those lines to mark my place in my project– to sort of delineate where I ’m working .
Cperl - mode seems a little more sluggish to me when it has to place your braces where they belong , but I like the way it spaces things better .
( And people talk about how hard it is to parse Perl … it was n’t long before I broke the syntax highlighting with a line that had a mess of single and double quotes on it .
Maybe switching color mode on was not a good idea . )
Perl has anonymous functions and also functions that operate in list context .
As much as Larry hates parentheses , it ’s clear that he does n’t hate Lisp concepts … .
If you ’ve got an array of strings , you can grep them with an anonymous function .
Map can be used in a similar way :
my @array = qw / apple bus cat dog elephant / ; my @things = grep {length ( $_ ) > 3} @array ; print " *$_*
" for @things ; my @stuff = map { " --$ _--" } @things ; print " test : $_
" for @stuff ; # Altogether now : print map { " !!!$_!!!
" } grep {length ( $_ ) == 3} @array ;
Now here ’s the cool thing .
I ’m thinking to myself … would n’t it be great if you could refer to files streams in list context ?
And sure enough …
print map { “ !!!$_!!!
” } grep {length ( $_ ) == 3} <>;
This works !
All of that accidental complexity in my Perl scripts due to excessive looping and if - then - else blocks … this one idea puts a huge dent in it .
I have to admit , this gave me flashbacks to my college Calculus class .
We ’d been working through a huge number of problem sets for a few weeks … and the professor comes in and teaches us a trick that showed us we were really doing things the hard way .
The “ regular ” kids were disgusted .
Why did he waste all our time ?
My theory was , that for most of us , we would not have appreciated the trick ( and maybe not even understood it ) if we had n’t done the work first .
Back at the code bench , this translates to … write bad Perl scripts to do practical things at work .
Then clean them up with map and grep .
Now you * really * know what they were trying to tell you back in chapter 3 of SICP !
You know it down in your fingernails … .
Okay , one last note .
A few weeks ago , we saw that to really get functions to work with accepting arrays as arguments and returning groups of them for their return values , you had make the mental and semantic leap to begin thinking in terms of references .
This seems to be a little tricky , because it does n’t appear to be a “ reference ” like what I ’ve seen in other languages– maybe it is , but if I “ my ” the sucker in a subroutine , it looks like that ’s copying it , at the very least .
Anyways , I ’ll gradually assimilate that in time .
We do n’t really care what a reference really is yet – we just want stuff to work !
Especially with hashes !!
my ( $ foo , $ bar ) = test2 ( ) ; my $ value = $ { $ bar} { 2} ; print " The value of foo is $ foo and the value is $ value
" ; print " We could have just said , ' $ {$ bar} { 2} ' , too .
" ; sub test2 { my $ foo = " hello " ; my % bar ; $ bar {2} = " world ! " ; return ( $ foo , \ % bar ) ; }
So , to cast the reference ( stored in a scalar ) into a hash so that we can ‘ talk ’ to it , we have to ‘ fancy ’ it in two places .
I was thinking that the curly braces around the key would tip Perl off as to what we were trying to do … .
And when that did n’t work , I was thinking that some sort of casting with a % sign somewhere would be the ticket .
Thanks to Intermediate Perl , though , we know what we need to keep rolling ….

How many of you have ever wanted just one more minute of sleep on a Monday morning after a weekend of partying ?
I know I have and if you ’re like me , you ’re in for a treat .
Some smart people have come up with a way to help us grab some precious extra minutes of sleep in some unusual circumstances .
With their revolutionary vertical bed anyone can take a short nap while waiting for the traffic light to change , in the elevator or in public transportation vehicles .
The vertical bed comes complete with ear - muffs , mirrored eye - glasses and even an umrella in case it rains .
All you have to do is stick your hands in your pockets to protect your wallet and phone and you ’re all set for a nice relaxing nap .
One day in the vertical bed and you ’ll wonder how you ever lived without it .
GIVEN that you should never shout “ fire ” in a crowded theatre , it was perhaps unwise of your correspondent to walk into his local branch of JPMorgan Chase and ask , “ Could somebody please explain the deposit insurance rules to me ?
I want to know if my money will be alright if the bank goes bust . ”
“ Could you come with me , sir ? ” was the cashier 's urgent reply , leading me briskly out of the public area where the question might alarm other customers .
Once in a private room , she visibly relaxed .
She explained that before the past few days , nobody had asked about the deposit rules in years — in fact , the first time she was asked , she had to look them up .
AP
Do n't mention it
Recently , though , such questions have become quite common .
She allows that if JPMorgan Chase is allowed to go bust , “ we might as well as get on a boat out of the country . ”
That is probably an accurate assessment .
JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Bank of America have been allowed / required to scarf up the assets of troubled banks , effectively making them arms of the government as Hank Paulson , America 's treasury secretary , desperately tries to keep the global financial system alive .
Letting Lehman Brothers file for bankruptcy is one thing ; but these three banks would probably fail only if the government itself went bust — and despite Uncle Sam 's readiness to splash cash like there is no tomorrow , that is surely unthinkable .
And yet , the question remained : what are the rules ?
Is my money safe ?
It turns out each customer has protection from the federal deposit insurance scheme for savings of up to $ 100,000 per bank .
Due to some combination of having had a decent year , and of an entirely justified reluctance to invest in either shares or bonds given the current uncertainty , I had a little over that in my accounts at JPMorgan Chase .
So , I said to the banker , I had better take that uninsured money out of your bank and open an account at Citigroup .
At this point , the teller looked worried .
“ No , please do n't do that , ” she said .
She explained that there was another option , which she had already done for several other customers in a similar situation to mine .
“ Is there someone you know who does not have an account at this bank , that you could hold money in trust for ? ” she asked .
I suggested my niece , after first being reassured that the money remained mine — the account would just get a new name , and her deposit insurance protection would apply to my money .
A quick nod from me , a few clicks from the banker , and suddenly my money was safe .
Or so it seemed for a day or so .
Now , this solution feels too clever by half .
Several other people say they have done the same thing .
But would such a sleight of hand really stand up to legal scrutiny in the aftermath of Armageddon ?
Might the politicians charged with cleaning up the mess decide , on populist “ bash the rich ” grounds , that anyone with more than $ 100,000 deserves to take a haircut on their savings , and thus that such schemes will not be given deposit insurance ?
Panic is unworthy , certainly , especially in a business writer who should know better .
Yet why take the risk , however small ?
If the financial market mess gets any worse — and who would currently bet against that ?
—JPMorgan Chase may soon have a little less cash in its vaults , and Citigroup will have a new account holder .

Economic Crisis Hits the Playboy Mansion : Hugh Hefner Facing Bankruptcy
You know the economy has definitely reached crisis level when Playboy billionaire Hugh Hefner is being told to tighten his purse strings or face bankruptcy .
Amid the plummeting Dow , Playboy saw it 's shares drop from $ 11.23 to $ 2.81 , and Hef has been told to cut much of his staff at the New York and Los Angeles offices as soon as this month or go bankrupt .
According to an insider , " Only the top brass has known for a while how bad things have been for Hef recently . "
The news comes on the heels of rumors of the impending exits of girlfriends Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson .
Photos of Hef 's number one gal getting cozy with magician Criss Angel in Las Vegas sparked rumors of an affair , then Hef 's youngest girlfriend was seen out and about with Philadelphia Eagles Hank Baskett III , whom she calls her " hero " on her Myspace page , along with " HB3 in LOOOOVVVVEEEE !!!!!! "
There has recently been a bit of discord among The Girls Next Door , with both Kendra and Holly taking their grievances to Myspace .
Adding to tension in the Mansion are reports that Hef has become smitten with buxom brunette , Dasha Astafieva .
And the staff cutbacks ?
Spokeswoman Elizabeth Austin would not confirm the layoffs , saying : " It is our policy not to comment on corporate matters such as employee issues . "
MCCAIN’S BOLD STAND AGAINST GLOBAL COOPERATION … .
According to an excerpt published by Time ’s Mark Halperin , John McCain will launch a brand new attack against Barack Obama in a speech to the American Legion National Convention this afternoon .
About a month ago , in his speech in Berlin , Obama reminded his audience , “ [ L ] ook at Berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one . ”
It seemed like an innocuous thing to say , but it ’s the basis for a new round of criticism from McCain .
“ There are those who say that our day as the free world ’s leader has passed , that our moment is waning .
They point to the anti-Americanism that is sometimes heard in Europe and elsewhere , and take this as a sign that America no longer has the strength or the moral credibility to lead .
The criticisms tend to pass or quiet down when global threats and dangers appear .
In times of trouble , free nations of the world still look to America for leadership , because they know the strength of America remains the greatest force for good on this earth .
“ My opponent had the chance to express such confidence in America , when he delivered a much anticipated address in Berlin .
He was the picture of confidence , in some ways .
But confidence in oneself and confidence in one ’s country are not the same .
And in that speech , Senator Obama left an important point unclear .
He suggested that the end of the Cold War proved that there was , quote , ‘ no challenge too great for a world that stands as one . ’
Now I missed a few years of the Cold War , as the guest of one of our adversaries , but as I recall the world was deeply divided during the Cold War — between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny .
The Cold War ended not because the world stood “ as one , ” but because the great democracies came together , bound together by sustained and decisive American leadership . ”
Putting aside McCain ’s not - so - subtle reference to his background as a prisoner of war , again , I ’m not at all sure what , exactly , McCain is whining about here .
Indeed , McCain seems to have gotten Obama ’s speech backwards .
Obama talked about taking on global challenges — counter - terrorism , global warming , counter - proliferation , the international drug trade — and encouraging Europeans to join with the United States because , “ No one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone .
None of us can deny these threats , or escape responsibility in meeting them . ”
Why would a man running to be Leader of the Free World publicly reject the notion of international cooperation on global challenges ?
Obama ’s message in Berlin need not be controversial .
We saw an American political leader , addressing Europeans waving American flags , encouraging people everywhere to rally to confront problems we can’t resolve on our own .
As Obama described it , encouraging our allies to follow our lead ultimately serves our interests , and the interests of free people around the globe .
McCain perceives this as lacking “ confidence in America . ”
I ’m afraid today ’s bizarre criticism says more about McCain ’s twisted worldview than Obama ’s faith in American strength .
Lee factory explosion injures two employees
Posted Thursday , July 31 , 2008 6:36 am
The individuals , whose names were not released , were employees of Protective Armored Systems , and their injuries were described as non-life - threatening by Alan Sparks , deputy chief of the Lee Fire Department .
Sparks said that the explosion , which occurred shortly before 7:25 p.m. , was caused by the company 's autoclave , a large machine that fuses glass laminates and polycarbonate sheets to make bulletproof and bullet - resistant glass .
The autoclave uses sterilized , superheated steam to seal the layers together , according to the company 's Web site .
The explosion , which blew a massive hole in the side of the building and dislodged the roof of the building from the surrounding walls , did not create smoke or fire , Sparks said .
Chunks of brick , glass , and insulation were strewn all over the perimeter of the building and parking lot , and Sparks said several cars in the vicinity had their windshields shattered from the falling debris .
The cause of the autoclave explosion was unknown , Sparks said , and , although there was nothing suspicious about the event , the state fire marshal had been contacted .

While presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain will thrice face a no-holds - barred debate format for adults , Republicans have insisted on and won a far more tightly - controlled format for the single vice - presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin .
In effect - and over objections from the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) , which sponsors the events - the Republicans have demanded and won a lightweight debate format for Palin in hopes of protecting her from being directly challenged by her opponent , as the New York Times observes :
At the insistence of the McCain campaign , the Oct. 2 debate between the Republican nominee for vice president , Gov. Sarah Palin , and her Democratic rival , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , will have shorter question - and - answer segments than those for the presidential nominees , the advisers said .
There will also be much less opportunity for free - wheeling , direct exchanges between the running mates ....
McCain advisers said they had been concerned that a loose format could leave Ms. Palin , a relatively inexperienced debater , at a disadvantage and largely on the defensive ....
The wrangling was chiefly between the McCain - Palin camp and the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates , which is sponsoring the forums ....
Commission members wanted a relaxed format that included time for unpredictable questioning and challenges between the two vice - presidential candidates .
On Wednesday , the commission unanimously rejected a proposal sought by advisers to Ms. Palin and Senator John McCain of Arizona , the Republican presidential nominee , to have the moderator ask questions and the candidates answer , with no time for unfettered exchanges .
Advisers to Mr. Biden say they were comfortable with either format
The Oct. 2 vice - presidential debate will be moderated by Gwen Ifill of PBS , a fact which should make for a tougher , more substantive , and more penetrating debate than what we might expect with moderators from commercial cable or network news .
Nonetheless , the GOP should not get a pass on this sad attempt to protect Palin from precisely the kind of direct challenge these debates are supposed to be .
Expressions of concern or protest may be addressed to CPD director Janet Brown ( jb@debates.org ) , to Gwen Ifill via Washington Week in Review and / or Newshour , and to PBS Ombudsman Michael Getler .
Right under my nose was a fascinating find — in a book in my office that I overlooked for years .
It almost went without notice , and then I flipped the page back and there it was !
In today ’s modern electronic age , where programs with searchable books and websites seem to be the primary means of locating something , you may just miss something .
That ’s the lesson I learned in this instance anyway .
I have many books and access to many more in our library , and from time to time I have to consult the hard copy .
And right under my nose was a fascinating find — in a book in my office that I overlooked for years .
I opened my hard copy of John Calvin ’s commentary on the book of Genesis to view his initial notes .
As I flipped past the preface on my way to Genesis in this particular printing of the book , a facsimile of the original artwork for the translation of Calvin ’s commentary of Genesis into English from Latin was included .
This artwork was from AD 1578 .
The artwork displayed a few creatures as well as vegetation , which is likely referring to God ’s creation of such things in Genesis .
There are two birds , similar to a pelican with slight artistic merit .
They sit symmetrically near the top .
There are also two heads of pig on both sides near the bottom .
Among the other images of creatures and plants , the ones that caught my attention were along the top , just above the birds .
There are two dragon - looking creatures symmetric .
They have the appearance of a reptile and have a lizard - like tongue coming out , and yet the creatures have a form of wings .
The two creatures are not identical .
In both drawings , they appear to have long reptile - like tails , and yet one clearly has some form of forearms .
This is likely some form of embellished flying dragon ( or possibly sea dragon ) .
I ’m reminded of Isaiah 27:1 where it says : “ In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea . ” ( KJV 1769 )
As I scanned the picture further , I noticed what looked like a creature that appeared to be dead in bottom center of the drawing ( since it was upside - down ) .
Another creature looked as though it was about to feast on it .
The unique feet and long serpent - like tail give reptile - like characteristics to this particular creature as well .
Looking closely , the drawing resembles an ornithopod - type dinosaur .
Conclusion
Many creationists believe that descriptions and images of dragons in history are remnants of encounters with real dinosaurs and sea monsters .
The images in Calvin ’s book may reflect such encounters .
These drawings are significant because this translation and its corresponding artwork were completed in 1578 , long before the word dinosaur was even coined ( 1841 by Sir Richard Owen ) .
This was also long before people began digging extensively into the ground and describing dinosaur fossils .
Such a finding continues to confirm what we infer from the Bible ’s account of history : that man and dinosaurs did n’t live millions of years apart , but were alive at the same time .
God created man and dinosaurs on the same day ( Day 6 , Genesis 1:24 –31 ) ; dinosaurs were aboard the Ark with Noah ( Genesis 6:19 –20 ) , lived after the Flood ( Genesis 8:16 –19 ) , and are likely now extinct , like many other animals have become in this sin-cursed world .
The extinction of dinosaurs and other creatures reminds us of the presence of death in the world : the result of our sin .
We , too , will one day die and face the judgment of God on our sin .
Before that time , we need to cry out in repentance and faith to the Savior Jesus Christ and receive
His free gift of eternal salvation .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) I have had a keen interest in diet and exercise for several years .
I work out extensively and eat a largely plant based diet .
The question I often get is - " do n't you need more protein , energy drinks , or those " recovery " foods to build muscle ? "
To be honest , I have never used energy drinks , or packaged recovery foods .
I do n't need to .
And neither do you .
I have found two studies that complement each other that prove this point .
A healthy diet based on fruits and vegetables , with enough calories if you want to build muscle , will do the trick .
Nothing fancy needed .
A study from the March issue of thehas stated that a plant based diet can ward off muscle loss .
After age 65 , most people lose 4.4 pounds of lean tissue .
In this study , 400 male and female volunteers aged 65 or older ate a diet higher in potassium - or an alkalizing , plant based diet .
The members of the study had a potassium baseline established through urinary potassium , and further data were collected 18 months after the subjects had started the diet .
Those that ate a plant based diet , high in potassium intake , had 3.6 more pounds of lean tissue than the group that consumed half as much dietary potassium .
A study from the May issue of the journal , has stated that nutrient availability affects muscle growth .
Muscle stem cells , called myoblasts , will not develop into mature muscle cells without the proper nutrient levels .
The availability of glucose will determine whether a myoblast will develop , or differentiate , into a mature muscle cell .
The article stated that there is a defined pathway that actively controls this differentiation in a low nutrient environment .
One of the researchers , Dr. Sartorelli , says that the pathway discovered may be a cellular check point meant to prevent cells from going through the energy demanding process of differentiation .
Once nutrients , in this case glucose , are abundant , the pathway is effectively turned off , and the muscle cells will undergo differentiation .
Both of these studies prove that you can be on a plant based diet , or a diet that is largely plant based , and still be athletic .
You will prevent muscle loss due to the alkalizing nature of the diet , and those that eat processed carbs and a lot of meat cannot say this .
This type of diet , with a sufficient caloric intake , will ensure muscle growth .
So if there is anyone out there that has been thinking about becoming a vegetarian , or vegan , and worries that it will affect their athletic performance or ability in the weight room - now you can rest assured that it will not .
Yet another great reason to keep eating those fruits and veggies !

Woman resistant to AIDS found , may hold secret to cure Reuters
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email This By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A woman who has never shown symptoms of infection with the AIDS virus may hold the secret to defeating the virus , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
Infected at least 10 years ago by her husband , the woman is able somehow to naturally control the deadly and incurable virus -- even though her husband must take cocktails of strong HIV drugs to control his .
She is a so - called " elite suppressor , " and studies of her immune cells have begun to offer clues to how her body does it , the team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said .
" This is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus , " said Dr. Joel Blankson , who led the study .
" The feeling was initially that they had defective virus , " Blankson added in a telephone interview .
But the couple has been monogamous for at least 17 years , Blankson said , and tests show they are infected with the same strain of virus .
What is different is the immune system of the wife , who can not be named for privacy reasons .
" That 's a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine , " Blankson said .
Such a vaccine would not prevent infection but might be used to treat patients .
The AIDS virus infects at least 33 million people globally and more than a million in the United States .
It has killed 25 million people since it was identified in the early 1980s .
New figures show 56,000 people are infected every year in the United states , mostly gay and bisexual men but also injecting drug users and their sexual partners , both male and female , as well as newborns and recipients of contaminated blood transfusions .
STALLING REPLICATION
Both the man and the woman , who are from Baltimore , were diagnosed 10 years ago , Blankson said .
The husband is a former injecting drug user .
Tests showed that immune cells known as CD8 T - cells from the wife stalled HIV replication by as much as 90 percent , while the husband 's T - cells stopped it by only 30 percent , Blankson 's team reported in the Journal of Virology .
Her virus has also mutated in apparent response to this immune attack , becoming weaker , while her husband 's virus has remained strong .
" Elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts : how CD8 killer T - cells can attack HIV and how a stronger immune response can force HIV into a permanent defensive state , " Blankson said .
" We are trying to figure out exactly how the T - cells work in her to inhibit viral replication , " he added .
" We are just trying to see what kind of cytokines they make . "
Cytokines are immune system signaling proteins .
One thing the researchers have noticed is that while the husband 's T - cells make just one , called gamma interferon , hers made both that one and another called TNF , or tumor necrosis factor .
That can not be the whole story , though , because AIDS researchers have tried using such immune system proteins in patients and they did not work well .
And her immune cells seem to make the response only when they encounter the virus .
Another clue : the woman may have unusual activity in her human leukocyte antigen system , or HLA , Blankson said .
This important component of the immune system helps recognize antigens -- protein identifiers -- of enemies such as bacteria and viruses .

http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2008/08/why-people-who-question-anthrax-attacks.html
I think I 've figure out why many people who question the government 's explanation for the anthrax attacks do n't question the official story about 9/11 .
Specifically :
9/11 involved much greater loss of life - while 5 people died in the anthrax attacks , close to 3,000 died on 9/11
While none of us have seen gruesome images of the victims of the anthax attacks , we watched horrific images of 9/11 : planes slamming into buildings , people jumping out of the Twin Towers , the Towers collapsing . . .
9/11 was the first attack on the U.S. by " foreign terrorists " .
As such , it was the point at which America took the fork in the road away from traditional notions of liberty , justice and the Geneva Convention and towards the " war on terror "
9/11 and the anthrax attacks - and the government 's " investigation " into both - were actually very similar in many ways , as I will show in my next essay .
However , while many people can see how ridiculous the government 's case against Dr. Bruce Ivins as the " sole culprit " is , they are so traumatized by the 3,000 dead , the horrible images , and the status of 9/11 as the " day when everything changed " , that they simply will not allow themselves to honestly and fully investigate 9/11 .
The air was muggy , and a haze hung over Beijing as if it was yet to wake up , although it was midday .
I had decided months before that I would be there for the opening ceremony of the Olympics , and share the excitement .
But as I drove in from the airport there were no welcome banners , no colourful flags on the lampposts , no billboards or Olympic posters .
It was only three weeks till the big day , after seven years of waiting and meticulous preparations .
It was to be the " dream of a century " for the Chinese .
But the atmosphere was dead .
The fast lane of the airport expressway and all the ring roads were marked with the five circles of the Olympic symbol .
No cars dared to enter them .
The traffic moved unusually freely , as half the city 's 3.2 m cars have been taken off the road to reduce congestion and help clean up the air .
There were few foreign tourists either ; the air hostess told me on the way over that Air China flights were being cut back as visas had been drastically restricted to keep out potential troublemakers .
I got home in record time .
I was startled to see a police car parked outside my apartment complex , and two volunteers in blue and white torch - bearer T - shirts standing at the crossroads .
The porter was in military khaki .
Instead of greeting me as he usually did , he demanded proof of my residence .
I asked him the reason for this change : " Do n't you feel safer ? " he asked .
Later I popped out to get the local papers and magazines , and they were full of alarm , bombs in Kunming , suspicious white powder on a plane , anti-aircraft missiles being installed by the Bird 's Nest stadium ready for any attack .
There were to be security checks on the Beijing underground , and checkpoints at frequent intervals on the highways into the city .
" Even if they dare to commit any crime during the Olympics , they wo n't be able to escape easily , " the Beijing Evening News said .
Where was the joy , the sense of celebration ?
I had last been here in early March , just before the demonstrations in Tibet and the violence at the torch relay around the world .
The mood was boisterous then , with eager anticipation as the giant clock ticked away on Tiananmen Square counting down to the start .
" Give us 16 days of Olympics , and be rewarded with 5,000 years of our civilisation , " was a slogan I remembered well .
The only questions were : would the stadium and various other sites be finished on time , what about the traffic jams , how could the visitors be made to feel at home , would Chinese athletes collect more golds than America ?
Above all , how could our Olympic games become the most successful , the most memorable in history ?
Now the Olympics are here , but the buzz has gone .
The only tangible reminder of it has been the torch relay inside China , in which the rest of the world was scarcely interested .
Even that was highly staged , with a very visible police and security presence .
The commentators on China Central Television even told their audiences to sit at home and watch it on television .
A subdued nervousness permeates Beijing .
Critics say the Chinese government is exaggerating the terror risk to extend its control .
But is it really necessary to have this high security , I asked a Chinese friend , who is not very patriotic .
" Yes , " she said .
" It is all the foreign devils .
Better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in London , Paris , and San Francisco .
It was such a loss of face .
We do n't want it here on our soil . "
For the government too , the risk seems real .
They started with " One World , One Dream " : they believed that China would be welcomed on to the world stage and galvanised frenetic popular support .
When the western media protested at the award of the Olympics to China , the government felt it would overcome its critics by dazzling the world with its brilliant display .
They failed to appreciate the importance the world would attach to the pledges they had given on the environment , human rights and press freedom .
Surely diplomacy means engaging with the world on the world 's terms , not just on your terms ?
Then the protests against the torch relay produced a sea change .
Fear of disruption , or worse , hostage - taking and killings like Munich in 1972 , took over .
The government 's new line was only confirmed when 16 policemen were killed in an attack in Xinjiang , in western China , on Monday , just four days before the opening ceremony .
A government spokesman said the attackers wanted to " make 2008 a year of mourning for China " .
Now a headline in the Beijing Evening News said it all : " A safe Olympics is the most important gold medal . "
At any cost , even the jubilation of the whole country .
I came back to England .
If watching the Olympics on television is now the choice of the Chinese , I thought I would rather do it in London .
But then I was overwhelmed by the avalanche of criticism in the British press and TV coverage : " ' Police - state wastes goodwill ' , says stadium designer " ; " Beijing Olympics : the spying games " , " Clegg urges PM : do n't endorse these tainted Olympics " , " Queasy rider - US cyclists combat pollution " , " Britons arrested for flying pro-Tibet banners " , " Tiananmen orchestra cannot drown out the chorus of protests " - and many , many more , ranging from abhorring the " hideous " Bird 's Nest , to accusations of exploiting the migrant workers who built it .
This is not fact - finding but fault - finding .
And now , at the eleventh hour , Bush has rasped at China 's record on human rights and religious freedom , fanning the flames .
China certainly has faults .
But reading the papers and watching the news , you might think the country has nothing to take credit for .
Do a billion Chinese not deserve their day in the limelight , their moment of rejoicing ?
The western press seems to equate the Olympics with the Chinese government , not the people - and the people must wonder what they have to do to win some approval .
As a Chinese writer and film - maker , I have tried to tell the truth about China - most recently spending a year in Tibet , documenting the lives of ordinary Tibetans , their dreams and their frustrations .
I know the problems all too well .
But as the writer VS Pritchett once said , the only worthwhile criticism is " lit with a gleam of sympathy " .
The reforms that have produced China 's vibrant cities , its new prosperity and new freedoms , only started 30 years ago in 1978 .
We still have a long way to go .
But covering China with nothing but shame is not going to help us get there .
As we Chinese say , you do n't make a seedling grow faster by pulling it up and stretching it .
We can expect more demonstrations in Beijing during the games , especially with the kind of encouragement given by the western press .
The Chinese government would do well not to overreact to the protests or the criticism , with 25,000 foreign journalists focusing on them .
They should be confident in the knowledge that the majority of the Chinese are behind them , at least on the games .
I 'm sure it will be a great and memorable - and safe - spectacle .
I will be watching it , and so will half the world .
But I shall be wishing that my countrymen and women were dancing in the streets .

Atlas is the biggest experiment housed at the LHC Our planet is not at risk from the world 's most powerful particle physics experiment , a report has concluded .
The document addresses fears that the Large Hadron Collider is so energetic , it could have unforeseen consequences .
Critics are worried that mini - black holes made at the soon - to - open facility on the French - Swiss border might threaten the Earth 's very existence .
But the report , issued the European Organization for Nuclear Research , says there is " no conceivable danger " .
The organization - known better by its French acronym , Cern - will operate the collider underground in a 27 km - long tunnel near Geneva .
This Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is a powerful and complicated machine , which will smash together protons at super - fast speeds in a bid to unlock the secrets of the Universe .
Six " detectors " - individual experiments - will count , trace and analyse the particles that emerge from the collisions .
Most physicists believe the risk of a cataclysm lies in the realms of science fiction .
But there have been fears about the possibility of a mini- black hole - produced in the collider - swelling so that it gobbles up the Earth .
Critics have previously raised concerns that the production of weird hypothetical particles called strangelets in the LHC could trigger the mass conversion of nuclei in ordinary atoms into more strange matter - transforming the Earth into a hot , dead lump .
New particles
The lay language summary of the report , which has been written by Cern 's top theorists , states : " Over the past billions of years , nature has already generated on Earth as many collisions as about a million LHC experiments - and the planet still exists . "
The report added : " There is no basis for any concerns about the consequences of new particles or forms of matter that could possibly be produced by the LHC . "
If a black hole is produced , it might look like this in LHC data
The new document is an update of the analysis carried out in 2003 into the safety of the collider by an independent team of scientists .
The authors of the latest report , including theoretical physicist John Ellis , confirmed that black holes could be made by the collider .
But they said : " If microscopic black holes were to be singly produced by colliding the quarks and gluons inside protons , they would also be able to decay into the same types of particles that produced them . "
The report added : " The expected lifetime [ of a mini - black hole ] would be very short . "
On the strangelet issue , the report says that these particles are even less likely to be produced at the LHC than in the lower - energy Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) in New York , which has been operating since 2000 .
A previous battle over particle accelerator safety was fought over the US machine .
' Fundamental question '
The scientific consensus appears to be on the side of Cern 's theorists .
But in 2003 , Dr Adrian Kent , a theoretical physicist at the University of Cambridge , wrote a paper in which he argued that scientists had not adequately calculated the risks of a " killer strangelet " catastrophe scenario .
He also expressed concern that a fundamental question ( how improbable does a cataclysm have to be to warrant proceeding with an experiment ? ) had never been seriously inspected .
The LHC was due to switch on in 26 November 2007 .
The start - up has been postponed several times , however , and is currently scheduled for later this summer .
The first delay was precipitated by an accident in March 2007 during stress testing of one of the LHC's " quadrupole " magnets .
A statement carried on the Cern website from the US laboratory that provided the magnet stated that the equipment had experienced a " failure " when supporting structures " broke " .
It later emerged that the magnet had exploded in the tunnel , close to one of the LHC 's most important detectors .
No one was in the immediate vicinity of the test , so there were no injuries .
The magnet problem was fixed shortly afterwards .
In March , a complaint requesting an injunction against the LHC 's switch - on was filed before the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii by seven plaintiffs .
One of the plaintiffs had previously attempted to bring a similar injunction against the RHIC over safety concerns .

What are these ?
Birds do it , bees do it , and so , apparently , do . . . cows ?
No , it ’s not that .
We ’re talking about sensing the Earth ’s magnetic field .
German scientists using satellite images posted online by the Google Earth software program have observed something that has escaped the notice of farmers , herders and hunters for thousands of years :
Cattle grazing or at rest tend to orient their bodies in a north - south direction just like a compass needle .
Studying photographs of 8,510 cattle in 308 herds from around the world , zoologists Sabine Begall and Hynek Burda of the University of Duisburg - Essen and their colleagues found that two out of every three animals in the pictures were oriented in a direction roughly pointing to magnetic north .

The resolution of the images was not sufficient to tell which ends of the cows were pointing north , however .
Asked whether he had ever observed such behavior in cows , dairy farmer Rob Fletcher of Tulare , Calif. , said , “ Absolutely not . ”
But , he added , “ I do n’t spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that . ”
Similar results were found in field studies of 2,974 red and roe deer in the Czech Republic , the researchers reported today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers had been studying magnetism in smaller animals and were looking for a way to extend their work to larger species .
Cows are known to align their bodies facing uphill , facing into a strong wind to minimize heat loss or broadside to the sun on cold mornings to absorb heat , but the fact that the pictures were taken at many locations , at different times of day and in generally calm weather minimized the effect of environmental factors , the researchers said .

Researchers have long known that certain bacteria , birds , fish , whales and even rodents have minute organs in their brains containing particles of magnetite that can act like a compass .
But the new results are the first hint that larger land - based mammals may also have such organs , said biologist Kenneth J. Lohmann of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , who was not involved in the research .
The findings are “ very interesting and not at all implausible , ” said Caltech geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink , who was also not involved in the research .
“ We have to remember that whales are descended from a common ancestor of [ cows ] , so this is not a surprise given what we know about whales . ”
And , he added , “ this is an incredibly neat use of Google Earth .
This is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago . ”

Bats , birds , bees and whales all use their magnetic sense to help navigate .
Kirschvink recently reported , for example , that if a pulsing magnetic field is applied to bats perpendi- cular to the Earth ’s field , the animals will change the direction of their flight by 90 degrees .
What the benefit could be for cows , however , remains a mystery .
It might help them find their way home , experts said , or perhaps it is simply a vestigial sense that is no longer used for any purpose .
Furthermore , the authors noted , no one has examined cows or deer to determine whether their brains contain magnetic particles .
Experts acknowledged that the research almost certain - ly has no practical applications .

Today in Berlin Barack Obama put a 21st Century vision to the theme of walls that must be torn down , “ The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope .
But that very closeness has given rise to new dangers – dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean .
The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on American soil . ”
Obama talked about how America and Europe must work together on issues like securing nuclear material and global warming , “ In this new world , such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them .
That is why we cannot afford to be divided .
No one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone .
None of us can deny these threats , or escape responsibility in meeting them .
Yet , in the absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall , it has become easy to forget this truth . ”
He said the biggest danger facing us is to allow new walls to divide us , “ That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another .
The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand .
The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand .
The walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand .
These now are the walls we must tear down . ”

The Illinois Democrat closed by talking about the themes of his campaign , hope and the future , “ People of Berlin – and people of the world – the scale of our challenge is great .
The road ahead will be long .
But I come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom .
We are a people of improbable hope .
Let us build on our common history , and seize our common destiny , and once again engage in that noble struggle to bring justice and peace to our world . ”
This was a home run for Obama .
He looked presidential , and was very much in control of the issues that he was discussing .
Most importantly , he laid out an alternative vision for America ’s partnership with Europe .
It is clear that an Obama presidency will mean the end of the go it alone stance of the Bush administration .
The speech deserves special credit for taking Reagan ’s famous speech , and putting a futuristic and progressive spin on it .
This was n’t Obama ’s best speech , but it got the job done , and demonstrated that he is ready for the world stage .

These are lonely times for Lebbeus Woods .
In the early 1990s this irreverent New York architect produced a series of dark and moody renderings that made him a cult figure among students and academics .
Foreboding images of bombed - out cities populated by strange , parasitic structures , they seemed to portray a world in a perpetual state of war , one in which the architect ’s task was to create safe houses for society ’s outcasts .
Since then Mr. Woods has become his own kind of outcast .
Architecture is big business today .
While most of his friends and colleagues have abandoned their imaginary cities to chase lucrative commissions , Mr. Woods has shown little interest in building .
Instead he continues to work at a small drafting table in a corner of his downtown apartment , a solitary , monklike figure churning out increasingly abstract architectural fantasies , several of which are on view in the “ Dreamland ” show at the Museum of Modern Art .
Some question the wisdom of his choices .
( They certainly have n’t made him a rich man . )
But that he now stands virtually alone underscores a disturbing shift in the architectural profession during the past decade or so .
By abandoning fantasy for the more pragmatic aspects of building , the profession has lost some of its capacity for self - criticism , not to mention one of its most valuable imaginative tools .
It 's official : File sharing becomes a crime without punishment in Germany
Law enforcement officials from several German states have told local press in recent days that they wo n't pursue the vast majority of file sharing lawsuits anymore .
A spokesperson of the state prosecutor of Nort - Rhine Westphalia told the online magazine jetzt .de earlier this week that P2P users wo n't have to fear any lawsuits if they do n't share files on a " substantial , commercial " level .
The criteria to determine whether P2P users reach this level are both the number of files shared and the specific value of the shared files .
From the interview : Does that mean that you can now share up to 3000 MP3s without getting sued in Germany ?
Well , not exactly .
Another indicator for so - called commercial infringement is the specific nature of the files shared .
Sharing a movie that has not been released theatrically in Germany could get you in trouble even if you do n't share to many other files , according to the prosecutor 's spokesperson .
North - Rhine Westphalia is n't the only state in Germany that chooses to ignore small - time file sharing .
Similar regulations are also put in place in Bavaria , Baden - Wuerttemberg , Saxony , Saxony - Anhalt as well as in Berlin .
The regulations are a reaction to hundreds of thousands of lawsuits against file sharers that have been filed by rights holders in recent years .
North - Rhine Westphalia 's prosecutor told jetzt.de that one of three offices in his state has received 25,000 lawsuits in the first half of this year alone .( via netzpolitik.org Update :

This contest will end October 13 , 2008 at 8:00 PM CST and is for US and Canadian residents only .
Well , we ’ve heard the interview now .
And John McCain either does n’t know who the Prime Minister of Spain is , thinks Spain is a country in Latin America , or possibly both .
In case , you have n’t seen our updates from last night , yesterday John McCain was interviewed on the Florida affiliate of Spanish radio network Union Radio .
And in the interview McCain appeared not to know who the Prime Minister of Spain was and assumed he was some anti-American leftist leader from South America .
After the interviewer presses him a couple times on the point and tries to focus him on the fact that Prime Minister Zapatero is n’t from Mexico and is n’t a drug lord either McCain comes back at her saying , “ All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the Hemisphere that are friends with us and standing up to those who are not .
And that ’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America and the entire region . ”
Then there ’s a moment of awkward pause before she says .
“ But what about Europe ?
I ’m talking about the President of Spain . ”
McCain : “ What about me , what ?
Interviewer : “ Are you willing to meet with him if you ’re elected president ? ”
McCain : “ I am wiling to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for humans rights , democracy and freedom .
And I will stand up to those who do not . ”
At this point , the interviewer gets tongue - tied presumably because she can’t get over McCain not knowing what Spain is .
After Mike Tabor turned his videocamera on two Portland cops rousting a couple of men on a downtown sidewalk , one cop seized his camera and gave him a ticket , saying he'd broken the law by recording the officers without their permission .
The Multnomah County District Attorney 's Office declined to prosecute , and now Tabor is trying to force the Portland Police Bureau to take a formal position on whether it 's OK for civilians to videotape cops -- with sound -- in public places .
In a tort claim notice to the city last week , attorney Benjamin Haile informed the city of Tabor 's intent to sue for $ 100 and a written policy saying that citizens have the right to make video and audio records of police .
Haile has taken on Tabor 's case at no charge to Tabor .
He says recording officers on the job is a fundamental part of holding police accountable that Haile believes is protected by the First Amendment .
The issue is n't an isolated one .
Last month , Beaverton police arrested a 27 - year - old Aloha man on accusations that he illegally recorded an officer arresting another man at a bowling alley .
Ho Xent Vang recorded the encounter on his cell phone , and Beaverton police say the audio part of the recording violated state law because the officer did n't give his consent .
In both cases , police were citing ORS 165.540 , which makes it generally illegal to tape - record a conversation without first obtaining permission except in cases where a person would n't reasonably expect privacy , such as at a public meeting or sporting event .
Portland police spokesman Sgt. Brian Schmautz said he believes the public does n't have a right to record officers ' conversations - on or off the job - without their consent .
" Just because somebody is a police officer does n't mean they give up their rights , " Schmautz said .
The videotaping incident that netted Tabor a ticket unfolded when Tabor spotted officers Dane Reister and Nicholas Ragona stopping two men on March 25 next to the Portland Art Museum .
On the nine - minute video , one of the officers can be heard accusing one man of being a drug dealer and the other a drug buyer .
He repeatedly asks one of the men for his ID and to allow himself to be patted down .
At one point , the officer - identified by Tabor as Reister - tells the man to back away .
And when the man takes a step back , Reister takes two or three steps forward and shoves the man in the chest .
" That bugged me , " said Tabor .
" It really looked like intimidation - bully - type stuff . "
After patting the man down , the officers let both men go .
Then Reister walks over to Tabor , asks him if the camera was also recording sound , and when Tabor says yes , tells Tabor to hand over the camera .
" I was just totally surprised , " Tabor said .
Tabor began to walk to Central Precinct to file a complaint .
The officers pulled up in their patrol car and asked what he was doing and then said they 'd meet him in the lobby .
Tabor claims that after waiting about 20 minutes , the officers returned his camera and handed him a ticket .
Tabor said the officers told him he was standing too close and making them nervous in what could have been a dangerous situation .
Tabor said he does n't think he was standing too close - and if the officers thought he was , they should have said so .
Deputy city attorney Dave Woboril said he 'll review the incident , but said that Oregon 's law is " pretty complicated . "
Woboril said his reading of the statute is that people can't surreptitiously make an audio recording of others who think their conversations are private .
But Woboril said most people assume that someone holding a videocamera out in the open is recording sound as well as video .
In general , he believes civilians have the right to record officers in public places in that way .
In 1991 , then - police chief Tom Potter issued a training bulletin stating that the public had the right to record video and audio of police arresting suspects in a public place .
Woboril , Schmautz and Police Chief Rosie Sizer were n't aware of the bulletin , but Tabor 's attorney , Haile , dug up it up in his research .
Haile said he wants the bureau to specify that police stops -- not just arrests -- can be recorded .
He also wants the policy put in the bureau 's policy and procedures manual , so it wo n't be forgotten .
Haile noted that Potter 's bulletin was issued shortly after Rodney King , a black man who was stopped for speeding , was videotaped by a bystander being beaten by four Los Angeles police officers .
The videotape spurred widespread discussion about police brutality .
Dan Handelman , of Portland Copwatch , said he hears about a few cases each year in which videocameras are seized by police .
He says if police are acting professionally and lawfully , they should have no objection to being videotaped .
" It could end up exonerating the police -- it could be good for them . "

Counterpoint to the divisive and hurtful cultural stereotyping of men and boys
Indifferent and bumbling caretakers ?
This leaves men out of their families after divorce via the family court system .
Cold and unfeeling ?
This leads to indifference in men's emotions and translates into a lack of understanding and services for men in need .
All men are Rapists ? -
This has led to over zealous rape shield laws and a blind eye to false accusations of rape .
Violent ?
This has led to double standards and discrimination in areas such as domestic violence .
D ouble Standards
If men and women are truly equal why should the following exist ?
Men comprise at least 75 % of the suicides .
No one knows why .
According to a Washington Post article the director of the American Association for Suicidology states that there is no research money available to find out why , only money for women and girls .
Men comprise 93 % of the workplace related deaths .
Research shows that men comprise at least a third of those injured in domestic violence and yet the only services available for victims of domestic violence are for women and children .
Men comprise 75 % of those who are murdered and yet there is no Violence Against Men Act .
Being male is the largest biasing factor in the criminal Justice system .
According to an article in the L.A. Daily News ( a daily newspaper in Los Angeles , California , USA covering law news . )
" Research clearly demonstrates that gender is the most significant biasing factor in determining whether or not someone will be charged , prosecuted , indicted and sentenced , as well as determining the severity of the sentence . "
It is a larger bias factor than race , class , or religion .
Men die from every major cause of death earlier than women and have a lifespan that is on average 5 years shorter and yet we have five national commissions for women 's health and none for men .
We spend twice as much money on women 's health as we do on men's .
Female circumcision is against the law drawing large fines and jail time while male circumcision ( a comparitively similar procedure ) is the most popular surgical procedure in the United States .
Why was it oppression when college enrollment favored males but when enrollment now favors women it is considered empowerment ?
When a cruise ship was sinking recently in the Mediterranean women and children were directed to be first on the lifeboats .
Men 's roles have n't changed since the Titanic .
Women and children first is not what I would call equal .
More Questions

Why are television moms always portrayed as wonderful and loving and television dads normally portrayed as inept buffoons ?
Why is it politically incorrect to say anything negative about women but funny to put men down ?
Why are women without a job considered to be exercising free choice but men without a job considered a bum ?
Why is it that when a woman accuses a man of rape , the man 's name is made public and he is presumed guilty , but when he is proven innocent the woman remains anonymous and the man is still ruined ?
Double Binds
A man who emotes openly and pubically is called a wimp while a man who does n't show emotion is called cold and unfeeling .
Men in today 's culture are at risk .
There are obvious double standards and stereotyping but they often go unseen since much of the population
A new system devised by Carnegie Mellon University researchers aims to thwart man - in - the - middle ( MitM ) attacks by providing a way to verify the authenticity of self - signed certificates .
The system , which is called Perspectives , uses a distributed network of " notary " servers to evaluate the public key of a target destination so that its validity can be ascertained .
The growing presence of public wireless access points puts more users at risk of falling prey to man - in - the - middle attacks .
The researchers believe that the Perspectives system can resolve this problem and offer reasonably strong security guarantees for users who visit web sites that have self - signed certificates instead of certificates that are independently validated by certificate authorities .
The client - side component of Perspectives is implemented as a Firefox browser extension that communicates with notary servers .
When the user visits a page with a self - signed certificate , the Perspective add - on requests validation from the notary servers , which then send back the public key of the target destination .
The key retrieved from the notaries can then be compared with the key obtained by the user 's browser in order to determine if a MitM attack is being perpetrated .
Retrieving keys from multiple notaries will help protect the user by ensuring that public key authenticity is verified accurately even in the event that an individual notary server is compromised .
Users can specify the level of redundancy that they require for a key to be considered valid .
For additional protection , the notary servers also cache keys and recheck them periodically so that they can detect when keys change over time and factor that into assessments of key validity .
Typical MitM attacks will not be able to inject false responses into traffic to or from notaries because each is secured by a key signature .
An attack that merely blocks access to notaries will fail as well , because the browser extension will only verify the authenticity of a public key if it can obtain comparison keys from the notary servers .
" To enhance security without requiring a PKI , we designed Perspectives to supplement [ Trust - on - first - use ] applications with spatial and temporal redundancy , " the researchers wrote in a paper .
" Our implementation demonstrates that the notary concept is practical , and after using our Perspectives clients for nearly a year , we have found them invaluable at several occasions : when logging in to a new server while connecting through a public wireless network , or when connecting to a known server after a server key change . "
The current notary servers are all operated by CMU , but the researchers hope that other institutions will voluntarily run additional servers to expand the network .
There are obvious privacy implications associated with using the service , but the researchers claim that the notary servers do not log IP addresses and that all other notary servers will be required to commit to the same privacy standards .
The server software is written in C and uses the Berkeley DB for storing data .
Benchmarking tests demonstrate that , on relatively modest hardware , notary servers could answer more than 20,000 queries per second .
I downloaded the Firefox extension and tested it with Firefox 3.0.1 on Ubuntu Linux .
The software performed as expected during my tests .
It is implemented with a combination of C++ and JavaScript and did n't appear to have a noticeable impact on Firefox performance or reliability .
In addition to developing a Firefox plug - in , the researchers also experimentally modified OpenSSH to give it notary validation capabilities .
Although the Perspectives software can't universally mitigate MitM attacks , it provides strong protection and demonstrable efficacy in thwarting many common MitM attacks .

Advertisement Another electronic book reader has arrived , ready to do battle with its paper cousins .
But , writes cultural critic Stephen Bayley , it faces an uphill struggle against a truly beautiful knowledge delivery platform .
What is the most flexible , intelligent , interactive data retrieval system yet to appear ?
It 's the book .
As a source of high density data storage , the book offers unparalleled ease of access .
Data can be retrieved in sequence or at random .
Image and text can be presented in any variation of density .
Hand - writing did not replace speech , wood - block print did not replace hand - writing
In addition , books are inexpensive and available in many different formats , colours , shapes , sizes and weights .
The book is readily portable and requires no energy or lubricants to maintain .
Being modular , it is easy to store .
Oh , and probably lasts forever .
If eternity does not appeal to the owner , the book can be easily recycled .
No wonder books have been popular for a thousand years or so .
With the arrival of the ingenious Sony Reader it 's worth making the case for the book .
There will be an appreciative market for electronic reading systems among weight - conscious travellers , but books are not going to disappear in a Gotterdammerung of pixellation .
Changed perceptions
No new communications technology has ever wholly replaced its predecessor .
Handwriting did not replace speech , wood - block print did not replace handwriting .
Radio did not succeed print .
Television lives side - by - side with radio .
And so on .
What happens is that any new medium changes our perceptions of existing media and we adjust our behaviour and taste to fit .
Books do furnish a room , Anthony Powell suggested And so it will be with the book when electronic readers become commonplace .
It may be the end of the cheap paperback , but a new era of more expensive books will be a pleasing stimulus to publishers and a new source of delight to human readers .
After all , the value of books is not determined by literary content alone .
Colour , shape , texture and even smell are all elements of the reader 's enjoyment .
Better papers , more adventurous design , and quality typography are all now delicious prospects .
Already there are signs that this is happening .
Blockbuster is a lazy old expression ... until now .
Just published by FMR in Bologna is an , as it were , ground - breaking volume on Michelangelo .
Its cover is real marble and shows in miniature the Madonna della Scala , a bas - relief from the Casa Buonarotti .
With original photographs by Aurelio Amendola , Michelangelo : La dotta mano ( Michelangelo : The learned hand ) is guaranteed for 500 years , weighs 21kg and costs $ 155,000 ( £ 87,000 ) .
So , just when we are being told print is dead or dying - the Guardian Media Group 's Alan Rusbridger has said his new printing presses are the last they will ever buy - someone invents the luxury book .
Books , as any visitor to a civilised house knows , do furnish a room .
Books never look untidy , even when piled in tumbling stacks .
Transatlantic flight boon
They have sculptural presence and provide islands of interest wherever they are found .
What precious insights into an individual 's psychology are revealed in the hierarchy of display with the books in the loo and the books on a drawing room table ?
The knowing and sly host can play unsettling games in this arena .
A furtive scroll through a Sony Reader 's files will never be quite so fascinating .
True , no - one in their right mind would want to carry the print equivalent of Sony 's electronic library of 160 volumes on a transatlantic flight .
But , on the other hand , the Bodleian or the Laurenziana or the National Library of Wales would not be quite so glorious if their shelves were stacked with Sony Readers , especially ones with dead batteries .
There is something sensuous , possibly even erotic , about the book .
It appeals to both the senses and the intellect as well as to your hidden interior designer .
And what curious pleasures are to be found in antiquarian bookshops - the market for used Sony Readers will perhaps never be quite so attractive .
And the best evidence of all for the immortality of the book ?
By 1995 Nicholas Negroponte director of MIT 's futurophiliac Media Lab had become completely convinced of the absolute primacy of electronics .
How did Negroponte choose to explain himself to the world ?
He published a paper and ink book called Being Digital .
Negroponte fell in love with the most flexible , intelligent , interactive data retrieval system yet to appear .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I think he is wrong about communication technology never becoming obsolete - you just need to look at the cassette or VHS ( or in a few years the CD ) to see that .
However I believe that books will never become obsolete as , unlike music , it is very rare that people will need to carry around more than one paperback - the most probable eventual use I can see for these readers is as large technical reference manuals .
Nigel de Grey , London , UK
There 's also the factor of health and stress - reading from a screen makes my eyes tired and gives me headaches , but reading a decent size print does not .
Harriet R , Bristol , UK Just as the digital age promised the ' paperless office ' and generated more not less paper , the electronic book will likely be purchased and used by the few .
I do n't think people really want another gadget to carry around , let alone have the need to have hundreds of books at their fingertips .
Peter B , Watford , UK I love books , I really do .
I have a small library at home however , I love the idea of the Sony Ereader .
Why ?
I can read a standard paperback in the time it takes to go on the train from Bristol to Nuneaton .
If I 'm doing this journey both ways ...
I need two books to keep me occupied .
With the Ereader , it wo n't weigh me down on public transport .
That 's not to say I 'll stop curling up with a good book - no chance !
It just means I can take my reading material with me without carrying multitudes of books ... oh , and listen to music as well ...
I wo n't have to replace the iPod that just stopped working !
Jen , Nuneaton Books , Books !
They will always be a part of man´s life and culture .
The new media ... electronic book , will be liked but it is limited due to batteries .
When a perpetual battery powered by the sun is invented then and only then will paper books fade from use .
Imagine 1000 years from today when future archaeologists dig and find ebooks with dead and obsolete batteries ?
How can they read it ?
For this century , the paper book is king and electronic bok is convenience .
Carl Lawrence , San José , Costa Rica Despite being an IT professional with technologies , methodologies and gadgets galore spilling out all over the place , I would never , ever give up a proper printed book when it comes to my reading .
Paper books have an intrinsic place in culture throughout history and have come to represent anything form learning to relaxation .
They can be given as tokens of respect , friendship or love and received in the same manner .
When were you ever disappointed to receive a book ?
Would you feel the same to receive a PDF in your email ?
I doubt it !
Will Shaw , Barnsley , UK Books smell good .
I noticed this more when I was younger .
Every book has a distinctive smell , especially when new .
On - line books just can't compete .
Clive Shergold , Middlesbrough , UK
The book is a wonderful medium for distributing information and almost certainly well continue to be one for a long time .
However I can't help but sense a little nostalgia here .
I am willing to bet that people in many years time will be saying the same about ' beautiful , prefect , supreme '
EBooks when some new technology comes to beam information directly into your mind ?

US Election Campaign Obama 's Star Status Frustrating McCain
John McCain has attempted to distract from Barack Obama 's tour of the Middle East and Europe by attacking his foreign policy record .
But he 's failing to take the shine off the Democratic candidate in the US election .
The Republican has a problem .
Loading ( this can take up to 5 seconds ) ...
Separation anxiety is a situation where one finds it hard to let go of someone or something .
This goes beyond the basic sense of sadness , ...
In 1961 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower famously warned the country about the " unwarranted influence " of the
" military - industrial complex . "
But back then , only a relative handful of companies did business with the Pentagon .
Today , the military - industrial web is everywhere , Nick Turse writes in his new book , The Complex : How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives .
And " it 's nothing like the olive - drab outfit of Eisenhower 's day :
It reaches deeper into
American lives and the American psyche than Eisenhower could ever have imagined .
The truth is that , at every turn , in countless , not - so - visible ways [ our day - to - day dealings are ] wrapped up with the military . "
To prove his point , Turse spends a day in the life with Rick , a fictional " midlevel manager in a financial services company in New York
City . "
So wake up with Rick and sample a single spring morning as the alarm on his Sony ( Department of Defense contractor ) clock interrupts his final dream of the night .
Donna is already up and dressed in fitness apparel by Danskin ( a Pentagon supplier that received more than $ 780,000 in DoD
dollars in 2004 and another $ 456,000 in 2005 ) and Hanes Her Way ( made by defense contractor and cake seller Sara Lee Corporation , which took in more than $ 68 million from the DoD in 2006 ) .
Committed to a healthy lifestyle , she 's wearing sneakers from ( DoD contractor ) New Balance and briskly jogging on a treadmill made by ( DoD contractor ) True Fitness
Technology .
*
Rick drags himself to the bathroom ( fixtures by Pentagon contractor
Kohler , purchased at defense contractor Home Depot ) .
There , he squeezes the Charmin , brushes with Crest toothpaste , washes his face with
Noxzema ; then , hopping into the shower , he lathers up with Zest and chooses Donna 's Herbal Essences over Head & Shoulders – " What the hell , " he mutters , " I deserve an organic experience . "
( The manufacturer of each of these products , Procter & Gamble , is among the top 100
defense contractors and raked in a cool $ 362,461,808 from the Pentagon in 2006 . )
... Of course , the Pentagon has long poured U.S. tax dollars into private coffers to arm and outfit the military and enable it to function .
At the time of Eisenhower 's farewell address , ** New York Times reporter Jack Raymond noted that the Pentagon was spending
" $ 23,000,000,000 a year for services and procurement of guns , missiles , airplanes , electronic devices , vehicles , tanks , ammunition , clothing and other military goods . "
Today , that would equal around $ 200 billion .
In 2007 , the Department of Defense 's stated budget was $ 439 billion .
Counting the costs of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the number jumps to over $ 600 billion .
Factoring in all the many related activities carried out by other agencies , actual U.S. national security spending is nearly $ 1 trillion per year .
*
* Back in Eisenhower 's day , arms dealers and mega- corporations , such as Lockheed and General Motors , held sway over the corporate side of the military - industrial complex .
Companies like these still play an extremely powerful role today , but they are dwarfed by the sheer number of contractors that stretch from coast to coast and across the globe .
Looking at the situation in 1970 , almost 10 years after Eisenhower 's farewell speech , Sidney Lens , a journalist and expert on U.S .
militarism , noted that there were 22,000 prime contractors doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense .
Today , the number of prime contractors tops 47,000 with subcontractors reaching well over the 100,000 mark , making for one massive conglomerate touching nearly every sector of society , from top computer manufacturer Dell ( the
50th - largest DoD contractor in 2006 ) to oil giant ExxonMobil ( the 30th )
to package - shipping titan FedEx ( the 26th ) . *
In fact , the Pentagon payroll is a veritable who's who of the top companies in the world : IBM ; Time - Warner ; Ford and General Motors ;
Microsoft ; NBC and its parent company , General Electric ; Hilton and
Marriott ; Columbia TriStar Films and its parent company , Sony ; Pfizer ;
Sara Lee ; Procter & Gamble ; M&M Mars and Hershey ; Nestlé ; ESPN
and its parent company , Walt Disney ; Bank of America ; and Johnson &
Johnson among many other big - name firms .
But the difference between now and then is n't only in scale .
As this list suggests , Pentagon spending is reaching into previously neglected areas of American life :
entertainment , popular consumer brands , sports .
This penetration translates into a remarkable variety of forms of interaction with the public .
*
* Rick and Donna 's home is full of the fruits of this incursion .
As they putter around in their kitchen , getting ready for the day ahead , they move from the wall cabinets ( purchased at DoD contractor Lowe's
Home Center ) to the refrigerator ( from defense contractor Maytag ) , choosing their breakfast from a cavalcade of products made by Pentagon contractors .
These companies that , quite literally , feed the Pentagon 's war machine , are the same firms that fill the shelves of America 's kitchens . *
Now , I have a feeling politics of * The Complex * are far to the left of most DANGER ROOM readers ' views .
But Turse 's documentation of the interweaving of corporate and military interests is fascinating , no matter where you place yourself on the ideological spectrum .
The 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing are supposed to be the greenest yet .
There has been some coverage on television , and despite all the attempts to clean things up beforehand and to limit especially the air pollution during the games , pictures from the city show it still in many ways to be a smoggy , grimy place .
It ’s not wholly bad , however .
The buildings constructed for some of the competitions are architecturally striking , and they seem to be a functional success , as well .
But how do they stack up as green buildings ?
There has been some criticism that outsider firms were chosen to design these iconic buildings , but the successful execution of both projects undermines this criticism somewhat .
Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron were the lead designers for the Beijing National Stadium ( Bird ’s Nest ) and the Australian firm PTW Architects were the design lead for the Beijing National Aquatics Center ( Water Cube ) .
The Bird ’s Nest Stadium is described as functionally being eight separate buildings .
“ Since all of the facilities – restaurants , suites , shops and restrooms – are all self - contained units , it is possible to do largely without a solid , enclosed facade .
This allows natural ventilation of the stadium , which is the most important aspect of the stadium ’s sustainable design . ”
Engineering firm Arup served as consultants for both the Bird ’s Nest and the Water Cube , but only for the Water Cube do they speak about working to ensure the sustainability of its design .
“ Swimming centres require a lot of heating , but by cladding the building in high - tech ETFE cushions , we have developed a very efficient green house .
90 % of the solar energy falling on the building is trapped within the structural zone and is used to heat the pools and the interior area , ” says Kenneth Ma of Arup .
The Olympic Village , where the athletes are housed , is less of a signature project than the stadiums , but is , perhaps the more impressive green building feat .
The Olympic Village was awarded LEED Gold with the plaque presented by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen this past Wednesday .
Green features of the building include solar cells and geothermal heat pumps .
“ The Beijing Olympic Village uses solar cells and geothermal heat pumps to supply energy to the buildings .
The buildings feature solar heat , solar hot water , solar thermoelectric cogeneration , and intelligent control devices .
They consume just 1/30th of the energy consumed by conventional buildings , according to the contractor , Guoao Investment Company .
“ Through a heat exchange system , the Village is projected to draw 7.89 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy from the Sun during the Olympics and slightly less in the years after the Games are finished and the buildings are used to house other residents . ”

No one was surprised when both presidential candidates appealed for votes Saturday at the annual convention of the nation ’s largest organization of disabled military veterans .
But Fred Bristol , who has attended the Disabled American Veterans convention for the last 55 years , marveled at his fellow veterans ’ reaction to Sens.
Barack Obama , who sent a video , and John McCain , who addressed the group in person .
“ I think there ’s an unusual split in the group we have n’t seen in the past , ” said Bristol , 81 , of Sarasota , Fla .
“ I ’m hearing that from a lot of friends . ”
McCain has built his political career on his Navy service , including 5 1/ 2 years as a POW in Vietnam , and he remains immensely popular with many veterans groups .
But the Arizona Republican ’s appearance here suggested limits to that appeal .

The 1.4 - million - member group said that in 2006 , he voted for only one of the five spending bills the group considered most important -- 20 % .
“ It ’s a pretty low score , ” said David Autry , spokesman for the congressionally chartered nonprofit group .
The group rated Obama ( D - Ill. ) at 80 % .
The bill McCain supported , which passed the Senate unanimously , increased funding for veterans ’ health benefits and got rid of enrollment fees and higher pharmacy co-payments .
The four he opposed would have increased funding for veterans ’ services and benefits .
In each case , aides said , he objected to earmarks : amendments that members often attach for pet projects in their home districts , including those involving the Veterans Affairs Department .
Opposition to earmarks is a signature issue for McCain .

McCain used his remarks here Saturday to try to reassure the 4,000 or so people at the convention .
“ Exactly because funding VA programs commands bipartisan support , some in the Congress like to attach unrelated pork barrel appropriations and earmarks to VA bills , ” he said .
“ The result is to mix vital national priorities with wasteful and often worthless political pork . ”
McCain also discussed his plan to issue sick or disabled vets a special access card so they could use private healthcare providers outside the VA system .
Some veterans and the Obama campaign oppose the plan .
“ Let me make very clear :
This card is not intended to either replace the VA or privatize veterans ’ healthcare , as some have wrongly charged , ” he said .

The director of Illinois ’ Veterans Affairs Department , L. Tammy Duckworth , countered on behalf of the Obama campaign that McCain ’s plan would reduce veterans ’ benefits .
An Army helicopter pilot who lost both legs in Iraq , she is the national group ’s Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year for 2008 .
McCain ’s proposal , she said , would push disabled vets “ out into the local economy in hope that someone can take care of their combat wounds .
It ’s essentially privatization , something I cannot support . ”
Obama pledged in his remarks , recorded before he left for a week ’s vacation in Hawaii , that he would fully fund VA healthcare , and add more veterans centers , particularly in rural areas .
“ We ’ll have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets : zero tolerance , ” he said .
On the subject of Iraq , McCain and Obama differed sharply on their plans for ending the unpopular war , or least on how to describe their differences .
McCain said the buildup of U.S. troops last year “ has succeeded ” and victory “ is finally in sight . ”
But he warned that it “ could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines , ” a reference to Obama ’s pledge , if elected , to withdraw most troops within 16 months of taking office .

Obama “ would choose the path of retreat and failure for America over the path of success and victory , ” McCain said .
Both the White House and Iraq ’s government have recently signaled support for a staged withdrawal .
McCain has said that he too would begin to bring troops home if conditions in Iraq continued to improve .
Obama ’s aides argue that McCain is trying to give himself political wiggle room to pull troops out while simultaneously accusing his opponent of accepting defeat by advocating withdrawal .
They say McCain ’s tactical and political shift proves that Obama was right all along .
It ’s difficult to gauge whether McCain ’s military service and pedigree -- he is the son and grandson of Navy admirals -- gives him a campaign advantage with veterans .

President Clinton , who did not join the military , beat two World War II veterans to win his two terms in the White House : President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and former Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 .
And in 2004 , Sen , John F. Kerry , a Vietnam veteran , lost to President Bush , who served in the Texas National Guard .
Many vets here said they do not consider the Iraq war or McCain ’s military service to be key campaign issues .
Their chief concerns are the ailing economy and high gas prices .
“ I work three jobs to make ends meet , ” said Jeff Graves , 45 , an Army veteran from Falmouth , Ky .
“ I need to know who ’s going to help with that . ”

It may not be fun for all the family – well , not in the same way as Monopoly , Trivial Pursuit or Mousetrap , say .
The themes of empire building and terrorist - style attacks on opponents would probably provoke an outbreak of spluttering over the Christmas sherry .
It is rare , however , for a board game to be seized by the police .
This week that distinction befell War on Terror : The Boardgame ; a set was confiscated from climate protesters in Kent .
Following a series of raids on the climate change camp near Kingsnorth power station , officers displayed an array of supposed weapons snatched from demonstrators : knives , chisels , bolt cutters , a throwing star – and a copy of the satirical game , which lampoons Washington 's " war on terror " .
For the game 's creators , Andrew Sheerin and Andy Tompkins , web designers from Cambridge , the inclusion of their toy was a shock .
" When I saw the pictures in the papers I was absolutely baffled , " said Mr Sheerin , 32 .
" I thought : surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon ? "
You wo n't find the game in high street stores ; retailers have all declined to stock it .
The high street chain Zavvi bought 5,000 sets but strangely withdrew them for sale after one day , citing " poor sales " .
But since its low - key launch two years ago , War on Terror : The Boardgame has sold 12,000 copies online and through independent stockists , prominently featuring in student bedsits .
Distribution deals have been set up to sell the game in Europe and the United States , where war fatigue has ensured a keener reception than in Britain .
Much like games such as Risk or Diplomacy , War on Terror revolves around players creating empires that compete and wage war against each other for resources and land .
The controversial twist allows them to " train " terrorist cells that either attack your enemies or , if you 're unlucky , turn against you – like some anti-Western terror groups have done .
There is an " Axis of Evil spinner " intended to parody international diplomacy by randomly deciding which player is designated a terrorist state .
That person then has to wear a balaclava ( included in the box set ) with the word " Evil " stitched on to it .
Kent police said they had confiscated the game because the balaclava " could be used to conceal someone 's identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act " .
Mr Sheerin was unconvinced .
" That 's absurd , " he said .
" A beard can conceal someone 's identity .
Are the police going to start banning beards ? "
The game 's slanted political overtones were fostered in the build - up to the Iraq war .
" When we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that , despite the mass marches and protests , we were off to war , " Mr Sheerin said .
" We thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed . "
After two years of tinkering Mr Sheerin and Mr Tompkins were ready to find a producer ; friends helped raise the £ 30,000 needed to order the first 5,000 copies from a factory in China .
Most high street stores and toy fairs declined to stock the game ; those managers who expressed initial interest were overruled by head office .
" The manager of the local Borders bookshop in Cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it , " said Mr Sheerin .
" A day before it was due to appear , head office said not to stock it .
That happened time and time again . "
Zavvi was on the verge of becoming the first major high street store to stock the game and ordered 5,000 copies last year .
But a subsequent decision was made to withdraw it , forcing the store to return the order .
A spokesman for Zavvi said the group had bought the game when it was part of the Virgin Megastore network .
" We do n't censor our products .
The game just was n't selling . "
Rules of the game
The game is for two to six players .
All players begin with fledgling empires on a world map which they expand through the acquisition of land , oil and cities .
At any time players can abandon the " pursuit of liberty and oil " in favour of becoming a terror state – or they are designated a terror state by a random " Axis of Evil " spinner .
Empires can also train their own terrorists to target rival empires , although these groups often turn on you later in the game .
Terrorists can use special cards such as " suicide bomber " , " plane hijack " and " WMDs " to advance themselves .
Empires rely on tactics such as " espionage " , " regime change " and forcing other empires to sign up to the Kyoto protocol to bankrupt their competitors .
" The idea is to encourage the sort of short - term , selfish thinking that led us into war , " says Andrew Sheerin , the co-creator of the game .

At a town hall meeting on the economy in St. Petersburg , FL today Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama was confronted by some hecklers who were upset with what they viewed as Obama ’s lack of a stance on issues like the Jena 6 , and Sean Bell .
Later one of the hecklers asked Obama why he has n’t spoken out more for the black community , “ In the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the African community or the black community by the same US government that you aspire to lead – and we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that you spoke of – it was n’t just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena , a phenomena that targeted the African community and Latino community , attacks like the killing of SeanBell by the New York police department and ??
right here in St. Petersburg by the St. Petersburg police , and Jena 6 and Hurricane Katrina , and the list goes on .
In the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the African community , why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited African community or Black community in this country ? ”
Obama answered , “ I think you are misinformed about when you say not one time .
Every issue you ’ve spoken about , I actually did speak out about ….
I ’m going to go through the various specific examples .
I ’ve been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the United States senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when I was in the state legislature .
And I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African American and Latino communities .
I ’ve said that repeatedly .
Number two , Jena Six – I was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong , that there ’s an injustice that ’s been done and we need to change it .
That ’s number two .
When Sean Bell got shot , I put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem . ”
Advertisements
After the man interrupted him , Obama continued , “ I ’m just trying to answer your question .
On each of the issues that you mention , I have spoken , I ’ve spoken out forcefully .
I was a civil rights lawyer …
I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois …
I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform issue in Illinois … that does n’t mean I ’m always going to … [ say ] what you guys want me to say … which gives you the option of voting for somebody else … or … run for office yourself . ”
The problem that many activists of all races have with Obama is that he puts out statements instead of getting involved with the protests , but he is a politician running for president , not an activist .
The root of this issue is that some feel that Obama is ignoring the black community , but I think that if Obama wants to be president he can’t allow him himself to be perceived by voters as a radical , especially not a black radical .
I do n’t think that this would be in line with who Obama is anyway .
He is not the second coming of Martin Luther King Jr..
He is a politician who is running for president who happens to be half African American .
I am sure that this is disappointing to some , but it is the truth .

960 babies in TB scare at Kaiser in S.F. SAN FRANCISCO
Kaiser Permanente is contacting 960 mothers whose babies may have been exposed to a health care worker in San Francisco who has an active case of tuberculosis .
The worker was assigned to the postpartum unit in the maternity ward of Kaiser 's San Francisco Medical Center to care for mothers and infants .
Kaiser officials say the infection risk for patients is very low , but testing will be provided along with treatment if necessary .
Kaiser also is notifying 115 employees who may have been exposed .
The Oakland health maintenance organization learned of the worker 's infection Aug. 18 .
The part - time night shift employee worked at Kaiser from March 10 to Aug. 10 and is no longer an employee there .
Kaiser has been working on the matter with the San Francisco Department of Public Health .
" We feel that this is a low - risk exposure , but we want to be aggressive about identifying any potential contacts , " said Dr. Stephen Parodi , chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California .
He said that the involved TB strain is a common one that responds well to a regimen of antibiotics .
Pediatricians began notifying patients Tuesday .
" We are trying to take a personal approach , " Parodi said .
Those potentially exposed are being asked to take a skin test .
If the test is positive , further screening will be performed , including chest X - rays .
Global Regular Expression
Print is a staple of every command - line user ’s toolbox .
As with find , it derives a lot of power from being combined with other tools and can increase your productivity significantly .
Following is a simple tutorial that will help you realize the power of this simple and most useful command .
If you are on Windows and have n’t already , download and install Cygwin .
If you are also new to regular expressions ( regex ) , here is a great regular expressions reference to get you started .
Tutorial
Suppose we want to search for duplicate functions in all of our JavaScript files .
Let ’s start basic and work up to it .
This technique can be used to search for a TON of duplicate items like :
Duplicate HTML IDs
Check how many times a CSS class is used
Duplicate java classes
many , many more …
# Search JS files in this directory for " function " grep " function " * .js
The above command will print the lines containing “ function ” in all JavaScript files in the current directory ( NOT subdirectories ) .
Printing out line contents would be much more helpful if we knew what files they come from and their line numbers :
# Print files , line #s , and lines starting with function grep - EHn " ^s*( function w+ |w+ = function ) " * .js
Depending on how you format your JavaScript files , something like this will omit comments , anonymous functions , and also words like “ functionality ” giving you better results .
# Print a list of : function {function - name} and sort it grep - Eho " ^s*function w + " * .js | sort
-o prints only the part that matches the regular expression .
- E options gives me extended regex and -h suppresses printing of the file name .
I am then piping to sort which just sorts the output so it a list of function .
** If you do n't have a lot of files / functions to go through , you can just scan the list and then note the duplicate function names you see .**
Let 's go a step further for those that DO have a big list :
# Print only duplicate function names grep - hEo " ^s*function w + " * .js | sort | uniq -d
There we go !
That will list only the duplcated functions .
I know that we can expand this with awk or other stuff and get the file names and line numbers of the duplicates , but I do n’t want to explaining the details of awk ; ) .
Other Examples
# Count the number of functions in all JS files grep -c " function " * .js # Print lines that DO NOT have " function " grep -v " function " * .js #
List processes that match " pidgin " ( non- Windows ) ps - ef | grep pidgin
Conclusion
grep is one of the most used command - line tools , often piped to for filtering output .
Understanding it is essential to increasing productivity on the command - line .
There is so much more to grep than what I ’ve shown here , and it would be cool to see your best uses in the comments !

This document will summarize the level of support for web standards and maturing technologies in popular web browsers .
It covers the Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Opera web browsers , with focus on the HTML , CSS , DOM , and ECMAScript technologies .
Pick browsers to display
Visitors with visual impairments may take advantage of a magnified version or a monochrome version of these documents .
In most web browsers , you can select your preferred view by going to the View menu and then Page Style or Style .
This mechanism is not supported by Internet Explorer or Safari .
How to interpret these tables
Each row corresponds to a feature of the particular web standard or maturing specification .
In the full tables , the browser support for that feature is usually indicated by a single letter : Y ( yes ) , N ( no ) , or I ( incomplete support ) .
A question mark (? ) means that the support for that feature is currently unknown .
The values have been colored for readability .
Most feature names in the full tables are links to the official standards definitions .
Some features are listed as a summary of another group of features on the tables .
These summary features often show percentages indicating the mean average support for the features in that group .
Incomplete ( I ) support for a feature is calculated as a 50 % support .
Features with unknown levels of support are ignored .
Features that are irrelevant in the summarized context are also ignored , such as the “ inherit ” values in the individual components of CSS shorthand properties .
If more than 5 % of the data in the summarized group is unknown , it simply lists a question mark .
If all of the summarized features have all or no support , the summary feature simply lists a Y or N , respectively .
If there is only one feature summarized and it has an I rating , the summary feature simply lists an I .
Some summary features summarize a feature breakdown that is not written out on these tables but is obvious in the standard 's specification , such as a predefined set of possible values for an attribute in HTML .
These summary features assume a value for general support and an additional value for each part of the breakdown in order to arrive at the displayed percentage .
The tables on this page and the summary page are in summarized form .
Each row is a summary feature of the corresponding group in the full tables .
Feature names are links to the corresponding sections of the full tables .
Some feature ratings have explanations associated with them , particularly for those with an “ I ” rating .
The explanations are stored in the title attribute of the table cell or in a mouseover event for user agents supporting ECMAScript , and can usually be accessed by user agents with mouse support by hovering the mouse cursor over the table cell .
These rating symbols are marked with an overline .
There are three families of web browsers shown here by default : IE , Firefox , and Opera .

仮想マシンなので命令はメモリから読もう。レジスタを２つ増やして、プログラムカウンタと計算結果を保存するレジスタを持つようにしてみる。命令は停止命令とACCレジスタをインクリメントする二つだけ用意しよう。
data Reg = PC | FP | ACC deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Enum ) data Insn = INCR | STOP deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Enum )
命令を PC から読み出す fetch と、それを decode する関数は、メモリアドレスとメモリの持つ値が両方とも同 じ
Int にしておくと簡単になる 。
fetch :: ( Ord x , Show x , MonadState ( VM Reg x x ) m ) => m x fetch = do pc <- loadReg PC load pc decode :: Int ->
Insn decode = toEnum
実行するのも簡単だ 。fetch - decode と命令による分岐を書けば良い。とりあえずは ACC レジスタの値を返しておくことにする。ハンドアセンブルして命令列を作るほうが面倒なくらい。
exec :: ( MonadState ( VM Reg Int Int ) m ) => m
Int exec = do op <- fetch case decode op of STOP -> do { loadReg ACC } INCR -> do { acc <- loadReg ACC ; storeReg ACC ( acc + 1 ) ; pc <- loadReg PC ; storeReg PC ( pc + 1 ) ; exec }
適切なメモリとレジスタの状態を作って実行する。
* Main > evalStateT exec ( makeVm [ STOP ] ) 0 * Main > evalStateT exec ( makeVm [ INCR , STOP ] ) 1 * Main > evalStateT exec ( makeVm [ INCR , INCR , INCR , STOP ] ) 3
これではハンドアセンブルがあまりに辛い。TMR-Issue6 ( https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/1/14/TMR-Issue6.pdf) を斜め読みすると、DSL としてアセンブラを書いている（ように見える）。同じことを目指してみよう。

LAST month , the Bush administration launched the latest salvo in its eight - year campaign to undermine women ’s rights and women ’s health by placing ideology ahead of science : a proposed rule from the Department of Health and Human Services that would govern family planning .
It would require that any health care entity that receives federal financing  whether it ’s a physician in private practice , a hospital or a state government  certify in writing that none of its employees are required to assist in any way with medical services they find objectionable .
Laws that have been on the books for some 30 years already allow doctors to refuse to perform abortions .
The new rule would go further , ensuring that all employees and volunteers for health care entities can refuse to aid in providing any treatment they object to , which could include not only abortion and sterilization but also contraception .
Health and Human Services estimates that the rule , which would affect nearly 600,000 hospitals , clinics and other health care providers , would cost $ 44.5 million a year to administer .
Astonishingly , the department does not even address the real cost to patients who might be refused access to these critical services .
Women patients , who look to their health care providers as an unbiased source of medical information , might not even know they were being deprived of advice about their options or denied access to care .
The definition of abortion in the proposed rule is left open to interpretation .
An earlier draft included a medically inaccurate definition that included commonly prescribed forms of contraception like birth control pills , IUD ’s and emergency contraception .
That language has been removed , but because the current version includes no definition at all , individual health care providers could decide on their own that birth control is the same as abortion .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A long - awaited consolidation of Europe ’s banks is rapidly taking shape , but it is being executed through shotgun rescues and bargain purchases by stronger banks rather than a harmonization of businesses across borders .
Governments , which in the past have been the biggest barrier to takeovers by blocking dominant players , are now acting as kingmakers by stepping in to rescue ailing banks .
They are nodding through deals they would have blocked a year ago , giving the region ’s better capitalized banks such as Spain ’s Santander , Britain ’s Barclays and France ’s BNP Paribas the chance to dramatically expand market share at “ once- in-a- generation ” prices .
That strategic shift could also allow ING ING .
AS to buy the Dutch assets of ABN to create a national powerhouse just days after Lloyds TSB LLOY.L was allowed to grab a dominant position in the UK .
There has also been speculation that Switzerland 's UBS UBSN.VX and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX or BNP Paribas BNPP .
PA and Societe Generale SOGN .
PA could come together if turmoil from a global credit crisis deepens .
Santander SAN.MC and Barclays BARC.L , meanwhile , are taking advantage to pick up cheap cross - border assets .
“ If banks can go out and buy assets and can get them at less than book value , that has got to make a handful of institutions stronger , ” said Simon Maughan , analyst at MF Global .
“ Growth will resume at some point and those banks with materially more market share that they obtained cheaply will be the winners , ” he said .
BENELUX ASSETS IN PLAY
The latest flurry of interest has fixed on Fortis FOR.BR , putting the Belgian - Dutch group at the heart of consolidation speculation for the second time in a year .
Fortis ’ part in a consortium takeover of ABN AMRO last year stoked an expectation that further M&A activity would follow .
But its parameters have changed with the global financial crisis .
During a frantic weekend of talks , Fortis was effectively put up for sale .
BNP Paribas and ING showed an interest but pitched low - ball offers , and the Belgian , Dutch and Luxembourg governments opted to part - nationalize it .
That may still not be enough and Fortis is selling assets to shore up its capital , including the ABN Dutch retail bank business it bought for 24 billion euros but has not taken delivery of yet .
Those assets may only fetch about 7 billion euros now , analysts at Dresdner predicted .
ING has agreed to buy the business and will seal a deal in the next two weeks , people familiar with the matter said .
Britain 's government also stepped in to nationalize ailing lender Bradford & Bingley BB.L on Monday and Santander stepped in to buy its deposit book and branches , adding to its planned takeover of Alliance & Leicester ALLL.L .
“ ( It ) will mean , in effect , Abbey , A&L and B&B are all merging on the High Street , ” said Alex Potter , analyst at Collins Stewart .
Santander , BNP and others are benefiting from a strong capital position and more confidence among investors in their futures than most of their rivals .
The consolidation is also happening on a smaller scale elsewhere on the continent .
Denmark 's Vestjysk Bank VJBA.CO on Monday said it planned to buy two smaller peers hurt by the credit crisis , the latest in a surge of consolidation in the country 's banking sector .
Even the fragmented German market has consolidated , with a trio of big deals including a long - predicted but never delivered merger between Commerzbank and Dresdner , as the global credit shake - out triggers action .
The ' smart address bar ' makes finding previously visited sites easier Microsoft has released the second " beta " or test version of its latest browser Internet Explorer 8 ( IE8 ) .
It remains unclear when a final version of the program will be shipped , with the test version currently available for download .
IE8 offers a few surprises compared to the initial beta version released in March .
New features will include improved privacy and search functions , and ways to keep track of portions of web pages .
The release debuts two functions that were not available in the March release .
However , many in the blogosphere have noted that several of the improvements in IE8 have been available on other browsers for some time .
Searching made easier
One feature new to the release is the " smart address bar " .
Microsoft senior product manager James Pratt pointed out at that 80 % of the time , internet users were visiting sites they had been to before .
To address that , the new release archives visited sites based on their titles as well as their addresses .
That means a search in the address bar for words and phrases will find previously visited sites , as well as bookmarks .
Another new set of features makes web searching easier ; search terms entered in the search bar at the top of the browser now instantly display potential results in real time as the search term is typed .
Results are shown from user - defined search engines and websites , with rich visual content .
For websites with changing content , such as items on eBay or status pages on Facebook , IE8 's Web Slices allows users to keep up with the content without going to the webpage directly , accessible through the Favourites bar .
Tabs by colours
The new release also showcases Groups , which makes tabbed browsing easier .
Tabs opened from the same page are colour - coded , making it easier to keep track of different tab groups .
Web Slices keep track of changing content Tabs can also be moved around to different groups , with the tab taking on a new group 's colour .
Right - clicking tabs allows actions on the entire group , such as closing .
Users will also be relieved to find that if they inadvertently close a tab , IE8 offers an option to reopen it .
As with the earlier Beta release , the new version sports inPrivate Browsing mode , which leaves no trace of sites visited on the computer .
Behind the scenes , developers have made the browser more compliant with software standards , so that pages in IE8 will look the same as in any other browser .
While IE8's tab Groups and the way it sorts results in the smart address bar are novel , many have argued that the release is simply catching up to other , existing browsers .
IE8 's inPrivate mode performs the same job as the Private Browsing mode available in Apple 's Safari Browser , and the Web Slices function echoes Safari's Web Clips .
The " smart address bar " works much like the so - called " Awesome bar " in Mozilla 's latest release of its Firefox browser , and Firefox has long had the ability to reopen closed tabs .
However , Microsoft UK's Ian Moulster counters that IE8 was designed by studying what people need and want .
Though some functions appear similar , he says , they have been implemented in more user - friendly ways .
" If you look at the way the features work , like visual search and Web Slices , nobody else does them in the same way , and many do n't do them at all , " he says .
" I think if you add up the whole product across the board , it absolutely stands by itself in making the web easier and safer to use . "

What are these ?
Better late than never , I suppose .
For the last five years , some of us have argued that the government 's biodefense priorities are screwed up , massively .
Research into largely theoretical bio threats has sucked up money from tackling real killers , like tuberculosis .
In fact , the biggest threat may be from the proliferation of biodefense labs , packed with largely untrained staffs ; an accident or a malicious insider was more likely to cause serious damage than nearly any bioterrorist .
In the meantime , we 've seen biolab workers infected in Texas and Boston ; disease - ridden mice escaped ( twice ) , and a deadly flu strain accidentally shipped all over the country .
Today , The New York Times echoes what we 've been saying .
All it took was the suicide of Army biodefense scientist Dr. Bruce Ivins , a suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks .
" Has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure by multiplying the places and people with access to dangerous germs ? " the paper of record asks .
* More people in more places handling toxic agents create more opportunities for an accident or intentional misuse by an insider ...
There also is insufficient federal oversight of biodefense facilities to make sure the laboratories follow security rules and report accidents that might threaten lab workers or , in an extreme case , lead to a release that might endanger the public ...
In effect the government may be providing the tools that a would - be terrorist could use ... ...
Apart from the threat from insiders , some public health experts believe money being used to study obscure pathogens that are not a major disease problem could be better directed to study known killers like influenza or AIDS .*
" Partly in response to this criticism , government officials now often talk about how strengthening the systems necessary to respond to a terror attack would also prepare the country for a natural epidemic like avian flu , " the paper notes .
About time .
UPDATE : " Several years ago I would have pooh - poohed the idea that highly trained and vetted scientists would present such a risk , " biochem blogger Bugs n Gas Gal says .
" But for at least the last couple of years I ’ve felt that the expansion of biodefense labs is related not to research need but to homeland defense money .
If you build it they will come , and a couple of them might be frakking nuts .
Do we not now have enough investment in the study of the most dangerous , but least likely threats ? "

Obama could open early Iran nuclear talks - adviser Reuters
Published : Thursday August 28 , 2008
Print This Email This By Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama could open talks with Iran on its nuclear program early next year if he wins the White House , one of his senior foreign policy advisers said on Thursday .
Former U.S. national security adviser Tony Lake suggested Washington needed to give Tehran a sharper choice between the consequences of continuing its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons and the benefits of giving it up .
The Bush administration accuses Iran of seeking to develop atomic weapons and has sought to persuade Iran to give up its sensitive nuclear work through a carrot - and - stick approach of incentives and sanctions .
Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons , saying that its uranium enrichment program is to generate electricity .
After refusing to talk directly to Iran on the nuclear issue unless it first suspending uranium enrichment , Bush in July changed policy and sent a top diplomat to join a meeting of major powers -- Britain , China , France , Germany and Russia -- with Iran .
Obama strongly backed that move .
He has said that if elected he would pursue a policy of greater engagement aimed at persuading Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions but has not been specific about the timing .
The United States , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany presented a new package of incentives to Tehran last month , offering to hold off on further sanctions if Iran froze expansion of its nuclear work .
Iran has not accepted the offer .
The United Nations Security Council has already passed three resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran .
Obama hopes the administration makes progress before Bush steps down in January , Lake said , but he believes the United States and its allies needed to devise tougher potential sanctions to increase its leverage over Tehran .
' PRESENT A CHOICE '
" He ( Obama ) is saying that as soon as he takes office that we have to have a very serious set of negotiations with the Iranians in which we in effect present them with a choice , " Lake said in a panel on the sidelines of the Democratic convention in Denver , broadcast by C - Span television .
The United States needed to make clear that there " will be consequences " to the pursuit of nuclear weapons , Lake said .
" We have to work with other nations now in increasing the leverage that we have for that negotiation and increasing the sanctions that could be placed on the Iranians , " he said .
Speculation that the United States or Israel might resort to military action against Iran has rattled oil markets in recent months .
Lake said the United States needed to make clear to the Iranians they would benefit if they changed direction .
" It is a course that will help them build up an economy that is showing considerable strain , " he added .
" Everybody in this room should pray that they make that latter choice , " he said .
" This is an extremely important issue , an extremely serious issue and an extremely urgent issue .
" It could well lead to the worst crisis that we will see over the next five years because the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon will present a huge threat to the security of Israel , to others in the region , to the Europeans , including the Russians , and many others . "

) shows a sample of products that have experienced significant deflation in the last ten years ( as well as deflation in the last few years in almost all cases ) , double - digit percentage decreases in all cases except for new cars ( - 3.4 % ) .
Then considering that average hourly earnings have increased by almolst 40 % over the last ten years , the real prices of those products have fallen by an even greater amount , a HUGE amount .
In other words , there are many , many products like computers , cameras , new cars , clothing , TVs , appliances , electronics , software , etc. that are significantly cheaper today than ten years ago , especially after adjusting for increases in earnings .
At GUADEC John ( J5 ) Palmieri announced the GNOME Cookbook project , this delicious dessert is my first contribution to the project , I hope you like it !
The Italian translation of the recipe is on my cooking blog .
Ingredients
4 eggs
3/4 cup ( 150 g ) sugar
1 pound ( 500 g ) mascarpone cheese
salt
1 3/4 lbs. ( 800 g ) strawberries
1/2 lemon
2 tbs. rum
3/4 lbs. ( 340 g ) savoiardi ( lady fingers )
Instructions
Update : I have an updated version of this recipe on my cooking blog .
Whisk the yolks with half of the sugar making a cream , then add mascarpone cheese and rum .
In a bowl whip the egg whites to hard peaks with a pinch of salt and add them to the mascarpone cream .
Wash the strawberries in very cold water and cut off the tops .
Place in a blender 1 lb. strawberries , the lemon juice and the remaining sugar , and blend to puree .
Arrange a layer of savoiardi dipped in the juice in a serving dish and spread with some cream .
Repeat layering with remaining savoiardi and cream .
Slice remaining strawberries and garnish the tiramisù with them .
Place in the refrigerator for some hours so the savoiardi can soften and absorb the juice .

Hacking Mifare Transport Cards
London ’s Oyster card has been cracked , and the final details will become public in October .
NXP Semiconductors , the Philips spin - off that makes the system , lost a court battle to prevent the researchers from publishing .
People might be able to use this information to ride for free , but the sky wo n’t be falling .
And the publication of this serious vulnerability actually makes us all safer in the long run .
Here ’s the story .
Every Oyster card has a radio - frequency identification chip that communicates with readers mounted on the ticket barrier .
That chip , the “ Mifare Classic ” chip , is used in hundreds of other transport systems as well — Boston , Los Angeles , Brisbane , Amsterdam , Taipei , Shanghai , Rio de Janeiro — and as an access pass in thousands of companies , schools , hospitals , and government buildings around Britain and the rest of the world .
The security of Mifare Classic is terrible .
This is not an exaggeration ; it ’s kindergarten cryptography .
Anyone with any security experience would be embarrassed to put his name to the design .
NXP attempted to deal with this embarrassment by keeping the design secret .
The group that broke Mifare Classic is from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands .
They demonstrated the attack by riding the Underground for free , and by breaking into a building .
Their two papers ( one is already online ) will be published at two conferences this autumn .
The second paper is the one that NXP sued over .
They called disclosure of the attack “ irresponsible , ” warned that it will cause “ immense damages , ” and claimed that it “ will jeopardize the security of assets protected with systems incorporating the Mifare IC . ”
The Dutch court would have none of it : “ Damage to NXP is not the result of the publication of the article but of the production and sale of a chip that appears to have shortcomings . ”
Exactly right .
More generally , the notion that secrecy supports security is inherently flawed .
Whenever you see an organization claiming that design secrecy is necessary for security — in ID cards , in voting machines , in airport security — it invariably means that its security is lousy and it has no choice but to hide it .
Any competent cryptographer would have designed Mifare ’s security with an open and public design .
Secrecy is fragile .
Mifare ’s security was based on the belief that no one would discover how it worked ; that ’s why NXP had to muzzle the Dutch researchers .
But that ’s just wrong .
Reverse - engineering is n’t hard .
Other researchers had already exposed Mifare ’s lousy security .
A Chinese company even sells a compatible chip .
Is there any doubt that the bad guys already know about this , or will soon enough ?
Publication of this attack might be expensive for NXP and its customers , but it ’s good for security overall .
Companies will only design security as good as their customers know to ask for .
NXP ’s security was so bad because customers did n’t know how to evaluate security : either they do n’t know what questions to ask , or did n’t know enough to distrust the marketing answers they were given .
This court ruling encourages companies to build security properly rather than relying on shoddy design and secrecy , and discourages them from promising security based on their ability to threaten researchers .
It ’s unclear how this break will affect Transport for London .
Cloning takes only a few seconds , and the thief only has to brush up against someone carrying a legitimate Oyster card .
But it requires an RFID reader and a small piece of software which , while feasible for a techie , are too complicated for the average fare dodger .
The police are likely to quickly arrest anyone who tries to sell cloned cards on any scale .
TfL promises to turn off any cloned cards within 24 hours , but that will hurt the innocent victim who had his card cloned more than the thief .
The vulnerability is far more serious to the companies that use Mifare Classic as an access pass .
It would be very interesting to know how NXP presented the system ’s security to them .
And while these attacks only pertain to the Mifare Classic chip , it makes me suspicious of the entire product line .
NXP sells a more secure chip and has another on the way , but given the number of basic cryptography mistakes NXP made with Mifare Classic , one has to wonder whether the “ more secure ” versions will be sufficiently so .

As automakers dropped their latest batch of awful sales numbers on the market on Tuesday , reinforcing the gloom spreading across the economy , the troubles confronting American workers seemed to intensify .
Plummeting home prices have in recent months eliminated jobs for hundreds of thousands of people , from bankers and real estate agents to construction workers and furniture manufacturers .
Tighter lending standards imposed by banks in the wake of huge mortgage losses have made it hard for many Americans to secure credit  the lifeblood of expansion in recent years  crimping the appetite of consumers , whose spending amounts to 70 percent of the economy .
Joblessness has accelerated , and employers have slashed working hours even for those on their payrolls , shrinking the size of paychecks just as workers need them the most .
Now , add to that unsavory mix the word from automakers that sales plunged in June  by 28 percent for Ford , 21 percent for Toyota and 18 percent for General Motors  a sharp sign that consumers are pulling back , making manufacturers more likely to cut production and impose more layoffs .
Until recently , the weak labor market has been marked more by the reluctance of employers to create new jobs than by mass layoffs .
Maybe it's his badass black outfit with blood - red letters screaming " Scientology Kills . "
Or possibly it's his crew cut , or his nose slammed 45 degrees left after catching one too many right hooks .
Maybe it 's the hardcore cell - phone earpiece or the camcorder strapped to his palm to record confrontations .
Whatever it is , when Tommy Gorman stands at a man 's door demanding he get his " chicken - shit ass out here , " you doubt it 's an invitation to a civil chat .
( Also See : Anonymous 101 and footage from the recent Anonymous yacht party by Lauren Smiley . )
Gorman moved the man whose rear was in question , president of the San Francisco Church of Scientology Jeff Quiros , to his shitlist about seven years ago .
The feeling is mutual .
" I do n't hold the best wishes for Tommy Gorman , " Quiros says .
" He 's a lying criminal , and I would hope he ends up going to jail one day for the things he 's done . "
Quiros would not be taking Gorman up on his offer for a tête - à - tête that July afternoon , earning him Gorman 's favorite epithet of " coward . "
Gorman 's antagonism used to be directed at people exactly like himself .
He was raised in Scientology — his family called Quiros " Uncle Jeff " — and never questioned that enemies of the religion deserved harassment .
While defending Scientology , he heckled psychiatrists entering conventions before he could do multiplication , and held " Religious Bigot " signs outside critics ' houses before he could legally drink .
But Gorman 's loyalty to Scientology turned to rage against it in 2001 , after his then - teenage friend Jennifer Stewart , now his wife , alleged she was forcibly raped by an adult staff member of the Mountain View branch of the church .
Both say that Scientology officials , including Quiros , urged them not to go to the police .
Scientology staffers vigorously deny both allegations .
In a later civil suit , the church weighed the bad press that might come from the " incendiary " allegations coming out at trial and paid Stewart a handsome 2005 out - of - court settlement that barely made the news .
It could have been expected that Tommy Gorman would n't go quietly , especially since he 's convinced that the organization known for ardently going after its critics intimidated his family with threats , stalking , and even allegedly tampering with his car .
He now stakes out the city 's Scientology headquarters in the old Transamerica building at the foot of Columbus Avenue , where the late Scientology founder and science - fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard 's words are gospel .
Gorman turns the bulldog picketing tactics back on the organization he now calls a cult .
He even shaves " S.P. " on the back of his head , mocking the " suppressive person " label reserved for Scientology 's most evil critics .
Although Gorman never received the official declaration as such , Quiros says he considers Gorman one .
Gorman says it 's an honor .
Yet before January , no one dreamed that Gorman would be backed up by the most unlikely of allies : an army of Internet geeks pissed about a censored Tom Cruise video .
The troops call themselves Anonymous , Quiros calls them the " electric Klan , " and they have stepped out of cyberspace in masks to bring down Scientology , too .
With an estimated 10,000 members worldwide , the Anons form the largest movement to ever oppose Scientology since mobilizing on Web message boards earlier this year .
Their numbers have galvanized ex-Scientologists formerly too scared to protest their former church and others , like Gorman , who had picketed but who could never find a critical mass of support .
Until now .
" I 'm not going to go away , " Gorman says .
" I 've already told [ Scientology ] if they want to get rid of me they 're going to have to kill me , and they 've already tried that . "
On YouTube , a sample of a video filmed and produced by Gorman shows a heavy - set man puffing on a cigarette as he walks down the sidewalk lined with Anonymous protesters toward the church 's door .
Gorman recognizes the man as the brother of Kevin Creech , who defected from the S.F. organization four years ago .
Creech was declared an SP and then " disconnected " by his two Scientologist brothers .
( Policy requires that members must cut off contact with SPs , family or not . )
It 's just more ammunition for Gorman : " Heeey !
How 's it feel knowing that your brother , Dan Creech , he wo n't talk to your other brother , Kevin ? " he taunts .
" How 's Kevin doing since you do n't talk to Kevin ? ...
Do n't be a coward ! "
The man silently holds the door for another Scientologist approaching with a walker , exposing himself to yet more time with his heckler .
( " You can see in his face , he 's like , ' Can you just hurry up ? ' " says Kevin Creech , who later watched the video online . )
Gorman is undeterred : " Are you being a coward again ?
Why wo n't you talk about disconnection ? ...
They lied to [ Kevin ] , Scientology did !
What else is Scientology lying about ? "
Gorman 's wife , Jennifer , chimes in : " It 's so sad you got disconnected from your family . "
Mike Creech pops a stick of gum in his mouth with studied nonchalance and walks through the doorway as Gorman calls after him : " C'mon , let 's talk about this !
Kevin 's been in good communication with me ! "
Gorman 's aggression comes off as obnoxious to most , and even Anonymous has questioned whether Gorman , known in Anon culture as an " old guard " critic , is an asset or liability to the cause .
In June , one Anon started a thread on the anti-Scientology site www.enturbulation.org saying he was " disgusted " by Gorman 's methods : " People who need to dump their aggression should go to the gym and do some bagwork , not take it out on individual Scinos [ Scientologists ] .
... I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS BEHAVIOUR WORKS AGAINST US , AND FOR THE CHURCH . "
Others were Gorman apologists : " Tommy has been heavily fucked by the cult , and I think he has a lot of justifiable anger , " one wrote .
In other forums , others profess respect : Tommy " would eat two handfuls of glass shards if he thought it made some kind of point about how much scilons [ Scientologists ] suck . "
There 's no denying Gorman and Anonymous use very different means for a common end .
The " raids , " as Anons refer to their picketing , are much like parties laced with the idiosyncratic humor of an Internet culture fueled by " lulz " ( a take - off of " lol , " Internet shorthand for " laugh out loud " ) .
While dance music blares from speakers , protesters decked out in everything from a Pac - Man head to a furry panda sweatsuit dance with signs , eat cake , and call each other some variation of " faggot . "
With lines like " You 're too cool to be in a cult ! " the Anons ' goal is to get Scientologists to question their own beliefs , or at least to research their church and learn about its grinding down of critics in the legal system or scandals such as Operation Snow White , in which church agents infiltrated and stole documents from U.S. government agencies that were investigating it .
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is considering legislation that would permit new offshore drilling as part of a broad energy bill , a response to growing anxiety within her party that Republicans are gaining traction with election - year attacks that Democrats are n’t doing enough to address high gasoline prices .
One proposal under consideration would let states decide whether to permit new energy exploration off their coasts while possibly maintaining the drilling ban off the Pacific Coast , according to a House leadership aide who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations .
Pelosi has long opposed lifting the drilling ban but has come under pressure from members of her own party -- including freshmen in tough reelection campaigns -- to allow a vote on offshore drilling .
Adding to that , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama recently said that he would be open to limited offshore drilling if it was part of a broader energy compromise .
A vote is likely to be held next month , after the House returns from its summer recess .
Advertisement
What exactly would be voted on was still being discussed Wednesday .
Democrats are expected to insist that any bill include some of their priorities , such as the repeal of oil industry tax breaks and a requirement that utilities generate more electricity from cleaner energy sources .
Those measures , which have drawn GOP opposition , could complicate the passage of any measure .
That is especially true in an election year , with time running out on the congressional session and partisan tensions running high .
Pelosi said on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live ” this week that she would consider a vote on offshore drilling but that “ it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax ” -- part of a broader package that would probably include investment in alternative energy sources , releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and targeting speculation in energy markets .
Pro-drilling forces remained suspicious .

“ Just because a bill comes to the floor with ‘ offshore ’ and ‘ energy ’ in the title does n’t mean it ’s a good offshore drilling bill , ” said Brian Kennedy , a former House Republican leadership aide who is now with the Institute for Energy Research , a Washington group that promotes free - market energy policies .
“ Speaker Pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to , and even then it ’s not going to have much energy in it . ”
President Bush and Republican presidential candidate John McCain have called for lifting the long - standing ban on new offshore drilling , but Pelosi has called the proposal an election - year ploy by oil industry allies .
She has said that new offshore drilling would provide no immediate relief from high gas prices and that , even in the long run , it would have only a negligible effect on energy costs at potential risk to the environment .
At least 31 Democrats have signed on as cosponsors of legislation to permit new drilling 25 miles off the coast -- or , if states object , 50 miles offshore .
The number of Democratic supporters is expected to grow once lawmakers get an earful from their constituents about high gasoline prices , said Dave Helfert , a spokesman for Rep. Neil Abercrombie ( D - Hawaii ) , one of the bill ’s chief sponsors .
Counting Republicans , the bill has 124 House sponsors .
The bill should get the support of oil - patch Democrats , or those from petroleum - producing states , plus the backing of some Democrats who have previously voted against new offshore drilling .
It includes measures aimed at attracting more Democratic support , such as funding for such party priorities as development of alternative fuels , like solar and wind power , and energy assistance to low - income households .
Advertisement
The idea of letting states decide whether to permit drilling has gained support in the Senate too .
A bipartisan group of senators recently unveiled a compromise that would let Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia decide whether to allow drilling 50 miles off their shorelines .
Drilling opponents are stepping up their efforts to preserve the ban .
MoveOn.org Political Action , which supports the election of candidates favoring the MoveOn.org agenda , has run radio ads in some GOP - held districts attacking the incumbents for accepting oil industry campaign contributions and calling new offshore drilling a gimmick that would n’t produce oil for years .
The ad also accuses GOP lawmakers of being more interested in “ political stunts than honest solutions , ” a reference to the Republicans who have stayed behind on the House floor during the summer recess to criticize Democrats -- even with the cameras and microphones off -- for leaving town without acting on major energy legislation .
Advertisement
The issue has presented Pelosi with a sticky political problem .
On one hand , with gas prices on voters ’ minds , public support for offshore drilling has increased , even in California , where a 1969 oil spill devastated the coast off Santa Barbara .
Republicans have spotlighted Pelosi ’s opposition to new coastal drilling in attacks on Democrats throughout the country .
But the drilling ban has long been a priority for environmentalists , an important Democratic constituency , and party leaders prefer to shield their members from politically tough votes close to an election .
Rep. Tim Walz ( D - Minn. ) , who supports the bill sponsored by Abercrombie and Rep. John E. Peterson ( R - Pa. ) , called it a good compromise .
Not only does the measure “ show the public that we ’re going to do something ” about gas prices , he said , but it includes elements meant to win the support of lawmakers , like him , who are outside the oil patch and want to develop alternative energy sources in their districts .
Advertisement
Rep. Jim Costa ( D - Fresno ) , another cosponsor of the Abercrombie - Peterson bill , said that more than 50 House Democrats would probably support a balanced energy package that would include new offshore drilling .
“ And I ’ll bet you when members come back from their districts , you ’ll find more movement taking place , ” he said .
Costa said that he told Pelosi during a recent meeting that “ it ’s nonsensical that it ’s safe to drill off the coast of Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi , and yes , California , but it ’s not safe to drill anywhere else .
. . .
The average hardworking American does n’t understand that . ”
But Rep. Lois Capps ( D - Santa Barbara ) , a leading opponent of new offshore drilling , said in a statement that although she was “ always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters , ” she had n’t seen “ a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among Democrats . ”

“ Holding a vote on a policy to keep doing more of the same drill - only strategy makes no sense , and I do n’t think that you ’ll see the Congress do that , ” she said .

One of the most glaring examples of ‘ socialism ’ in the United States is the Alaska Permanent Fund and , in particular , the Permanent Fund Dividend .
I wo n’t go into all the particulars ( if you are interested , follow the links ) but the bottom line is that there is an amendment in the Alaska Constitution which dictates that 25 % of Big Oil ’s sales and royalties be set aside in a fund that is managed by a semi-independent corporation .
As part of that , each Alaskan enjoys an annual dividend check .
The amount of the check varies .
In 1984 it was $ 331 and this year it was $ 3,269 .
One of the reasons that this year ’s check was so large is that Sarah Palin included a one - time bonus ( Alaska Resource Rebate ) of $ 1,200 .
If you want to know why some polls give her an 80 % approval rating , look no further than the fact that she paid every Alaskan a $ 1,200 bonus this year .
Some countries have nationalized oil sectors .
Other countries have some kind of hybrid situation .
The United States ( with the exception of Alaska ) allows all minerals ( national resources , really ) to be utilized by corporations .
The people of Texas , for example , do not get a check in the mail from Exxon / Mobil .
What goes on in Alaska is the exact kind of thing that so upsets Oil Men when it happens in Venezuela or Iran , that they start talking about coups , invasions , and the menace of international communism terrorism .
Now , I do n’t have a problem in any general sense with the way Alaska orders its business , but I do wonder why Alaskan citizens are so lucky and the rest of us see no benefit from the wealth created by tapping our national resources .
In addition to getting a nice , fat check every year , Alaskans have other advantages :
Alaska is the only state that does not collect state sales tax or levy an individual income tax on any type of personal income , either earned or unearned .
To finance state operations , Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues .
Some of its cities and other local jurisdictions , however , do collect sales tax revenue .
Mayor Palin , for example , raised the local sales tax to help pay for an athletic arena in Wasilla .
In any case , Alaska is different from the other 49 states in that it is a quasi - socialist state .
And that is highly unusual in a country that is almost pathologically opposed to the idea of any kind of state - owned , state - run anything .
We ca n’t even get people to take the idea of a single - payer health care system seriously , let alone let the people share in the profits from mineral and timber extraction .
In fact , it ’s this culture of the sanctity of private enterprise and privitization that has a lot of liberals gloating at the prospect of the U.S. government owning 80 % of the world ’s largest insurer , AIG .
The level of hypocrisy inherent in the Bush administration ’s decision to take over AIG is staggering .
But , Sarah Palin , at least , should n’t be too unsettled .
No word yet if a McCain / Palin administration will cut us all annual dividend checks out of AIG ’s sales and royalties .
OPW INTERVIEW -- Sep 20 -- SayHeyHey does video , quite well .
It 's Great Expectations online , for free .
Here 's my interview with the CEO .
- Mark Brooks
What is your background and founding story ?
My origins are from Ukraine .
I immigrated to the U.S when I was 7 years old and moved to Los Angeles .
I got my undergraduate and graduate degree in engineering at Stanford University .
Afterwards I started working in the start up world in Silicon Valley .
As an online dater , I used JDate .
I discovered that there was a large gap between what people say in their profiles and what the reality was when you met them .
A lot of the pictures that you see are of people that are 10 years and 40 pounds ago with a lot of static content and generic stuff like walks on the beach .
That does n’t tell you much .
I thought there could be a better solution .
And that ’s kind of how SayHeyHey came about .
How is your site different and how do people use SayHeyHey ?
It ’s free online video dating .
We ’ve built an online dating site with online dating mechanisms built in but the introductions happen via video with the idea that video provides a much more meaningful way of communicating .
You can see people ’s mannerisms and hear their voice .
You can get a better sense of who they are even if they ’re talking about generic things , so there is a higher chance of a good match when you meet them live .
Members can have multiple private or public videos in their profiles .
If they like somebody they found on our site by browsing or through our matching algorithm , they can send their own video to that person .
If the person likes the video and accepts the introduction , the two parties are automatically connected and they can have a free flowing conversation where they can set up a date , exchange phones numbers , whatever they like .
I like to think of it as YouTube with an online dating mechanism built behind it with a sophisticated video delivery platform inside as well .
However when we launched , our users told us a completely different story of what they wanted .
It became more of a soap box for people to share their experiences with online dating , their love life , relationships , and sex .
This brought out a lot of entertainment value that has been dormant in online dating to this date and SayHeyHey became an entertainment media property as well .
The other key aspect is that we ’re targeting the 18 to 28 year old demographic , which has largely been neglected in the online dating community .
If you look at Match.com and eHarmony , the average age there is around 33 to 35 years .
Those are people who are looking to settle down ; they have disposable income to pay $ 30 to $ 35 a month for the service .
That ’s not the case with young adults .
They ’re not looking to get married .
They ’re looking to have fun , to date , hook up and enjoy funny videos .
That ’s what we are providing here .
How are things going with Verizon ?
I saw you had a partnership with Verizon .
Yeah that ’s right .
When we launched Verizon reached out to us and said : “ Hey guys you have some really compelling content here .
You are targeting the demographic that we ’re trying to reach . ”
So we did a deal in a few months to distribute and license SayHeyHey content on V - Cast .
We have our own channel and we ’ve been live with them since May .
I could n’t be happier having such a great partner , which also helps us on the distribution side in addition to revenue .
How do you make money ?
There are several ways .
Licensing with Verizon is a big part of our revenue mix .
There are other opportunities that I can’t really talk about too much but let ’s just say mobile is a big part of our strategy and there are other integrations with sort of traditional media that we ’re working with to get SayHeyHey content out there and make some revenue out of licensing as well .
Advertising will be a big part as well once we think its best for our users .
That will probably take from a post roll out , pre roll out in video ad campaign .
We ’re also going to offer a premium account , which will allow live video chat and conversations , as well as a Pay - for - Placement model which allows users to bid for added exposure on our home page to get more hits , and hopefully more dates .
This has proven to work well in Europe .
Have you considered working with other site ?
Absolutely .
We had some preliminary conversations with a few major players that I can’t discuss but its one of the strategies we ’re evaluating at the moment .
What are your goals for 2008 through 2009 ?
Where do you see your company being ?
Our key focus right now is to keep growing the user base and more importantly creating more and more content .
We have a couple of things in the works that are fairly innovative and fairly groundbreaking .
What we ’re trying to do is really shake up the online dating industry .
From my perspective , it has really been lacking innovation for a long , long time and that ’s why you ’re seeing such bad growth numbers in the United States for online dating – 7 % compared to Europe ’s 40 % .
A lot of the major players are afraid to innovate because they do n’t want to mess up what they have , which is pretty nice revenue numbers from their entrenched base .
So we ’re trying to shake that up as much as possible and we ’re going to do that through our content and through our products .
Another focus in the next year will be the international expansion .
We are planning a strong push in Latin America this Fall .

Thought Crimes
Last night , around 11:15 PM , I suddenly realized that I needed something for work the following day .
So I hopped in my car and zipped to the local grocery store , a mile away .
On the way home , I was pulled over for speeding .
" Do you know how fast you were going ? " the cop asked after approaching my window .
I did , because I had glanced at the speedometer the moment he 'd appeared in my rear - view mirror .
" Yeah , about forty , " I said , rounding down a bit .
He let my fudging go unchecked and moved on to question # 2 .
" And do you know what the speed limit is ? "
Thirty - five , I responded dutifully .
" Well , right now it 's 35 , " the policeman conceded .
" But during the day it 's only 25 .
Because this is a school zone . "
He paused for dramatic effect , before saying " And just imagine if you 'd been driving 40 when school was in session . "
Maybe the suggestion was rhetorical , but I have a pretty active imagination and decided to give it a whirl .
I closed my eyes and envisioned myself traveling 40 miles an hour , cresting the hill at midday .
Before me are a dozen children , gaily frolicking in the middle of the street .
What are they doing there ?
The school is half a mile away and completely fenced in .
And surely they have some form of supervision , right ?
I pushed aside such doubts , determined to comply with the officer 's request .
In fact , I decided to go the extra mile .
I am not just driving my Toyota Corolla while school is in session , thought I , I am behind the wheel of a truck .
A tanker truck .
A tanker truck of nitroglycerin !
I barrel over the summit at 40 -- no , 90 miles an hour !
The cab of the vehicle briefly lifts from the ground entirely , as if about to take flight , before slamming back down to the asphalt .
The scores of children sitting in the road ahead freeze , their faces suffused with apprehension .
Each holds a goldfish bowl containing one of the few remaining specimens of the endangered Knysna seahorse .
As I approach , a single ray of sunshine pierces the overcast skies like a javelin thrown by God , ricochets off the Columbia Center in downtown Seattle , and strikes the back of my truck , igniting a small fire .
I told those fools not to make the tank out of chipboard !
In the rear - view mirror I watch as the blaze spreads , gnawing its way through the wall of the vessel .
When I again return my attention to the road ahead of me , I see that the nuns , into whose care the students have been entrusted , have rushed into the street , frantically trying the herd the children to safety .
Their cries of terror echo from the houses nearby , as the distance between us dwindles ...
Haha .
No , I 'm just joking -- I did n't imagine any of that .
I just adopted my " dude you blew my mind " face for a few second and then said , " wow , yeah .
I totally see your point . "
Anyway , long story short , he gave me an imaginary ticket for imaginarily driving 40 during imagined school hours , and a warning .
Always make sure you have latex or vinyl gloves in your kit .
Blood born pathogens are very real and not everyone is upfront or knows about infections or health problems .
You may also encounter injured people or need to treat someone with your first aid kit .
Do n't forget to wear your gloves .
The gloves can also be handy if you must treat yourself and have dirty hands .
It will help keep the first aid process cleaner and reduce your risk of infection .
The missiles would be similar to those based in Alaska and California Poland has signed a preliminary deal with the US on plans to host part of its new missile defence shield .
Under the agreement , the US will install 10 interceptor missiles at a base on the Baltic coast in return for help strengthening Polish air defences .
The US says the system will protect itself and Europe against long range missile attacks by " rogue states " .
Moscow has voiced anger at the deal , saying it worsens ties with the West already strained by the war in Georgia .
At a press conference in Moscow , the deputy chief of general staff , Gen Anatoly Nogovitsyn , said US plans for a missile base in Poland " cannot go unpunished " .
" It 's a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation , the American side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the United States and Russia , " he said .
Moscow has argued the project will upset the military balance in Europe and has warned it will be forced to redirect its missiles at Poland .
We agreed this negotiating phase a week ago , which was ... before the events in Georgia

Q&A : US missile defence Guide to planned US missile shield Deal cools Polish - Russian relations However , Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told the BBC's World Tonight programme that the timing of the deal had nothing to do with the hostilities .
" We agreed this negotiating phase a week ago , which was ... before the events in Georgia , and because of the US calendar there was some urgency , " he said .
" But , what is crucial , and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days , was that the US offered us new proposals . "
Unlike the US , Poland sees Russia as a bigger threat to its security than so - called rogue states such as Iran , the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is reported to have cancelled a scheduled visit to Poland shortly after the deal was announced .
Modernisation Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the agreement on national television shortly before it was signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer and US chief negotiator John Rood .
Mr Tusk said Washington had agreed to meet Warsaw 's main demands in exchange for hosting the 10 interceptor missiles in a former military base near Poland 's Baltic Sea coast .

In return , the US had agreed to help modernise the Polish armed forces and locate Patriot missiles and a garrison of US servicemen in Poland to beef up its air defences , Mr Tusk said .
Poland is reported to have demanded the extra security help as part of the deal after Moscow threatened to target its missiles at any eventual bases .
A White House spokeswoman said US President George W Bush " was very pleased with this development " .
" In no way is the president 's plan for missile defense aimed at Russia .
In fact , it 's just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at Russia given how Russia could overwhelm it , " she told AFP .
The US signed an agreement with the Czech Republic in July to base tracking radars there as part of the missile defence system .
The US wants the sites to be in operation by about 2012 .

What are these ?
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed 55 years ago , on June 19 , 1953 .
But last week , they were back in the headlines when Morton Sobell , the co-defendant in their famous espionage trial , finally admitted that he and his friend , Julius , had both been Soviet agents .
It was a stunning admission ; Sobell , now 91 years old , had adamantly maintained his innocence for more than half a century .
After his comments were published , even the Rosenbergs ’ children , Robert and Michael Meeropol , were left with little hope to hang on to -- and this week , in comments unlike any they ’ve made previously , the brothers acknowledged having reached the difficult conclusion that their father was , indeed , a spy .
“ I do n’t have any reason to doubt Morty , ” Michael Meeropol told Sam Roberts of the New York Times .
With these latest events , the end has arrived for the legions of the American left wing that have argued relentlessly for more than half a century that the Rosenbergs were victims , framed by a hostile , fear - mongering U.S. government .
Since the couple ’s trial , the left has portrayed them as martyrs for civil liberties , righteous dissenters whose chief crime was to express their constitutionally protected political beliefs .
In the end , the left has argued , the two communists were put to death not for spying but for their unpopular opinions , at a time when the Truman and Eisenhower administrations were seeking to stem opposition to their anti-Soviet foreign policy during the Cold War .
To this day , this received wisdom permeates our educational system .
A recent study by historian Larry Schweikart of the University of Dayton has found that very few college history textbooks say simply that the Rosenbergs were guilty ; according to Schweikart , most either state that the couple were innocent or that the trial was “ controversial , ” or they “ excuse what [ the Rosenbergs ] did by saying , ‘ It was n’t that bad .
What they provided was n’t important . ’ ”
Indeed , Columbia University professor Eric
Foner once wrote that the Rosenbergs were prosecuted out of a “ determined effort to root out dissent , ” part of a broader pattern of “ shattered careers and suppressed civil liberties . ”
In other words , it was part of the postwar McCarthyite “ witch hunt . ”
But , in fact , Schweikart is right , and Foner is wrong .
The Rosenbergs were Soviet spies , and not minor ones either .
Not only did they try their best to give the Soviets top atomic secrets from the Manhattan Project , they succeeded in handing over top military data on sonar and on radar that was used by the Russians to shoot down American planes in the Korean and Vietnam wars .
That ’s long been known , and Sobell confirmed it again last week .
To many Americans , Cold War espionage cases like the Rosenberg and Alger Hiss cases that once riveted the country seem irrelevant today , something out of the distant past .
But they ’re not irrelevant .
They ’re a crucial part of the ongoing dispute between right and left in this country .
For the left , it has long been an article of faith that these prosecutions showed the essentially repressive nature of the U.S. government .
Even as the guilt of the accused has become more and more clear ( especially since the fall of the Soviet Union and the release of reams of historical Cold War documents ) , these “ anti anti-communists ” of the intellectual left have continued to argue that the prosecutions were overzealous , or that the crimes were minor , or that the punishments were disproportionate .
The left has consistently defended spies such as Hiss , the Rosenbergs and Sobell as victims of contrived frame - ups .
Because a demagogue like Sen. Joseph McCarthy cast a wide swath with indiscriminate attacks on genuine liberals as “ reds ” ( and even though McCarthy made some charges that were accurate ) , the anti anti-communists came to argue that anyone accused by McCarthy or Richard Nixon or J. Edgar Hoover should be assumed to be entirely innocent .
People like Hiss ( a former State Department official who was accused of spying ) cleverly hid their true espionage work by gaining sympathy as just another victim of a smear attack .
But now , with Sobell ’s confession of guilt , that worldview has been demolished .
In the 1990s , when it was more than clear that the Rosenbergs had been real Soviet spies -- not simply a pair of idealistic left - wingers working innocently for peace with the Russians -- one of the Rosenberg ’s sons , Michael , expressed the view that the reason his parents stayed firm and did not cooperate with the government was because they wanted to keep the government from creating “ a massive spy show trial , ” thereby earning “ the thanks of generations of resisters to government repression . ”
Today , he and his brother Robert run a fund giving grants to the children of those they deem “ political prisoners , ” such as convicted cop killer Mumia Abu - Jamal .
Ironically , if there was any government that staged show trials for political ends , it was the government for which the Rosenbergs gave up their lives , that of the former Soviet Union .
This week , the Meeropols made it clear to the New York Times that they still believe the information their father passed to the Russians was not terribly significant , that the judge and the prosecutors in their parents ’ case were guilty of misconduct , and that neither Julius nor Ethel should have been given the death penalty for their crimes .
On the subject of their mother , the Meeropols have a point .
In another development last week , a federal court judge in New York released previously sealed grand jury testimony of key witnesses in the case , including that of Ruth Greenglass , Julius ’ sister - in - law .
It turns out that a key part of her testimony for the prosecution -- that Ethel had typed up notes for her husband to hand to the Soviets -- was most likely concocted .
That does n’t mean that Ethel was innocent -- indeed , the preponderance of the evidence suggests she was not .
But what is clear is that in seeking to get the defendants to confess to Soviet espionage , the prosecutors overstepped bounds and enhanced testimony to guarantee a conviction .
Americans should have no problem acknowledging when such judicial transgressions take place , and in concluding that the execution of Ethel was a miscarriage of justice .
Nevertheless , after Sobell ’s confession of guilt , all other conspiracy theories about the Rosenberg case should come to an end .
A pillar of the left - wing culture of grievance has been finally shattered .
The Rosenbergs were actual and dangerous Soviet spies .
It is time the ranks of the left acknowledge that the United States had ( and has ) real enemies and that finding and prosecuting them is not evidence of repression .
Ronald Radosh , an emeritus professor of history at City University of New York and an adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , is the coauthor of “ The Rosenberg File . ”
European Union leaders will discuss sanctions against Russia ahead of an emergency summit meeting , the French foreign minister said today , as western leaders increased diplomatic pressure on Moscow .
When asked what measures the west could take against Russia in the crisis over Georgia , Bernard Kouchner told a press conference in Paris : " Sanctions are being considered . "
He gave no details , but the threat reflects western impatience at Moscow after its invasion of Georgia and its recognition of Georgia 's breakaway provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , as independent .
Despite Kouchner 's comments , it will not be easy to reach consensus on sanctions within the EU as some states will be unwilling to jeopardise mutually beneficial relations with Moscow .
In particular , the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , is unlikely to support any moves that could damage relations and interrupt the flow of gas and oil to Europe .
It is the first time that France , which prides itself on good relations with Moscow , has raised the possibility of sanctions or other measures in the standoff between the west and Russia .
" I do not want to prejudge the issue before the EU summit on Georgia has taken place , " Kouchner said .
" But we will work hard with our 26 partners to draft a strong statement that signifies our refusal to accept the situation in Georgia .
France does not support breaking off relations with Russia .
This will have to be sorted out through negotiation .
This will take time , we are not deluding ourselves . "
Analysts say the EU is not contemplating the type of sanctions imposed on Iran or Zimbabwe , which include arms embargoes and travel bans .
But the EU is likely to postpone talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia scheduled for September , or at the extreme , break them off indefinitely .
Similarly , France , which is scheduled to host a biannual meeting of the EU - Russia council in Nice in November , may decide it is not the time to roll out the red carpet for the Russians .
Recent moves to forge security ties with Russia appear doomed .
Moscow has expressed interest in having a role in attempts to forge a common European defence policy .
Russia had offered the use of helicopters to the EU as an incentive for being included .
On the economic front , analysts speculated the EU could take a closer look at the activities of Gazprom , the Russian energy giant in Europe .
Gazprom gets 70 % of its profits from sales to EU countries , and the size of the market gives the EU important leverage .
The flipside is that Europe , particularly Germany , depends heavily on these supplies .
As to support for Georgia , the EU could improve visa access for its citizens , give Tbilisi greater trace access to the EU , or hold an EU - Georgia summit .
The Russian foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , dismissed the idea of sanctions as the product of a " sick imagination " .
" My friend Kouchner also said that we will soon attack Moldova and Ukraine and the Crimea ...
But that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well , " he told reporters at a security meeting in the Tajik capital , Dushanbe .
" I think it is a demonstration of complete confusion . "
France , which brokered a ceasefire between Russia and Georgia , has called an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Monday to discuss the most serious rupture between Russia and the west since the end of the cold war .
Russia failed to get the robust support it was seeking from its allies on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) , a security group that includes China and that Russia help set up .
After a meeting in Dushanbe , attended by the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , the group condemned the use of force and called for respect for every country 's territorial integrity .
" The SCO states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully , through dialogue , and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks , " the final declaration said .
Britain said it would not accept the redrawing of Europe into spheres of influence .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said such concepts were " anathema " and belonged to the second world war era of Yalta .
He rejected the argument that Nato was an offensive alliance seeking to encircle Russia .
The 1945 agreement at the Yalta conference , between the leaders of Britain , the US and the Soviet Union , saw the allied powers accept that eastern Europe fell into Moscow 's sphere of influence .
Miliband 's comments on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme followed a tough statement signed by himself and the foreign ministers of the US , Canada , France , Germany , Italy and Japan deploring Moscow 's " excessive use of military force " in Georgia .
The statement , described as an " unprecedented step " by the Foreign Office , followed a warning from Miliband delivered in Kiev , the Ukrainian capital , to Medvedev that he bore a " big responsibility " not to provoke a new cold war .
The foreign ministers said Moscow 's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violated Georgia 's integrity and sovereignty .
" We ... condemn the action of our fellow G8 member .
Russia 's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN security council resolutions supported by Russia . "
In his interview , Miliband rejected the notion that his visit to Ukraine had been provocative .
He said he went there because it was important to say to a friendly country that " we support their democratic choices " .
The foreign secretary reiterated Britain 's support for Ukraine 's wish to be in Nato and rebuked Russia for treating its neighbours as if they were either " enemies or vassals " .
Miliband , tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister , went to Kiev to deliver a speech flying the flag of western democracy on Russia 's doorstep , while seeking to avert a new crisis on the Crimean peninsula , home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow 's Black Sea fleet .
The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years , delivered in a country that is Russia 's neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation .
Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe 's relations with Russia , ending nearly two decades of relative tranquillity .
He said Tuesday 's decision by Medvedev to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe .
" [ Medvedev's ] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance , " Miliband said .
" It is not just the end of the post - cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe .
It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law . "

Shadow home secretary David Davis has resigned as an MP , promising to fight to regain his seat on a platform of defending " British liberties " .
The Lib Dems are not taking part in the by -election in Haltemprice and Howden , while Labour has yet to decide .
Mr Davis said the government was facing a test of " nerve " over its plans to extend detentions for terror suspects .
But Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said the resignation showed the Conservatives were in " disarray " .
Mr Davis said he would fight the by - election campaigning against the government 's plans to extend pre-charge detentions for terror suspects to a maximum of 42 days .
' Their issue '
The proposal passed through the Commons on Wednesday by a margin of nine votes , against the opposition of the Tories , Lib Dems and 36 Labour MPs .
Mr Davis said : " It would be very unlikely that the Labour Party would n't stand .
" This is their issue ...
If they do n't , what does it show about their nerve ?
What matters is the principles that we are dealing with here . "
At the last general election , in 2005 , Mr Davis was re-elected in Haltemprice and Howden with a 5,116 majority , with the Lib Dems second and Labour third .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said his resignation was an extraordinary move almost without precedent in British politics .
This can not go on .
It must be stopped and for that reason today I feel it is incumbent on me to make a stand
David Davis
Analysis : High - risk strategy A profile of David Davis Will Davis face a challenge ?
So far no party has said it will put up a candidate against Mr Davis - the Lib Dems say they support him on terror detention and Labour is still deciding whether to take part in what some of its MPs have described as a " stunt " .
The BNP , which came fourth in the seat in the 2005 general election , says it will not stand against Mr Davis as it agrees with his stance on terror detention .
UKIP , which was fifth , said it was still considering its position , although one of its MEPs , Godfrey Bloom , has offered to campaign for Mr Davis .
If no other candidate has come forward by the close of nominations , Mr Davis would be returned as the MP without a vote .
' Personal decision '
He has led the opposition to Labour 's plans to extend the maximum limit terror suspects can be held beyond the current 28 - day maximum .
On Wednesday , Mr Davis accused the government of " buying " the nine votes they needed to get the legislation through the Commons .

He vowed that the Conservatives , who are the official opposition and favourites to win at the next election , would continue the fight in the House of Lords .
Tory leader David Cameron paid tribute to his campaign on 42 days and insisted the party would not change its policy .
But he stressed Mr Davis ' resignation had been " a personal decision , a decision he has made " .
He said it was a " courageous " move and he hoped Conservatives would support Mr Davis 's by - election campaign .
This resignation is quite extraordinary and without precedent that I can think of in British politics and means that politics is now utterly unpredictable
Nick Robinson
BBC Political Editor
Read Nick 's thoughts in full Q&A : Davis resignation
But he added : " We can not put home affairs on pause and it is my job to ensure that we have a team that 's ready for government . "
Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve , whom Mr Cameron has appointed as the new shadow home secretary , rubbished reports the Tory leadership was split on the issue of 42 days and pledged to repeal the measure if the party gained power .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " Faced with a crucial decision on the safety and protection of the British public , the Conservatives have collapsed into total disarray on what is their first big policy test since they have come under greater scrutiny .
" David Cameron must come clean on what has really happened and why David Davis has really resigned . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg , who also voted against 42 day detention , said his party would not be fielding a candidate in the by - election , after speaking to Mr Davis .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It has come to something when it takes the lone bravery of a Tory MP and the house of Lords to protect civil liberties in this country Peter Hearty , London Mr Davis mounted a passionate attack on government plans to extend terror detention in the Commons on Wednesday - only to see the government win the key vote by the narrowest of margins .
In his resignation statement , he said he feared 42 days was just the beginning and next " we 'll next see 56 days , 70 days , 90 days " .
But , he added : " In truth , 42 days is just one - perhaps the most salient example - of the insidious , surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental British freedoms . "
He listed the growth of the " database state , " government " snooping " ID cards , the erosion of jury trials and other issues .
" This can not go on .
It must be stopped and for that reason today I feel it is incumbent on me to make a stand , " said Mr Davis .

The small country of Niue today became the first nation to provide OLPC ( One Laptop Per Child ) laptops to all of its public school students -- but then again , that number amounts to only 500 .
Niue 's 200 secondary school students received their PCs last month , according to a report by Radio New Zealand International .
The 300 primary school children in Niue got their laptops today , in conjunction with the Pacific Islands Forum , a summit being held there which focuses on climate change .
Dr. Barry Vercoe , an MIT professor , told Radio New Zealand that students can use PCs to explore this issue .

" Children can become involved in observing the effects of climate change for themselves .
And that , of course , is one of the fastest ways -- or best ways -- of enabling these children to learn about the realities of the situation , " according to Vercoe .
An OLPC spokesperson told BetaNews today that Vercoe , a native of Australia , is also a very active OLPC volunteer .
The donation of 500 computers to Niue is part of a larger move to distribute 5,000 OLPC laptops throughout the Pacific region , according to a report by Agence France Presse ) .
The OLPC spokesperson noted that , elsewhere in the Pacific , OLPC volunteers have already donated laptops to students in New Guinea .
Larger OLPC donations have been made in nations that include Uruguay , Haiti , Mexico , Peru , and Rwanda , for example , BetaNews was told .
As previously reported in BetaNews , the OLPC Project originated at MIT , before OLPC was spun off as a separate not - for - profit organization .
If Niue rings a bell -- or maybe a familiar number -- then you 're an astute reader of BetaNews indeed .

Mother convicted of neglect after leaving toddler alone for weekend
A mother was convicted of neglect today after leaving her two - year - old son home alone for the weekend while she went to stay with her boyfriend .
Kelly Tollerton , 22 , left the toddler penned into the kitchen of her flat , which later flooded .
He was found by police in inches of water wearing a dirty vest and pants , sobbing for help behind a baby gate , the jury at Lincoln crown court heard .
The boy was forced to use dirty laundry for a bed and eat from plates left on the kitchen floor .
The youngster was so hungry that he sifted through rubbish for food , the court heard .
Tollerton was convicted of one count of child cruelty by way of neglect , one of child cruelty by way of abandonment and one of perverting the course of justice .
During Tollerton 's trial the court heard how the mother came home from college , put her son in his baby seat in the kitchen , got changed and went out .
Tollerton claimed she spent the weekend with her partner , 36 - year - old Ken Hill , while her friend looked after her son .
Yet her son , now four , was only found when water seeped through from her flat to the apartment below and neighbours raised the alarm .
The court heard that when police found the youngster in November 2006 at Tollerton 's Lincoln flat , there was also a spoon and a packet of chocolate on the kitchen floor .
Tollerton 's son is now being cared for by foster parents .
Recorder William Harbage QC told Tollerton she faced a custodial sentence .
She will be sentenced on June 27 .

Has at the end a new twist on " Able Danger " - were THEY the babysitters ?
There 's not a lot of evidence here but an explanation of how this organisation works , in context with " Able Warrior " , in practice actions where each group trades off and pretends to fight the other .
No back - up of this was offered but it bears thinking about .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks skidded Monday , with the Dow slumping nearly 778 points , in the biggest single - day point loss ever , after the House rejected the government 's $ 700 billion bank bailout plan .
The day 's loss knocked out approximately $ 1.2 trillion in market value , the first post - $ 1 trillion day ever , according to a drop in the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 , the broadest measure of the stock market .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 777.68 , surpassing the 684.81 loss on Sept. 17 , 2001 - the first trading day after the September 11 attacks .
However the 7 % decline does not rank among the top 10 percentage declines .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 8.8 % , its seventh worst day ever on a percentage basis and the biggest one - day percentage drop since the crash of ' 87 , when it lost 20.5 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) fell 9.1 % , its third worst day on a percentage basis and also its worst decline since the crash of ' 87 .
Stocks tumbled ahead of the vote and the selling accelerated on fears that Congress would not be able come up with a fix for nearly frozen credit markets .
The frozen markets mean banks are hoarding cash , making it difficult for businesses and individuals to get much - needed loans .

" The stock market was definitely taken by surprise , " said Drew Kanaly , chairman and CEO of Kanaly Trust Company , referring to the House vote .
" If you watched the news stream over the weekend , it seemed like it was a done deal .
But the money is being held hostage to the political process . "
Stocks had fallen from the get - go Monday morning .
In addition to expectations for the bailout , there was also news that troubled Wachovia had to sell its banking assets to Citigroup .
A number of European banks also collapsed .
But the possibility that the House wo n't pass the bailout plan caused stock losses to accelerate .
" It 's a huge disappointment , " said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank .
Although another version of the plan will likely go before Congress , investors are concerned that passing the bill could be a more drawn - out process .
On Monday afternoon Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said markets around the world are under great stress and that a plan needs to be passed as soon as possible .
" People do expect that there will be some plan put in place , but even before this vote , there was doubt as to whether it would be enough to avert the crisis , " said Ken Kam , portfolio manager of the Marketocracy Masters 100 ( MOFQX ) fund .
Investors thought they would be debating whether the plan was good enough , he said , not whether the plan would even go through .
But the ' good enough ' question remains in place .
" We are charting new territory in policy tools and implementation with this program and there 's no guarantee that it will work , " said Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments .
" That a number of institutions have n't been able to last through the negotiations adds to the uncertainty , " Gayle said , referring to Washington Mutual 's failure on Friday and the buyout of Wachovia Monday .
Stocks are also extremely choppy and volatile as Wall Street moves to the end of the third quarter .
Financial institutions and funds are expected to have their books settled before Wednesday , so there is a lot of last - minute scrambling , Gayle said .
Treasury prices rallied , sending yields lower , as investors sought safety in government debt .
Government rescue plan : Congress had supposedly reached a compromise on the $ 700 billion bank bailout plan Sunday , but the House voted against the bill Monday .
The bill is based around Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's initial plan to buy up bad mortgage debt from banks as a means of getting them to lend to each other again .
However , Congressional lawmakers added provisions to protect taxpayers and enable them to benefit if the companies do as well .
( Full story )
But it was shot down , with lawmakers voting largely along party lines , with House Republicans mostly voting against it and House Democrats mostly voting for it .
Investors also remained skittish amid more bank turbulence - and banks continued to hoard cash .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world announced steps Monday to make billions available to troubled banks .
Wachovia : Citigroup is buying the company 's bank assets in a $ 2.2 billion all - stock deal that will see the company hold onto its brokerage business and remain afloat , albeit in a smaller form .
The deal calls for Citigroup to absorb up to $ 42 billion in losses and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to be responsible beyond that .
Citigroup will give the FDIC $ 12 billion in preferred stock and warrants in exchange .

Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) shares began trading in the afternoon , plunging 81 % .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) fell almost 12 % .
Last week , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) bought Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) , after it suffered the largest failure ever of a U.S. bank .
JPM shares fell 15 % Monday .
On Monday , regional bank National City ( NCC , Fortune 500 ) slumped 63 % on worries that it might be next .
Other regional banks dropped too .
Bank of New York ( BK , Fortune 500 ) fell 27 % , Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) fell 43 % and Regions Financial ( RF , Fortune 500 ) fell 41 % .
Big banks fell too , including Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners 19 to 1 on volume of 2.05 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by over five to one on volume of 2.88 billion shares .
Global markets : Worldwide markets struggled .
Asian and European markets ended lower after three European banks fell apart .
Dutch - Belgian bank and insurance giant Fortis was given a $ 16.4 billion lifeline to avoid it collapsing .
The British government nationalized battered U.K. bank Bradford & Bingley .
Germany 's financial regulators and several banks stepped in Monday to throw a line of credit to Hypo Real Estate Holding AG in a multibillion - euro move aimed at shielding the No. 2 commercial property lender .
Credit markets : Businesses depend on the credit markets to function on a daily basis , and the absence of ready capital has threatened to stall the broader financial system .
Several measures of bank fears surged Monday , suggesting that despite the bailout , banks remain worried .
However , as with stock markets , the freezing up could be an immediate knee - jerk reaction that is mitigated once Congress passes the bill .
Additionally , credit markets may have been more focused on Wachovia and the other distressed banks , than the bailout .
The Libor - OIS spread , one gauge that banks use to determine lending rates , rose to a record 2.2 % .
Meanwhile , the TED spread hit a more than 26 - year high of 3.58 % before dipping back to 3.54 % .
The TED spread is the difference between what banks charge each other to borrow for three months and what the Treasury pays .
When banks charge each other a higher premium than the U.S. government , that 's a sign of fear .
The three - month Treasury bill , seen as the safest place to park money in the short term , fell to 0.34 % from 0.83 % late Friday .
Earlier this month , the three - month bill fell to a 68 - year low around 0 % as panic gripped financial markets .
Long - term
Treasury prices rose , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.58 % from 3.82 % late Friday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Treasury prices have been rallying recently and yields tumbling as nervous stock market investors have looked for safer areas to move their cash .
Other stock movers : Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) slumped almost 18 % after RBC and Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the stock to " neutral " from " buy " saying the consumer spending slowdown will hurt profits .

Among other movers , Circuit City ( CC , Fortune 500 ) slipped 21 % after it reported a wider - than - expected quarterly loss and withdrew its fiscal 2009 outlook due to tepid sales .
All 30 Dow components ended lower and all lost at least 3 % .
Oil and gold : U.S. light crude oil for November delivery fell $ 10.52 to settle at $ 96.37 a barrel , in the second - biggest one - day plunge ever .
( Full story )
Oil prices had plummeted over $ 55 after peaking at $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 , as investors bet that sluggish global growth will diminish oil demand .
But prices have seesawed in the last few weeks as the financial crisis has intensified and investors sought to put their money into hard assets .
COMEX gold for December delivery rose $ 5.90 to $ 894.40 an ounce .

Habib Miyan lived with 32 relatives
An Indian man reported to be the oldest in the world has died in the western city of Jaipur .
Habib Miyan 's pension papers showed his date of birth as 20 May 1879 , but he claimed he was 138 .
He shot into limelight five years ago when he managed to complete his only unfulfilled dream , to visit the Muslim holy place of Mecca in Saudi Arabia .
A UK - based businessman paid $ 5,700 for the trip after reading his story on BBC News Online .
Mr Miyan lived in a Muslim neighbourhood of Jaipur with 32 relatives .
He claimed to be 138 ( his pension book said 129 ) .
He lost his vision 50 years ago and had limited mobility for many years .
He had been drawing a pension since 1938 , but relatives say he could not afford to pay for a trip to Mecca .
After reading his story on BBC News Online , a UK - based businessman sent him money to be able to undertake the Haj pilgrimage .
When the US military trains soldiers to resist interrogation , it uses a torture technique from the Middle Ages , known as " waterboarding " .
Its use on terror suspects in secret US prisons around the world has come to symbolise the Bush administration 's no-nonsense enthusiasm for the harshest questioning techniques .
Although waterboarding has been considered torture for over a century and the US military is banned from using it , controversy over its continuing use by the CIA may be about to derail the appointment of President Bush 's candidate for US Attorney - General .
Michael Mukasey , a retired federal judge from New York and a veteran of several al - Qa'ida trials , was questioned by a Senate committee on Tuesday and refused to say whether waterboarding was illegal .

Instead , he called the technique " repugnant to me " and promised to investigate further if he was confirmed in the job .
He explained that he could not say yet whether the practice was illegal because he had not been briefed on the secret methods of US interrogators and he did not want to put the CIA officers who used it in " personal legal jeopardy " .
Even though Congress banned waterboarding in the US military in 2005 , it did not do so for the CIA .
As a result , Mr Mukasey told senators , it was uncertain whether this technique or other harsh methods constituted " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment .
His answers did not satisfy the Democrats , however , and his approval now hinges on whether he is willing to say the torture method is against US law .
In a further embarrassment for Mr Bush yesterday , Malcolm Nance , an advisor on terrorism to the US departments of Homeland Security , Special Operations and Intelligence , publicly denounced the practice .
He revealed that waterboarding is used in training at the US Navy 's Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape School in San Diego , and claimed to have witnessed and supervised " hundreds " of waterboarding exercises .
Although these last only a few minutes and take place under medical supervision , he concluded that " waterboarding is a torture technique – period " .
The practice involves strapping the person being interrogated on to a board as pints of water are forced into his lungs through a cloth covering his face while the victim 's mouth is forced open .
Its effect , according to Mr Nance , is a process of slow - motion suffocation .
Typically , a victim goes into hysterics on the board as water fills his lungs .
" How much the victim is to drown , " Mr Nance wrote in an article for the Small Wars Journal , " depends on the desired result and the obstinacy of the subject .
" A team doctor watches the quantity of water that is ingested and for the physiological signs which show when the drowning effect goes from painful psychological experience to horrific , suffocating punishment , to the final death spiral .
For the uninitiated , it is horrifying to watch . "
The CIA director Michael Hayden has tried to defuse the controversy .
He claims that , since 2002 , aggressive interrogation methods in which a prisoner believes he is about to die have been used on only about 30 of the 100 al - Qai ' da suspects being held by the US .
Meanwhile , a CIA official told The New York Times waterboarding had only been used three times .
The Bush administration has suggested that the interrogation of al - Qai'da 's second - in - command , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , was a success thanks to the technique , and used this to justify continued aggressive interrogations of suspects in secret CIA prisons .

While US media reports typically state that waterboarding involves " simulated drowning " , Mr Nance explained that " since the lungs are actually filling with water " , there is nothing simulated about it .
" Waterboarding , " he said , " is slow - motion suffocation with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration .
When done right , it is controlled death . "
Mr Nance said US troops were trained to withstand waterboarding , watched by a doctor , a psychologist , an interrogator and a backup team .
" When performed with even moderate intensity over an extended time on an unsuspecting prisoner – it is torture , without doubt , " he added .
" Most people cannot stand to watch a high - intensity , kinetic interrogation .
One has to overcome basic human decency to endure watching or causing the effects .
The brutality would force you into a personal moral dilemma between humanity and hatred .
It would leave you to question the meaning of what it is to be an American . "
Mr Mukasey 's nomination goes before the Senate next week .
Three Democratic presidential candidates , including Hillary Clinton , have already said they will not support him .
However , the White House said yesterday that it did not believe his nomination was in jeopardy .
' I felt I was drowning and I was in terrible agony '
Henri Alleg , a journalist , was tortured in 1957 by French forces in Algeria .
He described the ordeal of water torture in his book The Question .
Soldiers strapped him over a plank , wrapped his head in cloth and positioned it beneath a running tap .
He recalled : " The rag was soaked rapidly .
Water flowed everywhere : in my mouth , in my nose , all over my face .
But for a while I could still breathe in some small gulps of air .
I tried , by contracting my throat , to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could .
But I could n't hold on for more than a few moments .
I had the impression of drowning , and a terrible agony , that of death itself , took possession of me .
In spite of myself , all the muscles of my body struggled uselessly to save me from suffocation .
In spite of myself , the fingers of both my hands shook uncontrollably .
' That 's it !
He 's going to talk , ' said a voice .
The water stopped running and they took away the rag .
I was able to breathe .
In the gloom , I saw the lieutenants and the captain , who , with a cigarette between his lips , was hitting my stomach with his fist to make me throw out the water I had swallowed . "

Covering Obama and McCain
Wednesday , August 06 , 2008
By Bill O'Reilly
ADVERTISEMENT
Beginning on Monday , September 8 , " The Factor 's " coverage of the presidential race will shift into high gear and take on a different look — more of an investigative tone .
Up until now , we 've covered the candidates on what they 've said and how they 've attacked each other .
Pretty standard stuff .
What separates us from most opinion programs on TV and radio is that we have not been rooting for anyone or spinning stuff to hammer one candidate while giving the other a pass .
We are skeptical of both candidates .
Now , I 'm simply bored with the gotcha game every night parsing a candidate 's words hoping to make him look bad .
I mean , what is the value of that ?
It 's just dumb .
Here 's an example .
Yesterday , Obama said he will now consider drilling for new oil if alternative energy measures are included in the bill .
That 's a change in his position .
Why ?
Because the polls say 70 percent of Americans now want new drilling .
So the senator responded to the polls .
And you can make the call whether he 's a flopper or not .
John McCain now says he 's a big alternative energy guy in addition to being a driller .
But no ANWR and he voted against alternative energy in the past .
Is McCain being disingenuous ?
Again , you have to make the call .
What 's amusing is that both candidates are hammering each other over the energy debacle , even though both have made big mistakes on the issue and neither has a clear plan for the future .
So it 's politics as usual and " Talking Points " has a headache .
Next week , Obama heads to Hawaii to raise money and take a vacation .
McCain will continue his whistle stops and town meetings .
I do n't expect much to happen before the conventions , but in this gotcha climate you 've got to tune in every night for the latest .
Now the conventions themselves will be predictable , but " The Factor " will be there , so that will liven things up a bit .
We 'll cause some trouble , but expect a lot of bloviating from the pols .
Bush will be the devil in Denver , Obama the destroyer in Minneapolis .
After that , it will be September and we 'll begin our microanalysis of the campaign .
Since we still do n't know much about Barack Obama 's belief system , we 'll spend some time on that .
And we will profile his career and associations as well .
We hope the senator will finally speak with us , but we 're not counting on it .
As I 've stated , this election is basically a yes or no vote on Obama .
You know what you 're getting with McCain , but Obama remains somewhat of a mystery .
However , come November , he wo n't be .
Count on it .
And that 's " The Memo . "
Pinheads & Patriots
Most Americans respect our military people , and some are even helping them .
Sixteen - year - old Lizzie Palmer from Ohio created a five - minute video honoring the troops , and it has received 25 million hits on YouTube .
Lizzie herself plans to join the Army , and she is , indeed , a patriot .
On the pinhead front , actress Mary - Kate Olsen was a friend of the late Heath Ledger , and the feds want to talk to her about the actor .
But Ms. Olsen is refusing to talk without immunity because the situation involves Ledger 's drug - taking , which killed him .
Olsen says she knows nothing about that .
If that is true , then why does she need immunity ?
She may be a pinhead .

Sen . Chuck Schumer said , \ " I would not be afraid to attack back\ " to McCain ads .

Schumer : ' Hit McCain harder '
One of the Democratic Party 's leading electoral street fighters , New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , said that Barack Obama should respond to John McCain 's personal attacks with an equally personal slap .
" I would not be afraid to attack back , " said Schumer , who chairs the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee , in an interview with Politico .
" When they say , ' He 's not one of us , ' you do n't say , ' Here 's our plan on health care , " ' he said .

" I thought the Britney Spears commercial was powerful , " Schumer said , referring to McCain 's television ad casting Obama as a vapid " celebrity . "
Currently promoting the paperback edition of his book " Positively American , " which argues for a Democratic agenda pitched around a new set of bread - and - butter issues and government activism on behalf of middle class voters , Schumer did n't directly criticize Obama 's strategy .
Rather , he argued for a higher - velocity response .
" I would answer back hard .
What do you mean he 's not one of us ?
It 's John McCain who wears $ 500 shoes , has six houses , and comes from one of the richest families in his state , " Schumer said .
" It 's Barack Obama who climbed up the hard way , and that 's why he wants middle - class tax cuts and better schools for our kids . "
Obama 's campaign responded to McCain 's barrage by accusing him in television ads and press releases of taking the " low road , " while casting Obama as above such attacks on his opponent 's character .
The strategy has produced some questions in Democratic circles as to whether Obama should n't be hitting back more personally - but Obama 's aides argue that the perception that McCain is running a traditional , negative campaign is damaging McCain 's reputation for high - minded independence .
Schumer argued that Obama will best be able to make his case on issues if he 's also willing to slap back on matters of character .
" McCain 's an unappealing candidate , " Schumer said .
" McCain 's done great things for our country , but he does n't particularly empathize with the plight of the average person . "
Schumer argues in a new preface to his book that Americans ' economic insecurity could make 2008 a realigning landslide .
" This election has the potential to effect the kind of paradigm - shifting change that occurs once in a generation , " he writes , comparing the vote to Franklin Roosevelt 's rise in 1932 and Ronald Reagan 's in 1980 .
" If it 's decided by issue and policy offerings , this election might just be the one that creates a political majority for a generation . "
Schumer , who supported his junior New York senator , Hillary Rodham Clinton , in the primary , said he never underestimated Obama 's strength .
" He 's an amazingly capable person , and I think everyone in the Senate knew that , " he said .
" It was a close race , a hard - fought contest , I think either one of these candidates would have made a great president and would beat McCain , " he said .
Though Schumer seemed to be urging Obama to hit back harder , he said Americans ' general unhappiness at the state of affairs would dampen the effect of Republican attacks on his character and readiness to lead .
" I think there 's a real chance that Obama gets 300 electoral votes , " he said .
" This is a change election and the more people get to know him and see him the better it will be . "
1 Fill a thick glass bowl with water and ice .
The thicker and more insulated the bowl , the better .
It should be able to trap the cold water and ice mixture .
Add as much ice to the water as you can , but not so much that it prevents the entire beverage container from being submerged into the water .
A 50/50 mix of ice and water is a good rule of thumb .
If you just need to chill one or a few drinks , this is fine .
If you have to chill many drinks , you 're better off using a cooler or even your bathtub .
2 Add a pinch of salt to the water .
A small handful should do .
The salt will disassociate into its constituent sodium and chloride ions .
The water molecules , being polar , will orient themselves accordingly .
This is work , and work requires energy which comes from thermal energy in the water , thus reducing the ambient temperature further .
3 Put your drinks in the ice water solution and rapidly stir them .
Stirring the drinks will help the heat transfer out of your drink and into the ice solution more quickly .
4 Wait about two minutes .
The temperature should have fallen dramatically in a very short time .
If it needs more time chilling , stir the remaining drinks in the salted ice water for another minute or two .
Welcome to the final installment of this series , which has looked at the advantages of Django 's loose binding philosophy .
At first , we looked at replacing Django 's templating system with Jinja2 .
Next , we looked at using SQLAlchemy instead of Django 's ORM , and in this third segment we are going to look at using CouchDB instead of a traditional object relational database for data storage .
CouchDB is one of the more exciting projects -- measured in number of semi-plausible day dreams it has inspired -- I 've run into in the past year .
It is an ideological rival to relational databases , and instead of being focused on highly detailed schemas ( long ints , varchars of length 25 , and blobs of binary data , oh my ) it deals in documents .
These documents may be comprised of identical fields , but may also contain dissimilar fields , allowing the same flexibility as Google 's BigTable .
Beyond that , CouchDB brings some other unexpected goodies to the table like document versioning1 .
Before we get started you 'll need to install CouchDB , which wo n't be covered in this tutorial ( install on OS X , install on Windows , install on Ubuntu ) .
Our Project
In this tutorial we 're going to use CouchDB to store the data for a simple Django webapp which will allow us to post and edit simple text documents online .
Before we get started we have a bit of setup to do .
First we need to have Django installed .
We 'll be using the SVN version , which can be installed like this ( note that you 'll bee to replace SITE - PACKAGES - DIR with your Python 's site - packages directory ) : svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/
django - trunk ln -s ` pwd ` / django - trunk / django SITE - PACKAGES-DIR /django
Next , we need to install the Python library , couchdb - python , which interfaces with CouchDB. easy_install couchdb
Third , we need to create a Django project ( for those who do n't want to go through all the steps themselves , you can download a zip file containing the code created in this tutorial ) .
django-admin.py startproject comfy_django_example
You may not have django - admin.py in your system path , in which case you 'll need to run it from inside your local checkout of Django .
For me that looks like : ~/svn/django - trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py startproject comfy_django_example
Now , we need to create a Django application inside of our comfy_django_example project .
cd comfy_django_example python manage .py startapp couch_docs
We 're almost done getting setup , just need to configure a few settings .
Go ahead and open up the settings.py file in the comfy_django_example folder .
We 'll make this change : INSTALLED_APPS = ( ' comfy_django_example.couch_docs ' , )
We 'll also edit the comfy_django_example / urls.py file to look like this : urlpatterns = patterns ( ' comfy_django_example ' , ( r'^ ' , include ( ' couch_docs.urls ' ) ) , )
Getting to Know CouchDB
Before we go on and start fleshing out the webapp , lets spend a few minutes playing with CouchDB at the Python command line .
First , we need to start running CouchDB .
If you have symlinks properly setup , it should be as simple as :
some - computer : ~ user $ couchdb Apache CouchDB 0.8.0 - incubating ( LogLevel = info )
Apache CouchDB is starting .
Apache CouchDB has started .
Time to relax .
Now fire up a Python interpreter .
python
First you need to create an instance of Server which represents the local CouchDB server running on your computer .
>>> from couchdb import * >>> s = Server ( ' http://127.0.0.1:5984/' ) >>> s < Server ' http://127.0.0.1:5984/'> >>> len ( s ) 0
Now lets create a couple of databases , iterate through all the databases , and delete the database .
>>> s . create ( ' users ' ) >>> s . create ( ' docs ' ) >>> len ( s ) 2 >>> for x in s : ... print x ... docs users >>> del s [ ' users ' ] >>> del s [ ' docs ' ] >>> len ( s ) 0
Now lets create another database , and actually store some data in it .
>>> db = s . create ( ' docs ' ) >>> len ( db ) 0 >>> db . create ( { ' type ' : ' Document ' , ' title ' : ' Document One ' , ' txt ' :
" This is some text . " } ) u'fd179491f0d95268eb1761e0439cf3e2 ' >>> len ( db ) 1
We can also create named documents as well .
>>> db [ ' manifesto ' ] = { ' type ' : ' Document ' , ' title ' : ' Personal Manifesto ' , ' txt ' : ' I strongly believe in something .
I think . ' } >>> db [ ' manifesto ' ] < Document u'manifesto'@u '818144524 ' {u'txt ' : u'I strongly believe in something .
I think . ' , u'type ' : u' Document ' , u'title ' : u' Personal Manifesto'} >
Retrieving and extracting data from documents is easy as well .
>>> a = db [ ' manifesto ' ] >>> a [ ' title ' ] u' Personal Manifesto ' >>> a [ ' title ' ] = " Ehm. Lame title . " >>> a < Document u'manifesto'@u '818144524 ' {u'txt ' : u'I strongly believe in something .
I think . ' , u'type ' : u'Document ' , u'title ' : ' Ehm .
Lame title .'} >
If we want to run a specific query , we write a JavaScript function for this .
For example , lets say wanted to retrieve all documents with a title greater than length 4 , we 'd write this JavaScript :
function ( d ) { if ( d . title .
length > 4 ) emit ( d . name , null ) ; }
Now , to run that query in Python we have to do this :
>>> func_str = " function (d ) { if ( d.title.length > 4 ) emit ( d.title , null ) ; } " >>> for row in db .
query ( func_str ) : ... print row .
key ... Document One Personal Manifesto
Its a bit hard to understand whats going on in that query , so lets break it down .
emit is used for returning the data you want ; the first argument is the key in the result set , and the second argument is the value in the result set .
The next example should help clarify things .
>>> func_str = " function (d ) { if ( d.title.length > 4 ) emit( d.title , d ) ; } " >>> results = db . query ( func_str ) >>> results < ViewResults < Temporary View ' function (d ) { if ( d.title.length > 4 ) emit( d.title , d ) ; }' None > { } > >>> for row in results : ... print row .
key ... print row .
value ... Document
One {u'txt ' : u' This is some text .' , u'_rev ' : u'709275850 ' , u'_id ' : u'fd179491f0d95268eb1761e0439cf3e2 ' , u'type ' : u' Document ' , u'title ' : u' Document One'} Personal Manifesto {u'txt ' : u'I strongly believe in something .
I think . ' , u'_rev ' : u'818144524 ' , u'_id ' : u'manifesto ' , u'type ' : u' Document ' , u'title ' : u' Personal Manifesto'}
We can also access the data using list comprehensions .
>>> [ x . key for x in results ] [ u' Document One ' , u'Personal Manifesto ' ]
Now for the last example we 'll walk through all the steps at once .
>>> from couchdb import * >>> s = Server ( ' http://127.0.0.1:5984/' ) >>> db = s . create ( ' software ' ) >>> db [ ' FireFox ' ] = { ' type ' : ' browser ' , ' title ' : ' FireFox ' } >>> db [ ' Safari ' ] = { ' type ' : ' browser ' , ' title ' : ' Safari ' } >>> db [ ' Aquamacs ' ] = { ' type ' : ' editor ' , ' title ' : ' Aquamacs ' } >>> len ( db ) 3 >>> only_browsers = ' function (d ) { if ( d.type == " browser " ) emit ( d.title , d ) ; } ' >>> [ x . key for x in db .
query ( only_browsers ) ] [ u' FireFox ' , u'Safari ' ] >>> del s [ ' software ' ]
With that command line experimentation under our belt , its pretty easy to imagine how to use CouchDB for most of your data storing , retrieval and manipulation needs .
Now on to our coup de grace2 : integrating CouchDB with Django .
Integrating CouchDB with Django
We 're going to put together a very simple application .
It 'll have two views : the index view will display a list of all available documents and allow you to create a new document , and the detail view will allow you to edit an existing document .
First , lets create the couch_docs / urls .py file .
from django.conf.urls.defaults import * urlpatterns = patterns ( ' comfy_django_example.couch_docs.views ' , ( r'^doc /(? P< id >\w+ ) /' , ' detail ' ) , ( r'^$ ' , ' index ' ) , )
Next , we need to edit the couch_docs / views .
py file .
We 'll start with the imports and also some code to create a CouchDB database named docs if it does n't already exist .
from django.http import Http404 , HttpResponseRedirect from django. shortcuts import render_to_response from couchdb import Server from couchdb.client import ResourceNotFound SERVER = Server ( ' http://127.0.0.1:5984' ) if ( len ( SERVER ) == 0 ) : SERVER . create ( ' docs ' )
If you were following best practices you 'd probably want to create a COUCHDB_SERVER entry in your settings .py file and then do something like this :
from django.conf import settings SERVER = Server ( getattr ( settings , ' COUCHDB_SERVER ' , ' http://127.0.0.1:5984' ))
But for the time being we 'll stick with the simpler , albeit less flexible , solution of specifying the server in the views .
py file itself .
Now , lets write the views .
The index view does two things .
On a GET request it displays all the existing documents in the database , and on a POST request it creates a new document and redirects to that document 's detail view .
def index ( request ) : docs = SERVER [ ' docs ' ] if request .
method == " POST " : title = request .
POST [ ' title ' ] . replace ( ' ' , '' ) docs [ title ] = { ' title ' : title , ' text ' : " " } return HttpResponseRedirect ( u" /doc / %s / " % title ) return render_to_response ( ' couch_docs/index.html ' , { ' rows ' : docs })
Notice that we 're passing rows as extra context for the index.html template in the exact same way we 'd pass data queried using the Django ORM .
The detail view has two functions as well .
If it gets a GET request , then it will display the document ( along with a form for editing it ) , and on POST requests it will update the document .
We 'll also want to throw a 404 error code if someone requests a document that does n't exist .
def detail ( request , id ) : docs = SERVER [ ' docs ' ] try : doc = docs [ id ] except ResourceNotFound : raise Http404 if request .
method == " POST " : doc [ ' title ' ] = request .
POST [ ' title ' ] . replace ( ' ' , '' ) doc [ ' text ' ] = request .
POST [ ' text ' ] docs [ id ] = doc return render_to_response ( ' couch_docs/detail.html ' , { ' row ' : doc })
Please note that the docs [ id ] = doc line is not optional , and the entry for the document will not be updated without that line , despite update the documents keys .
I 'm uncertain if that is an oversight in the library or an intentional decision to cut back on http requests , but it can be a confusing gotcha .
Now we just have to write the templates .
First , create the template directories in the comfy_django_example / couch_docs / folder .
cd comfy_django_example/couch_docs / mkdir templates mkdir templates / couch_docs cd templates / couch_docs /
And then create the index.html template .
< html > < head > < title > Comfy Django </ title > </head > < body > < h1 > CouchDB in Django </ h1 > < form method= " post " action= " . " > < table > < tr> < td >
Title for new document < /td > < td > < input type= " text " name= " title " ></td > < td >< input type= " submit " ></td> </tr> </table > </ form > < hr > < ol > { % for row in rows %} < li > < a id= " title " href= " / doc / {{ row }} / " > {{ row }} </a></li > { % endfor %} </ ol > </ body > </html >
And the detail . html template as well .
< html > < head > < title > CouchDB in Django : {{ row. title }} </ title > </head > < body > < h1 > CouchDB in Django : {{ row. title }} </h1 > < a href= " / " > Return to index </ a > < table > < tr > < td> Title < /td > < td id= " title " > {{ row.
title }} </td > </tr > < tr> < td> Text < /td > < td id= " text " > {{ row.text }} </td > </tr > </ table > < hr > < form method= " post " action= " . " > < table > < tr> < td >
Title for new document < /td > < td > < input type= " text " name= " title " value= " {{ row .
title }} " ></td> </tr> < tr> < td> Text </td > < td >< textarea name= " text " > {{ row.text }} </ textarea></td > < tr > < td >< input type= " submit " ></td> </tr> </table > </ form > </ body > </html >
And that sums up our new web app .
Go ahead and give it a whirl .
couchdb & cd comfy_django_example python manage .py runserver
And then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see it in action .
Its simple , but it should be enough to get your creative juices flowing a bit about what you could do by combining Django and CouchDB .
Especially as CouchDB continues to mature , I think this 'll be a potent pairing .
Downloading a Copy of Tutorial
You can download the zip file containing this project here , but for the most up - to - date version it 'll be easiest to check the tutorial 's repository on GitHub .
Why Would We Ever Actually Do This ?
So , thats an important question .
Is there a situation where using Django with CouchDB makes substantially more sense than using it with PostgreSQL or MySQL ?
Are we actually gaining something useful while we forsake the Django Admin ( and the sessions framework , etc ) ?
There are a number of reasons why CouchDB is legitimately worth considering despite the inconveniences .
Consider a wiki that allowed users to download a copy of its contents and modify them .
If it was implemented with CouchDB , the users could then upload their contents and merge them into the database .
The implementer would n't need to write custom code for this , its part of CouchDB 's feature set .
If some of the new data was bad , you could then use the versioning system to rollback to a previous revision ( unless it had already gotten deleted by compacting the database ... ahem ) .
Also , consider something like FreeBase which creates schema seemingly on the fly for different types of data .
It would be extremely unpleasant to do that in a relational database , because you'd be constantly creating and modifying schema .
But in CouchDB , if you wanted to add another field for a piece of data , then you 'd just add the data , and it would just work .
Having flexible ( or , really , non-existant ) schema makes it easy to implement some kinds of applications that would require a few drops of the genius elixer to solve with rigidly defined schema3 .
Finally , there is the recurring thread from Damien Katz that -- once they start optimizing -- Couch DB may become impressively fast .
Can We Have Our Cake and Eat it Too ?
Yes .
Yes , you can .
You could use an SQLite or PostgreSQL database to manage your sessions and users , and only use CouchDB to store the document data .
In that way , you 'd get to use the Django Admin for much of your data , and could still take advantage of CouchDB 's document - based storage for the applicable pieces of your application .
The additional complexity from doing so would n't be terribly high , at least for the initial programmer .
However , scaling such an application would require more thought and effort than scaling an application with only relational databases or that only used CouchDB .
It would also be more difficult to efficiently deploy such a service with limited resources ( like on a small VPS ) .
These technical hurdles would n't be insurmountable , but probably would n't be a lot of fun to deal with either .
Wait ,
That is n't the Cake I Wanted To Eat
Oh .
So you want to implement the sessions frameworks on top of CouchDB ?
You could certainly custom roll an authentication framework using CouchDB , and it is probably possible -- although likely requiring a superhuman effort to the extent of translating SQL statements into commands for CouchDB - - to create a Django backend that seamlessly used CouchDB instead of a traditional relational database .
If anyone does want to undertake that project , they should probably wait until CouchDB reaches 1.0 and the API stabilizies .
But ... even then I imagine the project would be something of a hellish quagmire that would make children out of men and break spirits faster than being asked to implement Perl regular expressions with a pushdown autonoma .
Ending The Loose Coupling in Django Series
As this article winds to a close , so does the series encompassing it which looked at Jinja2 , SQLAlchemy and now CouchDB and how Django 's philosophy of loose coupling allowed them to easily integrate with Django .
For me , one of the enduring thoughts after writing these entries is that the loose coupling certainly is n't perfect , but it 'll let you do whatever you want if you 're willing to pay the toll in time .
And , for my time , the prices at the toll ain't half bad .
C&Ler Jim sent this response to Kudlow after he blamed " Liberal guilt consciences " for the mortgage meltdown .
Cudlow , Cudlow , Cudlow [ sic ] ... you are not stupid .
You are , however , a conservative , republican hack .
You know good and g*damn well that this crisis was precipitated by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 , pounded through by Senator Phil Gramm , that was tucked into an omnibus spending bill at the end of Clinton 's last term that included , amongst other things , a treasury authorization and Medicare / Medicaid bill that could not be vetoed .
This
Act excluded any swap transaction from the reach of the CEA and also amended the Securities Act to exclude swap agreements as being defined as securities .
Therefore , these instruments were left unregulated .
Hence , we are now reaping the whirlwind .
You have put yourself on record as blaming liberal guilt and poor people for this crisis .
This is not just intellectually dishonest , it is a factual lie .
As a member of the f*&king intellectual elite ( I have a law degree , a guitar , and a car ) I challenge YOU to bring McCain and Palin on your show and have them explain their version of these events .
I bet you wo n't ...
Love , Jim .
P.S. I might also add that the notion that the sub - prime crisis was caused by liberals wanting to put poor , first - time buyers into homes is disproved by the fact that most of these loans ( over 60 % ) were not first time home buyers , but refinances .
This is because investment firms and banks were selling the idea that people should treat their primary residence as an investment like a stock : borrow on the equity ( leverage ) like any other asset and bet on the value to rise .
This is contrary to traditional conservative thought that the homestead is not to be put at risk .
But you guys never thought about that because you were too single - mindedly interested in the up - side .
It never occurred to you that the downside was families without homes .
Therefore you put unsophisticated folks with children in the same boat with Ivy league 20 something geniuses who walked away with millions , while the families walked away with a trailer .
It truly is sickening .
Once again , Love , Jim
VENTURA , Calif . —
Ventura police say they ’re looking for a couple who tried to steal a shopping cart full of goods and then abandoned their 4 - year - old daughter while fleeing .
Lt. Mark Stadler says authorities on Thursday were still seeking 24 - year - old Gerardo Rodriguez and 22 - year - old Yanira Camargo of Fillmore , five days after they disappeared .
Police say the pair were trying to leave a Kohl ’s store Sunday with a cart full of unpaid merchandise when a guard confronted them .
The couple allegedly ran to their car and fled , leaving their daughter in the shopping cart .
She ’s been placed with a relative and warrants have been issued for the couple ’s arrest .
Dallas Billionaire , McCain bundler , is anti-Obama group 's backer
The spokesman for the American Issues Project , the independent group whose ad is the most negative of the cycle and links Obama to terrorism , says the group just filed a report naming its sole donor .
The donor , spokesman Christian Pinkston said , is Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons , who made his first fortune in chain pharmacies and is now listed as the 73rd richest person in the world , with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $ 2.1 billion .
Simmons , a major Republican donor , gave maximum $ 2,300 contributions to Senator John McCain last year , as well as to former Governor Mitt Romney and to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
He 's listed as a bundler for the McCain campaign on McCain 's website , which says he 's raised between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 for the Republican candidate .
He 's also contributed to Rep.
Chet Edwards , the Texas Democrat who has been mentioned as a possible Obama running mate .
Simmons was reportedly a major donor to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004 .
He 's also a backer of a controversial plan to store nuclear waste in West Texas , which his waste management company would administer .
Most public companies provide forecasts of revenue and earnings in the upcoming quarters .
These forecasts ( sometimes called " guidance " ) form the basis of the work most stock analysts do to make buy and sell recommendations .
Much to the consternation of these analysts , Google is among the few companies that have refused to follow this practice .
As a result , estimates of Google 's revenue by analysts using publicly available data , like comScore numbers , have often been spectacularly wrong .
Today 's earnings call may be no different .
A Google executive once explained to me why Google does n't provide forecasts .
To understand it , you have think about the engineers at Google who work on optimizing AdWords .
How do they know they 're doing a good job ?
We know that Google is constantly bucket - testing tweaks to their AdWords algorithms .
An ad optimization project is considered successful if it has one of two results :
Increase revenue per search ( RPS ) , while not using additional ad real estate on the search results page ( SERP ) .
Reduce the ad real estate on each SERP , while not reducing RPS .
The tricky cases are the ones that increase RPS , while also using more ad real estate .
It then becomes a judgment call on whether they should be rolled out across the site .
If Google were to make earnings forecasts , the thinking went , there would be huge temptation to roll out tweaks in the gray area to make the numbers .
As the quarters roll by , the area of the page devotes to ads would keep steadily increasing , leading to longer term problems with customer retention .
Of course , this does n't mean there is no earnings pressure .
In reality , whether they issue guidance or not , Google 's stock price does depend on whether they continue to deliver robust revenue and earnings growth .
So implicitly , there is always pressure to beat the estimates .
And for the first time , as Google 's stock has taken a hammering in recent months , I 've heard about hiring slowdowns at Google .
So there is definitely pressure to cut costs as well .
It will be interesting to observe the battle between idealism and expediency play itself out , with its progress reflected in the ad real estate on Google 's search results .
It 's easy to be idealistic with the wind behind your back ; the true test is whether you retain the idealism in the face of headwinds .
Time will tell .
This brings us to today 's earnings call .
In my experience , the best predictor of Google earnings has been Efficient Frontier 's excellent Search Engine Performance Report .
EF is the largest ad agency for SEM advertisers , and manages the campaigns of several large advertisers on Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft .
As I had noted earlier , in Q1 an estimate based on their report handily beat other forecasts , most of which use ComScore data .
( Disclosure : My fund Cambrian Ventures is an investor in EF . )
EF 's report for Q2 , released this morning , indicates a strong quarter for Google .
Google gained more than its fair share of advertising dollars in Q2 2008 .
For every new dollar spent on search advertising , $ 1.10 was spent on Google , at the expense of Yahoo and Microsoft .
In addition , Google 's average cost - per- click ( CPC ) increased by 13.8 % in Q2 2008 versus Q2 2007 , while click volume and CTR increased as well .
And , there was strong growth overseas as well , which should help earnings given the weak dollar .
I do n't have the time right now to do the math and figure out whether the robust performance was sufficient to beat the Street 's estimates .
You should read the report for yourself and make that call .
Update : Google 's results , although robust , were below expectations .
The biggest moment in the earnings call for me was this quote from Sergey ( via Silicon Alley Insider ) :
Exclusive to STR
August 15 , 2008
This is a wonderful book ' packed with personality and a surprising amount of helpful supplementary material .
For example , in her introductory essay to Notes on Democracy : A New Edition , Marion Elizabeth Rodgers ( author of Mencken : The American Iconoclast ) describes the effect of Henry Louis Mencken ( 1880 - 1956 ) on first - time readers :
' [ Mencken is ] . . . still castigated as un-American , ' anti - democractic , ' even ' a near anarchist . '
His independent and realistic thought is sternly censured ; in more liberated circles , it is simply regarded with unease .
When every phrase must be examined for political correctness , many find it impossible to enjoy Mencken without apology . '
For first - time readers , yes , Mencken is pugnacious .
Yes , he adopted indefensible positions for their shock value , but he knew in his bones that thick heads need a good hard whack to break up the cobwebs .
And when it came to words versus action , he followed the good advice that was once given to children : ' sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me . '
Today , our culture of hypocrisy and false - civility has completely reversed that bit of wisdom .
On one hand , we enforce politically correct speech to avoid hurt feelings .
On the other , we institutionalize the genuine victimization of our fellow citizens through idiotic laws , prohibitions , and progressive taxation .
Even worse , we celebrate as heroism the slaughter of impoverished civilians in far - away locations by our military establishment ' no matter how implausible the ' threats ' they pose .
As an antidote for our perverse zeitgeist , there is no better medicine than this readable and entertaining book by one of the most influential writers of the 20th century .
As Mencken explores the democratic man , the democratic state , and the conflict of democracy and liberty , he laughs and pokes fun at fundamentalists , teetotalers , law enforcement zealots , judges , victimless crime laws , presidents , public schools , our history of warmongering , and the drooling stupidity that seems to run through our society like a bubbling sewer with lots of inconvenient clogs .
To make this particular edition even more valuable to readers , Ms. Rodgers ' introduction explores Mencken 's most fascinating traits and some of the accusations made against him 'placing him in an appropriate historical context .
She also provides 45 pages of annotations to supplement the text .
These bring to life ( and save us the trouble of looking up ) the people , places , and ideas cited by Mencken throughout the book .
Then , in a succinctly written afterword , Pulitzer - prize - winner Anthony Lewis brings us up to date .
He explains the vital relevance of Mencken 's thinking to 21st century America , which already has been twisted beyond recognition by a Janus - headed cadre of lying and spineless politicians ( take your pick from either party ) and their easily deceived mob of witch - burners born in the wrong century .
Part 1 : The Democratic Man
Mencken begins by taking the high road :
He refuses to blame the Greeks for cooking up the concept of ' democratic man . '
Instead , he blames the idealized vision of the noble savage on Jean - Jacques Rousseau .
Then Mencken playfully digs through the mountain of evidence that contradicts Rousseau 's rosy assumptions ' and he uses the appropriate tool , a steam - shovel .
He immediately dispels the notion that democratic man is on a quest for his higher self .
What he really wants is ' something concrete and highly materialistic ' more to eat , less work , higher wages , lower taxes . '
But what 's so bad about that ?
The problem , says Mencken , is that ' the inferior four - fifths of mankind ' reduces everything to his own private advantage .
This , he explains , is based on the inevitable inequality that prevails among men : ' The mob , being composed , in the overwhelming main , of men and women who have not got beyond the ideas and emotions of childhood , hovers , in mental age , around the time of puberty , and chiefly below it . '
With a bit more sympathy , he puts it this way :
' One thus sees the world as a vast field of greased poles , flying gaudy and seductive flags .
Up each a human soul goes shinning , painfully and with many a slip .
Some climb eventually to the high levels ; a few scale the dizziest heights .
But the great majority never get very far from the ground .
There they struggle for a while , and then give it up .
The effort is too much for them ; it does n't seem to be worth its agonies .
Golf is easier ; so is joining Rotary ; so is Fundamentalism ; so is osteopathy ; so is Americanism . '
But how does this transform itself into democratic man ?
With the help of fear and stupidity : ' Man comes into the world weak and naked , and almost as devoid of intelligence as an oyster , but he brings with him a highly complex and sensitive susceptibility to fear . '
Most of us are incapable of getting rid of our childish fears , and being unable to reason , we fall prey to those who are expert in manipulating our fears '' the demagogues , i.e. , the professors of mob psychology , who flourish in democratic states . '
According to Mencken , '. . . man on the lower levels , though he quickly reaches the limit of his capacity for taking in actual knowledge , remains capable for a long time thereafter of absorbing delusions .
What is true daunts him , but what is not true finds lodgment in his cranium with so little resistance that there is only a trifling emission of heat . '
Consequently :
' Politics under democracy consists almost wholly of the discovery , chase and scotching of bugaboos .
The statesman becomes , in the last analysis , a mere witch - hunter , a glorified smeller and snooper , eternally chanting ' Fe , Fi , Fo , Fum ! '
It has been so in the United States since the earliest days .
The whole history of the country has been a history of melodramatic pursuits of horrendous monsters , most of them imaginary : the red-coats , the Hessians , the monocrats , again the red-coats , the Bank , the Catholics , Simon Legree , the Slave Power , Jeff Davis , Mormonism , Wall Street , the rum demon . . . the hell hounds of plutocracy , the trusts . . .
Pancho Villa , German spies , hyphenates , the Kaiser , Bolshevism . '
Today we might update the list with Korea , Vietnam , foreign oil , Islam , Wal - Mart , inequality , tobacco , Iraq , illicit drugs , Afghanistan , Russia , immigrants , firearms , imported cars , gay people , Iran , Holocaust - deniers , Starbucks coffee , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , and anti-war protesters .
If you nodded your head at any of these , ask yourself why .
As an example of the bugaboo theory of demagoguery in action , Mencken demonstrates how President Wilson 'a favorite target 'was able to whip Americans into a fear - based frenzy by demonizing Germany :
' The whole power of the government was concentrated upon throwing the plain people into a panic .
All sense was heaved overboard , and there ensued a chase of bugaboos on a truly epic scale .
Nothing like it had ever been seen in the world before , for no democratic state as populous as the United States had ever gone to war before .
I pass over the details , and pause only to recall the fact that the American people , by the end of 1917 , were in such a terror that they lived in what was substantially a state of siege , though the foe was 3000 miles away and obviously unable to do them any damage . '
Does this remind anyone of President Bush and 9 - 11 ?
But how is it that demagogues find such fertile fields on the continent of the democratic man ?
In a word , envy .
Underneath his pretensions of superiority , in democratic man ' there lies an uncomfortable realization of actual inferiority . '
More explicitly :
' The sea - sick passenger on the ocean liner detests the ' good sailor ' who stalks past him a hundred times a day , obscenely smoking large , greasy , gold - banded cigars .
In precisely the same way democratic man hates the fellow who is having a better time of it in this world .
Such , indeed , is the origin of democracy .
And such is the origin of its twin , Puritanism . '
Today 's Puritans carry the torch of their philosophical ancestors by persecuting deviancy wherever they find it : the Puritans of the left abhor the fat wallets of the economically successful , and on the right , they spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about the pudenda of the sexually adventurous .
By alternating the use of fear and envy , says Mencken , politicians can stampede their followers into just about anything .
The democratic man '. . . oscillates eternally between scoundrels , or if you would take them at their own valuation , heroes .
Politics becomes the trade of playing upon its natural poltroonery 'of scaring it half to death , and then proposing to save it . '
Mencken quotes Sir Francis Galton to explain that the pervasive mixture of fear , envy , and stupidity results in fear of liberty : ' The vast majority of persons of our race have a natural tendency to shrink from the responsibility of standing and acting alone . '
He adds : ' The heritage of freedom belongs to a small minority of men , descended whether legitimately or by adultery , from the old lords of the soil or from the patricians of the free towns . '
In contrast the democratic man seeks only one thing : security .
That is why instead of seeking genuine justice ( justice for the individual based on his own actions ) , he seeks out social justice ( a pre-determined result applied for politically organized groups ) .
Says Mencken , ' Justice , in fact , is always unpopular and in difficulties under democracy , save perhaps that false form of so - called social justice which is designed solely to get the laborer more than his fair hire . '
Mencken 's theory about the roles played by fear , stupidity , and envy goes a long way toward explaining why we are presented ' in each election cycle ' with a choice between two fraudsters : '[ the democratic man ] can imagine and even esteem , in his way , certain false forms of liberty ' for example , the right to choose between two political mountebanks , and to yell for the more obviously dishonest ' but the reality is incomprehensible to him . '
Part 2 : The Democratic State
Mencken provides a definition of the democratic state that not only describes it but also hints at its internal mechanism .
Furthermore , he does not protest that the United States is supposed to be a constitutional republic :
' Whether it be called a constitutional monarchy , as in England , or a representative republic , as in France , or a pure democracy , as in some of the cantons of Switzerland , it is always essentially the same .
There is , first , the mob , theoretically and in fact the ultimate judge of all ideas and the source of all power .
There is , second , the camorra of self - seeking minorities , each seeking to inflame , delude and victimize it .
The political process thus becomes a mere battle of rival rogues .
But the mob remains quite free to decide between them . '
He denies that checks and balances have had any salutary effect .
Why ?
Because politicians play upon the envy , stupidity , and fears of the electorate : ' [ The politician ] is willing to embrace any issue , however idiotic , that will get him votes , and he is willing to sacrifice any principle , however sound , that will lose them for him . '
Mavericks ?
They are rarely elected and quickly disappear .
If they are dubbed with that title in an admiring way by journalists , you are being taken to the cleaners ' and Obama and McCain are no exception .
Read onward as Mencken 's delightful microscope tears into the presidencies of Abraham Lincoln , Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , and Franklin Roosevelt with relish 'exposing them and their adoring constituencies for what they are .
If Machiavelli took off our blinders and exposed the rancid underbelly of tyrants in The Prince , Mencken did the same for democracy in this gem of a book .
As Mencken says plainly , ' We are dependent for whatever good flows out of democracy upon men who do not believe in democracy . '
Part 3 : Democracy and Liberty
Mencken 's discussion of Prohibition and the 18th Amendment teaches a lesson that applies directly to our bizarre obsession over what people ingest in the privacy of their own homes .
I refer to the War on Drugs and those who profit mightily from it 'not only the criminal gangs that are its inevitable result , but the judges , police departments , DEA , FBI , and the vast and vicious prison industry .
Here Mencken describes their tactics :
The Prohibitionist leaders , being mainly men of wide experience in playing upon the prejudices and emotions of the mob , developed a technique of terrorization that was almost irresistible .
The moment a politician ventured to speak against them he was accused of the grossest baseness .
It was whispered that he was a secret drunkard and eager to safeguard his tipple ; it was covertly hinted that he was in the pay of the Whiskey Ring , the Beer Trust , or some other such bugaboo . . . .
The point is that such accusations are generally believed , especially when they are leveled at a candidate for office .
The average American knows what he would do in like case , and he believes quite naturally that every other man is willing and eager to do the same . '
If we ask why the democratic man supports bankrupt notions such as Prohibition , the War on Drugs , and a host of victimless crime laws and economic legislation , we must remember the unholy trinity of envy , stupidity , and fear :
' Democracy , as a political scheme , may be defined as a device for releasing this hatred born of envy , and for giving it the force and dignity of law . . . .
The Puritan 's actual motives are ( a ) to punish the other fellow for having a better time in the world , and ( b ) to bring the other fellow down to his own unhappy level . . . .
The whole criminal law in America thus acquires a flavour of fraud . . . .
It is executed by officers whose private prosperity runs in direct ratio to their reckless ferocity .
And the business is applauded by morons whose chief delight lies in seeing their betters manhandled and humiliated . . . .
There is always a district attorney at hand to launch the prosecution , for district attorneys are invariably men who aspire to higher office , and no more facile way to it is to be found than by assaulting and destroying a man above the general [ level ] . '
Does this remind anyone of the raid on the bong business of comedian Tommy Chong ?
What about financier Michael Milken in the 1980s ?
The same instinct applies to both .
And let 's not forget about Martha Stewart , surrounded like Joan of Arc by a barnyard pen of FBI agents , prosecutors , and judges ( known to be hybrids of lawyers and politicians ) .
One must always remember Mencken 's assessment of the democratic man : '. . . he is not actually happy when free ; he is uncomfortable , a bit alarmed , and intolerably lonely .
He longs for the warm , reassuring smell of the herd , and is willing to take the herdsman with it . '
According to Mencken , that is why the most harmful legislation often runs through the gauntlet of Congress so quickly : ' Haste is necessary , lest even the mob be shaken by sober second thought . '
Can anyone spell USA PATRIOT Act ?
This gift of Congress was passed before it was read .
By mistake , someone even forgot to remove the thinly veiled humor .
After all , when spelled out , the acronym actually reads as follows : Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act .
Yes , there is a god ; George Orwell walks among us .
Part 4 : Coda'or Mencken 's Final Barb
In the last section of his book , Mencken leaves us with some final thoughts on democracy : ' It came into the world as a cure - all , and it remains primarily a cure - all to this day .
Any boil upon the body politic , however vast and ranging , may be relieved by taking a vote ; any flux of blood may be stopped by passing a law .
The aim of government is to repeal the laws of nature . . . .
War becomes simply a device to end war .
The state . . . takes on a transcendental potency . . . .
Democracy becomes a substitute for the old religion . . . not vulnerable to logical attack .'
Oh , my .
What 's a mother to do ?
We are saddled with a faith - based religion called democracy .
Along with Mencken , we can proclaim , ' I have never encountered any actual evidence , convincing to an ordinary jury , that vox populi is actually vox Dei .
The proofs , indeed , run the other way . '
So what is Mencken 's advice ?
In short , enjoy it :
'. . . the true charm of democracy is not for the democrat but for the spectator . . . .
Try to imagine anything more heroically absurd ! . . . .
It is based upon propositions that are palpably not true ' and what is not true , as everyone knows , is always immensely more fascinating and satisfying to the vast majority of men than what is true . . . .
I enjoy democracy immensely .
It is incomparably idiotic , and hence incomparably amusing .
Does it exalt dunderheads , cowards , trimmers , frauds , cads ?
Then the pain of seeing them go up is balanced and obliterated by the joy of seeing them come down . '
Citing the preceding text , many readers consider Mencken to be the quintessential cynic .
I disagree .
Look behind the words .
Mencken was a supreme idealist , and Notes on Democracy is an expression of his bottomless disappointment in the American public and its mode of government .
Behind his unbridled amusement and boozy laughter lies a man deeply wounded by the nonsense that surrounds him , and Notes on Democracy is his attempt to reach an accommodation with it while remaining a sane ' and living ' human being .
This particular edition places his remedy directly in our hands .

Notes on Democracy : A New Edition , 208 pages .
By H. L. Mencken ( introduction and annotations by Marion Elizabeth Rodgers ; afterword by Anthony Lewis )

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Treasurys gained Wednesday , pushing yields on the shortest - term securities to the lowest in decades , after the Commerce Department said housing starts declined more than expected , indicating a continuation of the housing recession that is weighing on a growing number of financial institutions .
U.S. debt also rallied as a resurgence of fear in other debt markets and equities led to safe - haven Treasury buying .
Two - year notes yields fell TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.128 % 18 basis points , or 0.18 % , to 1.63 % .
Rates on three - month bills , among the most popular assets for investors seeking higher quality , plunged to 0.06 % , the lowest on record .
Housing starts fell 6.2 % to a seasonally adjusted rate of 895,000 in August , the lowest in 17 years .
That is also below the 955,000 forecast by economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
Building permits , another sign of future construction , also dropped .
See full story .
" The key here is that starts and permits are exhibiting another leg down , which will keep dragging on residential investment " and economic growth , said T.J. Marta , fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
Treasurys initially were lower after the Federal Reserve bailed out American International Group AIG , - 1.23 % to avert a potential bankruptcy of the insurance giant .
See full story .
The Fed 's offer of an $ 85 billion loan to AIG revived concerns among bond investors that the government will have to issue more debt , decreasing the value of their current holdings .
" Initially , the bailouts and financing seem like a good thing for the system -- they buy time , soothe panic , " said RBS Greenwich Capital strategists .
" But it will put a lot of paper into the market at distressed levels that surely impact the pricing of more solid institutions ' holdings . "
Already , the Treasury Department auctioned $ 40 billion in 35 - day cash management bills at a rate of 0.30 % to deposit at the Fed to finance its liquidity operations .
See full story .
Benchmark 10 - year note yields fell TMUBMUSD10Y , 0.646 % 6 basis points to 3.39 % .
Prices move in the opposite direction of yields .
Yields on 30 - year bonds , the longest security the U.S. issues , dropped TMUBMUSD30Y , 1.417 % to a record - low of 4.07 % .
Corporate borrowing costs increased as investors fled riskier assets .
The gap between two - year treasury yields and the two - year swap rate , a fixed - rate payment made to receive a floating rate , jumped to 129.5 basis points today from 94.5 basis points on Friday afternoon , according to UBS .
Fed futures
Treasurys ended lower Tuesday after the central bank disappointed markets and kept its target interest rate at 2 % .
Traders see a 64 % probability that the Fed will lower rates at least a quarter percentage point at its next meeting on Oct. 29 , according to the November fed funds futures contract .
Traders also expect a second quarter - point cut at policy makers '
December meeting .
Fund managers outlook
The number of fund managers taking the view that the global economy is in recession rose sharply in September .
The number of fund managers that believe the global economy is in recession rose to 44 % in September , according to a monthly survey by Merrill Lynch .
That level of gloom is up from 24 % in August .
The survey of 186 mangers who oversee a total of $ 641 billion took place after the Treasury Department seized mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % .
Investors went overweight bonds for the first time in the survey 's history , with 4 % of managers taking this view , compared to a net 14 % underweight position last month , Merrill said .

基本的には データ型 , データ（整数 やfloat 、double）、または データ型 , 長さ , データ , データ , データ , … （Raw 、Array 、Map）という形でシリアライズします。エンディアンはネットワークバイトオーダー（Big endian）です*2。 データ型には以下の種類があります 2進数 16進数 Positive FixNum 0xxxxxxx 0x00 - 0x7 f Negative FixNum 111xxxxx 0xe0 - 0xff Variable 110xxxxx 0xc0 - 0xdf nil 11000000 0xc0 ( string ? ) 11000001 0xc1 false 11000010 0xc2 true 11000011 0xc3 11000100 0xc4 11000101 0xc5 11000110 0xc6 11000111 0xc7 11001000 0xc8 11001001 0xc9 float 11001010 0xca double 11001011 0xcb uint 8 11001100 0xcc uint 16 11001101 0xcd uint 32 11001110 0xce uint 64 11001111 0xcf int 8 11010000 0xd0 int 16 11010001 0xd1 int 32 11010010 0xd2 int 64 11010011 0xd3 11010100 0xd4 11010101 0xd5 ( big float 16 ? ) 11010110 0xd6 ( big float 32 ? ) 11010111 0xd7 ( big integer 16 ? ) 11011000 0xd8 ( big integer 32 ? ) 11011001 0xd9 raw 16 11011010 0xda raw 32 11011011 0xdb array 16 11011100 0xdc array 32 11011101 0xdd map 16 11011110 0xde map 32 11011111 0xdf FixRaw 101xxxxx 0xa0 - 0xbf FixArray 1001xxxx 0x90 - 0x9 f FixMap 1000 xxxx 0x80 - 0x8 f Positive FixNum , Negative FixNum -31〜127の整数は１バイトに格納でき、データサイズを小さくすることができます。
フォーマットとしては、数値がそのままデータ型になるところがポイントです。たとえば
125（2進数で01111101）は、そのまま
01111101 になります。同様に -31（2進数で11100001 ） も、そのまま 11100001 になります。
nil , false , true nil , false , true は１ バイトに格納します。nilは 0xc0 、 falseは 0xc2 、trueは 0xc3 です。
float , double IEEE 754形 式の浮動小数点を格納します 。
floatはデータ型+2バイトで 0xca 0xXX 0xXX 、doubleはデータ型+4バイトで 0xcb 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xXX となります。
uintX , intX 整数は8ビット、16ビット、32ビット、64ビットの4つのサイズがあり、それぞれに符号付きと符号無しがあります。
FixNum、uintX、intXは、数値を入れられる最小のデータ型を選べばデータサイズを小さくすることができますが、シリアライズ速度を重視して大きなデータ型に入れてしまうこともできます。 フォーマットとしては、float、double、uintX、intXは、（1<
raw 16 , raw 32 raw 16 はデータ型（0xde）に続いて２バイトの整数が続き、その整数の長さ分だけバイト列が続きます。raw
32はデータの長さを表す整数が4バイトになります。
array 16 , array 32 array 16はデータ型（0xdc）に続いて2バイトの整数が続き、その整数の長さ分だけ他のオブジェクトが続きます。array
32はデータの長さを表す整数が4バイトになります。
たとえば 0xdc 0x00 0x01 0x03 は、データ型がarray
16、長さが1で、要素は整数の3（FixNum） です。
arrayの中にarrayを入れたり、arrayの中にmapを入れたりすることができます。
map 16 , map 32 mapは連想配列です。map
16はデータ型（0xde）に続いて２バイトの整数が続き、その整数×２個分だけ他のオブジェクトが続きます。オブジェクトは key , value , key , value , ... の順で並び、偶数番目がkey で、そのkey の次のオブジェクトがvalueです。 フォーマットとしては、raw X、array X、map Xは、（2 <
FixRaw , FixArray , FixMap 長さが0〜31のバイト列は、raw 16/32を使う代わりに、長さを表す整数をデータ型の部分に埋め込むことができます。
同じように長さが0〜15の配列や連想配列は、array
16/32やmap 16/32を使う代わりに、長さを表す整数をデータ型の部分に埋め込むことができます。
たとえば 0 x a2 ' a ' ' b ' は長 さ2のバイト列で、中身は ' a ' ' b ' です。
Stream parsing MessagePackの特徴の１つに、流れてくるデータを順次ストリーム処理していける点があります。
ネットワークプログラミングにありがちな処理で、最初にデータのサイズを受け取り、続いてそのデータのサイズ分だけバイト列を受け取る、という処理があります。CやC++で、あるいはselect(2)やpoll(2)を使ったプログラミングモデルでこのような処理を実装するのは少々面倒なわけですが、MessagePackでデータをシリアライズしておけば、メッセージとメッセージの切れ目を知ることができます。面倒な処理を書くことなく、MessagePoackのデシリアライザにデータを投げ込んでいくだけで、メッセージを１つずつ取り出すことができます。
Rubyでは↓こんな感じでサーバープログラムが書けます。 require ' msgpack ' class Server def initialize ( sock ) @sock = sock @mupk = MessagePack :: Unpacker .new @buffer = '' @nread = 0 end def receive_data ( data ) @buffer << data while true @nread = @mupk .execute ( @buffer , @nread ) if @mupk . finished ?
msg = @mupk .data log " message reached : # { msg.inspect } " @mupk .reset @buffer .slice !(
0 , @nread ) @nread = 0 next unless @buffer .empty ?
end break end rescue log " error while deserializing buffer ( #{ $ ! } ) " end def run while true begin data = @sock .sysread ( 1024 ) rescue log " connection closed ( #{ $! } ) " return end receive_data ( data ) end end def log ( msg ) puts " Server : # { msg } " end end rpipe , wpipe = IO . pipe thread = Thread .new ( Server .new ( rpipe ) ) {| srv | srv.run } wpipe.write [ " put " , " apple " , " red " ].to_msgpack wpipe.write [ " put " , " lemon " , " yellow " ].to_msgpack wpipe.write [ " get " , " apple " ].to_msgpack wpipe.close thread.join このプログラムを少し改造して、RPCを実装するのもそれほど難しくないハズです。「オブジェクトを取り出す」のところでメソッドを呼び出したり、返り値を返すようにすればOK。 JSON -RPCの実装を参考にしつつ、デシリアライザの部分をMessagePackに変えれば、非同期なRPCも比較的簡単に実装できるはず。

Overshadowed by the John Edwards endorsement is the fact that Barack Obama spent the day campaigning in Michigan and talking about jobs .
“ Now , when John McCain came to Michigan in January and said that we could n’t bring all these jobs back to America , he was right .
But where he ’s wrong is in suggesting that there ’s nothing we can do to replace those jobs or create new ones .
Where he ’s wrong is in not offering new solutions or economic policies that are different from what George Bush has given us for eight long years .
That ’s wrong .
That ’s giving up .
And that ’s not what this country is about , ” Obama said .
Obama talked about creating jobs for , and keeping jobs in , Michigan , “ I wo n’t stand here and tell you that we ’ll be able to stop every job from going overseas or bring every job back .
But I will tell you that we can end the Bush - McCain policy of giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas , and we can start giving those tax breaks to companies that create good - paying jobs right here in America .
Instead of opposing job training similar to what ’s being offered at M - Tech , like John McCain has , we can make sure every American has the skills to compete in the global economy .
We do n’t have to stand idly by while foreign competitors outpace us in making the cars of the future .
I ’m running for President to make sure that the cars of the future are made where they ’ve always been made – right here in Michigan .
Because the fight for American manufacturing is the fight for America ’s future – and I believe that ’s a fight this country will win . ”

Barack Obama came to Ohio and Pennsylvania and spoke about hope and a new economy , but he never seemed to understand the language of jobs .
He lost both states because he could n’t connect with the voters on their most important issue .
He went to Indiana and sharpened his message about the economy and jobs .
Consequently , he came within an eyelash of winning the Hoosier State .
For voters in what is known as the Rust Belt , jobs are always the number one issue .
In Michigan today , Barack Obama proved once again that he is nothing if not a quick study .
The Edwards endorsement fits right into this emphasis on jobs because nobody outside of Hillary Clinton understands the language of blue collar Democrats better than John Edwards .
I do n’t think Obama is in as much trouble in places like Michigan , Ohio , and Pennsylvania as some pundits believe .
If Obama campaigns hard in these states , and shifts from a message of hope to a message of jobs , he will do just fine .
The evolution and growth of Obama as a candidate has been amazing to watch .
The man rarely makes the same mistake twice .
We all knew that he had the talent to become president , but what we have also found out is that he has the skills to match .

Gnome-o- gram : Financial Derivatives II : Counterparty Risk
Much of the discussion in the legacy media of the bailout of financial institutions caught in the financial derivatives meltdown , such as AIG , about which I wrote yesterday , predictably misses the point of why these bailouts are being done and , as a result , fails to explain just how dire the risk is to the economy as the mountain of junk derivatives is unwound .
The key phrase in understanding this is one which you may not have heard before , but are almost certain to hear many , many times from all sides before this mess is finally sorted out : “ counterparty risk ” .
Our previous discussion of derivatives used exchange - traded wheat futures as an example , but at the heart of the present problem are “ over the counter ” or privately negotiated derivative contracts between two parties .
Consider , for example , an airline who wishes to lock in the price of the Jet A fuel its planes will require in the next year .
Knowing the price it will pay , and being therefore insulated from fluctuations in the price of fuel , allows the airline to budget and pre-sell seats at a known price without having their profit margin depend upon whatever fuel happens to be selling for when the flight actually departs .
There are actually now exchange - traded futures contracts for Jet A , but they are a recent innovation and still thinly traded , so the airline looking to hedge its fuel requirements may prefer to conclude a private forward purchase contract with a financial institution such as AIG .
( An earlier pioneer in such contracts was Enron , which gives you a sense of how rapidly the financial community learns from experience . )
There are two parties to such a contract : the airline and the financial institution .
Each is thus the “ counterparty ” to the other .
To the airline , the financial institution is its counterparty and vice versa .
The financial institution does not , of course , manufacture or sell jet fuel , so in assuming the risk of a rise in price of that commodity , it will usually balance its exposure on the contract with its own hedge , for example by concluding a forward sale contract of about the same quantity and delivery date with a refiner of Jet A or ( since it 's unlikely a precisely balancing contract can be made ) by buying crude oil futures based upon a model of the relationship between the price of crude and that of jet fuel worked out by all of the erstwhile string theorists in the back room who did n't get tenure at the university .
The cost of putting on the countervailing hedge is priced into the premium the airline pays for the forward purchase contract .
Unlike exchange - traded derivatives such as futures and options , these private derivatives are bespoke contracts between the two parties — they can be ( and often are ) arbitrarily complicated , incorporating aspects of futures , options , and insurance , and bewilderingly difficult to completely hedge .
They are also exempt from regulatory scrutiny and , unlike exchange - traded contracts , not marked to market until the contract comes to term and the settlement payment between the parties is computed and paid .
This means that there is almost complete opacity about the obligations undertaken by an issuer of derivative contracts , and that their financial situation can deteriorate to the brink of insolvency without any indication of the approaching crisis until a payment comes due and there is n't any money to make it .
Let 's go back to the simple case of the airline with the forward contract for jet fuel .
Suppose the forward was made when fuel was 50 dollars a barrel and when the contract expires a price spike had doubled the price to 100 dollars a barrel .
The airline is counting on the profit from the forward contract to compensate for increased price it will have to pay when purchasing fuel on the open market .
If it has presold seats and budgeted based on the locked - in 50 dollars per barrel fuel price , having that price suddenly double may push it over the edge into bankruptcy , but the forward insulates it from that risk .
But only if the counterparty pays up !
Suppose that , the night before the settlement date on the forward contract , the financial institution goes belly up due to something entirely unrelated to the jet fuel contract : for example , a contract with a major computer manufacturer denominated in the user satisfaction level with Windows Vista .
Now the airline has a contract which covers the increased price it will have to pay for fuel , but the financial institution , the counterparty , is bankrupt and cannot pay .
That 's counterparty risk .
It 's like having all your assets in bearer bonds in your safe deposit box and a meteor hits your bank : you did everything right and now you 're wiped out .
The airline , faced with twice the fuel price and no forward contract profit to cover it , files for bankruptcy , lays off employees , shrinks its fleet , and the economy as a whole takes a hit .
Much of the legacy media coverage of the recent bailouts has followed the usual populist narrative that the bailout is a rescue of the fat - cat shareholders and the miscreant executives who ran the institution into the ground while collecting their unconscionable salaries and bonuses .
Now , I am not here to defend either investors stupid enough to buy a piece of a company with an opaque and unquantifiable exposure to who - knows - what , nor the idiots in the executive suite who assume such risk without thinking “ what if ” .
But they are n't the reason for the bailout !
In fact , in the recent rescues of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and AIG , the investors were essentially wiped out even before the bailout , and the executives are soon to be cleaned out , both from their offices and in the financial sense by shareholder suits and prosecutions .
No , the reason for the bailout is the consequences of default on all of the counterparties of the derivatives they had written .
In the case of a company like AIG , they are all over the economy and all around the world , and even compiling a list of them , no less assessing the consequences of a default , is a major undertaking .
For example , there are bonds whose rating is based on insurance from AIG .
Take away that insurance , and the current value of the bond plummets .
Now who owns those bonds , and what happens when they have to report their holdings at the end of the quarter ?
This is not a made - up example ; if you 've been reading these gnome - o - grams for some time , you 've probably gotten a sense of how sceptical of the financial conventional wisdom and careful I am of the assets I hold , but my portfolio includes one such bond insured by AIG , and had I sold it on Monday , it would have been at about 40 % of face value .
( Got better — come on November ! )
That 's the nature of counterparty risk , and why it poses such a peril to the global financial system .
I 've been expecting FNM FRE , and AIG ( and several more , which I wo n't name here to avoid being accused of precipitating a bank run among my dozens of readers ) to inevitably pack it in for over a year : the fundamentals were obvious , and the only question was when .
So certainly , I would n't go anywhere near securities issued by these politically driven hollowed out accidents waiting to happen .
But gotcha , counterparty risk from AIG that I never knew I had more than halved the value of a bond I owned overnight .
That 's counterparty risk , even though I was n't the direct or a knowing indirect counterparty .
When regulators have to decide whether to bail out a financial institution or let it fail , they are n't thinking of the shareholders or management .
Instead , they 're trying to assess the hit to other enterprises and the economy as a whole of of the counterparty risk if the derivative contracts written by the institution on the brink are defaulted upon .
“ Too big to fail ” is a real phenomenon , but the legacy media often assume “ big ” is measured by assets , employees , or some other irrelevant quantity .
In the age of derivatives , and at the moment they are brutally being marked to market and rendered visible by insolvency of those who wrote them , “ big ” is measured by counterparty risk , and that 's why that if you 've just encountered the term for the first time here , you 're sure to be tired of hearing it everywhere within the next six months .

Elaine Meinel Supkis
The Sphinx just released over $ 600 billion to all the worlds banks !
Indeed ... at the hearings in Congress that I attended at the very end , everyone made some sort of strange mention of ' $ 600 billion stuck in LONDON . '
I noted this down and got very excited .
The Lehman Brothers executive sitting next to me had also mentioned this sum , too !
So I have been watching the news for mention about this and here it is : Bernanke got his $ 600 billion to flood world banks with dollars because dollars are disappearing .
This is the Derivative Beast eating money .
I am certain of this .
Fed Pumps Further $ 630 Billion Into Financial System
( Bloomberg ) --
The Federal Reserve will pump an additional $ 630 billion into the global financial system , flooding banks with cash to alleviate the worst banking crisis since the Great Depression .
The Fed increased its existing currency swaps with foreign central banks by $ 330 billion to $ 620 billion to make more dollars available worldwide .
The Term Auction Facility , the Fed 's emergency loan program , will expand by $ 300 billion to $ 450 billion .
The European Central Bank , the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are among the participating authorities .
The Fed 's expansion of liquidity , the biggest since credit markets seized up last year , comes as Congress prepares to vote on a $ 700 billion bailout for the financial industry .
The crisis is reverberating through the global economy , causing stocks to plunge and forcing European governments to rescue four banks over the past two days alone .
``Today 's blast of term liquidity will settle the funding markets down , and allow trust to slowly be restored between borrowers and lenders , '' said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York .
On the other hand , ``the Fed 's balance sheet is about to explode . ''
I scanned in the notes I made last Friday .
This was the very last page of my notes that day :
Follow the money , they always say !
Well , this $ 600 billion should be followed : it went across the planet .
The tiny window the Fed created as an ' experiment ' which was not supposed to be scary , that tiny window into the Outer Darkness , this small hole into the Cave of Wealth and Death has been expanding rapidly since it first was poked into the cave 's wall .
All the reserves of the Federal Reserve are now gone .
The ONLY way the Fed can flood the world with dollars is to beg all the other banks to give us dollars for us to give them .
Got that ?
HAHAHA .
This is how the Outer Darkness operates !
Up is down and in is out .
Everything is the opposite .
So the Federal Reserves , which is neither federal nor has reserves , is now the conduit for flash flows of money created out of thin air .... by our trade rivals .
I hammer on the issue of trade because money is just another way of saying , ' Trade ' .
This is why these money games the Fed has been frantically playing are called ' Swaps ' .
This is basically a ' bait and switch ' deal which will turn into a ' switch and steal ' operation .
The crazy , out of balance world trade system is being kicked back into action via these fraudulent deals between the rival central banks and our foolish Federal Reserve bankers .
The game here is to not let the US people know that the jig is up .
That we can't run trillion dollar trade or budget deficits !
Indeed , it is not mere irony that this sum we just got via a ' swap ' in London is pretty much exactly the size of our trade deficit .
This is not coincidence .
Or rather , in the Outer Darkness , coincidence is magic and magic is all about having things merge and then in a loud bang , flip into a new system , a new shape , a new reality .
The Derivatives Beast is the darling son of the goddess , Depression who was suckled by her sister goddess , Inflation .
He is eating up all our money .
The actual dollars .
Not merely content with devouring equity values , he is now literally eating dollars .
This is why the dollars have to now pour out of our entire system only to disappear .
This money is needed to sustain global unbalanced trade .
But it vanishes before it can be passed around the planet .
Lord only knows what the Dragon of China is doing with its vast , huge dollar reserves !
This $ 630 billion infusion is one third the size of China 's FOREX dollar reserves .
Recently , I sat down and calculated Europe 's dollar reserves and it was over $ 600 billion by about $ 50 billion .
So I am also assuming this injection was actually Europe letting the Federal Reserve ' borrow ' their dollar reserves !
This is ASTONISHING if it is true .
It is another sign that the whole concept of a floating currency with the US as the reserve currency has now officially collapsed !
Now we will see a free - for - all as our trade rivals spar to see who replaces the US as a reserve currency .
Meanwhile , the Derivatives Beast burps .
Oil , Metals , Crops Drop on Concern U.S. Bailout Plan May Fail
( Bloomberg ) --
Crude oil fell the most in almost seven years , leading commodities including copper and corn lower , on concern the U.S. plan to spend $ 700 billion propping up America 's banks will fail to avert a global economic slowdown .
Oil slumped more than $ 6 , helping send the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index to a 5 percent drop .
The agreement between Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and congressional leaders failed to cut short - term interest rates .
Commodities also dropped after the pound fell the most against the dollar in 15 years and the euro weakened as European banks were bailed out .
``Oil is down because the economy is very fragile , '' said Rick Mueller , director of oil markets at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield , Massachusetts .
`` It 's great that they were able to come to an agreement in Washington but that 's no guarantee that there will be no more bank runs or that the economy will recover anytime soon . ''
In depressions , money vanishes .
The banking gnomes have insured that this will be the case .
Note that we just went through hyperinflation .
My husband said , ' This can of soup last year was 99 ¢ on sale .
Today , there are no sales and it is now over $ 6 a can ! '
This is super - hyper inflation !
How dare the Fed pretend inflation is under 3 % ?
The mythological creatures who control all potential wealth laugh at all this .
They know that they are all forces of nature that are unstoppable once they are launched .
The trajectories of their actions are predictable because they are natural .
With tremendous effort , central bankers can delay the inevitable but if they do this , they make it worse since Time is Money .
Time is money is an important concept .
Why is this ?
Simple : we are MORTALS .
We die !
We have limited time on this lovely planet we call ' earth ' .
We must do our best during the span of our hours to do the right thing .
We have only one chance on this planet .
So we must focus on using this time carefully and well .
The value of this time is of tremendous interest to the denizens of the Cave of Wealth and Death .
Note the last word !
They are death gods .
We all end up visiting them in this garb .
Not as givers of wealth but takers of life .
The glory of being human is , we can see the gods and know their actions , habits and natures .
Because of this , we can enter the Cave of Wealth but if we are smart , we do so as sparingly as possible .
For they take back every bit of this wealth when we die .
Or worse , they get us into situations where we kill each other before stumbling into the Cave of Death sectors .
Lehman's ` 100 % Principal Protection ' Means Pennies for Notes
( Bloomberg ) --
A brochure pitching $ 1.84 million of notes sold by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in August , a month before the firm filed for bankruptcy , promised ``100 percent principal protection . ''
Buyers had ``uncapped appreciation potential '' pegged to gains in the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index , the brochure said .
In the worst case , they would get back their $ 1,000 - per - note investment in three years .
Only the last in a list of 15 risk factors mentioned the biggest danger : `` An investment in the notes will be subject to the credit risk of Lehman Brothers . ''
This was pure fraud .
All fraudsters must , by law , append a fine print note about risk .
Here is the SEC filing for these splendid ' 100 % Principal Protection ' scams :
I must say , it should be drilled into everyone 's head in their youth that there is NO SUCH THING AS A 100 % PRINCIPAL PROTECTION SYSTEM .
Period .
This is because it can be wiped out by the gods .
All they need to do is drop an asteroid on us , just for one example .
Or have the sun go nova .
Or have an ice age begin suddenly .
The possibilities are endless .
When Napoleon began his Grand Armee invasion of Russia , he thought he was very clever .
But way off in Indonesia , Mt. Tamboura decided to blow up !
The weather went from mild and normal to one of the coldest winters on record .
The following year here in New England was called ' The Year Of No Summer ' and many people died of the cold and hunger .
In a matter of days , the weather in Moscow went from warm to bitterest cold !
And Napoleon lost his army and his throne .
Con artists always like to talk about ' a sure thing ! '
I always ask them , ' Why share this with little old me ? '
They then mutter that they need cash !
Well , the only sure thing is , when you hand over cash , there is a good chance , you wo n't see it again .
And like Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers or any of these con artists , they will mutter something about the weather suddenly turning cold or the horse they bet on went lame , etc .
Arrest them .
Conning people is supposed to be illegal .

STARZ EDGE & STARZ CINEMA PRESENT THE WORLD TELEVISION PREMIERE OF UNCOUNTED
Just in Time For the 2008 Presidential Race :
A Searing Indictment of the Election Process
As It Affected Both the 2004 and 2006 Elections ...
And Could Affect the Outcome of the 2008 Election Englewood , Colo. , August 11 , 2008 - Defenders of democracy unite : Starz Edge and Starz Cinema present the world television premiere of Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections , an explosive documentary that shows how election fraud changed the outcome of the 2004 election and led to even greater fraud in 2006 .
With the 2008 presidential race just around the corner , is it too late for a free and fair election ?
The film will premiere on Starz Edge on Monday , August 25 at 10:30 p.m. ( et / pt ) .
Starz Cinema will show Uncounted on Thursday , August 28 at 10:00 p.m.
Uncounted , the controversial film by David Earnhardt , examines in factual , logical and startling terms how easy it is to change election outcomes and undermine election integrity across the United States .
The film shines some much - needed light onto : Jim Crow - like Voter Suppression and Intimidation in the 21st Century
Exit Poll Discrepancies in 2004 and 2006
Undervoting up to 80 % in Precincts
Electronic Voting Machines Altering Final Vote Tallies
Provisional Ballots Not Counted
The Privatization of the Election Process " Our country has a long and varied history of stolen elections , systematic disenfranchisement , and manufactured election irregularities , " said Uncounted filmmaker David Earnhardt , " Yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process .
I hope that watching Uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs - and encourage immediate action before it 's too late . "
In addition to being a searing indictment of the country 's election system and a stunning wakeup call for voters , Uncounted also tells the inspiring stories of three patriotic whistleblowers who recognize the threat to the core of our democracy and do the right thing - regardless of the consequences .
" The notion of stolen elections is something we assign to Third World countries , but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Customers of bars that play loud music drink more quickly and in fewer gulps , French researchers said on Friday .
Their study , published in the journal Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research , found that turning up the music spurred drinkers to down a glass of beer about three minutes more quickly .
To gauge the effect of sound levels on drinking , the team spent three Saturday nights visiting two bars , where they observed 40 men aged between 18 and 25 drinking beer .
“ We have shown that environmental music played in a bar is associated with an increase in drinking , ” Nicolas Gueguen , a behavioral sciences researcher at the University of Southern Brittany in France , who led the study , said in a statement .
With help from the bars ’ owners , the team turned the music up and down and then recorded how much and how fast people drank .
The men did not know they were being observed .
Louder music spurred more consumption , with the average number of drinks ordered by patrons rising to 3.4 drinks from 2.6 drinks , Gueguen found .
The time taken to drink a beer fell to an average 11.45 minutes from 14.51 minutes .
The researchers acknowledged some limitations to their study , for example that the experiment was on a small scale and could not be applied to every bar .
They said it was not clear why louder music appeared to increase alcohol consumption but said it might make conversation more difficult , forcing people to drink more and talk less .
Physicists sent two photons down optical fibers toward different destinations , and found that the photons could instantly sense each other´s behavior .
After performing multiple tests on two entangled photons , physicists have yet again found that the photons seem to be communicating faster than the speed of light - at least 100,000 times faster .
The researchers hope that their results might encourage theorists to come up with new explanations for the strange quantum mechanical effect .
The physicists , led by Nicolas Gisin from the University of Geneva , arranged their experiment by sending two photons down fiber optic cables to detectors in two Swiss villages located 18 km apart .
Both photons started in Geneva , with one heading toward Satigny and the other toward Jussy .
The study , which is published in Nature , builds on previous tests published a few months ago in Physical Review Letters .
When the researchers measured several properties of each photon at its destination , they found that the particles could instantly sense the other´s behavior without any known communication .
Although this correlation obeys the laws of quantum mechanics , it seems to defy the nature of space and time , at least from humans´ everyday perspectives .
The physicists ruled out several possible classical explanations for the instantaneous communication .
For one thing , they showed that the photons did not share information before leaving Geneva , and so they didn´t travel knowing about each other´s properties .
In another test , the scientists showed that no communication could have occurred through a different reference frame , as might happen because of the photons ´ high speeds .
According to Einstein´s theory of relativity , observers moving at high speeds can get different measurements of the same event because they have different reference frames .
But , by performing tests over a complete rotation of the Earth , the researchers ruled out this possibility .
For now , Gisin´s team doesn´t have a good explanation as to how the seemingly instant correlations happen .
Even though it doesn´t make sense to them , they hope that others might one day find a better understanding .
In a Nature News story , theorist Terence Rudolph at Imperial College London suggested that humans think that the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we´re used to should be the same everywhere , on all scales .
But , he says , some things in quantum mechanics might transcend our view of space - time , and we just don´t get to see the whole picture .
" We think space and time are important because that ´s the kind of monkeys we are , " he said .

REPUBLICAN BOASTS ABOUT ‘MINISTRY OF TRUTH ’….
Last year , in an unusual display of ignorance , Fox News ’ Sean Hannity announced that he would begin offering “ Enemy of the State ” awards to liberals he disapproves of .
Hannity , never accused of being the sharpest crayon in the box , had no idea that the phrase has Stalinist origins , and quietly renamed his on - air segment , “ Enemy of the Week . ”
At the time , one of Andrew Sullivan ’s readers noted : “ It makes me wonder if Hannity has anything above a 4th - grade level education when it comes to the history of totalitarian movements . ”
As it happens , Hannity is n’t the only one who is n’t well read .
Eric Kleefeld reports on this gem :
[ A ] leading Republican appears to have just inadvertently admitted that the GOP ’s spin machine set up to counter Barack Obama during the convention is a propaganda machine spewing nothing but lies .
The GOPer in question is Colorado GOP chairman Dick Wadhams , who accidentally made the admission when describing the GOP ’s war room in Denver set up to hammer Obama during convention week .
Wadhams described the GOP ’s outfit thusly to the Denver Post : “ Just consider this the Ministry of Truth . ”
Now , I will gladly concede that the word “ Orwellian ” is used a little too often , sometimes in instances in which it does n’t really apply .
But in a case like this , Republicans like Wadhams is just making it too easy .
The “ Ministry of Truth , ” of course , comes from Orwell ’s 1984 .
Its responsibility was to create bogus propaganda and re-write history , all in the interests of lying to — and ultimately , maintaining control over — the public .
Kleefeld quoted Orwell ’s description : “ The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war , the Ministry of Truth with lies , the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation .
These contradictions are not accidental , nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy ; they are deliberate exercises in doublethink . ”
And now we have a leading Republican Party official comparing its own propaganda outlet to Orwell ’s .
It ’d be funnier if it did n’t hit quite so close to the truth .
I used to think I was the greatest songwriter around .
The truth was I was far from it , because I had n’t learned any of the concepts that can make a song great .
I wanted to be an innovator and do whatever I wanted , but I did n’t realize that before you innovate you have to know the methods that have worked again and again .
Then you can stray from them .
If you just do whatever you what , whenever you want , without learning , it ’s a recipe for a song that ’s just messy .
Believe me , I learned that the hard way .
I once had a song that went from rock , to funk , to jazz all in the same song !
I thought it was great because it was original , but needless to say my listeners had no idea where I was taking them with that kind of music .
I was trying to innovate before I knew anything about what makes a song successful .
Then I realized that once you know the ideas that go into a successful song , you can use them to make your song great , or you can creatively stray from those same ideas to make your song innovative .
Either way , you win .
But you have to know what those concepts are first .
Once I realized my songs were n’t working , I decided to build a solid songwriting education for myself and make it my mission to know what makes songs listeners want to hear and own .
I read books , and went to seminars and workshops given by the best and most accomplished songwriting teachers around .
I learned all the best tips , tricks and techniques there are .
Some of what I learned worked and some did n’t .
But the stuff that worked , worked incredibly well .
As I started to learn more and more about songwriting , I developed the ability to see what made successful songs work so well , while other songs did n’t .
It became almost instantaneous when I listened to a new song .
I ended up analyzing a ton of hit songs for articles on my own website and for other great songwriting websites , like USA Songwriting Competition ’s Blog and CD Baby ’s Do It Yourself Musician ’s Blog .
I ’ve even had my writings appear as examples in the book Songwriting Without Boundaries , by Pat Pattison , who ’s an acclaimed Lyric Writing Professor at Berklee College of Music .
Games and fashion have never exactly gone hand in hand .
PC players wearing non-ironic t- shirts about binary code .
Developers wrapping their characters in leather from head to toe and thinking it ’s still ‘ the look ’ .
Any Nintendo tee that is n’t adorned with ‘ know your mushrooms ’ .
Let ’s face it ; trying to inject fashion sense into the gaming world is a lost cause .
But while the medium has never been famed for snappy dressing , there are worse things than being unfashionable .
Like fighting in your kecks .
Against a giant lizard .
A giant lizard who ’s carrying a big sword .
Yep , dressing impractically for the situation is something the following characters are all guilty of .
And these guys and girls do n’t just need a new tailor ; they need a good mental professional to help them through these clothing catastrophes .

What ’s the best attire to wear when you ’ve got a hot date with dozens of ravenous hell beasties ?
Protective armour ?
A Kevlar vest ?
Iron -coated underwear ?
Nope .
The only thing that ’ll do the job is a bodice so revealing it would make a helmer of German grot blush .
While the ludicrously flimsy fabric might provide no protection against mandibles , claws or scythes , it does pack some NASA - shaming tech in its nether regions .
Other half left the room ?
Good .
Now look closely and you ’ll see that Capcom ’s curvaceous starlet is wearing no… how can we put this delicately ?
Under garments .
Thanks to some gravity - defying magic , though , the tip of that bodice somehow always manages to strategically cover our lady ’s unmentionables .
But while it may protect her privates from peeping eyes , we do n’t imagine it offers much resistance against the hordes of hell ’s weapons .

Space .
The final frontier … for terrible clothing choices .
There ’s a reason why NASA invest / waste millions of their moolah on the space program every year .
R&D for rocket technology .
Advanced training for astronauts .
And , of course , those useful things called space suits .
They ’re really handy by all accounts .
Something about letting you breathe in an oxygen - free environment , we think .
But not for our boy Mazza .
Oh no .
Who needs all that needless breathing apparatus and all that shit that stops your head from popping like a balloon when you ’ve got a pair of red and blue dungarees to brave the cold , uncaring vacuum of space .
The portly plumber ’s lungs should collapse before he nabs his first power star .
And let ’s not even start on how useless his shoddy Italian garb should be for traversing planets covered in molten rock , man -scoffing plants and giant bees .
As modelled by : Arthur in Super Ghouls ‘ N Ghosts
One of gaming ’s toughest titles is made even harder , thanks to Arthur ’s ridiculous armour .
On paper , wearing a reinforced metal suit seems like a pragmatic and practical solution when tasked with beating up beasties .
But in practice it offers about as much protection as a soggy cardboard box in a hurricane .
Get so much as breathed on by any of the monsters in the game and you can say goodbye protective suit and hello to the most iconic boxers in videogames .
The stupidly breakable armour may be laughable , but it still offered a might more resistance than a pair of cotton undies against a world filled with ghouls , goblins and gaming ’s most nails bosses .
Brisk sales of Apple 's MacBook product lines have seen the company 's share of the North American notebook market surge more than 60 percent on a yearly basis through the second quarter of the year , according DisplaySearch .
In a quarterly notebook shipment report released Wednesday , the NPD - owned firm reported that the Mac maker 's share rose from 6.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007 to 10.6 percent for the three - month period ending June — the largest jump out of all PC manufacturers doing business in the region .
Apple 's success came largely at the expense of rivals Toshiba and Acer , both of which saw significant declines in their share of the market during the same 12 - month period .
In particular , Acer saw its share fall some 22.5 percent from 18.6 percent to 14.4 percent , while Toshiba 's share fell 21 percent from 11.4 percent to 9 percent .
" The data calls into question Acerâs acquisition of both Gateway / eMachines and Packard Bell , " said John Jacobs , Director of Notebook Market Research for DisplaySearch .
" While the move immediately prevented competitors from getting more of a foothold in the rapidly growing US and European retail notebook PC sectors , the last few quarters ' results clearly show that Acer is struggling to integrate the Gateway and Packard Bell brands into their portfolio . "
Acer 's share of the notebook market in Europe , the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) was also down from 20.9 percent to 17.9 percent , while Toshiba saw marginal success by boosting its share a little over 2 percentage points to 11.7 percent .
" Both Gateway and Packard Bell were losing notebook PC market share prior to their acquisition , but the acquisition has failed to reverse , or even halt that trend , â Jacobs added .
Apple did not rank amongst the EMEA 's the top five notebook vendors .
Overall , 13.3 - inch to 16.0 - inch notebooks saw the largest growth during the second quarter of the year , accounting for more than 88 percent of notebook shipments , according to DisplaySearch .
Desktop Replacement Notebook PCs , or those having a 17.0 - inch or larger display , fell to just 7.5 percent market share after having been close to 10 percent share during the same period last year .
WASHINGTON DC --
The vice presidential candidate chosen to run with Obama is Senator Joe Biden of Delaware , a discredited , sleazy , and shopworn political hack -- and therefore an anti-climax for all the callow and feckless youth who got the word via text message at 3 am in the morning .
The ability of the Trilateral - Bilderberg machine which controls Obama to put up a person like Biden already reflects the further degradation of US political life over the past 9 - 12 months , largely as a result of Obama 's own demagogic , no- issues , personality cult agitation .
A year ago , there was wide agreement in the US middle class that Bush and Cheney should be impeached , that the police state be rolled back , and that the Iraq war should be ended as soon as physically possible .
Thanks largely to the advent of the vapid and messianic Obama , these issues have now been thoroughly deflated .
Biden is himself an incurable warmonger who voted for the Iraq war and blathered ceaselessly in favor of Bush 's aggressive adventure to all who would listen .
Naming Biden is a brutal insult to the antiwar majority of the Democratic Party , and Obama is obviously hoping that the Iraq war issue is dead , so nobody will care .
Last year , Obama promised that he would work against the mentality that produced Iraq ; if anyone incarnates that mentality , it is Biden .
Biden is an incurable imperialist and an eager advocate of the discredited Bush - Cheney " war on terror . "
He even tried to use one of the Democratic debates last year to whip up hysteria in favor of attacking Sudan over the Darfur issue , and with some success .
" I went there .
I sat in the borders .
I went in those camps .
They 're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die .
We 've got to stop talking and act , " Biden postured in Manchester New Hampshire on June 3 , 2007 in an apparent call for bombing Sudan , a coup in Khartoum , or an invasion .
Incredibly , the crowd applauded wildly .
Biden remains convinced that it is up to the United States to dictate the form of government and economic system of virtually every country in the world .
His specialty is blatant interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states , with left - cover of soft power issues like human rights and humanitarian concerns furnishing his favorite pretexts .
Biden has learned nothing from the Iraq debacle except that Iraq was not the right victim ; more appropriate victims and more effective methods will have to be found , argues Biden .
The real lesson of Iraq ( and Lebanon 2006 ) is that US - British imperialism and world domination are finished historically , but this is lost on Biden .
Biden is the author of the odious plan to balkanize , partition , and subdivide Iraq into three zones : a Kurdish state designed to carve up Iran , Syria and Turkey as well as Iraq ; a landlocked and oil - poor Sunni desert entity ; and an oil - rich Shiastan in the south that might absorb the Arabistan or Achwaz province of Iran is a later breakup scenario for Iran .
Biden 's plan is a continuation of the Bernard Lewis plan to break up the existing states of the Middle East in a way destined to create a mosaic of pseudo - independent , squabbling mini-states or micro-states .
This approach places Biden squarely behind the Zbigniew Brzezinski " dignity " doctrine of breaking up the existing nation states of the world in favor of a crazy quilt of micro-states based on ethnic and religious parochialism and particularism ; not one of these micro- states could stand up to Exxon - Mobil or JP Morgan Chase .
BIDEN IS MORALLY INSANE ON GEORGIA Biden 's ample track record as an agent provocateur against Russia goes back more than a decade to the time he mobilized his mouth to help demonize Milosevic of Serbia as part of the Albright - Holbrooke - Wesley Clark anti-Russian campaign of those years , which ended with the NATO bombing of Serbia , an act of unprecedented historical vandalism .
In the past week , warmonger Biden has rushed to the side of the latest tin pot mini-Mussolini of the Brzezinski - Soros faction , the infamous war criminal and gangster Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia .
" I left the country convinced that Russia 's invasion of Georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in Europe since the end of communism , " raved Biden on his return , documenting his own moral insanity by siding with the aggressor .
" The claims of Georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for Russia 's invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers , and the continuing presence of Russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region , " added the Orwellian senator .
BIDEN : $ 1 BILLION FOR MADMAN SAAKASHVILI
In presenting Biden , Barky reveled in Biden 's " tough message " for Russia ; we are sure Putin is trembling .
Biden wants to prop up the madman Saakashvili with $ 1 billion of the US taxpayers ' money , a gesture which is every bit as obscene as the worst Bush - Cheney excesses .
$ 1 billion would get us on the road to fully funding a program like WIC ( high - protein foods for expectant mothers ) or Head Start , but this thought does not occur to Biden when he is trying to provoke Russia .
We can see the cruel elitism of a financier - controlled Obama regime taking place before our eyes .
Obama and Biden resemble each other closely , Both are insufferable windbags besotted with their own rhetorical verbiage .
Biden 's celebrated gaffes will provide comic relief , as long as they do not gaffe us into World War III , which is always a distinct possibility .
Obama and Biden are addicted to the sound of their own voices , and this may turn out to be the fatal flaw that sinks them when the voters get sick of the endless parade of speeches .
Obama and Biden are in danger of drowning in their own endless blabber .
Each one has more than a touch of megalomania , which prevents them from seeing their limits .
Biden 's middle name is Robinette , which is close to the term for a faucet tap in French .
Biden has never been able to find the tap to turn off his own mouth .
TWO PLAGIARISTS ON THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET Obama and Biden are both plagiarists ; words are their stock in trade , and even the words are fake .
It emerged this spring that Obama was spouting verbatim the canned speeches of Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts , his fellow clone from the Trilateral stable .
Biden is a picaresque paladin of plagiarism .
His 1988 presidential campaign was aborted when he was found to have stolen paragraphs of a speech by the Labour Party leader , Neil Kinnock .
He had also embroidered his campaign biography .
Biden had also been guilty of plagiarism at the Syracuse University law school which he attended , but he had somehow talked his way out of those charges .
BIDEN A CREATURE OF THE WORST CREDIT CARD GOUGERS Biden represents Delaware in the US Senate .
Delaware is not a state , but a giant post box for Dupont , General Motors , and many of the giant corporations and Wall Street firms .
The state politics of Delaware are dictated down to the most minute detail by the bankers and their corporate lackeys , since everything depends on keeping a pro-oligarchical political climate in the state .
Biden personally is a tool of MBNA , a credit card issuer that was recently absorbed by the Bank of America , which presumably now also owns Biden .
Biden got at least $ 215,000 from MBNA over the past decade .
MBNA is notoriously one of the biggest predatory lenders and interest rate gougers in the entire usurious world of credit cards , and Biden 's services to them are precisely in this area : Biden was a big supporter of the 2005 bankruptcy law which makes it much harder for working families to escape debt bondage and debt slavery ­ just what the looters at MBNA ordered .
Biden has also boasted that he wrote the ban on assault weapons , a measure that is sure to cause problems among the bitter clingers of Appalachia who are concerned about gun ownership .
Obama has voted for the rotten compromise on FISA illegal wiretaps ordered by Bush that grants retroactive immunity to the telecoms .
Biden is also an enthusiastic police state totalitarian .
In 1995 , after the Oklahoma City false flag bombing , Biden submitted an oppressive police state bill , in many ways a precursor of Bush 's infamous Patriot Act .
" I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing , " boasts Biden .
" And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill . "
Biden 's only regret is that he was not able to undermine political freedom as much as he wanted to .
Obama 's drooling acolytes have argued all summer that to name Senator Clinton to the ticket would negate Barky 's profile of youth , change , hope , and so forth .
Clinton has been a national figure for almost twenty years , but she has been dumped in favor of Biden , who has been in the US Senate for about 36 years and is about as stale and hackneyed as a political figure could be .
The difference is that Biden 's track record established him as an obedient servant of the Wall Street banks that have their post box headquarters in his state ; the Clintons , by contrast , represent the closest thing we have to political combination not wholly owned by Wall Street and capable of saying no to the bankers when they demand austerity and aggression , as they are assuredly doing now .
Rockefeller and Soros do not want Sen. Clinton in the presidential succession under any circumstances , and this is an important positive qualification for the New York senator .
BEAU BIDEN , THE CORRUPT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF DELAWARE Joe Biden 's son is Beau Biden , the current attorney general of Delaware .
Beau is involved in one of the dirtiest enemies ' list operations in recent memory against Larry Sinclair , who has come forward with explosive charges of gay sex and crack cocaine use in 1999 on the part of Obama .
When Sinclair came to the National Press Club in Washington on June 18 to make his case , he was arrested on a trumped - up warrant issued by Beau Biden .
Sinclair is being threatened with a long jail term , essentially because he has spoken out against Obama .
It was a clear bid to do a favor for Barky and get Joe Biden on the ticket in the veep slot .
That has now occurred ­ on the basis of a police state operation against an outspoken political opponent which goes beyond Nixon or Bush - Cheney , since Obama is not yet president and may well never be .
The Biden announcement was thoroughly botched and bungled by Axelrod , Plouffe , and Favreau .
The text message gimmick is drawn straight from the Kiev Orange revolution of 2004 and the Tiflis Roses revolution of 2003 , the models for Obama 's attempt to seize power .
The proceedings were a carnival of gaffes and Freudian slips , all ignored by Obama 's loyal brigade of media whores .
According to Barky , Joe Biden would help enact " a new energy policy to freeze ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil " ­ a chilling prospect .
" BARACK AMERICA " AND OTHER FREUDIAN SLIPS
Barky made another revealing Freudian slip : " the next President the next Vice President ­ Joe Biden . "
Does Barky know that Biden will act as his resident in - house controller ?
Biden , evidently mindful that he will have to sell the radical subversive Obama as a wholesome product of the heartland , returned the gaffe by calling the presumptive nominee " Barack America " or " Barack American . "
Perhaps he was trying to imitate the old Subliminal Man of Saturday Night Live , but was too slow .
Behind Barky 's Freudian slip is the fact that Biden will evidently run foreign policy for the clueless Obama in much the same way that Brzezinski ran foreign policy above and behind Carter , or that Cheney has run foreign policy above and behind Bush .
Obama is so ignorant and cognitively impaired that he could hardly understand the instructions that bankers ' spokesmen like Brzezinski and Soros will be shouting to him on the phone .
This is where an experienced hack like Biden is needed .
The media , in a transparent attempt to portray an apostolic succession for Biden , are still feeding the illusion that Biden was chosen by Caroline Kennedy .
In reality , the choice was probably made by Trilateral - Bilderberg operative Jim Johnson , who was forced to retreat from his announced role as The Vetter by revelations about a sweetheart mortgage , but probably just kept going behind the scenes .
The Obama campaign has repeated ad nauseam its mantra that McCain is running for Bush 's third term .
McCain has answered that Obama is running for Jimmy Carter 's second term .
The reality may be that Joe Biden is running for Dick Cheney 's third term as the resident controller of a lazy and shallow puppet president ­ Obama , the Manchurian candidate of the Trilateral Commission .
Webster G. Tarpley is the author of Obama : The Postmodern Coup , and Barack H. Obama : The Unauthorized Biography , both published by Progressive Press of California .
Barry George denied killing the Crimewatch presenter Barry George has been found not guilty of murdering BBC television presenter Jill Dando outside her London home .
Mr George , 48 , of Fulham , west London , denied shooting 37 - year - old Miss Dando on her doorstep on 26 April 1999 .
He was first convicted in 2001 but an Old Bailey retrial was ordered after doubt was cast on the reliability of gunshot residue evidence .
In a statement issued through his solicitor Jeremy Moore , Mr George said he was " overwhelmed " by the verdict .
Mr George added : " I want to thank my family , my legal team , my medical team and all the people who have supported me at Belmarsh , Whitemoor and Manchester prisons , and all my supporters . "
But Mr Moore said : " This is not a time to celebrate .
Barry George , an innocent man , has spent eight years in prison for a crime he did not commit .
" Those eight years could have been better served by the police in searching for the real killer . "
Mr Moore said he would not be surprised if Mr George , who left the Old Bailey in a taxi , sought compensation for the time wrongly spent in jail .

The jury of eight women and four men was sent out to deliberate on Wednesday after an eight - week trial .
Mr George , a loner and epileptic who suffers from mental illness , has consistently insisted he did not murder Ms Dando .
He showed no reaction as the verdict was read out but nodded as clinical psychologist Dr Susan Young , who sat with him in the dock during the case , whispered to him .
Outside court , Dr Young said : " Throughout the trial , he did not dare to get his hopes up and he continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted .
" His eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath . "
Later , Dr Young told the BBC News Channel that Mr George was unlikely to be angry about his experience .
" Obviously this is the time for reflection ; perhaps mistakes have been made but bitter and angry are not words I would use . "
Mr George was arrested on 15 May 2000 , a year after the shooting in Gowan Avenue .
His defence argued he was not capable of carrying out what could be seen as the " perfect crime " that required " meticulous " planning .
We are really delighted to finally have justice
Michelle Diskin
Barry George 's sister
Psychologist 's statement CPS and police statements Forensic evidence about a tiny speck of gun residue found in Barry George 's coat pocket after his arrest helped secure his original conviction .
The prosecution said this proved that he had fired the fatal shot and he was convicted by a majority of 10 to one .
But last year , the Court of Appeal ruled new scientific doubts over the evidence meant the conviction had to be quashed and ordered a retrial .
The appeal hearing was told it was " just as likely " that the particle came from " some extraneous source as it was that it came from a gun fired " .
The residue evidence was not permitted to be put before the retrial jury .
Mr George 's sister Michelle Diskin , who has led the fight for his release , was instrumental in getting the Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer the case to the Court of Appeal .
" We are really delighted to finally have justice , " she said .

" A huge thank you to the jury .
They obviously worked very hard to ensure they correctly interpreted the circumstantial evidence in this case ...
" We 've been fighting for many years .
Now we need time to get back together as a family .
We also hope that the police will now look again into the murder of Jill Dando . "
The Crown Prosecution Service defended its original decision to charge Mr George .
In a statement it said : " Mr George now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man .
But that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case .
" Our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction ; it would be wholly wrong only to bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction . "
The Met Police said it would reflect on George 's acquittal and " consider how best to proceed " .
Commander Simon Foy , head of Scotland Yard 's homicide and serious crime command , said : " We are disappointed by today 's verdict but especially disappointed for Jill 's family and friends .
However , we respect the decision of the court . "
The prosecution had used a change in the law to introduce so - called bad character evidence at the retrial .
Jill Dando was one of the most popular presenters on television
They painted an image of Mr George approaching a series of women on the streets of Fulham .
No murder weapon was found by police .
But prosecutors presented evidence they said showed Mr George was a celebrity and gun-obsessed stalker with a grudge against the BBC , where he had worked as a messenger for a short time in the past .
He was said to have photographed hundreds of women and was described as a fantasist who told people he was the cousin of the late Queen singer Freddie Mercury .
When police searched his home in Crookham Road , officers found 2,248 photographs he had taken of women .
Prosecutors maintained that witness identification was the most important part of their case .
However , only one witness could be 100 % sure that they had seen Mr George in Gowan Avenue - and that was more than four hours before the killing .
Defence counsel William Clegg QC pointed out the prosecution case was circumstantial and said there was no direct evidence that George was the killer .

The court heard that Mr George has an IQ of 75 , in the lowest 5 % of the population .
The jury at the retrial also heard the defendant had a history of medical problems and memory lapses and told police he had a " personality disorder " .
Mr Clegg said : " The only reason that the prosecution say that this is the work of the local loner , the local nutter , the man with these serious psychological problems , is because that is the man they arrested .
" But if you look at the facts of the case they will give you a very different story . "

ALEX BRUMMER : Rate cuts , the only cure to this financial meltdown
What ought to have been a hopeful day on the world financial markets - with the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley and the progress of the America 's $ 700 billion bail - out scheme - turned into a nightmare .
The reality of globalisation is not just that it has brought the world undreamed - of prosperity , but that it is impossible to isolate a financial crisis in one country from that in another .
In a matter of a few short hours yesterday banks across the globe from Wachovia in North Carolina to the frozen wastes of Iceland fell under new ownership .
And as the drama unfolded the share prices of banks , including those of the big four on Britain 's high street - Royal Bank of Scotland , Lloyds TSB , Barclays and even HSBC - took a hammering .
Down , down , down :
The economy took another hit as markets across the world reacted to the failed $ 700 bn bail - out
In the U.S. , the House of Representatives rejected Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson 's banking rescue package , leaving Wall Street in a state approaching panic and causing its biggest one - day fall in history .
Here in Britain B&B was nationalised with a difference in that the banking system , rather than the taxpayer , might have to pick up the eventual bill .
In the United States Wachovia , a big retail bank , was swallowed by mighty Citibank with the assistance of the U.S. central bank the Federal Reserve .
And on the Continent banks based in Belgium , Germany and Iceland have been taken into public ownership by their respective central banks .
So what has been going on ?
The immediate causes of the rescues were falling share prices in the banks concerned and other banks , lenders and savers pulling out their deposits .
In effect the banks concerned , Fortis in the Benelux countries , Glitnir in Iceland and Hypo Real Estate bank in Germany , had suffered invisible runs .
There were no queues , as when Northern Rock ran into trouble a year ago , but the withdrawal of deposits in the wholesale markets ( where banks lend to each ) made it difficult for the banks concerned to fund operations .
So central banks across the world have been forced to nationalise in an effort to stabilise the system .
Until now many experts have sought to blame the escalating global banking crisis on the foolishness and greed of Wall Street and the packaging and selling - on of toxic sub - prime loans .
But it is also becoming clear that it is not just the American banks and Anglo - Saxon capitalism which is responsible for the present catastrophe .
Europe 's vulnerability to the credit crunch also stems from its own extravagant behaviour .
Across Britain and Europe , over the last decade , there has been huge surge in corporate and household lending and debt .
This has been layered on top of a banking system which believed it could operate with lower capital and liquidity than in the past .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters ' we are still in a crisis ' as the bid failed
Instead of conserving banking profits for a downturn in the economy , gains were extravagantly distributed to executives , employees and shareholders .
It is not just the U.S. and Britain which experienced a housing boom .
The subsequent drop in house prices has spread across Europe , too , with Ireland , France and Spain seeing serious declines spoiling the value of the mortgage security held on balance sheets .
This was the core of the problem at Bradford & Bingley and HBOS , Britain 's biggest mortgage lender , which is being bought by Lloyds TSB .
As important has been corporate borrowing and debt levels .
The last few years have seen record levels of mergers and acquisitions with prices driven up by private - equity deals as well as unusually high levels of capital spending .
Across Europe this year there has been a serious deterioration in the balance sheets of companies , with the debt agencies downgrading the debt of 78 per cent of borrowing corporations - the worst period since the dot.com bubble burst in 2003 .
The other factor which has caused problems to spread and worsen is the internationalisation of risk .
Everyone is now aware that bad mortgage debts in Cleveland , Ohio ended up on the balance sheet of banks such as Barclays in Britain , BNP in France and IKB in Germany .
International Monetary Fund figures show that the exposure of European banks to American sub - prime mortgages is 73 per cent as big as that of the American banks .
So it is hardly surprising that the UK and the Continent are now feeling the effects of the same hurricane which has swept away great chunks of Wall Street and hundreds of years of venerable financial history .
Not just EU and US : A Thai stock investor monitors shares prices next to an electronic stock data board in Bangkok , Thailand
So when will it end ?
From the startling evidence of the widespread public ownership now taking place , the current storm still has along way to go before it blows itself out .
Until now we have seen a piecemeal response to the crisis , with banks being rescued or taken over one by one .
What has been lacking is a coherent economic response .
The most far - reaching rescue package was put together by Mr Paulson , but now Congressional opposition has put this into serious doubt .
Central banks , including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England , have been nervous of cutting interest rates because of the inflation threat .
That is now becoming the lesser of two evils .
What is needed now is cheaper money , which will ease the pressure on bank and corporate balance sheets .
Instead of fighting last year 's war against inflation , the new battle against banking collapse and economic implosion needs to be joined with decisive rate cuts .
If you 've only got one afternoon in Chicago , which museum should you attend ?
After mulling over the possibilities and consulting my Magic 8 - ball , I decided to hit up the Field Museum .
It was a great choice , largely because I got to meet this old gal , who happens to be one of the most controversial set of bones in existence .
The Discovery
The dino named Sue was almost not found .
After the crew on the dig found a few Edmontosaurus bones , they were pretty much ready to call it quits .
But then their truck got a flat tire .
While waiting on the tire to be fixed , Sue Hendrickson thought she would bide her time by checking out some cliffs that they were unable to get to before .
After finding some small pieces of bone , she looked up to see where they had fallen from .
Sticking out of the cliff were some much larger bones that looked to be well preserved .
( Photo from the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research )
The remains were eventually excavated and the crew discovered that the T. Rex was 80 percent complete " “ the most complete set of T .
Rex bones ever found .
In fact , only seven T . Rex fossils that are more than 50 percent complete have ever been found , so this was really an amazing find .
The reason the skeleton is so complete , they speculated , is because the dino was covered with water and mud shortly after it died , so other animals were n't able to make off with pieces of it very easily .
The Controversy
Pretty much as soon as word of the discovery got out , people started fighting over who " owned " 
Sue ( the dino , not the paleontologist ) .
The excavation crew had permission from Maurice Williams , the owner of the land , to dig and remove the skeleton and paid him $ 5,000 for those privileges .
But Mr. Williams said the $ 5,000 did n't include the sale of any findings " “ just permission to remove and clean them .
It gets even more complicated .
Williams belonged to the Sioux tribe , and the Sioux insisted that the bones were rightfully theirs .
However , the United States Department of the Interior held the land the dinosaur was found on in trust , so they claimed the land actually belonged to them and not Williams .
Concerned that something would happen to the valuable fossil , the FBI and the National Guard seized the it from the dig site in 1992 and transferred it to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology .
It was eventually decided that the fossil did belong to Maurice Williams .
He decided to sell it , which was when the Field Museum pooled funds with California State University , Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , McDonald 's , Ronald McDonald House Charities and lots of individual donors to purchase the T .
Rex when it when up for auction at Sotheby's .
They ended up buying it for $ 8,362,500 .
The Restoration
The Field Museum built a new research laboratory specifically for preservationists to work on Sue .
It also allowed the museum 's visitors to watch the preservation through glass .
Copies were made of each bone and models were made of the 20 percent of the bones that were missing .
McDonald 's got one complete set to put on a traveling tour and Disney 's Animal Kingdom received a set that you can still see in the DinoLand U.S.A. section of the park .
The preservationists also took CT scans of each bone to see what they could learn , but at nearly five feet long , the skull was way too big to fit in a conventional medical scanner .
So they borrowed the scanner at Boeing 's Rocketdyne lab in California , which was usually used to check out space shuttle pieces .
What they discovered from all of their scans was that Sue was really old for a dinosaur .
She had also broken numerous rib bones , but they had all healed so they were injuries that occurred before she died as opposed to injuries that caused her death .
The ribs were n't her only injuries , though " “ she had also broken her fibula , experienced some damage to her skull and damaged vertebra of her tail .
They think that she died from disease , though , and not from a fight or a fall .
All in all , more than 25,000 hours were spent cleaning and restoring Sue .
The Display
Once properly examined and cleaned , the Field Museum was ready to show Sue off to the public in her entirety .
Problem : without muscles , Sue 's 600 - pound head was simply too heavy for her body to easily hold up .
Plus , her head had some damage to it and was n't in the greatest shape .
So , the solution was to cast a mold of the skull , fixing the smashed parts so the head would n't look distorted .
It was also much more lightweight and was easier to attach to the body .
The original skull is on display for museum patrons to see ; it 's not attached to anything .
When the whole thing was assembled , Sue ended up being 42 feet long and 13 feet tall at the hips .
Despite her huge size , her brain cavity is only big enough to hold about a quart of milk .
So , that 's the story of Sue .
If you 're ever in Chicagoland , I highly recommend checking her out .
The whole museum is fantastic " “ I lost my husband in the Native American exhibit for about an hour , and when he wandered out he confessed that he could have spent an entire day there .
It 's a wonderful , not - boring museum with lots and lots of dino bones for you to ponder .
I 'll leave you with a few of them .
DIGG THIS
Have you ever wondered how human beings can be so cruel ?
And how cruelty crosses all the boundaries — national , racial and ethnic ?
I have .
Rereading an autobiography published in 1941 by a communist agent reminded me of the dark side of human nature .
The book ,
Out of the Night , was written — under the pseudonym " Jan Valtin " — by a German who lived through the chaos of the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism .
Broken by Gestapo torture , he ended up being pursued by both the Nazi and the communist manhunters and killers .
Murders by these two forms of socialism are measured in the millions during the 20th century .
That alone should warn all people off any form of collectivism , because all of those millions , in the minds of their killers , were sacrificed " for the greater good . "
They — flesh - and - blood individual human beings — were all murdered in the name of an abstraction , a stupid theory of how society should be organized .
I doubt if the head thugs on both sides actually believed the theories .
What they really believed in was power over their fellow man .
If you look at the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution , the message is clear : Intellectuals and the common people can produce a blood bath .
Latching on to some " ism " for justification , their greed for power and desire for revenge can run amok .
Butchering women and children because they were born into the " wrong " class is surely insane .
In our time , when people are saying we must sacrifice liberty for security , that scrapping the Constitution is necessary to win the " war " against terrorism , I would suggest that you take your choice of genocides in the past 100 years and remind yourself what happens when people buy into the false proposition that the end justifies the means .
People who preach that are always more interested in the means than in any end .
The only safe environment for a human being is under a weak government with very restricted powers .
Normal people do n’t need much to be happy — food , shelter , dignity and freedom from marauders .
They need a rule of law that applies to everyone equally and at all times and in all circumstances .
In established societies , legislators should meet rarely — perhaps once every two or three years — because a continuing cascade of new laws will eventually drown freedom .
The Founding Fathers , whether through luck , wisdom or divine guidance , gave us an almost perfect form of government , and we ’ve been busy ever since trying to take it apart .
Human beings are dangerous predators and cannot be trusted with power over their fellows .
Many Americans have forgotten that the power of government comes out of the barrel of a gun .
Governments coerce ; they do n’t persuade .
There are people living among us at this very moment capable of the cruelty so evident in the Holocaust .
All they are waiting for is the opportunity .
No greater opportunity exists than when a government enlists such people and says whatever you do is now justified for the sake of the " greater good . "
Who would have guessed that George W. Bush , who seemed to be a genial good old boy , would turn out to be a tyrant , launching wars of aggression , arresting and confining people without charges or access to a lawyer , condoning torture and lying to the American people ?
A government that can without trial destroy you by simply putting on a list your name or the name of an organization with which you are associated is a tyranny .
A government that invades other countries and that feels free to murder people in any country it chooses is a tyranny .
Americans are on the edge of a long night .
We had better wake up and step back before it ’s too late .

It 's time now do discuss the problem of forming a representation of a knot or tangle in machine readable form .
I 've defined rational tangles but I should set that in a wider context .
A knot is essentially a single closed loop embedded in 3D space and a link is a non-intersecting union of a bunch of these .
Any tangle , knot or link can be projected down to 2D space so that you get a finite collection of ' over ' or ' under ' crossings connected by arcs .
You might have to jiggle things around a bit to ensure that you do n't get any degeneracies like two separate parts of a knot being projected to the same segment of curve in 2D , but this is always possible .
Here 's an example of such a 2D projection , a knot diagram , for the photograph I posted last week : Roughly speaking , two knots or links or tangles are equivalent if you can slide the strings about to get from one to the other without passing one string through another .
In the case of rational tangles we have the extra constraint that the free ends must n't move and must always remain ' at infinity ' so you can't pass loops over the end .
Given two diagrams for rational tangles , the task is to tell when they represent something equivalent .
I 'll start on this in a future posting , but for now I just want to consider the problem of getting diagrams like that above into machine readable from .
( Incidentally , the rigorous mathematical definition of knot equivalence , ambient isotopy , relies on the notion of finding a continuous bijection between the space around the two knots , not the knot itself . )
We do n't need anything particularly clever to form our representation as there is a fairly commonplace way to represent connectons between components using monads .
If we have some kind of block with inputs a and b and outputs c and d we can represent this as a line of do - notation looking likeExamples of such notation are in Matthew Naylor 's article on Lava .
We could also use arrows but in this case there is no need .
So now we need to break up a diagram of a rational tangle into components and hook them up , working down the diagram from top to bottom .
There are four essential components that can be discerned and I 'm calling them cups , caps , overs and unders .
Here are the corresponding diagrams for each one : Cups have two inputs but no output and caps have two outputs and no inputs .
Now all we have to do is label the inputs and outputs of each arc , write the corresponding lines as above , and collect them together in a do - block .
Here I 've redrawn the above diagram marking the cups and caps with red circles and the overs and unders with green circles .
I 've also labelled the inputs and outputs .
We can now write the following block of code .
Note how this block has a pair of inputs ( a , b ) and a pair of outputs ( m,z ) corresponding to the strings at the top and bottom .
Clearly knots and links should have no inputs or outputs but rational tangles should have a pair of inputs and a pair of outputs .
The precise order should n't matter as long as you do n't try to use a name that is n't yet in scope .
So what monad should we use ?
It 's easy to imagine some kind of state monad that allows us to generate fresh labels for each of the connections and collects up a graph - like representation of our tangle .
But the surprise is this : it turns out we do n't need to do anything complicated like this .
With suitable definitions ofand , not only does the vector space monad give us the representation we want , it also does most of our computation for us .
But first I need to explain the underlying mathematics in an upcoming installment .

Messing with the return stack : t( postpone tick postpone >r ; immediate : ( t ) ) tick swap - . .

However , you can define ` as being a synonym for postpone :
: ` postpone postpone ; immediate
This is Forth after all :)

It has a wonderful charm for expressing yourself , and a wonderful economy of primitives ; I wish it translated better to the ability to read the code of others .
I think some languages are , in a sense , too good at factoring and minimalism for their own good : by the time you 're done factoring things down , only you can tell what the code means anymore .
The Forth and APL families are the clear winners .
The Prolog and Snobol families are perhaps runners - up , with the Lisp and Smalltalk families taking the bronze ( and inching into territory where team programming seems possible ) .

Lots of people do regard Forth as write - only but I 'll have to discover this first hand .
I 'm working on a codebase written by a friend who had a head - start and so far I find the code pleasantly easy to understand ( and fun -- learning tricks ) .
Hardware is pretty friendly too - I wonder if Unix 's serial port interface is any easier than poking the UART registers directly ?
But I do always love the shiny new language I 'm learning so this is all subject to post - novelty revision later :-)

That script sound something
More than 100 species of sharks and rays have been classified and named as new species , including some that had been discovered as far back as the early 1990s .
The new namings and classifications are the result of an 18 - month Australian project using DNA analysis to clarify the identity of closely related species .
The new species include :
The endangered Maugean Skate ( Zearaja maugeana ) , which lives only at the southwestern tip of Tasmania .
It is closely related to an ancestor that lived off southern Australia some 80 million years ago .
A critically endangered gulper shark known as the Southern Dogfish ( Centrophorus zeehaani ) , which lives only on the continental slope off southern Australia .
The Northern Freshwater Whipray and the Northern River Shark , which are among the largest freshwater animals in Australia at more than 6 feet ( 2 meters ) long .
Until recently these were confused with similar marine species .
" Additional taxonomic information like this is critical to managing sharks and rays , which reproduce relatively slowly and are extremely vulnerable to over - fishing and other human impacts , " said project leader Peter Last of CSIRO , Australia 's top research agency .
" Their populations are also sensitive to small - scale events and can be an indicator of environmental change . "
Sharks and rays play a vital ecosystem role as top predators , culling weak or dimwitted members of other species .
" Take them away and what does it mean for the rest of the ecosystem ? " said team member William White .
" We can't understand possible implications unless we know what species we 're dealing with . "
Sharks are also sensitive to small - scale events and can be an indicator of environmental change , the researchers said .
Most of the sharks and rays were identified but not fully described in 1994 .
They new names and descriptions will be published in book form in 2009 .
Barack Obama has been mocked as \ " The One\ " by his Republican critics .
GOP 's celeb - Obama message gains traction
Barack Obama ’s critics laid down the foundations of the strategy months ago : The Republican National Committee started the “ Audacity Watch ” back in April , and Karl Rove later fueled the attack by describing the first - term Illinois senator as “ coolly arrogant . ”
It was n’t until the last week , however , that the narrative of Obama as a president - in - waiting — and perhaps getting impatient in that waiting — began reverberating beyond the inboxes of Washington operatives and journalists .
Advertisement
Perhaps one of the clearest indications emerged Tuesday from the world of late - night comedy , when David Letterman offered his “ Top Ten Signs Barack Obama is Overconfident . ”
The examples included Obama proposing to change the name of Oklahoma to “ Oklobama ” and measuring his head for Mount Rushmore .
“ When Letterman is doing ‘ Top Ten ’ lists about something , it has officially entered the public consciousness , ” said Dan Schnur , a political analyst from the University of Southern California and the communications director in John McCain ’s 2000 campaign .
“ And it usually stays there for a long , long time . ”
Following a nine - day , eight - country tour that carried the ambition and stagecraft of a presidential state visit , Obama has found himself in an unusual position : the butt of jokes .
Jon Stewart teased that the presumptive Democratic nominee traveled to Israel to visit his birthplace at Bethlehem ’s Manger Square .
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd amplified the McCain campaign ’s private nickname for Obama ( “ The One ” ) .
And the snickers about Obama ’s perceived smugness may have a very real political impact as McCain 's camp launched its most forceful effort yet to define him negatively .
It released a TV ad Wednesday describing Obama as the “ biggest celebrity in the world , ” comparable to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears , stars who are famous for attitude rather than accomplishments .
The harsher treatment from comedians and columnists — coupled with the shift by McCain from attacking on policy to character issues — underscores the fine line that Obama is walking between confident and cocky .
Once at pains to present himself as presidential , Obama now faces criticism for doing it too well .
“ I was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what Sen.
McCain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past , ” Obama said Sunday , speaking about his trip at a conference of minority journalists .
“ Now , I admit we did it really well .
But that should n't be a strike against me . ”
Obama and his supporters dismissed the line of attack as the latest desperate missive from a foundering Republican campaign .
Bloggers at the Huffington Post launched a backlash to the backlash against Obama ’s overseas trip , arguing in part that he would n’t face such criticism of acting premature if he were white .
Separately , the Obama campaign pushed back hard at journalists who used a report that detailed Obama ’s move to assemble a transition team to describe him as presumptuous by pointing to an interview in which McCain had owned up to the same thing .
Some Democratic operatives described the narrative as a Beltway creation , the pastime of journalists looking to keep the presidential race competitive .
" Self - absorbed press speculation , ” concluded consultant Bob Shrum , the chief strategist during John Kerry ’s 2004 presidential campaign .
“ Most Americans are not paying the slightest bit of attention to this . ”
Mark Mellman , a pollster for Kerry , said Obama acted the same when he was struggling last year against Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ The only people who are making him seem inevitable are the commentariat , ” Mellman said .
“ He seemed this confident and self possessed when he was down 30 points to Hillary Clinton .
He is a confident and self possessed person . ”
Republicans have long tried to turn his assuredness into a shortcoming .
National party operatives began sending e-mails to reporters in the spring detailing some of Obama ’s bolder moves , including using a faux presidential seal at a policy roundtable .
The RNC rolled the headlines onto one site , “ Barack Obama Audacity Watch , ” that it unveiled Wednesday .
The McCain campaign piled on with its “ Celeb ” ad , which juxtaposed Obama ’s speech to 200,000 people in Berlin with photos of Spears and Hilton .
“ Do the American people want to elect the world ’s biggest celebrity , or do they want to elect an American hero ? ”
Steve Schmidt , one of McCain ’s top aides , asked on a conference call .
They stayed personal later in the day when responding to Obama ’s suggestion at a Missouri town hall that Republicans would use his unusual name and his race to paint him as a risky choice .
“ This is a typically superfluous response from Barack Obama .
Like most celebrities , he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria , ” McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
Later Wednesday , the Obama campaign responded within hours to the “ Celeb ” ad with one of its own , accusing McCain of taking the “ low road ” and “ practicing the politics of the past . ”
Responding to questions from reporters about McCain 's ad , Obama said : “ I do notice that he does n’t seem to have anything to say very positive about himself . ”
The strategy has very real potential dangers for Team McCain .
Obama ’s unmistakable charisma and his campaign ’s deft brand of stagecraft have created an often lopsided contrast with McCain ’s sometimes painful - to - watch public events .
As presidents as diverse as Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy showed , Americans do like a touch of celebrity in their commander in chief ; though not too much .
Obama ’s steely sense of self - confidence , even destiny , is also one of the traits his supporters like most and which could , as the fall campaign heats up , be one of the qualities that help him make the sale .
But the slippery slope for Obama is allowing a McCain campaign that is searching for a consistent theme with which to attack him to latch on to a way of making him seem alien to ordinary Americans .
Douglas Schoen , a Democratic pollster , argued that Obama was not yet in a danger zone , but he needs to pay heed to the gathering storm .
“ My sense is that all of those attacks individually are frankly not particularly potent , but taken together , they are creating a narrative about Obama that is not helpful , ” said Schoen , who worked on President Bill Clinton 's 1996 reelection campaign .
“ It is a warning sign for Obama that he ’s got to get back on the trail and make the case that there is a real contrast . ”

I thought a good way to go would be to subclass Decimal , since you really do n't want to be using floating point numbers for financial data ( which basically all spreadsheets do of course ) .
Note
You can see how far I 've got with this , which is n't very far as it is a ' lunch - hour - project ' for Resolver Hacks , over at the Google Code Project Page and Repository .
However , if you read the rest of this entry you will see that most of the implementation may well change dramatically a check - in or two down the line ...
So , I create a Currency class that inherits from Decimal and implements sensible rules - like you can't add currencies of different types together and can only multiply amounts of currencies by integers , longs or decimals .
A simple implementation of addition then looks something like this :
def __add__ ( self , other , context = context ) :
if type ( self ) != type ( other ) :
raise TypeError ( " ca n't add different currencies " )
result = Decimal .
__add__ ( self , other , context = context )
return self .
__class__ ( result )
That seems to work fine .
So I add the equality method .
If the two values being compared are of different types then I can just return False , otherwise I can defer to Decimal comparison .
def __eq__ ( self , other ) :
if type ( self ) != type ( other ) :
return False
return Decimal .
__eq__ ( self , other )
Does this work ?
Well , if it did I guess this would be an even duller blog entry .
The result of the test self.assertEquals ( Pound ( 1 ) , Pound ( 1 ) ) is an exception in the addition method complaining that I 'm trying to add currencies of different types ...
The reason for this is that Decimal .
__eq__ delegates to its __cmp__ method , which first tests for a few special cases ( NaN , INF , 0 etc ) , then coerces other into a Decimal ( so that you can compare with integers and longs ) and then proceeds to add minus other to self and see if the result is zero .
So an equality comparison with a Decimal involves an addition with the right hand value coerced to a Decimal - and bang my nasty 'ole type checks in the Currency addition operator blow up .
( decimal.py does a lot of weird stuff which I guess you need to understand the context sufficiently to have a hope of grasping . )
So one solution is to coerce all the values into decimals first , so the addition happens in Decimal rather than in Currency :
def __add__ ( self , other , context = context ) :
if type ( self ) != type ( other ) :
raise TypeError ( " ca n't add different currencies " )
result = Decimal .
__add__ ( Decimal ( self ) , Decimal ( other ) , context = context )
return self .
__class__ ( result )
Yuck , so for every addition we pay the extra cost of construction two extra decimals ( we could save one by turning the result into a currency unit with result .
__class__ = self .
__class__ - but I think that brings too much bad karma ) .
Of course subclassing is really just a form of delegation .
I 'm layering the currency semantics onto the numerical semantics and delegating to Decimal to actually provide the numerical semantics .
So I could avoid the subclassing altogether , and just have my currency units store a real decimal value away - delegating in the numeric operators .
This makes the code look something like this :
class Pounds ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self , value ) :
self .
value = Decimal ( value )
def __add__ ( self , other ) :
if type ( self ) != type ( other ) :
raise TypeError ( " ca n't add different currencies " )
result = self .
value + other .
value
return self .
__class__ ( result )
This is a lot more readable .
The bugbear is that Resolver One unfortunately does have some ' is - a ' tests ( isinstance ) , rather than ' has - a' ( duck - typing ) , for how it handles values , both in terms of displaying the values properly ( right aligning numeric values in the grid ) and how it treats them in operations like SUM .
So the best answer is probably to do both , delegate but also inherit from Decimal .
This negates one of the nice results of delegation rather than subclassing , in that I could have only implemented the operators that made sense ( does a currency unit really need to support __divmod__ for example ) .
With sub-classing I have to implement all the methods to avoid any of the base class methods being called ' accidentally ' .
Oh well , implementing them all is n't really that much work and it's fun to mess around with decimal anyway .
And of course as I develop it TDD ( writing tests before writing new code ) it is hard to mess up things without realising it .
On the other hand , a delegation implementation would make it easier to swap in the .NET Decimal under the hood .
Although I 've been developing this for IronPython , so far it's all pure Python so I 've been running the tests with CPython .
It 's been nice to be able to use the new testing tool built into the Wing IDE
Diagramming on the Mac
One of the annoying things about writing a book is having to create my own diagrams .
This was something I was n't expecting when I started the project , I 'm a good writer but awful at producing diagrams .
Thankfully a colleague , Jonathan Hartley , stepped up and helped me .
Here 's one of my original diagrams , a ' hedgehog diagram ' I produced with ' Paint ' ( I was still running Windows at home at the time - later I upgraded to Paint.
NET which is a much better program but did n't improve my skills ) :
Here is Jonathan 's rendering of the same diagram :
To produce them , he used Open Office Draw .
I 'm now working on chapter 15 ( Embedding IronPython in C# and VB.
NET using the DLR Hosting API ) , and thought I 'd give it a try myself .
I used NeoOffice , which is a Mac port of Open Office , and it looks very good .
I did try Inkscape , even upgrading my X11 install to the latest version of XQuartz , but it just refuses to run .
Here 's , my first attempt :
It 's certainly better than my earlier attempts , but I think it still needs some magic from Jonathan .
Several people also recommended OmniGraffle , which looks good , but is not cheap and is n't cross-platform .
Given my skill level I think OO offers me everything I need .
Whilst we 're on the subject of Mac software , I 've also been using a few new programs recently .
Pixelmator Having created the diagram in Neo Office , I used Pixelmator to edit the Tiff graphics file .
I think I got Pixelmator included with one of the recent MacHeist bundles .
It seems like a very capable program for basic image editing .
MPlayer Yet another Open Source video player .
I 've been trying to play some high quality mkv ( Matroska ) files encoded with H.264 .
Neither Quicktime nor VLC ( usually excellent ) could play it .
MPlayer is n't as polished as VLC , but plays them fine .
Xee Nice little program for image viewing .
Much nicer than Preview ( which is part of Mac OS X and great for PDFs ) .
Cornerstone A shiny commercial Subversion front end .
I 'm trying out the demo version .
It seems great so far .
I also tried Versions ( also in Beta ) , but it does n't let you work with existing working directories ( you have to checkout through the Versions UI ) - so I did n't get very far .
Transmit Nice FTP , SFTP ( etc ) client for the Mac.
Again , commercial but worth it .
I could n't find another client that had a ' 2 - pane ' UI , except for FileZilla which just refuses to work on my computer .
It dies with an odd error that few other people seem to have , and the fixes suggested for them does n't work for me .
Octave Engine Casual
A new and very funky physics engine from a Japanese developer .
Absolutely pointless , but very fun - and very slick on the Mac ( and Windows ) .
Chmox A CHM reader .
The CHM ( Compiled Help Manual ) format for documentation is popular on Windows , and with reason as if well done it can make for very usable docs .
Chmox has n't been updated for a while , but seems to work fine .

South Ossetia and Abkhazia have had de facto independence for years US President George W Bush has urged Russia not to recognise Georgia 's two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states .
Mr Bush 's comments came after Russia 's parliament passed a non-binding motion calling on President Dmitry Medvedev to support the enclaves ' independence bid .
Meanwhile , the US says its warships will deliver aid to Georgia 's port of Poti , which is under Russian control .
The move could mean US and Russian forces coming face - to - face .
Although most of Russia 's forces pulled out of Georgia last Friday , some troops continue to operate near the Black Sea port of Poti , south of Abkhazia , where Russia says it will carry out regular inspections of cargo .
Georgia has accused Moscow of trying to impose an economic stranglehold on Georgia .
Until now American aid has been delivered to the Georgian port of Batumi , further south .
But the US embassy said that " at the request of the Georgian government " , two US ships would dock in Poti on Wednesday .
Georgians ' moved out ' Russia and Georgia fought a brief war this month over Georgia 's two breakaway provinces .
They are clearly trying to empty southern Ossetia [ of ]
Georgians
Alexander Stubb , OSCE
S Ossetia ' emptied of Georgians ' Moscow launched a counter - attack after Tbilisi tried to retake South Ossetia from rebels by military force .
The US and a number of Western governments have backed Georgia , sending aid and issuing strongly - worded statements .
In a statement , Mr Bush called on Russia 's leadership to " meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions " .
" The United States will continue to stand with the people of Georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity , " he said .
The US state department has said recognition of the two provinces ' independence would be " a violation of Georgian territorial integrity " and " inconsistent with international law " .
Leaders from Germany , the UK and Italy also expressed concern that the vote would raise tensions further in the Caucasus .
Meanwhile Alexander Stubb , the head of the European security organisation , the OSCE , has accused Russia of trying to empty South Ossetia of Georgians .
He told the BBC that OSCE military observers were trying to visit as much of South Ossetia as possible to clarify the situation .
The US McFaul has so far only delivered aid to Batumi " They are clearly trying to empty southern Ossetia [ of ]
Georgians , which I do n't think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations , " he said .
Large parts of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia have effectively been independent since breaking away in the early 1990s .
While they have enjoyed Russian economic and diplomatic support , and military protection , no foreign state has yet recognised them as independent states .
On the ground , Russian troops continue to operate in buffer zones that Russia controversially set up within undisputed Georgian territory .
France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy said at the weekend that , under the terms of the ceasefire he had helped broker , troops from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) would move into these buffer zones .
But senior Russian officials now say they never agreed to allow international peacekeepers to patrol in the zones , and also say they will not allow aerial reconnaissance over the zones .
' Hitler ' comparison
The upper house , Federation Council , voted 130 - 0 to call on President Medvedev to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The lower house , the State Duma , approved the same resolution in a 447 - 0 vote shortly afterwards .
It 's a historic day for Abkhazia ... and South Ossetia
Sergei Bagapsh , Abkhazian leader
Nato - Russia links ' should remain '
The Federation Council speaker , Sergei Mironov , said both Abkhazia and South Ossetia had all the necessary attributes of independent states .
During the debate in the two chambers , several speakers compared Georgia 's military action in South Ossetia with Hitler 's World War II invasion of the Soviet Union .
Both Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh and his South Ossetian counterpart , Eduard Kokoity , addressed the Russian lawmakers before the votes , urging them to recognise the independence of the two regions .
" It 's a historic day for Abkhazia ... and South Ossetia , " Mr Bagapsh said , adding that Abkhazia would never again be part of Georgia .
Mr Kokoity thanked Russia for supporting South Ossetia during the conflict with Georgia , describing President Medvedev 's move to deploy troops as " a courageous , timely and correct " decision .
He said that South Ossetia and Abkhazia had more rights to become recognised nations than Kosovo , which declared independence from Serbia earlier this year with support from the US and much of the European Union .
Both houses of the Russian parliament are dominated by allies of Mr Medvedev and Mr Putin .
The lawmakers interrupted their summer holidays for extraordinary sittings , formally called at the request of separatist leaders in the two Georgian provinces .
In a televised address , President Saakashvili dismissed the vote , saying : " Nobody can legalise the annexation of the Georgian territories . "
While both Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been pushing for formal independence since the break - up of the Soviet Union in the 1990s , Russia 's official line at least until now has been similar to that of the West , the BBC's Humphrey Hawksley reports from Moscow .
But in March the State Duma passed a resolution supporting independence should Georgia invade or rush to join Nato .
After Monday 's votes , the bill will be sent to the Kremlin for approval .
Analysts say the Kremlin might delay its decision while it carries out wider negotiations with the West on the crisis .
Should Abkhazia and South Ossetia be independent ?
Can normal life ever be resumed in Georgia ?

When General Taguba talks about this issue will the media listen ?
Remember when Sy Hersh reported that the General was one of the casualties of the Abu Ghraib ?
How Antonio Taguba , who investigated the Abu Ghraib scandal , became one of its casualties .
When we first started talking about torture on C&L and much of the liberal blogoshere we were called anti-American , traitors , unpatriotic and the like .
The White House and their media enablers like the Bill O'Reilly 's proclaimed that Abu Ghraib was only a few bad apples .
Nothing to see hear so move along little sheep .
Well , the evidence is flooding in that refutes this nonsense and now I 'd like to ask them something .
Who is the traitor to America ?
Who has been unpatriotic ?

Starr :
One thing perhaps worth noting in this report , heidi , is the forward , the preface to the report was written by retired major general Anthony Teguba .
He 's the army general that led the investigation into the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .
in this report the general says , " there is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes . "
The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held into account .
pretty tough words from a man very well regarded inside the army when he conducted the investigation into Abu Ghraib .
For its part , the pentagon continues to say that it deals with detainees in a humane fashion , that there is no policy towards torture , and if there was any misconduct , any abuse , it was in violation of government policy .
but this report clearly a pretty damning indictment if it stands on its own .
I 'd like all those that went out of their way to attack us to come out and apologize to us , our country , our soldiers and the victims of this abuse known as torture .
Barbara Starr gave this report on CNN .
There should be numerous investigations for war crimes on Bush Co. and everyone involved .
The sooner the better .

Mrs Stuart - Kelso said Murphy 's return was a wonderful surprise A snatched garden gnome has been returned to his owner with a photo album picturing him in 12 countries he had visited with his kidnapper .
Eve Stuart - Kelso said she was stunned to see her leprechaun Murphy standing outside her Gloucester home seven months after he disappeared .
He was also carrying a note putting his world tour down to " itchy feet " .
The album shows Murphy abseiling down a mountain , standing in a shark 's mouth and riding a motorbike .
Some of the pictures show a group of mysterious young men , who could be the ones responsible for the globetrotting stunt .
Also with Murphy were immigration stamps for all the shores he had been taken to visit - South Africa , Swaziland , Mozambique , New Zealand , Australia , Singapore , Thailand , Cambodia , Vietnam , China , Hong Kong and Laos .
There 's more to life than watching daily commuter traffic
An extract from Murphy 's letter
Read the full letter
The gnome , whose " travelling companion " is referred to only as The Bear , said he attracted unwanted attention from customs officials and took up 25 % of the party 's luggage allocation .
" There 's more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you , " the letter said .
The bizarre crime echoes the French film Amelie starring Audrey Tautou in which a gnome belonging to Amelie 's father is taken around the world and photographed to show him how much he is missing out on in life .
Grandmother - of - three Mrs Stuart - Kelso said : " The leprechaun went missing many , many months ago and I had forgotten about it .
Murphy was photographed in 12 countries including Thailand
In pictures " Then I opened the door on Thursday and saw he was back .
It was such a shock .
" I thought , ' Well , it 's a bit of mischief but at least he has n't been put through the window . '
She said the gnome had been quite badly damaged and although she wondered if the tightly wrapped parcel next to him might explode , her curiosity eventually overcame her alarm .
" Then I saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up , " she said .
" His feet were missing , but that 's no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain .
" It was the strangest gift I have ever received .
" I just keep thinking how funny it is .
It makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels .
It was a wonderful surprise and of course it 's so nice to get some good news . "
A Gloucestershire police spokeswoman said there had been no report of a gnome going missing but said : " Any theft of a person 's property , even if it is carried out as a joke , will be treated as a crime by police .
" What may seem like a laugh to one person can cause distress to another . "

Ex -CFO at garage charged in $ 3.9 million theft
The former chief financial officer of a nonprofit that runs a garage in Golden Gate Park could serve more than 14 years in prison for allegedly embezzling more than $ 3.9 million from the agency , prosecutors said .
Greg Colley was fired in February after his bosses at the nonprofit , the Music Community Concourse Partnership , discovered that he had taken millions of dollars .
The embezzlement came to light when the contractor that built the underground garage called the nonprofit 's director , Richard Bingham , to complain that he had not received a payment .
When confronted , Colley told officials that he had played - and lost - the money in the stock market .
Prosecutors said that Colley impersonated two officers at the nonprofit to transfer money from the nonprofit 's bank account to his personal account between 2006 and 2008 .
At an arraignment last week , he pleaded not guilty to embezzlement , money laundering and identity theft .
He was arrested in Salem , Ore. on Aug. 1 and was extradited to San Francisco several days later ; he remains in jail with bail set at $ 1.5 million .
If convicted , Colley could spend nearly 15 years in prison , face a fine of $ 10,000 and be ordered to pay restitution .
Suspicion over the collapse of Bear Stearns is centring on a massive options trade , less than two weeks before the historic investment bank went under in March , by which a single investor made a profit of more than $ 270 m ( £ 141 m ) on a bet against the company 's share price .
In a " whodunnit " that has gripped Wall Street for months , many traders and senior executives at Bear Stearns have become convinced the firm was brought down by a conspiracy of rivals and hedge funds , who spread malicious rumours and ultimately triggered a collapse in confidence among its trading partners .
These conspiracy theorists received new evidence yesterday , with news of an extraordinary bet placed in the derivatives market on 11 March , near the start of the week when rumours of Bear 's financial problems snowballed .
By 14 March , the Federal Reserve was having to extend emergency funding as Bear 's customers deserted .
On 16 March it was sold at a fraction of the previous share price to JPMorgan Chase .

The derivatives trade involved put options that gave purchasers the right to sell 5.7 million Bear Stearns shares for $ 30 each on 20 March , and 165,000 shares for $ 25 each also on 20 March , according to Bloomberg data .
The options cost the anonymous investor $ 1.7 m .
That was less than half the $ 62.97 price at which Bear Stearns shares were trading on 11 March , suggesting the investor was confident the stock was going to crash .
Many traders said yesterday such a big , short - term bet would be highly unusual , even for a hedge fund .
Others , though , pointed to the 158 per cent return to suggest it was a bet with a reasonable risk - reward ratio .
Bear Stearns executives first heard rumours on 10 March which were suggesting the company faced a liquidity crisis , and business television began reporting the company 's denials that day .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed trading records and email archives at dozens of Wall Street banks and hedge funds to see if people with a financial interest in Bear 's demise were spreading rumours they knew to be false .
At the shareholder meeting that agreed the firesale to JPMorgan , Jimmy Cayne , Bear 's chairman , told shareholders he believed a " conspiracy " was behind its collapse and said he hoped the authorities would " nail the guys who did it " .

The Short Run
What Housing Crisis ?
Katelyn Saner
Even as the U.S. housing market plummets and millions face foreclosure , the mega - rich continue to build lavish mansions .
In Los Angeles 's " platinum triangle " of Beverly Hills , Bel - Air , and Holmby Hills , at least 20 homes larger than 20,000 square feet are slated to begin construction in 2008 , according to the Los Angeles Times .
One local realtor told the Times that the mega - rich " keep adding the rooms [ they ] think [ they ] need .
The ballrooms .
The screening room .
Masters with his and hers and a beauty salon and a massage room .
And the house keeps growing .
... a gift - wrapping room ... a florist room . "
For the director of an area nature conservancy , the trend is all about ego : people design these homes " so everyone will know — aha — there is the richest person on the hill . "
While the rich may be unaffected by mounting economic woes , analysts predict that the nation 's real estate markets wo n't boom again until at least sometime after 2020 .
If these mega-mansions are the product of an economic downturn , imagine ( if you dare ) those that would be built during a boom !

Another Palin Investigation Kicks Off in Alaska
Created : September 04 , 2008 18:21 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
ANCHORAGE —
In case trooper - gate ’s not enough , Gov. Sarah Palin , the GOP vice presidential nominee , has another investigation on her plate .
The police officers union in Alaska has filed a complaint on behalf of Mike Wooten , a state trooper and Palin ’s former brother - in - law , who Palin is accused of trying to oust over a long - time family feud .
Since being tapped for the veep spot , Palin has lawyered up and is no longer cooperating in the investigation .
Via MSNBC :
The complaint alleges that the governor or her staff may have have improperly disclosed information from Wooten ’s personnel records .
The complaint alleges “ criminal penalties may apply . ”
John Cyr , director of the union that filed the complaint , told NBC News , “ It seems obvious to us somebody has improperly accessed [ Wooten 's ] personnel file . ”
The complaint alleges that a phone recording in which Palin aide Frank Bailey pressures Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to push out Wooten shows that his file was misused .
Palin ’s campaign responds saying that Palin ’s husband , Todd Palin , gave Bailey the information , all of which first appeared in public divorce records .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Wall Street , in shaping corporate America , has become just like it .
Brokerages and banks are bought and sold .
Thousands of jobs are created and lost in every turn of a cycle that 's spinning ever faster .
Firms have lost their character and style .
They have become indistinguishable .
They sell commodity services .
Everyone does initial public offerings , syndicated loans and bonds , and they all provide strategic advice to corporations .
In a rush to do everything , most Wall Street firms are n't known for anything .
It was n't always such a grind .
The Street used to be a place where relationships mattered , the rise and fall of markets were less dramatic , and company cultures were as colorful as the ethnic neighborhoods of New York .
There were the rowdy guys at Salomon Brothers , the bond guys at Lehman Brothers , the rough - and - tumble Bear Stearns Cos. bankers , the Catholics at Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % , the WASPs at J.P. Morgan & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % and the elitists at Lazard Freres .
There was a dark side to all of this , too .
Women and minorities were scarce .
If they did manage to cross the threshold , they were treated with contempt .
Finance was an old boys ' business , and highballs and cigars were their calling cards .
Wall Street was exclusive , but not in the way it 's exclusive today .
Imagine people like Dick Grasso and Jimmy Cayne , neither of whom finished college , or Stanley O'Neal , who rose up from the floor of an auto plant , making it on today 's Wall Street .
Instead , the top jobs are now held by people such as Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Vikram Pandit , who attended private schools in Mumbai and then earned a doctorate in finance at Columbia University , or J.P. Morgan chief Jamie Dimon , who went to the exclusive Browning School in New York and Harvard Business School .
They are smart guys , and , while Pandit has n't been on the job too long , Dimon is a proven leader with the confidence of his troops .
They are more than capable as executives .
But they are also job - hopping mercenaries .
Both have worked at multiple firms .
Some might say moving around is good because it gives a leader a more complete worldview .
They are also considered more objective and less likely to spare sacred cows .
A skeptic might argue that Dimon , Pandit and Morgan Stanley 's MS , - 2.35 % John Mack diminish the existing culture of a firm and send a signal to the rank and file that there 's no use in staying loyal to the company .
Thainisizing Merrill
No executive embodies this new kind of financial world than John Thain .
The CEO of Merrill Lynch , Thain , 53 , is at his this third major Wall Street firm in five years .
Expected to follow Henry Paulson as chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS , - 1.14 % in 2003 , Thain instead bolted for the New York Stock Exchange .
Less than four years later , Thain left behind NYSE Euronext NYX , a global and publicly owned conglomerate of markets .
He eliminated remnants of the not - for - profit exchange : the dining room , the shoe shine , the in - house barber .
He threw out tradition in favor of economic efficiency and pitted the NYSE against its archrival , Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. NDAQ , - 3.18 % , in a race for market share across the globe .
In short , he made stock markets another commodity .
Today , Thain is shaking up Merrill Lynch .
He 's cut jobs and undercut shareholders through capital raising .
Thain is considering the sale of Merrill 's stakes in BlackRock Inc. BLK , - 0.68 % and Bloomberg L.P .
These were sacred cows even for Thain 's predecessor , O'Neal , who was accused of destroying Merrill 's culture by slashing jobs and streamlining the company .
Contrast Thain and O'Neal with David Komansky , who graduated from the University of Miami , joined Merrill as a broker in 1968 and rose to CEO in 1997 .
He was shown the door in July 2001 .
A couple of years later , O'Neal remarked : " I think clubs have their place , but not in modern commerce . "
Partners to public
Thain and O'Neal are n't the first of their ilk , and they wo n't be the last .
Guys like Cayne , Richard Fuld at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH , and , to some degree , Charles Prince at Citigroup C , - 2.12 % are the last of an old guard of top managers who rose through the company and ran each division to gain experience .
The idea was that each particular company did business in a certain way .
Now , companies all do business the same way , and your education at X firm is good at Y .
In the mid-1980s , Wall Street began a slow evolution into the bland mess it is today .
Partnerships dissolved into public companies .
Bear Stearns went public in 1985 , Morgan Stanley in 1986 .
Lehman had its IPO in 1993 .
Those were bad enough , but when Goldman Sachs went public in 1999 and Lazard Ltd. LAZ , +1.59 % finally succumbed in 2005 , the industry 's biggest names had all become subject to the whims of shareholders .
Combined with the mergers that created the big banks and brokerages , Wall Street has taken its own medicine .
Those culture clashes we used to hear so much about -- the kind that were supposedly going to derail Credit Suisse 's acquisition of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette -- are an afterthought these days .
These new firms may be leaner and meaner .
They may be more nimble .
They may be better positioned to compete with the rising financial powers overseas .
Big investment banks have done unto themselves what they 've done to the rest of corporate America : made it sterile .
The new Wall Street is n't a bad place , but you might not recognize it .
It all looks the same .
2020 is likely to be the most significant election in a generation .
If you 're an adult US citizen it 's important that you ( yes , ) register to vote and then vote by November 3 , 2020 .
Several states are purging voters from their rolls , and efforts are being made to make voting by mail unreliable .

Observers ask :
What 's with all the white women in anti-Obama ads ?

The handful of white women fawning over Barack Obama in John McCain 's latest attack ad hardly seems an accident , nor does the Republican 's decision to include the line , " Hot chicks dig Obama . "
Some observers say the Web video is a not - so - subtle attempt by McCain to play on white voters ' racial fears , comparing the attack to the infamous " call me " spot attacking African American Democrat Harold Ford in his unsuccessful Senate run two years ago .
Predictably , conservatives are rushing to McCain 's defense , saying that the accusations of racism coming from some on the left are far worse than the underhanded racism McCain is accused of deploying .
A McCain adviser tells ABC's Jake Tapper , who counts four white women professing their Obama love in the vid , that the campaign 's intention was only to point out that " the kids think he 's dreamy , " apparently ignoring any suggestion of racial overtones .
" Why do you think they put so many young white women professing their love for Obama in what is clearly an anti-Obama video ? "
Tapper asks .
" What would possibly be negative about young white women liking Sen. Obama ? "
After McCain released his first " celeb " ad juxtaposing Obama and Britney Spears and Paris Hilton -- two young white celebrities known as sex symbols -- the Republican faced similar accusations that he was trying to play upon miscegenation fears .
While any implication in the first ad was far less overt , accusations of racism that time around seem to have inoculated the McCain campaign from more overt condemnation of its latest ad , allowing conservative defenders to simply dismiss any criticism as more of the same .
Provoking such consternation may even be the whole point , one right - wing blogger thinks .
So , why does McCain put them in there anyway , if libs like Jake Tapper are going to freak out over it ?
Duh -- because he WANTS THEM TO FREAK OUT OVER IT .
When they freak out , it creates controversy .
Controversy creates views of McCain 's YouTube videos which hit Obama on the issues -- taxes , for example -- and also hammer home the meta - meme that Obama is a substanceless puffball who is n't qualified to be President of the United States .
Indeed , McCain 's first round of ads mocking Obama as a celebrity and " the one " seem to have had some effect .
Even beyond the racial implications , they do seem to have raised some doubts among older voters that Obama is just the candidate of frivolous youngsters .
Obama , who 's on vacation in Hawaii this week , has not received quite as much traction with his TV and Web ads hitting McCain .
Some see a double standard in the media 's treatment of McCain and wonder what would happen if Obama was as aggressive in attacking the Republican 's most obvious vulnerabilities .
" Had Obama run ads calling McCain a senile old adulterer married to a drug addict we'd never hear the end of it from McCain and the corporate media , " says AMERICAblog 's John Aravosis .
" But McCain continues this sleazy bizarre attack on Obama and where is the media ?
Why are n't they all asking McCain every single day why he lied about never going negative ?
Why he 's given up on being a maverick ?
Why he no longer talks to the media ?
Why his campaign days have grown so short ?
Why he no longer seems to even be in charge of his own campaign ? "
McCain released the following ad Monday evening :

1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10 .
( CNN ) -- About 1,600 Hurricane
Ike evacuees from the Texas coast headed home on state - chartered buses Monday after spending the week in shelters in the Fort Worth area .
Workers on Sunday prepare to remove a sailboat washed up onto a Galveston highway by Hurricane Ike .
A fleet of 35 buses picked up evacuees at shelters in a four - county area around Fort Worth and began a four - hour trip to Houston , Beaumont and Baytown , according to Cecilia Jacobs , chief communications officer for the city of Fort Worth .
" Those areas are primarily where we had guests from , " she said , referring to Ike evacuees .
At the height of the evacuation , 24 shelters were operating in the Fort Worth area , Jacobs said .
Evacuees in those shelters , and in shelters scattered throughout Texas and beyond , have begun heading home in recent days , and by Monday , when the bus fleet set out , only 11 shelters were still open in the Fort Worth area , Jacobs said .
She said state and local officials decided to take evacuees back to Houston , Baytown and Beaumont in south Texas because authorities had determined those areas safe to reopen , and shelters were waiting there for evacuees " to help them transition back into their homes . "
Watch how rebuilding may be a difficult task »
Meanwhile , in Ike - ravaged Galveston , officials said residents could return to their homes on a permanent basis Wednesday , but the mayor emphasized that they will find few comforts .
Galveston has little or no electricity , natural gas , water or sewer services .
There are no medical facilities , there is limited cell - phone coverage and a curfew is in place from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Violators risk a $ 2,000 fine , Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said Saturday .
Residents of Galveston Island 's heavily damaged west end were able to return as of noon Monday to assess damage , but they were told they must must leave the area by 6 p.m. , said Danny Weber , Galveston 's mayor pro-tem .
" We encourage you to come down , look , and then please leave , " he said .
Galveston took a direct hit when Ike barreled ashore September 13 as a Category 2 storm .
Despite orders to evacuate , about 20,000 of Galveston 's 60,000 residents opted to remain in their homes .
Many of those who left went to shelters .
A search - and - rescue effort on the island is finished , and 50 residents are missing , City Manager Steve LeBlanc said .
Thomas said residents can begin returning for good at 6 a.m. Wednesday .
Residents and business owners must show photo identification verifying their address to guards manning checkpoints , she said .
Dr. Mark Guidry , head of the Galveston County Health District , urged residents who have " any medical condition that requires frequent care and the possibility of hospitalization " to delay their return until the island 's public health and medical infrastructure are in better shape .
Guidry also urged parents to keep their children away until debris fields have been cleared .
Anyone who chooses to return , Guidry said , should have plenty of hand sanitizer ; thick , long - sleeved shirts ; long pants ; protective gloves and footwear ; face masks ; mosquito spray ; bleach and other cleaning supplies ; first - aid kits ; charged cell phones ; full tanks of gas ; and bottled , boiled or treated drinking water .
He said returnees will find " enormous " traffic congestion , since many traffic lights do n't work .
The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston has " only the most rudimentary of medical resources , " warned Dr. Joan Richardson , the institution 's emergency preparedness officer .
" We have no capability of hospitalizing anyone , as we have no hospital beds that are open , " Richardson said .
Anyone requiring anything beyond basic first aid will be stabilized " as best we can " and flown off the island , she said .
LeBlanc urged anyone returning home to refrain from turning on gas or electricity before ensuring there are no leaks or electrical shorts .
He said special care should be taken in houses flooded by more than 10 or 12 inches of water -- the height of wall plugs .
" You do n't want to turn on the electricity , because there may be corrosion in those circuits , and it may start a fire , and we have limited fire protection , " LeBlanc said .
Any gas meter or regulator that was submerged must be replaced , LeBlanc said .
Regulators , which reduce pressure from gas lines entering the house , may not work after being submerged , resulting in the flow of too much gas , he said .
" If that 's the case , and there was a leak , you could have a serious fire and an explosion , " LeBlanc said .
Some 400 to 500 law enforcement officials are on the island to maintain order and to enforce the curfew , he said .
All About Hurricane Ike • Texas • Weather
Illustration by David Simonds
“ NATION shall speak peace unto nation . ”
Eighty years ago , Britain 's state broadcasters adopted that motto to signal their hope that modern communications would establish new bonds of friendship between people divided by culture , political boundaries and distance .
For those who still cling to that ideal , the latest trends on the internet are depressing .
Of course , as anyone would expect , governments use their official websites to boast about their achievements and to argue their corner — usually rather clunkily — in disputes about territory , symbols or historical rights and wrongs .
What is much more disturbing is the way in which skilled young surfers — the very people whom the internet might have liberated from the shackles of state - sponsored ideologies — are using the wonders of electronics to stoke hatred between countries , races or religions .
Sometimes these cyber- zealots seem to be acting at their governments ' behest — but often they are working on their own , determined to outdo their political masters in propagating dislike of some unspeakable foe .
Consider the response in Russia to “ The Soviet Story ” , a Latvian documentary that compares communism with fascism .
If this film had come out five years ago , the Kremlin would have issued an angry press release and encouraged some young hoodlums to make another assault on Latvia 's embassy .
Some Slavophile politicians would have made wild threats .
These days , the reaction from hardline Russian nationalists is a bit more subtle .
They are using blogs to raise funds for an alternative documentary to present the Soviet communist record in a good light .
Well - wishers with little cash can help in other ways , for example by helping with translation into and from Baltic languages .
Meanwhile , America 's rednecks can find lots of material on the web with which to fuel and indulge their prejudices .
For example , there are “ suicide - bomber ” games which pit the contestant against a generic bearded Muslim ; such entertainment has drawn protests both in Israel — where people say it trivialises terrorism — and from Muslim groups who say it equates their faith with violence .
Border Patrol , another charming online game , invites you to shoot illegal Mexican immigrants crossing the border .
From the earliest days of the internet the new medium became a forum for nationalist spats that were sometimes relatively innocent by today 's standards .
People sparred over whether Freddie Mercury , a rock singer , was Iranian , Parsi or Azeri ; whether the Sea of Japan should be called the East Sea or the East Sea of Korea ; and whether Israel could call hummus part of its cuisine .
Sometimes such arguments moved to Wikipedia , a user - generated reference service , whose elaborate moderation rules put a limit to acrimony .
But e-arguments also led to hacking wars .
Nobody is surprised to hear of Chinese assaults on American sites that promote the Tibetan cause ; or of hacking contests between Serbs and Albanians , or Turks and Armenians .
A darker development is the abuse of blogs , social networks , maps and video - sharing sites that make it easy to publish incendiary material and form hate groups .
A study published in May by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , a Jewish human - rights group , found a 30 % increase last year in the number of sites that foment hatred and violence ; the total was around 8,000 .
Social networks are particularly useful for self - organised nationalist communities that are decentralised and lack a clear structure .
On Facebook alone one can join groups like “ Belgium Does n't Exist ” , “ Abkhazia is not Georgia ” , “ Kosovo is Serbia ” or “ I Hate Pakistan ” .
Not all the news is bad ; there are also groups for friendship between Greeks and Turks , or Israelis and Palestinians .
But at the other extreme are niche networks , less well - known than Facebook , that unite the sort of extremists whose activities are restricted by many governments but hard to regulate when they go global .
Podblanc , a sort of alternative YouTube for “ white interests , white culture and white politics ” offers plenty of material to keep a racist amused .
Tiny but deadly
The small size of these online communities does not mean they are unimportant .
The power of a nationalist message can be amplified with blogs , online maps and text messaging ; and as a campaign migrates from medium to medium , fresh layers of falsehood can be created .
During the crisis that engulfed Kenya earlier this year , for example , it was often blog posts and mobile - phone messages that gave the signal for fresh attacks .
Participants in recent anti-American marches in South Korea were mobilised by online petitions , forums and blogs , some of which promoted a crazy theory about Koreans having a genetic vulnerability to mad - cow disease .
In Russia , a nationalist blogger published names and contact details of students from the Caucasus attending Russia 's top universities , attaching a video - clip of dark - skinned teenagers beating up ethnic Russians .
Russian nationalist blogs reposted the story — creating a nightmare for the students who were targeted .
Spreading hatred on the web has become far easier since the sharp drop in the cost of producing , storing and distributing digital content .
High - quality propaganda used to require good cartoonists ; now anyone can make and disseminate slick images .
Whether it's a Hungarian group organising an anti-Roma poster competition , a Russian anti-immigrant lobby publishing the location of minority neighbourhoods , or Slovak nationalists displaying a map of Europe without Hungary , the web makes it simple to spread fear and loathing .
The sheer ease of aggregation ( assembling links to existing sources , videos and articles ) is a boon .
Take anti-cnn.com , a website built by a Chinese entrepreneur in his 20s , which aggregates cases of the Western media 's allegedly pro-Tibetan bias .
As soon as it appealed for material , more than 1,000 people supplied examples .
Quickly the site became a leading motor of Chinese cyber- nationalism , fuelling boycotts of brands and street protests .
And then there is history .
A decade ago , a zealot seeking to prove some absurd proposition — such as the denial of the Nazi Holocaust , or the Ukrainian famine — might spend days of research in the library looking for obscure works of propaganda .
Today , digital versions of these books , even those out of press for decades , are accessible in dedicated online libraries .
In short , it has never been easier to propagate hatred and lies .
People with better intentions might think harder about how they too can make use of the net .
Revenge by creosote : Builder wrecks county cricketer 's flat after wife confesses affair
Believing his wife had been having an affair with a county cricket player half his age , John Matthews felt there was a score to settle .
So the 50 - year - old builder went round to the Somerset batsman 's house and ' undid ' all the improvements he had recently carried out .
Matthews had been employed by Neil Edwards , 24 , to carry out some work on his new flat - and had a set of keys to the property .
But a month ago , ' blinded by anger ' at the alleged affair , the father of three went into the flat , sawed his supposed rival 's bed in half , poured creosote on the furniture , scratched his plasma TV and poured expandable foam down the lavatories and bath .
Anger : Husband John
Matthews used the tools of his trade for revenge
Batsman : Neil Edwards ' toilet was filled with expandable foam
Then he left a note at the £ 200,000 property informing his target that this was just the beginning .
In it , he said his wife Pamela , 48 , had confessed to an affair .
' If you play with fire you can expect to get burned , ' he wrote .
Matthews caused about £ 9,000 of damage at Edwards 's two - bedroom flat , in Taunton .
It has been uninhabitable since .
This week , a court heard that Matthews had considered Mr Edwards a family friend who had been kind enough to invite his wife and daughter to cricket matches in Taunton .
But Matthews was later told that the relationship had gone further .
He told police : ' Edwards had been having an affair with my wife and I tried to put an end to it .
I still had a door key from when I carried all the work out there and I decided to undo all the work I had done .
Allegations : Wife Pamela is at the centre of affair claims
' I pulled down the curtains and took down a mirror .
I was going to smash the toilets with a sledge - hammer .
I went to the van to get a Stanley knife to cut up the curtains and I noticed I had some creosote in there .
If I had n't had it there I would n't have used it .
' I poured it on the bed and I cut it up because I did n't want him using it , and I poured some more on the settee .
' I filled the toilets with expanding foam but a piece fell off the foam gun and chipped the bath .
That is how it was broken , I did n't mean to do it .
I may have scratched the television accidentally .
I was blinded with anger . '
Prosecuting , Jeremy Oliver told Taunton Deane Magistrates ' Court how Mr Edwards found a note nailed to his front door , reading : ' Pam has told me all about the affair .
I told you I would smash you and your house if it carried on . '
In his statement to the police , Mr Edwards , a former England under - 19 player , who was playing for Somerset against South Africa at the time of the crime , said he previously got on well with Matthews and his wife .
But more than a year ago he became aware of rumours circulating in his home town of Penzance , Cornwall , that he and Mrs Matthews were having an affair .
The court was told Mr Edwards had no interest in her ' in that way ' and denied any affair , although it also emerged that Mrs Matthews and her daughter visited him at the flat .
Matthews pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage .
He was released on bail and will be sentenced this month .
Samuel Cooper , defending , said : ' Mr Matthews and his wife are trying to pursue their marriage once more .
This was an unfortunate chapter which happened at a time which was not a happy episode in their lives . '
Matthews and his wife , who live together in Penzance , and have been married 27 years , declined to comment .
" It is important that children learn about this and its links to wider world history , such as the American civil rights movement - the repercussions of which are still being felt today .
That is why the slave trade will join the British Empire , the two world wars and the Holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this September . "

Download the Python ( 2.5 ) source distribution from http://www.python.org/
Build Python from sources with MSVC 2005 Express , in both Debug and Release configurations .
For this , go to the directory PCBuild in the source distribution and double click on the .sln file ( Visual Studio will ask to convert it , since Python 2.5 was built on Windows with MSVC 2003 ) .
Select Debug and build solution .
Then the same for Release .
Some libraries fail to build - this is normal .
These are usually bindings to extra thing you have to install ( Tk addons , bz compression , Berkley DB libs , etc ) .
Python works fine without them .
Now , following the documentation instructions , I copied the \PC \example_nt directory , opened the solution contained in it , modified the Include and Linker Library directories path back to the source distribution , and built the solution .
example .pyd is created , and can be loaded and used by the Python interpreter .
I 've successfully created a C extension for Python , basically following the instructions given here .
For the compilation , I used the free Visual C++ 2005 Express ( internal version 8.0 )
The exact steps I followed are : Phew , this was much easier than I expected .
It 's another chance to appreciate the work that has been into Python to make it more friendly for Windows users .
You do n't even have to install the source distribution of Python to compile extensions .
The binary distribution on Windows has the Include and libs / directories that contain everything necessary to compile the extensions in Release mode .
It is still recommended to have the source distribution handy , though , because it comes with a lot of examples and code from standard extensions to learn from , and you can use it to compile the extensions in Debug mode and run them with a Debug version of Python itself .
news Is This The Most Awesome House in Toronto ?
There ’s a real estate company called Prestige Living , founded earlier this year by 22 - year - olds Philip Sywash and Casper Larski .
As the company name suggests , it ’s an upscale - only kinda deal , with houses — well , mansions — starting at $ 1 million .
A vast majority of the houses offered are classy and sophisticated , just what you ’d expect and hope for on the outskirts of Toronto for the deep - pocketed .
And then there ’s 2400 Doulton in Port Credit , Mississauga .
Currently on the market for $ 10 million , and thus Prestige ’s most expensive listing , it features four bedrooms , ten bathrooms , and some fantastically strange design touches that are either the mark of a rich evil genius or a fourteen - year - old starchitect wannabe .
See for yourself if you do n’t believe us .
From " rainbow breath " to incredible weight gain via donuts , here are 7 superhero powers the world does n't need .
1. The Power to Eat Things
If you 're desperate for heroes with mediocre superpowers , look no further than the Legion of Super - Heroes , the 30th - century superhero squad that started out in 1958 .
Packed with uninspiring members , the legion featured the likes of Bouncing Boy ( who could bounce around like a ball ) , Chlorophyll Kid ( who could make plants grow faster ) and Dream Girl ( who could tell the future through dreams ) .
But the strangest of all was Matter - Eater Lad , who just ate things .
Matter - Eater Lad's finest moment was stopping an indestructible machine from destroying the universe " ¦ by eating it .
The storylines were that good .
In 1993 , DC Comics decided that the character was too silly for the newer , grittier style of comics , and he was rewritten as the Legion 's personal chef , who did n't really get involved in the combat .
2. Fighting Nazis by turning them into Doves
During WWII , male comic book heroes were n't the only ones pounding on Hitler and throwing punches at Nazis .
A few female supers joined in the fight as well .
One such character , hidden in the pages of Quality 's Military Comics ( 1941 ) , was a young , pretty reporter named Joan Dale who gained her patriotic powers after a visit to the Statue of Liberty .
Gazing upon the national symbol , she wondered : " Gosh !
Just think of all the GOOD a person could do if they had the POWERS that the Statue of Liberty must possess !! " 
While we 're not certain which idiot tipped the savvy reporter off on the statue 's magical powers , Lady Liberty hears the wish , visits Joan in a dream , then grants her superpowers to aid American troops in the raging world war .
Or at least , that 's what she believes .
So does this newly created Miss America get to beat up Nazis like the boys ?
Not exactly .
Her main power seemed to be turning bad guys into doves .
The confusing bird trick proved a little dull for most comic book fans , and the Miss America storylines were promptly ignored .
In a very brief comeback in 1984 , it was revealed that the whole time Joan Dale could actually control molecules , meaning that she could do practically anything !
Why she 'd wasted everyone 's time turning Nazis into doves , however , was never explained .
3 . The Power to Talk Loudly
If Black Bolt told a joke , he 'd bring the house down .
Of course , if he said anything at all , he 'd bring the house down .
As King of the Inhumans , a mysterious super race based on the moon , Black Bolt packs a great set of lungs .
So great , in fact , that he causes utter destruction with his " quasi - sonic "  scream , even with the faintest whisper .
As a result , the soft - spoken superhero usually keeps quiet , speaking only when he needs to destroy things .
While it might seem like an inconvenient power , old Bolty does n't seem to mind .
When he is n't occupied with superheroics , he quietly rules his kingdom with his wife , Medusa , who no doubt can't believe her luck : a husband who wo n't talk back !
The books have yet to reveal what happens when he gets the hiccups .
4. Detachable Body Parts
Since the 1940s , there have been no less than seven superheroes called Captain Marvel .
But the strangest might be the one briefly published by M.F. Publications in 1966 .
As a robotic superhero , Captain Marvel could will his body parts in different directions , just by yelling the command : " Split ! "
This allowed him to fight numerous villains in various locations all at once .
His feet would separate and karate kick evil - doers , while his left and right hands would be jabbing and punching in different parts of the room .
Presumably , he could also use his torso to hip - check villains , Black Knight - style .
It was never really made clear how any villain worth their salt could be overcome by a disembodied finger or foot " “ and since the comic has n't been published for over 40 years , we 'll probably never know .
Although robot Captain Marvel is the least famous of the Captains Marvels , he has n't been forgotten .
Some readers view the books as camp classics .
5. Rainbow Breath
Admittedly , I have no idea what this does , but according to the text " “ when used with other powers like " X - ray strength "  , " speed - squared "  and " shame - vision "  " “ it 's " enough to topple most 21st century Western economies . " 
Maybe , but the Lucky Charmed halitosis still sounds pretty dumb .
Rainbow breath is just one of the 1,204 super - powers ( including " nuclear poop - vision "  and " larynx - freezing vision "  ) that belong to Seth , a monstrous , genetically - engineered hillbilly who fights the influential superhero team The Authority ( published by Wildstorm Productions ) in 2002 .
So , how do you take down a force like Seth ?
The superhero squad finally beat him by finding his failsafe mechanism and transforming him into seven chickens ( yes , seven chickens ) , all of which were then eaten by his own family .
6. Donut Power
Fat Momma was one of the final two contestants in the first season of the Sci-Fi Channel 's " reality "  show Who Wants to be a Superhero ? in 2006 , but was defeated in the end .
No doubt , several parents " “ concerned for their children 's health " “ were relieved .
Fat Momma was Nell Wilson ( both in the comics and in reality ) , who got her power from eating large quantities of donuts .
Unfortunately , her powers are exactly what you 'd expect from such a source .
She can become super - heavy enough to plummet through buildings to catch bad guys on the ground floor .
When angry , she can grow to five times her size .
And when she 's eaten too much , she can deafen enemies with her " Super Burp "  .
Her weakness ?
Diet food , which causes her to shrink .
This biggest loser became something of a celebrity , and even though she did n't win Who Wants to be a Superhero ? , she was given her own comic book , in which she says " When ever you pick on a poor innocent child you 'll have to deal with " ¦ FAT MOMMA ! " 
Unless , of course , they know how to climb staircases .
7. Super -Whatever : Superman's Stupid Powers
We can't let this list pass without mentioning the most famous of all superheroes : Superman .
Famous he might be , but consistent he is n't .
With most heroes , you know what you 're getting .
Superman , however , has whatever powers make it easiest for the writers to get him out of whatever predicament he is in .
You know about his super - strength , super - speed , ability to " leap buildings in a single bound "  ( and more impressively , fly ) , even his X - ray vision and his freeze breath .
But in the 1940s , for one comic only , he escaped an alien prison by merging himself with the wall .
Then he molded his face to look like one of the aliens , and convinced them to go home .
Convenient ?
Sure , but that is n't the half of it .
In his radio serial , Superman could walk through walls and split into two Supermen " “ only when necessary , of course .
And who can forget the 1980 movie Superman II , where he was able to wipe Lois Lane 's memory of his secret identity with " ¦ a kiss !
Super convenient .
Superman 's most ridiculous power , however , emerged in the 1970s , when a monstrous villain demanded to fight him , just as Clark Kent was meant to be reading the news on live television .
What did he do ?
He grabbed one of his colleagues and used " super - hypnotism "  to make the guy think that he was Clark Kent .
The hapless guy then put on his glasses and read the news , while Superman went out and battled the monster .
Presumably , all the TV viewers were fooled as well .
Comic - book readers , however , must surely have known that they were witnessing one of the biggest rip - offs in comic - book history .
Whether defying the dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine so he could publish a book on world health or challenging the titans of cosmology , Robert Lanza has never followed the script .
It ’s no wonder , then , that this renegade doctor would lead the charge into medicine ’s most controversial turf : the creation of cloned embryos for therapy and the engineering of spare human parts .
The value of therapeutic cloning has long been clear to Lanza , who did his early work with South African heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard .
Starting from those early days , Lanza understood that the barrier to tissue transfer was rejection by the recipient .
From an entire organ to a dose of embryonic stem cells , if the tissue ’s DNA came from anyone else , the transplant would be rejected without the aid of harsh immunosuppressive drugs .
“ The treatment could be worse than the problem , ” Lanza found .
But embryonic clones , the source of an endless supply of stem cells imprinted with one ’s personal DNA , could alter the equation in favor of the patient and augur a paradigm shift in medicine on par with the changes brought about by antibiotics and vaccines .
Lanza ’s single - minded quest to usher in this new age has paid dividends in scientific insights and groundbreaking discoveries .
Today a world force in the field of regenerative medicine , he ’s close to delivering cellular therapies that might reseed the immune system , heal damaged hearts , even save limbs .
Yet for almost 20 years government policy has kept his innovations literally on ice .
He has been called a murderer for tampering with embryos , and personal threats were so common at one point that he believed he would be killed .
Enduring tough times and fighting for his beliefs suit Lanza well .
He grew up poor in the Rox­bury section of Boston and , later , suburban Stoughton , where he had a difficult relationship with his mother and was distanced from his professional gambler father .
Year round , Lanza says , he was rarely allowed inside his own house except to eat dinner and sleep .
With nowhere else to go , he spent his youth roaming the nearby wilderness immersed in nature ’s mysteries .
Though initially labeled “ slow ” at school , in 1969 Lanza distinguished himself by transferring genes from black chickens to white ones when he was just 14 , a mere three years after scientists cracked the genetic code .
That extraordinary early feat , eventually published in Nature , signaled a raw scientific talent that his mentors ( who came to include Jonas Salk and B. F. Skinner ) likened to Einstein’s .
In a 2001 article , U.S. News & World Report called Lanza the “ living embodiment ” of the fictional genius in the movie Good Will Hunting , whose Massachusetts accent is as thick as Lanza ’s own .
Today Lanza lives on an island in a small Massachusetts lake , keeping a veritable museum of fossils and dinosaur bones and surrounded by the nature he cherishes .
DISCOVER senior editor Pamela Weintraub interviewed Lanza at his Worcester office .
You have always bucked authority , have n’t you ?
In the real world , people had a different plan for me , the boy from Roxbury with a family so rough and lacking in education .
There would be fights .
The police would be called .
The Stoughton public school system had three classes in elementary school : A , B , and C . I was put in the C class with the kids throwing spitballs at the teachers , the ones who had been held back .
How did you cope ?
There was a golf course nearby , so I earned money by collecting and returning golf balls .
When I had saved $ 18.95 , I had enough to mail - order a little squirrel monkey , sitting in the palm of a woman ’s hand , that was advertised in the back of Field & Stream .
I sent in my money and forgot about it , but a year later I came home from school and there ’s this monkey in the middle of the kitchen , tied up inside a box with these pellets in it .
“ Stay away ; it will attack , ” my mother said , but here was this little teeny baby squirrel monkey .
It was sneezing ; it had a cold .
I went up to it and it just curled up .
And it became my best friend .
It was just like a little person — little fingerprints , everything .
It was actually smarter than a lot of my friends .
Back then I was on my own .
I went into ponds to get snapping turtles .
I would go out for miles in the middle of the winter , using footprints to track raccoons .
I fell through the ice on a pond 15 miles from civilization up to my waist when it was below zero .
I would go up in trees and catch little screech owls in their holes .
I ’d go on long excursions trying to figure out how the universe worked .
Even at that early age , I was in awe and wonder of the world .
A squirrel monkey and nature sustained you .
Was that enough ?
Fortunately , I also had a neighbor , Barbara O’Donnell , and her husband , Eugene — wonderful people .
If I brought a bug to them , they ’d buy me a magnifying glass ; if I found a bird egg , they ’d get me a book on birds .
Every now and then you run into an extraordinary human being who does things selflessly , and Barbara O’Donnell was like that .
When a black family moved in next door , the neighborhood tried to stop it , but Barbara interceded .
She always fought for what was right .
They say that you incorporate the superego structure of your parents .
Well , not my parents , but hopefully I ’ve incorporated Barbara ’s and Gene’s .
Today my colleagues and the [ Catholic ]
Church and the president and even the pope can attack me and it ’s just like , you know what ?
I ’ve seen a lot worse .
Say what you want .
I ’m doing what I think is right .
It ’s lucky that you were able to find such kindness and support .
Yet school officials still kept you in the C class ?
When I was in the fifth grade , my teacher realized that I did n’t fit in the C class and encouraged me to do a science project , so naturally I did it on animals , and my best friend , Steven , did his on rocks .
He won first prize and I won second .
That was my first entry .
That ’s when I began to feel I should n’t have been pegged because of my family circumstance , and that people should be able to prove themselves .
I take it that ’s what you did to prove yourself .
Every year after that I did a science project , and in the eighth grade , Barbara O’Donnell , my neighbor , became my science teacher .
If not for what she did for me then , I would n’t be here today .
She arranged for me to be in the honors biology class in high school , something that was actually open only to the students at the top of the A division .
It caused chaos because I leaped over all these people ahead of me .
“ In this one honors class , biology , they ’ve got this loser .... What is this the rats dragged in ? ” I was determined to prove them wrong .
So I hatched an idea to win the whole science fair , something that only seniors had done .
My plan was to alter the genetic makeup of a white animal and make it pigmented .
The genetic code had been cracked only three years earlier , in 1966 .
Still you planned what amounts to genetic engineering .
My honors biology teacher told me it was impossible .
That made it a challenge .
I saved up nickels and dimes from the golf balls and took a bus and trolley to Harvard ’s Countway Library of Medicine .
I ended up finding an article on extracting nuclear protein [ containing DNA ] from cells using ethanol .
Barbara drove me to a farm to get eggs laid by pigmented chickens and we tracked down another farm to get eggs from white Plymouth Rock chickens .
I still remember trying to get the equipment .
I went to the hospital and talked them into giving me syringes .
Another hospital gave me penicillin so my animals would n’t get infected , and I found a guy who worked at one of the state labs who had a centrifuge and chemicals in his basement — that ’s where I extracted the DNA .
But most of the work I did at home .
My mother would not allow me to have anything in the house , so I found an unfinished back room next to the furnace in the basement , and there , in a little corner , I built an incubator for the white chicken eggs .
At a very early stage , I introduced the pigmented genes into the white embryos with a syringe .
Which , of course , was very problematic because I had to figure out how to make the eggs so you could see where the right spot was , and most of ’em you would kill or they would die .
There I was trying to alter the genetic makeup of a chicken , and my mother ’s talking to a neighbor saying , “ Oh , yeah , Robby is trying to hatch chicken eggs . ”

Did it work ?
Some of the white chickens were born with patches of pigmentation .
But to truly prove it , I had to make my experiments blinded and controlled .
What I needed was to do these experiments more correctly , not in my basement , and now I ’m thinking , “ OK , I really need to talk to someone who understands this stuff .
So I ’m gonna go to the greatest place on the planet , Harvard Medical School , and I ’m gonna talk to a Harvard doctor .
Now it ’s time to take this up a notch .
We ’re gonna get serious . ”
Did you make an appointment ?
Oh , no .
I did n’t even know where I was going .
I ’m walking around asking people how to find Harvard Medical School .
I had no clue .
I finally find it , with all that granite and slab stairs worn from the generations of people coming and going .
My endorphins are flying .
I go to the front door and the guard would not let me through .
I ’m not giving up that easy .
I went all around the building trying all the doors , but everything ’s locked .
So I stood by some Dumpsters trying to look inconspicuous until someone came by — this little short guy , bald , with khaki pants and a bunch of keys in his hands .
I figured it was the janitor .
So he opens the door and I just sort of slip in .
He keeps walking , but about halfway down the corridor he turns around and says , “ Can I help you , sir ? ”
“ No .
I ’m looking for a Harvard doctor , ” I said .
Now , what I did n’t know was that this was Steven Kuffler , chair of neurobiology .
Instead I told him that I was friends with a janitor who lived down the street from my house and that I worked at the school cafeteria washing plates .
I ’m from the underprivileged class too , I said .
He knew I thought he was the janitor .
He said , “ Why are you here ? ” I said , “ Oh , it ’s got to do with nuclear protein and inducing melanin synthesis in albino chickens . ”
I could see that I was impressing him .
He has no idea what DNA is , [ I am thinking ] .
Finally he said , “ Well , I think I know someone who can help you . ”
I remember him bringing me up in the elevator , past all the spaghetti wire , all that neurobiology equipment and circuits — it was so awesome and impressive — right to Josh Sanes , who now runs the brain center at Harvard .
He was just a grad student at the time , putting probes in caterpillars and looking at their neurons .
I talked to Josh all day .
Eventually they invited me back to repeat the experiments correctly .
The paper was ultimately published in Nature in 1974 .
Every now and then the janitor would show up and I was so excited to see him .
It was only later that I found out who he was .
So what happened back at the high school ?
The teacher gave me a C and everyone else got an A .
He did n’t like the way I wrote it , but the grade was changed after I won the state science fair .
The night of the science fair , my mother tried to stop me from leaving .
“ You ’re not going anywhere , ” she said .
Barbara was out front honking the horn , waiting to give me a ride .
I said , “ Ma , I ’m going .
I do n’t care what you say . ”
This was the first time I rebelled like that .
I remember her breaking down in tears .
When I arrived , the whole gymnasium was overflowing out the back door .
Then they went from the bottom up , fourth grand award , third grand award .
And then I was first grand award , and I noticed my mother was in there — she did show up at the end .
Then I got the Massachusetts Medical Society Award , and The Boston Globe gave me an award .
That was my vindication that I was n’t stupid .
You got to the Ivy League , and soon you were working with heart transplant surgeon Christiaan Barnard .
How did that happen ?
At the University of Pennsylvania , I was in the University Scholars Program .
We could take any classes we liked as undergraduates , so I started taking medical school classes in 1975 .
It was a wildly exciting time for heart transplant medicine , so I wanted to go to South Africa to work with Christiaan Barnard .
I wrote to Barnard , and he said , “ Yeah , you can come . ”
It was fascinating but horrific .
Some of the heart transplant patients had run out of their immunosuppressive drugs ; they could n’t breathe .
They were in wheelchairs .
Their bodies were rejecting the organs and they were dying with their families all around them .
Anyway , I came back to Philadelphia with a whole pile of papers coauthored with Barnard .
Obviously you did n’t go into surgery .
What came next ?
By the time I graduated from medical school , heart transplant surgery had become conventional , so I moved to Los Angeles and did something I ’ve never told anyone else about : I spent a couple of years rolling pennies and eating canned spinach and pasta while I tried to understand the universe , an effort I felt had reached a dead end .
Dropping everything to spend years thinking about cosmology could be called self - indulgent .
For me it was the equivalent of hiking around Europe — I was hiking through the universe , and I needed the intellectual freedom to just think .
I ’ll tell you , putting the puzzle together is not trivial , but after two years I had a new theory of the universe .
Your book on that work , called Biocentrism , cowritten with the astronomer Bob Berman , will be out soon .
In it you propose that our current theories of the universe will never work unless they account for life and consciousness .
Can you explain ?
Look at this coffee cup .
You say it ’s right there , but the truth of the matter is you ca n’t see that through your brain .
Your brain has a bone around it .
What is happening is that what you see is reconstructed in your mind .
We have these words space and time , but you ca n’t touch them .
They ’re not objects , they ’re not things , they go forever .
Space and time are really tools of animal sense perception , the way we organize and construct information .
You have suggested that reality is determined by the conscious observer .
Most physicists view consciousness as an accident .
There was a paper published in Science this February , and what it showed was that if you do an experiment with a photon , put it in the apparatus , that what you do right now actually changes an event that already occurred in the past .
Now is n’t that bizarre ?
That is the same universe that you and I are in .
How can the physics in this experiment actually show that if you do something right now it retroactively changes an event that has already happened ?
You can play your little games with it , but any way you cut the pie , if you observe something it acts as a particle , and if you do n’t it acts as a wave .
It is not an artifact of the system .
Those experiments are real .
Get over it .
You ’ve said physical laws are exactly balanced for life to exist .
If there were one - billionth of a difference in the mass of the Big Bang , you could n’t have galaxies .
If the gravitational constant were ever - so - slightly different , you could n’t have stars , including the sun , and you would just have hydrogen .
There are 200 parameters like this .
We now have people out there talking about an intelligent design , saying “ God ” is the explanation .
But it is really because quantum theory is right : Everything is observer - determined and the past and present are relative only to you , as the observer .
It all fits , but the problem is , you then do need to accept what people will not accept :
When you turn your back to the moon , it no longer exists .
Despite the cosmic uncertainty , you went on to pursue a most tangible goal .
Considering my small role in the universe , I thought I could best apply myself to trying to treat or even cure diabetes , and possibly other diseases that affect the health and lives of millions .
Instead of transplanting whole organs like the heart , I decided to work with cells — from a biocentric viewpoint , the fundamental units of reality and the bedrock of our observer - determined world .
The person I approached was Patrick Soon - Shiong , a UCLA professor who was trying to transplant the insulin - producing cells called islets as a treatment for diabetes .
The hurdles there were similar to those we faced with heart transplants : overcoming a shortage of tissue and preventing rejection .
NULL | Michael Lewis
What was the strategy ?
At first I thought we could isolate islets from cadavers or animals and protect them from rejection by putting them in little capsules .
We managed to get around that with our first patient , a Boeing executive with pancreatitis .
He had to have his pancreas removed , and instead of throwing his gland away , we took it back to the lab and got maybe 50,000 to 100,000 of these insulin - producing cells .
We injected the cells back into his portal vein and they took up home in the liver and the guy was fine .
It made a lasting impression on me because what it meant was that if you could deliver a person ’s own cells , you would eliminate the risk of rejection , and you could give the patient insulin - producing cells without the need for insulin injections for the rest of his life .
How did you get from islet cells to embryonic ones ?
Around 1990 , when I was still at UCLA , I was approached by BioHybrid­ Technologies in Shrewsbury , Massachusetts .
At first I thought , “ Why would I leave sunny California to go back to the rain and slush and snow ? ”
But I went out for the interview and the president , a brilliant man named Bill Chick , asked me what would make me happy .
I threw out what I thought was a preposterous figure for a salary , and when I got home there was a message saying it had been accepted .
I did n’t realize at the time that it was below the market rate .
At the company Christmas party I met his daughter , and she said , “ So you ’re the one with the tacky tie .
You ’re the one my father stole . ”
It turned out that Chick had suffered from diabetes since childhood .
Now he was dying , but he wanted to save himself by using the encapsulation method I had proposed at UCLA .
It was a race against the clock — Bill had so much angioplasty and heart surgery he was being glued together .
After a while we actually succeeded in dogs .
We got islet cells from the pancreases of healthy dogs , encapsulated them , and transferred them to diabetic dogs , who became insulin independent .
That ’s when I learned about Dolly , the sheep cloned by the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh , Scotland , and I said , “ Aha !
That ’s it . ”
If you can create an embryo genetically identical to the adult — that is , a clone — you can harvest immune - compatible cells to replace any tissue you might want without fear of rejection .
In essence the clone would supply stem cells to the parent ?
Right .
You can do all kinds of tricks with embryonic stem cells , but if they come from another individual , you still have the problem of rejection .
You still need powerful immunosuppressive drugs that cause cancer .
My idea was to clone the sick individual , not for reproduction but for therapy .
The stem cells produced through this therapeutic cloning would , like other embryonic stem cells , be capable of developing into many cell types and serve as a repair system for whatever part of the body required replenishment at the time .
You solve the rejection problem , and you have unlimited amounts of tissue .
I tried to convince Bill to try this , but he would n’t budge .
In the end he had strokes and did n’t know what was going on .
He died in 1998 in front of my eyes .
Then I learned there was a cloning company right up the street from BioHybrid that was the top in the world , called Advanced Cell Technologies , or ACT .
It was almost like fate .
By then I was attached to Massachusetts .
I ’d bought a little island , where I lived .
I had all my fossils and dinosaur bones there , and I had landscaped it .
My island had swans ; it had a beaver and a beaver den 10 yards from my door .
I wanted to stay around .
So you went to ACT and asked for a job ?
Before they would hire me , they gave me a task that was like bringing back the witch ’s broom .
There was a question about whether the National Institutes of Health would allow the work .
Even though this was for therapy and not reproduction , it still involved cloning embryos , and the public was totally against it .
Many considered it murder .
So I was asked to get all the Nobel laureates in the country to sign a letter to support embryonic stem cell research , addressed to Harold Varmus , the head of the NIH .
This was in the old days , when everything was by fax .
Actually , I had this whole drawer of all the letters signed by 70 Nobel laureates .
The effort was published in Science , and a few months later , many college presidents also signed on .
At the time , ACT was a subsidiary of a poultry genetics company , doing work in agriculture .
When I joined they made the move from animal cloning to human therapy , and we knew we would get hit , big - time .
I may be the only person who ’s had the [ Catholic ]
Church , the pope , and a couple of presidents condemn my work .
At one point we had bodyguards here .
There was a bombing up the street ; then a doctor at a local in vitro fertilization clinic was targeted .
I did n’t think I would be alive for more than a few years .
And you , alone on your island , were so vulnerable to attacks .
I would go for a walk , listening for sounds .
I was one of the most visible people in cloning and yet I was isolated .
I figured there was more than a 50 percent chance that I would be knocked off .
But I wanted to go out trying .
I ’ve always followed my heart .
Can you describe the original groundbreaking work at ACT ?
We injected human DNA from an adult cell into an egg from which the nucleus had been removed .
We managed to clone early - stage embryos that grew to four or six cells in size .
This was obviously far short of getting stem cells , which require a blastocyst [ an embryo with a larger cluster of cells ] .
In fact , even to this day , a decade after the cloning of Dolly , scientists still have not cloned human embryos developed enough to generate patient - specific cells .
You ’ve been exploring other ways of producing patient - specific cells .
What are they ?
We recently published a paper on a cell we created called a hemangioblast , which exists only transiently in the embryo but not in the adult .
I think of them like unicorns , these elusive cells that we had hypothesized and sought for years .
With the ability to become all of the blood cells — including your immune cells , red blood cells , all of your blood system , as well as vasculature — hemangioblasts have been biology ’s holy grail .
What we discovered is that we can create literally millions or billions of these from human embryonic stem cells .
Now that we have them , we are harnessing , for the first time , one of nature ’s early , most profoundly powerful cellular building blocks .
The point is , we can use transient , intermediate cells like hemangioblasts as a toolbox to fix the adult so you do n’t have to have limbs amputated , so you may not have to go blind , to prevent heart attacks .
We can direct their development into different cell types by adding certain molecules to them as they divide .
How does it work ?
We found that when we injected these cells into a damaged , is­che­mic limb , there was almost 100 percent restoration of blood flow in a month .
Before , the limb would have been amputated , but now it was restored .
As to heart attack , injection of the cells cut the death rate in half .
Since these cells give rise to the immune system , what about using them to treat autoimmune diseases ?
There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases .
What ’s interesting is that when you do a bone marrow transplant for cancer , some of those with autoimmune disease go into remission , as if the immune system has been eliminated and allowed to rebuild from scratch .
Using hemangioblasts that are the progenitors of the immune system , we ’re hoping we can replace the immune cells too .
Are there other , intermediate embryonic cells that might , in similar fashion , give rise to the nervous system or brain ?
Yes .
The way to think of this is that you have a tree with branches that give rise to all of the different tissue types of the body .
The hemangioblast , for instance , gives rise to one branch — to blood cells , vessels , and the immune system .
But there are also neural stem cells as well as early progenitors that have this plasticity in most of the other systems of the body .
Right now we ’re trying to discover how to isolate and expand them .
You ’re a bit limited using just cells .
You started out with Christiaan Barnard transplanting hearts .
To realize the full potential of stem cells , we must learn to reconstitute them into more complex tissues and structures .
So if we want to make an artery or bones or even an entire kidney or a heart , we need to learn to assemble and grow them on a biodegradable scaffold , which the body can later absorb .
In one study we used the cells to make little kidneys that even produced urine .
The urine had concentrated creatine or urea , meaning the kidneys were actually removing toxic materials from the blood .
Entire bladders have been grown this way .
Other researchers are doing bones , heart valves , and cartilage for joints .
This seems like lifesaving technology on an unprecedented scale , yet the work has been stymied by politics .
It must be frustrating to have these cells sitting around the lab , in storage , when you could be helping people .
Four years ago I was driving to work , going up a hill on a quiet little road with a speed limit of 15 miles an hour .
I was in a rush and whirled into the parking lot , and there ’s this police cruiser next to me .
I almost hit it .
“ Oh , jeez , now I ’m screwed , ” I thought .
I went into my office , started working , and a few minutes later a scientist from the next office over comes in and says , “ Bob , there ’s a police officer out there who wants to see you .
He has handcuffs and a gun . ”
The whole lab is thinking he ’s there to arrest me .
He says , “ Dr. Lanza , could I speak to you in your office ? ” so I brought him in .
It turns out that I had just published a paper showing that we could create human retinal pigment epithelial cells capable of restoring visual function in animals .
The officer had a 16 - year - old son who would go totally blind in two years without the therapy .
By the time he finished his story , I was almost in tears because we had these cells and they had been frozen at that point for nine months .
Why could n’t you take them out of storage to help the boy ?
We did n’t have $ 20,000 , which is what we needed to do the preclinical studies required for working with people .
At that point , our phones had been turned off .
We did n’t have a fax machine .
I could n’t even afford bottled water for my pipettes .
The point is , there is just no funding because basic research is generally funded by the government and the government will not fund stem cell work .
What else are you storing , still unfunded , in the vault ?
We have cells that reverse paralysis in sheep that have spina bifida and can’t walk .
After we injected our cells , the first animal that we treated returned to normal and was walking fine .
The same model could work for paralyzed humans , but without funding , we have n’t been able to repeat the experiment in five years .
People are in wheelchairs when there could be a cure .
A few years ago a woman contacted me .
In the course of chemotherapy for a tumor , something must have been activated , and for some unknown reason the glial cells in her cerebellum had started to degenerate .
She was a lady with all these kids .
Slowly she started to lose her ability to talk .
She began to use a walker .
She got worse and worse , and then , not long ago , she died .
You could have helped her ?
Yes , we have cells that probably could have helped her with a single injection .
One of her sons kept coming and asking , “ Is there anything you can do ? ”
But we did n’t have the resources to go through the process at the FDA .
It ’s heart wrenching to see this happening , knowing that this work is being held up .
Amid all this , are you still trying to achieve your first dream , harvesting embryonic stem cells from human clones ?
We ’re continuing this work , but with less urgency since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells — adult cells that have been reprogrammed back to an embryonic state .
We ’re working on new ways to reprogram skin cells that would allow us to safely create a bank of stem cell lines that would closely match the population as a whole .
It turns out that only 100 cell lines could give you a complete haplotype , or immune , match for 50 percent of the U.S. population .
These reprogrammed cells are not as controversial since you do n’t use cloning or embryos .
What do these technologies portend for human longevity ?
It turns out that the human life span plateaus as it approaches a roof of about 120 .
By eliminating infectious diseases , some chronic diseases , and cancer , we can get the life span past 100 .
I think with tissue engineering we can patch you together like a bicycle tire , replacing a kidney with a kidney and a heart with a heart , to about 120 years .
That was always my thinking :
That was the limit .
But with these hemangioblasts , I now have questioned my own rules .
These cells can go in and fix the damaged tissue inside , almost like nanoparticles .
We may be able to do the same thing with similar cell lines for neurons , where we can repair the damage in the brain itself .
So if it continues the way it ’s going , we may break that ceiling , like breaking the sound barrier .
I ’d be very hesitant to put a lid as to where longevity is going to go .
You ’re launching the future of medicine , but it is still on hold .
Rather than curing disease , we ’re trying to get around theological problems .
It ’s not what I signed up for in medical school .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve thrown my hands up and said , “ Enough , I ca n’t take it anymore , ” but then I ’m back the next day .
We ’re crippled , but they ca n’t stop us forever .
We ’ve now got enough irons in the fire and hopefully ways to bypass many of these objections .
But it ’s just a shame that the research has been held up so long .
We ’re living through a paradigm shift .
People are going to look back at us and say , “ They used to cut people ’s legs off . ”
Then they ’ll just give an injection and the blood flow will be restored and the limb saved .
If I were a patient and I knew I was going to have my leg cut off and something could be done , I would be demanding it .
But most people , even most scientists , do n’t realize what we ’re capable of .
I realize it because I ’m doing the work and I can see what ’s possible before my eyes .
Me : “ Thanks for calling *** , how can I help you ? ”
Customer : “ My phone service is n’t working . ”
Me : “ Okay , I ’ll see what I can do .
What wireless company do you have ? ”
Customer : “ I do n’t have wireless . ”
Me : “… I ’m not sure I ’m following you , ma’am . ”

Customer : “ AT&T . ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry , but we do n’t contract AT&T wireless in the store . ”
Customer : “ Look , lady , it ’s not WIRELESS .
My HOME PHONES are n’t working , and I ca n’t get a hold of my son and I ’m worried .
The service has been on the fritz all day .
I need you to FIX IT ! ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry , ma’am , I ca n’t fix your home phone service .
You ’ll have to call your provider . ”
Customer : “ What are you , stupid ?
I bought the phone from you ! ”
( She probably had bought the telephone through us , because we sell some made by / for AT&T .
But we do n’t do the service at all . )
Me : “ Ma’am , we do n’t do the service .
We are just the phone retailer .
Is there something wrong with the phone itself ? ”
Customer : “ NO .
It works fine , but I ca n’t actually CALL anywhere .
Now , I need this FIXED .
I ’ve been without a phone all day , every phone in the house is messed up , and I can’t call my SON .
I do n’t have a phone at ALL !
Do you understand ? ”
Me : “ Yes ma’am , I do , but like I said , we have nothing to do with your service .
We just sell the PHONES .
You have to call AT&T to see what ’s wrong with your service . ”
Customer : “ And just how am I supposed to do that , smarty - pants ?
I DON ’T have a PHONE that WORKS ! ”
Me : “ With all due respect , ma’am , how did you call US ? ”

Did your child walk and talk early ?
Does she have a brain like a sponge ?
Scribble magnificently ?
Love learning ?
Ask questions that leave you marveling ( and scrambling to Google an answer ) ?
You can't make your child be gifted , but you can help your kid reach his or her potential .
Wow , clearly she 's a genius !
Or , um , maybe not .
" Gifted " has become one of the most tossed - about words in the parenting lexicon .
Unfortunately -- sorry , but let 's get this out of the way right up front -- it 's also one of the most misused .
The vast majority of children are not gifted .
Only 2 to 5 percent of kids fit the bill , by various estimates .
Of those , only one in 100 is considered highly gifted .
Prodigies ( those wunderkinds who read at 2 and go to college at 10 ) are rarer still -- like one to two in a million .
And despite the boom in infant - stimulation techniques , educational DVDs , learning toys , and enrichment classes , those numbers have n't been increasing .
You can't build giftedness ; it 's mostly built in .
Still , it 's hard to resist scrutinizing your child for signs of greatness .
( Those " signs " in the first paragraph , by the way ?
Not one guarantees an intellectual giant . )
The growing fascination with giftedness is part natural impulse to see our offspring as special , part wanting to be sure a child 's needs are met and maybe a bit of hoping for a competitive edge in the increasingly cutthroat school - admission process -- or bragging rights .
Parenting.com : Homeschooling a gifted child
" There are no average kids anymore , " noted Devra Renner , a clinical social worker and coauthor of " Mommy Guilt . "
" The word ' good ' is like the new ' bad . '
Why settle for even ' smart ' when you could instead call your child ' gifted ' ? "
True giftedness may be as rare as Einsteins and Mozarts , but the good news is that there 's loads you can do to help your child reach her full potential .
Even better :
Whether young children are truly advanced or happily average ( where they have lots of company ) , in the early years they need pretty much the same things .
To raise a happy , emotionally healthy kid , follow these five steps to success :
1. Forget about the " g " word
There 's plenty of wishful thinking about giftedness because there 's no standard definition of it .
Broadly speaking , a gifted child has special abilities in a particular area .
The five main ones outlined in a popular 1993 U.S. Department of Education report are intellectual , academic , creative , artistic and leadership , none of which is normally associated with the performance of babies and toddlers .
" ' Gifted ' is often misunderstood , " said Julia Roberts , director of the Center for Gifted Studies at Western Kentucky University .
" People do n't always recognize a gift because they 're expecting a prodigy . "
And parents whose kids are " highly capable " or " advanced " in one area or another may not feel satisfied until somebody official labels it " gifted . "
Many parents of kids under 5 look to IQ tests for a number that will " prove " their child 's ability .
In truth , IQ testing does n't tell you much before the school years and even then is generally considered unreliable .
Why ?
Because " giftedness " is typically concentrated in one area and does n't refer to overall intelligence , the focus of an IQ test .
( If you 're going to use it for academic placement -- as many schools do , among numerous other factors -- testing between ages 4 and 9 is optimal . )
2. Start with the basics
In the first three years of life , all children need to feel a sense of security and attachment .
Being held , being loved and having one 's basic needs met are all critical for future learning .
The growing brain next needs stimulation in order to change and develop .
One thing it loves : novelty .
Every time your baby is exposed to new toys , words , sounds , textures , tastes , smells , faces and places , she 's learning .
You do n't have to work overtime to make this happen ; everything in everyday life is new to a baby .
By late infancy and toddlerhood , some kids do dart way ahead on milestone charts , and some do n't .
Whether your kid does or does n't , experts say , all babies , toddlers and preschoolers will thrive as long as they are :
• Provided a predictable life with a reasonably ordered environment .
• Held and touched often .
• Talked to ( or sung to ) often .
• Read to frequently .
• Exposed to interesting experiences .
• Given many opportunities to learn through play .
3. Play 's the thing
What even chart - busting toddlers and preschoolers do n't need are special " gifted " programs or learning tools such as flash cards , educational DVDs or brain - building computer games .
There 's no evidence that this " edu- tainment " does anything to boost children 's intellectual ability .

Will your preschooler need a tutor ?
Most educators believe that kids do n't benefit from academically oriented preschools , either .
Far more important is having opportunities to explore without constraint -- and teachers and parents who know how to keep learning fun .
" When it 's fun and playful , that 's when it gets into your head , " said Robin Schader , Ph.D. , parent resource advisor for the National Association for Gifted Children .
Neuroscience research confirms that pleasure is what makes our brains want to repeat and remember an activity , and it's that kind of natural repetition that fuels learning .

What babies learn through play
This helps explain why play is everything to young children .
It 's how they learn , experiment , tinker , express creativity , work through feelings , practice socialization , develop language and math skills , and see the world in new ways .
Pre -schools should mainly be play schools , centered on this kind of discovery learning and the teaching of basic social skills .
Many parents want their kids to start kindergarten being able to read Dr. Seuss , write their names and count to 100 .
But a kid who can do all that is actually going to have a harder time than his peers in school if he can't also sit still and listen , take turns , share and follow directions .
Those are the real skills teachers expect kindergartners to have .
4 . Tune in to your kid
If , for example , your child is very verbal , " you can make your language a little more complex , use more adjectives , " said Nancy Robinson , Ph.D. , a professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle .
" Expand a little on where the child is . "
That 's what Jackie Brezinski of Apple Valley , Minnesota , did .
She credits talking to 21 - month - old Seth and reading to him from infancy for his big vocabulary .
" I talk a lot .
I tell him what we 're doing , what we 're eating , where we 're going , " she said .
Now he wants to " read " the books to her .

Building on ability is known as " scaffolding . "
It means presenting experiences that are challenging but not overwhelming and doing it in a positive , supportive way to help the child reach the next level , higher than she could on her own , explains Schader .
For example , if your child asks about a stop sign , you can describe the sign and explain its meaning .
Point out the letters S - T - O - P. Later , you can point out an " S " on a store name and then ask if she can find some more .
Another idea for a curious , verbal child : Make Question Books .
Scatter three or four notebooks around the house .
If your child asks a question you either do n't know the answer to or are too busy to answer , say , " Let 's write it down . "
Later , you can explore the question together : find a book , go online , visit the library or a museum .

The magic of play
Enrichment does n't have to cost money .
There 's learning in practically everything you do with a young child .
5 . Be a guide , not a coach
Ultimately , the relationship between a child and his parents and teachers shapes his attitude toward learning .
Aim to be a gentle guide , not a high - pressure coach .
" Rather than ask , ' Is this kid counting better than others ? ' ask , ' Am I supporting what 's interesting and exciting to my child ? ' " said Alison Steier , Ph.D. , director of clinical training at the Arizona Institute for Early Childhood Development .
Cecilia Jerkatis says her son Kyle , 3 , keeps her on her toes as she looks for stimulating activities for him .
Yet at the same time that the mom in Albuquerque , New Mexico , wonders whether her clever , verbal boy is gifted , she also wonders whether the label matters .
" I think we 're here to support their development , whatever their interests are , " she said .
Just do n't think you have to drive yourself ( or your kid ) crazy signing him up for teams and classes to find activities he loves .
Simply exposing him to different experiences will spark things that " click . "
Build on his interests .
If he likes dinosaurs , find books and movies about them , or visit a museum .
You do n't need to sit down and " teach " anything .
Above all , do n't overfocus on cognitive abilities .
" You also want your child to be resilient , empathetic , and creative , " Schader said .
And you both want to enjoy his childhood .
" I do forget Kyle is 3 , " Jerkatis said .
" Then once in a while , he gets a little whiny , and I remember . "
So relax .
The best gift your child can have is the gift of time with you .
Reading , singing , playing , dancing , catching fireflies -- it 's all good .
The rest is gravy .

Good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
I apologise for getting you out of bed so early .
At 0500 hours this morning the combined armed forces of mankind across the globe launched a massive and sustained land , sea and air attack on the Kingdom of Heaven .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
There will be time for questions later .
As you are all aware , the world 's governments have been concerned about the true nature and ultimate purpose of God for some years now .
A being that proclaims Himself omnipotent clearly had to be watched closely - we would have been failing in our duty to protect our citizens had we not done so .
Evidence of God 's power is overwhelming .
Indeed
He has said nothing to deny it .
He has brought famine on numerous occasions .
He has inflicted plagues in the form of Aids , Sars and H5N1 .
Not a single year has passed without war raging in some corner of the globe , often with His explicit blessing on one side or the other and sometimes on both .
Tsunamis , floods and hurricanes are three more devastating weapons in the deadly armoury
He has not only developed but appears all too willing to use .
Faced with these already terrifying powers , we tasked the world 's intelligence services to establish when - not if , ladies and gentlemen , but when - He will have the capability to launch genuine weapons of mass destruction .
I refer , of course , to thunderbolts from heaven .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is my grave duty to inform you that all intelligence conclusively points to the fact that God already possesses such a capability and could launch it at a moment 's notice .
Please , please .
Be calm .
Not wishing to alarm the people unnecessarily , we have of course , up until this moment in time , kept this intelligence within the confines of the highest reaches of government .
Behind the scenes we have been attempting to negotiate with God.
Indeed , up until as recently as March of 2007 representatives of your governments were trying to open lines of communication .
We made it clear we were happy to talk either directly to God or to his Angels .
These approaches , I am sure you understand , largely took the form of silent prayer .
Unfortunately I have to report that our efforts proved fruitless .
The evidence of His presence is all around us , so He claims , yet when we want to talk to Him He is nowhere to be found .
Apparently God did not want to listen .
Though , of course , being omniscient ,
He did n't actually need to listen to be aware of our intentions .
Either that or He was in hiding .
Which seems unlikely , given that He also claims to be omnipresent .
As the world is aware , all nations are united behind the necessity of tackling the problem of God 's might before it is too late .
This , despite the fact that until recently many nations , for various reasons , have preferred not to confront Him .
Some have claimed that notwithstanding
His terrible wrath and well - documented history of visiting vengeance upon mankind , He is a force for good in the world .
Some countries - in fact , at the latest count , at least half the nations of the world - have at some time even claimed to be His Chosen People .
Yet despite countless appeals to Him , not only over the last few years , but over many centuries , to bring peace to the world , He has blatantly failed to deliver us from evil .
We now know that He even harbours terrorists .
At least , if they do not come from heaven , we know that heaven is where they go afterwards , as they are only too willing to admit .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have waited long enough .
We have given God every chance , but our patience is at an end .
I put it to you , can a being who chooses to be known under the guise of a number of different aliases ever be trusted ?
The time has come for regime change in heaven .
( interruption ) I 'm sorry ?
Excuse me a moment .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have just been informed that our mission has been successful .
The forces of the people are now in control of all key targets .
Overcoming determined resistance ... ( interruption ) ...
Excuse me , little resistance ... ( interruption ) ...
I 'm sorry , apparently no resistance at all , our forces battled ... ( interruption ) er , strolled into ... what appears to be a deserted realm .
( To aide : " What , no angels ?
No seraphim , no cherubim ?
No hosts of heavenly choirs ?
No ... souls of the eternally blessed ?
I was hoping to meet my mother again ... "
Aide : " There 's no evidence of anything , Mr President . " )
( Speaker takes sip of water . )
Ladies and gentlemen , I give you victory .
Today marks the triumph of mankind .
Heaven has fallen .
And may God save us all .
" the deliberate aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war . "
Propaganda the usual way :
" The terror of the Roman name will be such that the world shall know that , once a Roman army has laid siege to a city , nothing will move it - not the rigors of winter nor the weariness of the months and years - that it knows no end but victory and is ready , if a swift and sudden stroke will not serve , to preserve until that victory is achieved . "
- Titus Livius a.k.a Livy ( 59 BC–AD 17 , The Early History of Rome Vol. 1 - 5 ) .
MindWar :
" MindWar reverses this sequence .
Psychological means for achieving victory - essentially through convincing the enemy that he really wants to bring his national policies into harmony with ours - are fashioned in support of basic political goals .
The use of ordinary military force ( bombs , bullets , etc. ) is regarded as a last rsort in circumstances where MindWar by itself fails .
Essentially you overwhelm your enemy with argument .
You seize control of all of the means by which his government and populace process information to make up their minds , and you adjust it so that those minds are made up as you desire .
The MindWar operative must know that he speaks the truth , and he must be personally committed to it .
What he says is only a part of MindWar ; the rest - and the test of its effectiveness - lies in the conviction he projects to his audience , in the rapport he establishes with it .
In practice , however , the difference between MindWar and cynical or deceptive propaganda , from the perspective of the audience , is difficult if not impossible to perceive .
The examples of Kennedy 's ultimatum to Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis and Hitler 's stance at Munich might be cited .
A MindWar message does not have to fit conditions of abstract credibility as do PSYOP there ; its source makes it credible .
Strategic MindWar must begin the moment war is considered inevitable .
It must seek out the attention of the enemy nation through every available medium , and it must strike at the nation 's potential soldiers before they put on their uniforms .
It is in their homes and their communities that they are most vulnerable to MindWar .
Was the United States defeated in the jungles of Vietnam , or was it defeated in the streets of American cities ?
Like the sword Exalibur , we have to reach out and seize this tool ; and it can transform the world for us if we have the courage and the integrity to enhance civilization with it .
If we do not accept Excalibur , the we relinquish our ability to " inspire " foreign cultures with our morality .
If they then desire moralities unsatisfactory to us , we have no choice but to fight them on a more brutish level . "
MindWar states a whole truth that , if it does not now exist , will be forced into existence by the will of the United States .
- General Paul E. Vallely ( From PSYOP to Mindwar : The Psychology of Victory , Headquarters , 7th Psychological Operations Group , United States Army Reserve , Presidio of San Francisco , CA , 1980 ) .
The first President of the National Psychological Operations Association participant in the Pentagon military analyst program and a Fox News analyst .
In September 2003 , he took part in a Pentagon - funded tour of Iraq ... timed to help overcome the sticker shock from Mr. Bush ’s request for $ 87 billion in emergency war financing . "
He later told the New York Times , " I saw immediately in 2003 that things were going south . "
However , after returning he claimed on Fox 's " Hannity & Colmes " show : " You ca n’t believe the progress . "
Vallely is also the Military Committee Chairman for the Center for Security Policy in Washington , D.C. , and a member of the Iran Policy Committee .
He is co-author , with Thomas McInerney , of " Endgame : The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror . "
In April 2008 America learned he had been one of a dozen " military analysts " recruited by the Pentagon to spread favorable views of the failing Iraq War via the news .
General Valley is also a supporter of the Jerusalem Summit organization and an advocate of the organization 's proposal to transfer Palestine to surrounding Arab countries as a solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
He advocates military - led regime change in Iran , Syria and North Korea . "

PEMBROKE PINES , Florida ( CNN ) --
It is a few minutes after 8 a.m. , yet a steady crowd streams into the Century Pines Jewish Center , a Conservative synagogue tucked into a Broward County retirement community .
Dan Shapiro , a Middle East policy adviser to the Obama campaign , works to win voters at a Florida synagogue .
The line for coffee and bagels stretches across the room , and it's about 20 minutes behind schedule when Halie Soifer , the Barack Obama campaign 's director of Jewish outreach in Florida , grabs a microphone and starts the program .
A campaign button on her lapel says , in Hebrew , " Barack Obama ' 08 " and Soifer explains the agenda this way : " We are here today to talk about Sen. Barack Obama and Joe Biden 's record , and to ensure that Baruch Obama is elected the next president of the United States . "
Her use of the Hebrew name " Baruch " brings applause and laughter .
The heavy turnout showed Democratic enthusiasm , but several of those on hand said they were former Hillary Clinton supporters and some of their friends were still slow to warm to Obama .
Some said they wondered of Obama was perhaps too cerebral , and not tough enough to win a hotly contested race .
" He has to get specific -- and tell the American people , ' Let 's wake up , this is what is happening , ' " a man in a New York Yankees T - shirt said during a question and answer session .
" If not , he is going to lose -- he is going to lose . "
South Florida Jews are a loyal Democratic base , and critical to the party in close statewide elections in the state .
In Broward , Palm Beach and Miami - Dade counties , the Obama campaign is working aggressively to try to match or exceed the big margins put up by Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 .
Watch why Florida 's Jewish vote is so important »
But competition is intense this year , and Republicans see an opening to court these generally reliable Democratic voters .
Exhibit A in the GOP case are remarks Obama made in July 2007 during a primary debate sponsored by CNN , when he said he would be willing , in his first year in office , to sit down without preconditions with the president of Iran and other leaders of so - called rogue nations .
Republican Jewish Coalition newspaper ads call Obama 's position naïve .
Many of the Jewish voters CNN spoke to in the course of two days in South Florida reported they received mailings or phone calls reminding them of Obama 's words and other positions Republicans believe make him vulnerable with voters who put Israel 's security high on their priority list .
The Obama campaign presents a more nuanced position , saying Obama favors aggressive diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear program and other issues but would not agree to high - level meetings unless and until progress warranted such a step .
Dan Shapiro , a top Middle East policy adviser to the campaign , raised the issue in his remarks to the synagogue audience .
" You may hear and you may see ads or see rumors that Barack Obama wants to go and have coffee with [ Mahmoud ] Ahmadinejad , the president of Iran , " Shapiro said , " Not true .
Not true .
Not true .
However , as a principle he is prepared to have the United States meet directly with the appropriate Iranian leaders in properly prepared talks . "
Shapiro had strong praise for Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden , calling him a longtime friend of Israel in the Senate .
He worked in a dig at GOP running mate Sarah Palin , the Alaska governor , saying that when she was tapped by John McCain the Democratic campaign scoured the public record looking for evidence of her views on Middle East issues .
" We could n't find any , " Shapiro told the synagogue crowd .
" I was going to say the record is paper - thin , but it is kind of an insult to paper .
There is no record . "
At GOP headquarters in Delray Beach , in neighboring Palm Beach County , Jewish voters are among those on the contact lists used in a busy phone - banking operation -- a room filled on this day with home - schooled children whose parents bring them in once a week or so to help the Republican effort .
The majority leader of the Florida House , Rep. Adam Hasner , is a key McCain surrogate here , helping coordinate an outreach program he believes will make significant dents in the traditional Democratic base .
" We do know that he wants to sit down with Ahmadinejad , " Hasner told CNN in an interview .
" John McCain has a long , proven track record on his support for the safety and security of Israel and I think that is going to be very important to the Jewish community .
" And this is a year when more Jews are going to be voting Republican than ever before .
Republicans do n't expect to win the Jewish vote .
But they believe if McCain can pull 40 percent or more of the vote in Palm Beach and Broward counties he will be in good shape to carry the state because of Republican strengths elsewhere . "
At the Boca diner in Boca Raton , there is evidence of McCain inroads .
Jules Weiss says he voted Democratic in 2000 and 2004 but wo n't this time because he thinks the Democratic ticket is in the wrong order .
" It is just ludicrous to me to have a neophyte for president and the experienced one as his assistant , " Weiss said .
" That just does n't make sense .
You are not going to put an apprentice as chief executive officer of a large corporation .
He needs a lot of learning and training . "
But Ruth Goldberg says Obama will get her vote despite profound reservations .
She does not think he is ready , either , but does agree with the Democratic line that electing McCain would result in what amounts to a third Bush term .
" It is a very difficult thing , " Goldberg said .
" I really do n't want Obama , but I think that is what we have to do if we do n't want Bush again .
It is that simple , right ? "
Seven weeks to Election Day and Florida is once again in the thick of a fight that is fierce , and anything but simple .

Work to migrate Europe to the net 's new addressing system must speed up , says the European Commission .
The call to action is contained in a plan sent to the European Parliament urging governments and top websites in the region to head the migration .
It warns that internet - based innovation could be derailed as the current pool of addresses is used up .
The plan sets a target of 25 % of net users in the EU to be using the new system by 2010 .
Aiding innovation
" This is very much a case of a stitch in time saves nine , " said Viviane Reding , EU Commissioner for the information society , in a statement unveiling the plan .
Ms Reding said futuristic technologies already being adopted , such as smart tags , intelligent street lighting and heating systems , were already projected to boost demand for IP addresses 1,000 - fold - perhaps beyond the current system 's ability to cope .
Europe could face a " crisis " when the older system ran out of addresses , she warned .
Currently , Version 4 of the Internet Protocol ( IPv4 ) is used to ensure that data travelling across the net reaches the right destination .
The IPv4 scheme makes available about 4.3 billion addresses - a total predicted to run out in 2011 .
By contrast , Version 6 of this scheme ( IPv6 ) provides , in effect , an unlimited number of addresses .
The " huge address space provides a platform for innovation in IP - based services and applications , " said the commission in its plan .
The steps outlined in the plan are intended to build on the work already done to get Europe using IPv6 .
For instance , Geant , the high - speed data network linking many European research centres , is already 100 % IPv6 compatible , said the plan .
Governments should migrate their core networks to IPv6 and add a requirement for it to public procurement contracts , said the plan .
It also wants the top 100 websites in Europe to be reachable by IPv6 by the 2010 deadline .
The commander in chief of America ’s laptop bombardiers , Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol , can always be counted on to reveal not only the content of the neoconservative party line , but also , in so many words , the impulse that motivates it .
In his latest peroration from his perch at the New York Times , the intellectual architect of our disastrous war in Iraq lays out a rationale for yet another catastrophic blunder in the foreign policy realm , this time in the Caucasus :
“ In August 1924 , the small nation of Georgia , occupied by Soviet Russia since 1921 , rose up against Soviet rule .
On Sept. 16 , 1924 , The Times of London reported on an appeal by the president of the Georgian Republic to the League of Nations .
While ‘ sympathetic reference to his country ’s efforts was made ’ in the Assembly , the Times said , ‘ it is realized that the League is incapable of rendering material aid , and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon Soviet Russia . ’
“ ‘ Unlikely ’ was an understatement .
Georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991 . ”
You get the idea : in Kristol ’s world , Putin ’s Russia is Stalin ’s USSR , and poor , doe - like little Georgia  a bastion of freedom  is in danger of being devoured by the insatiable Russian bear .
Meanwhile , the world stands by , helpless , as appeals are made to a nation impervious to the very concept of morality .
To begin with , Kristol ’s historical analogy is misleading : Georgia in 1924 was very far from a democracy .
What he does n’t tell you is that it was under the control of the Mensheviks , a faction of the Russian Social Democrats ( later renamed the Communist Party ) that lost out to Lenin ’s Bolsheviks but was in fact very little different from its factional rivals .
As the British writer Carl Bechhofer described Georgia ’s Menshevik regime :
“ The Free and Independent Social - Democratic State of Georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist ‘ small nation . ’
Both in territory - snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside , its chauvinism was beyond all bounds . ”
George Hewitt , a professor of Circassian languages at London University , cites the colorful and well - traveled Bechhofer in an illuminating essay that lays out the grave error underlying American policy in the region :
“ In the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states , the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the USSR ’s constituent union - republics and would , thus , not give any encouragement to the yearning for self - determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the Soviet administrative system ( such as the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia and the Autonomous Region of South Ossetia , both lower - status entities within the union - republic of Soviet Georgia ) .
It was a huge irony that , in adopting this stance , the West was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the Soviet dictator Iosep Besarionis - dze Dzhughashvili , a Georgian known to the wider world as Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin . ”
Aside from memorializing Stalin ’s policy of imprisoning ethnic minorities within larger administrative entities , refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states allows the U.S. and the European community to maintain the fiction of Russian “ expansionism . ”
According to Washington , the Russians invaded “ Georgia ” ; Saakashvili ’s invasion of South Ossetia does n’t qualify as aggression , since how can you invade your own country ?
South Ossetia and Abkhazia are part of Georgia , you see .
Just like a small mammal is part of the anaconda that swallowed it whole .
Hewitt goes on to point out :
“ Had the Soviet Union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before Abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of Stalin in February 1931 from being a fully - fledged republic , which entered the Transcaucasian Federation on 13 December 1922 in treaty - alliance with Georgia , to that of an autonomous republic within Georgia , and had the then League of Nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor , the United Nations , then Abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community . ”
The same goes for Ossetia , which is today split into North and South , with the latter under the Georgian heel  as placed there by the half - Ossetian ( on his father ’s side ) , half - Georgian Stalin .
Readers of Hewitt ’s 1998 book , The Abkhazians : A Handbook , will note how effectively he explodes Kristol ’s myth of poor little Georgia , whose supposedly “ democratic ” history reflects its present “ pro-Western ” orientation and general worthiness :
“ The aggressive politics of the government of Georgia towards Abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local Abkhazian , Armenian , Russian , Greek , and a significant proportion of the Kartvelian peoples , which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of Soviet power in the region on March 4th , 1921 . ”
The fall of Menshevik communism in Georgia was celebrated by the captive mini-nations of the region “ as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the Georgian Republic . ”
Things have remained pretty much unchanged since 1921  albeit not in the way Kristol would have us believe .
While Kristol sentimentalizes the old Georgian republic , its Menshevik founders and leaders were , as Hewitt points out , unapologetic authoritarians :
“ The politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists , the jurist - internationalist Zurab Avalov ( Avalishvili ) .
In his book The Independence of Georgia in International Politics , 1918 - 1921 ( Paris , 1924 ) , he remarked , ‘ At the start of 1921 , Georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the Constituent Assembly a simple creature of party organization Georgian democracy 1917 - 1921 , a form of social - democratic dictatorship ( i.e. , of the right wing of Marxism ) , was a period of preparation for the triumph in Georgia of Soviet dictatorship . ”
This dictatorial tradition is today carried on by President Mikheil Saakashvili , who unleashed police on demonstrators , injuring 500 people , during the hotly contested elections and shut down independent media with the same alacrity displayed by his Menshevik predecessors .
It is little short of astonishing that Kristol holds up this smarmy regime of small - time hoodlums with big - time regional ambitions as some kind of model , the ideal U.S. ally whose fate we might even go to war over .
Georgia , in Kristol ’s view , is worthy not only of U.S. support , but of membership in an imaginary “ League of Democracies , ” a neocon project touted by John McCain and pushed by the neocon - dominated wing of the GOP as the “ conservative ” answer to the United Nations .
In short , NATO writ large , albeit with an ideological gloss such as only Kristol ( or a Marxist ) could bring to it .
No , that ’s not a misprint : I wrote Marxist , and meant it .
The whole flavor of Kristol ’s screed calling for U.S. support to Georgia , with its appeals to emotion interwoven with bogus historical analogies , reeks of the ideologue ’s sweaty - browed rhetoric .
He is like a little Lenin , exhorting us to follow the bright flag of “ democratic ” internationalism to the very ends of the earth , which is surely where South Ossetia is located , as least as far as Americans are concerned .
One hears , in Kristol ’s exhortations , the hectoring tone of the old Soviet commissar , albeit of the Menshevik rather than the Bolshevik variety , and this brings to mind a point made by the late Murray N. Rothbard in his justly famous 1992 speech to the John Randolph Club :
“ When I was growing up , I found that the main argument against laissez - faire , and for socialism , was that socialism and communism were inevitable : ‘ You ca n’t turn back the clock ! ’ they chanted , ‘ you ca n’t turn back the clock . ’
But the clock of the once - mighty Soviet Union , the clock of Marxism - Leninism , a creed that once mastered half the world , is not only turned back , but lies dead and broken forever .
But we must not rest content with this victory .
For though Marxism - Bolshevism is gone forever , there still remains , plaguing us everywhere , its evil cousin : call it ‘ soft Marxism , ’ ‘ Marxism - Humanism , ’ ‘ Marxism - Bernsteinism , ’ ‘ Marxism - Trotskyism , ’ ‘ Marxism - Freudianism , ’ well , let ’s just call it ‘ Menshevism , ’ or ‘ social democracy . ’
“ Social democracy is still here in all its variants , defining our entire respectable political spectrum , from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right .
We are now trapped , in America , inside a Menshevik fantasy , with the narrow bounds of respectable debate set for us by various brands of Marxists .
It is now our task , the task of the resurgent right , of the paleo movement , to break those bonds , to finish the job , to finish off Marxism forever . ”
Of course , the neoconservatives , of which Kristol is the ringleader , came from the left side of the spectrum and trace their historical antecedents all the way back to the schismatic Marxist sects of the 1930s and the epic battles between Trotsky and Stalin ( they were partisans of the former ) .
They were , in short , the American Mensheviks of their time .
In their hegira from the far left to the neocon right  a more fully documented odyssey exists only for that undertaken by Ulysses  they yet retain the telling characteristics of their Menshevik heritage , which Kristol proudly upholds to this day .
At a time when people are losing their homes and economists are beginning to talk about another Great Depression , Kristol ’s proposal to send millions more in “ aid ” to Georgia is obscene .
Now that ’s real anti-Americanism  sending taxpayer dollars to a Georgian despot while people in this country are hurting .
It ’s also political suicide for the Republicans to raise the prospect of intervening in Georgia ’s internal problems when we ’re already bogged down in the Iraq quagmire , from which there seems little hope of early extrication .
So much for Kristol , the grand strategist of the GOP .
He and his fellow neocons are dragging down the Republican Party along with their own sinking credibility .
The myth of poor little Georgia , a newborn and promising “ democracy ” threatened , bullied , and battered by Putin - the - reincarnation - of - Stalin is bogus from beginning to end .
It is a Bizarro World rendition of what is really happening in South Ossetia and the wider region : that is , a curiously and consistently inverted version of reality in which up is down , black is white , and the Georgians did not invade South Ossetia , killing thousands and driving many more northward .
According to our “ free ” media , the Georgians did n’t invade the land of the Ossetians  they merely tried to “ retake ” it , as a child would bloodlessly and even quite playfully retake a shiny red ball from a playmate .
Those evil Russkies , on the other hand , invaded , plunged into , and escalated their attack on Georgia .
At least , those are the words our “ reporters ” are using .
As George Orwell emphasized , the corruption of language is a form of control , and the American media in collusion with the government is expert at this , especially in its war reporting .
That ’s why Antiwar.com ’s continued survival is such a value for our growing audience : we give you the facts without the Washington - centric spin that comes with “ mainstream ” media coverage .
You know you can come here to find out what ’s really happening out there in the wide world .
You also know that we are n’t afraid to fly in the face of the conventional wisdom .
Maybe you remember how often that collective “ wisdom ” has been wrong .
The news media  and , not coincidentally , the War Party  is n’t interested in reporting the facts .
All they care about is the “ narrative ”  one not necessarily based on reality , designed to convince the public that what our rulers are doing and planning is right and just .
The Kristolian narrative of poor , little , pro-Western Georgia is a tall tale .
Georgian “ free market democracy ” exists in the same alternate universe as Iraq ’s famed “ weapons of mass destruction ” and the Piltdown Man , but you wo n’t see many other media outlets saying that .
I want to urge all of my readers , especially those who log in with some regularity , to contribute to our end - of - summer fundraising drive , which , as I write , is in its second day .
We still have a very long way to go , and I ca n’t impress upon you the urgency of our appeal .
The foreign policy crisis has been ongoing ever since 9/11 , and it still shows very little sign of letting up .
We seem to be approaching the breaking point , where the various crises in different parts of the world are seeming to converge into one mega- crisis : the threat of a new world war , involving most of the world ’s major powers , is a real possibility .
And it is a near certainty as long as the neocons are anywhere near the levers of power in the U.S .
Please , consider giving more than you usually give , considering how grave the prospects for peace have become .
The world , I fear , is slowly but surely darkening , with the bright promise of the post - Cold War era now just a distantly flickering memory , the echo of a lost peace .
Let us pray that peace is not lost forever , and that , once lost , it can be recovered .
We can do it , and you can help  but we ca n’t do it alone .

Cyberbullying among kids is an unfortunate reality , something that academics have struggled to define and politicians have occasionally tried to legislate .
While some measures in the past may have gone too far by locking down social networking and IM in school , a bill that just passed in the California Senate could give schools power to take action against cyberbullies .
Assembly Bill 86 , introduced by Assemblyman Ted Lieu nearly two years ago to enact nutritional reform in schools , has since been transmogrified into a piece of cyberbullying legislation .
The bill has been amended four times this year beginning on January 7 , gaining a passage that embodies its new purpose : " It is the intent of the Legislature ... to develop and implement interagency strategies , in - service training programs , and activities that will improve school attendance and reduce school crime and violence , including vandalism ... hate crimes , bullying , including acts bullying committed personally or by means of an electronic act . "
( Emphasis ours . )
The bill would also " Authorize school officials to suspend or recommend for expulsion pupils who engage in bullying , including but not limited to , bullying by means of an electronic act , as defined . "
The definition of an electronic act has evolved over recent amendments to now read as " the transmission of a communication , including , but not limited to , a message , text , sound , or image by means of an electronic device , including , but not limited to , a telephone , wireless telephone or other wireless communication device , computer , or pager . "
With this new clarity , the bill passed the State Senate with a 21 - 11 vote , and , if the differences with the State Assembly version are reconciled , will go to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's desk .
Previous studies have shown that the definition of what exactly cyberbullying is can sometimes get lost in translation between teachers , victims , parents , and legislators .
One study by Pew Internet found one - third of teens claiming to have experienced cyberbullying , while others find numbers all over the board depending on the context and level of threat .
Cyberbullying can be relatively harmless and its impact can vary more greatly than with more traditional playground tyrants , as over 80 percent of students in one study said they were n't distressed due to the anonymous identity of their aggressor .
At the other end of the scale , however , one cyberbullying case involved a people masquerading as a young boy on MySpace to bully a 13 - year - old girl .
The young girl eventually committed suicide and the mother of one of her classmates will stand trial in LA on charges related to the incident ; she faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , though the EFF now worries that the exact nature of the charges against the mother could be a threat to free speech .
If enacted , the California legislation would give power to school officials to take action over acts of cyberbullying that they beliee end up going too far .
Under current law , schools only have power over bullying acts that happen on school grounds , which means that schools can't do anything about what many consider to be a growing and serious problem .
Last week I mentioned that the Times reporting earlier this year on the McCain / Paxson / Iseman story had missed the key element of McCain ’s participation in the influence peddling .
Remember that McCain denied that he ’d asked for a decision one way or another in the case Paxson and his lobbyist Iseman had before the FCC .
He ’d only pressed them to decide the matter one way or another .
That was McCain ’s story .
FCC insiders knew different .
In fact , McCain was squeezing one of the FCC commissioners — making okaying Paxson ’s deal a condition of their reappointment .
What I had n’t realized is that McCain ’s quid pro quo had actually already been flagged , albeit circumspectly , in what was apparently a little noticed piece by Josh Green in The Atlantic Monthly .
Susan Ness , a Democratic commissioner , took the rare step of breaking with her fellow Democrats and voting with the Republican commissioners to approve the Paxson deal . …
And while there is no evidence that McCain or anyone on his staff made an explicit quid pro quo demand , Ness ’s vote is widely thought to have been a bid to win her reappointment to the FCC–a bid that happened to have stalled before McCain ’s committee months earlier .
So here we have what Paxson and Iseman bought from McCain , which pulls the whole story together and gives a much better sense of just what went down .
I know there are others out there ( beside those who ’ve already been in touch ) who know more about what happened and can shed more light on the favors McCain provided .
So please drop me a line .
As always , your anonymity is assured .
Last week , Brett Alexander and I paid a visit to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) office in Silver Spring , Maryland .
It turns out that , thanks in part to some discussion on our forums , NOAA had been contacted by a Google Lunar X PRIZE team to make some inquiries about potential license requirements .
NOAA had in turn gotten in touch with us , and asked us for a quick briefing about the prize .
In a friendly and relatively brief meeting , Brett and I talked to NOAA about the prize , and told them that it was one open to international teams where teams were not explicitly required to but might optionally chose to image the Earth , either for navigation purposes or for commercial purposes outside of the scope of the prize requirements .
We also reassured them that the guidelines for the prize explicitly require teams to comply with all relevant regulations and legislation , but that the X PRIZE Foundation did not intend to get into the business of identifying exactly which laws , et cetera , teams need to follow .
After all , we told them , that would likely be an impossible task to do even for a competition limited to only one country , but would surely be overwhelming for a global prize such as this one .
The NOAA officials were appreciative for the brief , but stated a desire to communicate to teams as quickly and as thoroughly as possible that some teams in some circumstance might need a NOAA license .
To that end , NOAA has now published an open letter to the teams on their website ( link goes to a . PDF ) , providing some quick details and contact information .
While I certainly encourage each Google Lunar X PRIZE team ( as well as potential teams ) to contact NOAA directly , as well as probably speaking with an attorney , there are some general rules one can follow to determine if one needs a NOAA license .
If your team has any team members or partners ( including launch sites or ground stations ) in the USA , and your team plans to take any sort of images of the Earth , you need to contact NOAA .
It is likely that for those teams only using the Earth as a navigational tool ( e.g. similar to a star tracker ) or only wishing to take pictures of the Earth from the surface of or in orbit around the Moon would either be given an exemption or simply walked through the permit process in a very quick and painless fashion .
Still , it 's important that you contact NOAA and work through this process , preferably soon .
I 'm not aware of what similar restrictions are out there for other countries , but I 'd certainly encourage each team to be thorough about checking .
And if you know of some , please feel free to pass the word along in the comments to this post or on the forum .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economy will likely slip into a recession by the end of the year , but the woes in the housing market are close to bottoming out , the top economist for a leading U.S. business group said on Thursday .
“ I see possibly a recession by the end of the year , but it will be a relatively short recession and a relatively mild recession , ” said Martin Regalia , vice president for economic policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
He also said the government ’s economic stimulus package helped head off a recession during the second and third quarters of this year , but that a second such package would not be worthwhile .
“ Some of the problems in the economy are a little more fundamental than consumption , ” Regalia told reporters in a briefing .
Congress passed the $ 152 billion stimulus package in February , sending checks directly to thousands of Americans in an attempt to spur the economy and help those hurt by the economic slowdown .
Democrats have discussed passing another emergency spending bill , but the movement has not gotten much traction .
Revised numbers released on Thursday showed consumer spending , supported by the stimulus package and strong exports , pushed the economy ahead at a solid 3.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter .
That was much stronger than the prior assessment of a 1.9 percent gain .
Regalia said he expects moderate third - quarter growth , at a 1 percent annual rate , and zero or slightly negative growth in the fourth quarter .
Regarding housing , Regalia said he was encouraged by data this week showing a quarter - over - quarter increase in home sales and a decrease in the rate home prices are declining .
“ I believe we ’re starting to see a little bit of hope , but I do n’t believe we ’ve bottomed out even yet , ” he said .
“ We ’re approaching the bottom . ”
Turning to tax policy , Regalia said the Chamber believes increasing taxes would further restrict economic growth .
The Chamber supports Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s suggestion to make Bush administration tax cuts permanent .
It also supports lowering overall corporate tax rates and is against policies that tax corporate dividends or try to improve income distribution by placing even higher tax rates on the wealthy .
Regalia added that there are not many good options to speed up an economic recovery , which he predicts will happen in the second quarter of 2009 .
“ I think we ’re in for a rough road over the next couple quarters , and I do n’t think we can do much in the short run , ” he said .
GREELEY , Colo .  Angie Zapata began living as a woman six years ago even though she was born male and named Justin .
While Ms. Zapata , 18 , was accepted by her many friends and five siblings , she was bullied in school and at times was lonely and troubled , an older sister , Monica , said .
Eventually , Ms. Zapata dropped out of school and got her own apartment here in Greeley .
It was in that apartment that Ms. Zapata ’s badly beaten body was found on July 17 .
On Wednesday , the police arrested Allen R. Andrade , 31 , and charged him with murder .
According to the authorities , Mr. Andrade had gone out on a date with Ms. Zapata , and upon discovering she had male genitalia , beat her to death starting with his fists and then with a fire extinguisher .
Mr. Andrade told investigators that he thought he had “ killed it , ” according to an affidavit filed by the police .
Mr. Andrade , who is in custody , has said nothing publicly about the killing , and his arraignment has not yet been scheduled .
' 9/11 Truth ' activists march through Denver Nick Juliano

DENVER -- Around 100 activists convinced that the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 were perpetrated by dark and mysterious actors within the US government marched across the city Tuesday in a sanctioned protest that resulted in no confrontations with police .
Members of the so - called " 9/11 Truth " movement gathered outside Denver 's city hall proceeding to snake through cordoned off streets towards the Pepsi Center , where the Democratic National Convention is being held this week .
Radio host Alex Jones , who runs the conspiracy theory Web site infowars.com and is a leader of the movement led demonstrators in chants of " 9/11 was and inside job " and " Down with the New World Order . "
Denver police on bicycles preceded the marchers through an empty street just outside of downtown .
Few Democratic delegates saw the protesters as they marched -- a goal the parade route seemed designed to achieve .
Along with the activists , the march included a mock parade float .
Labeled " God 's Gitmo , " it displayed protesters wearing masks depicting George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Condoleeza Rice , John McCain and Barack Obama locked up behind a chain - link fence .
The march never got very close to the Pepsi Center itelf , which was surrounded by a security perimeter more than two blocks from the main entrance , but it did snake past a back entrance to the security perimeter around 2 p.m. , when a scattering of delegates , reporters and other guests were arriving to the convention .
Stopping outside the gates , Jones and the marchers outlined their view that the 9/11 attacks were a " false flag " operation carried out by the US government for the sake of starting wars in the Middle East .
At least a dozen police in riot gear stood guard near the outer entrance to the convention site , but the protesters had no intention of causing trouble .
They moved on after about 15 minutes .
" That was the most organized anarchy I 've ever seen , " remarked one woman standing inside the security fences .
Moving on from the convention site entrance , the protesters decided to break up their march rather than continue into the designated free speech zone tucked off a corner of the convention site .
The area 's been dubbed the " freedom cage " by activists in town to protest the conventions .
The demonstrators reconvened near Denver 's union station later Tuesday afternoon and set up behind the MSNBC set that had been erected nearby .
They waved signs and chanted while Hardball was broadcast .
The show 's host seemed at best bemused by the display .
At one point during a commercial break , Matthews stepped to the edge of the set and seemed to taunt the demonstrators , making a " you 're crazy " gesture circling his finger around his ear .

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain on Wednesday credited the recent drop in the price of oil to President Bush ’s lifting of a presidential ban on offshore drilling .
[ social_buttons ]
“ The price of oil dropped $ 10 a barrel , ” said McCain , who argued that the psychology of lifting the ban has affected world markets .
But the White House did n’t go quite that far .
When asked about the McCain statement , presidential spokeswoman Dana Perino said the recent drop in price could also be a product of diminished demand .
“ I do n’t know if we fully deserve the credit , but I do think that it was important to send a signal to the market that we are serious about moving forward . ”
At last check , a barrel of light , sweet crude oil fell to $ 124.47 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday .
That ’s down from more than $ 140 a barrel earlier in the summer .

Sad as it may be the scandals affecting our sport connected to the world of betting have added richly to the lexicon of jokes available over the years .
And , as with many such cases when it comes to humor , the fact that they deal with a delicate subject makes them funnier .
Here ’s one to get you in the mood ;
The Pakistani team have issued a statement expressing their shock at the alleged involvement of three Pakistani players in match - fixing .
They ’ve promised to clean up their act before the 2 - 1 series defeat to the West Indies next summer .
Or how about the Pakistani international cricketer who refused to take a bribe ?
And his name ?
Why itâ€™s â€ œAsifâ€ of course !
OK , weâ€™ll go easy on Pakistan now as all that scandal is well and truly behind them and itâ€™s not as if betting on cricket canâ€™t liven up the otherwise dullest of test matches now is it ?
You can bet on just about anything these days â€ “ and with Betfair cricket becomes more exciting â€ “ particularly for the real aficionados of the game who understand its subtleties .
Thatâ€™s because Betfair is an exchange so you can accept bets as well as make them â€ “ acting as the bookmaker as it were .
In these cases , someone who really deeply understands the swings of fortune that can occur in a test match can back and lay with Betfair , gradually building their stake up regardless of the outcome if theyâ€™re shrewd enough .
And if bribery really is rife within cricket â€ “ then spare a thought for the poor England Twenty20 team Captain Stuart Broad who said after the teamâ€™s poor showing in Bangladesh ; â€ œI just donâ€™t get it , it was an important game for us so I bribed the umpire , but we still lost ! â€ 
â€ œItâ€™s awful is n’t itâ€ said Pakistanâ €™s Twenty20 captain Mohammad Hafeez , â€œit ’s getting so bad that you just donâ€™t know who you can trust these days !â€ 
And finally , while weâ€™re on the subject of unpredictable matches ; I ’ve been teaching a few hobbits how to play cricket .
Bilbo ’s not bad at catching , but he can’t really Frodoâ€¦.groan !
These are the same people that accused Ivins ' colleague Steven Hatfill who was cleared last month and was paid $ 5.8 million .
Here 's an article that states that Ivins ' colleagues are divided over his suicide :
But others , including former colleagues and scientists with backgrounds in biological weapons defence , disagreed that Ivins could have created the anthrax powder even if motivated to do so .
" USAMRIID does n't deal with powdered anthrax , " said Richard Spertzel , who worked with Ivins at the Army lab .
" I do n't think there 's anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it .
You would need to have the opportunity , the capability and the motivation , and he did n't possess any of those .
" Authorities cast doubt on Saturday on reports that Ivins had acted for financial gain based on patents and scientific advances he had made .
They say the government restricts income from inventions produced in its laboratories to no more than $ 150,000 per year , but the amount is often considerably less .
Around 80 million years ago , when Triceratops still browsed the plains of what was n’t yet North America , some flowering plant species developed a new strategy to spread their seeds , encasing them in a soft , fleshy cover – fruit – that became sweet and tasty as everything ripened .
The fruit was then eaten by animals , which would subsequently deposit the seeds far away from the mother plant , and with the addition of some useful fertiliser as well .
It did not take long , however , for enterprising funguses to start exploiting the sugar in the ripe fruits for their own growth and development , using oxygen to break the sugar down into carbon dioxide and water , releasing energy at the same time .
If there was no oxygen about they would turn the sugar , via acetaldehyde , into alcohol , and make energy that way , although they very much preferred not to : alcohol was poisonous .
These funguses mostly reproduced by budding – dividing into two , and giving each daughter cell a complete copy of her mother ’s genes .
However , on one occasion , at least , a daughter received two copies of her mother ’s genome instead of one .
The daughter ’s descendants evolved this spare set of genes so that , unlike their ancestors , they could make alcohol all the time , not just in the absence of oxygen .
The spare copy of the gene that created the enzyme that turned acetaldehyde into alcohol also evolved so that it could do this trick in reverse – turn alcohol into acetaldehyde .
What these changes enabled the clever little fungus – the ancestor of brewing yeast – to do when it landed on sugary fruit was to quickly flood its environment with alcohol , which was toxic to most of its microbial rivals ( our double - genome yeast had , of course , also evolved greater tolerance to alcohol , to cope with the extra alcohol it now created ) .
Once it had swamped the area with alcohol , and thus seen off rival funguses , it could then win even more energy by turning the alcohol into acetaldehyde .
The alcohol content of over - ripe fruit attacked by yeast has been tested at as high as 4.5 per cent , and there is a theory that humans like alcohol in part because our early primate ancestors learned to associate its smell with the presence of ripe , sugary fruit – a sort of ancient alcopop .
Appreciating alcohol , therefore , looks to be something deep in humanity ’s genes , going back to when we lived in trees and were still covered in fur .
Fermenting sugar is a rare trick : of the thousands of millions of different yeasts , only 250 can do this , and just 24 are “ good ” yeasts , in the sense that what they produce is palatable to humans ( although even then we have to arrest the yeasts ’ development at the point of maximum alcohol development , by cutting off their oxygen , before they start making acetaldehyde , which will give you a very nasty hangover . )
Yeasts also need help in tackling grain : a growing barley or wheat seed is converting its starches to sugars , and then using the sugar to make energy , and produce roots and stalks , faster than the yeast can rob the seed of its sugar .
But if humans stop the seed growing by heating it until it dies , and then crush and soak the dried grain , then the yeast can get at the sugar .
You can use the wild yeasts in the air to do this , if you like , and this is the preferred method of the lambic beer brewers of Belgium , for example .
But the lambic brewers rely on a natural environment filled with “ good ” yeasts .
For many early brewers , leaving sweet wort uncovered for a few days was most likely to result in a nasty vinegary liquid , as “ bad ” yeasts predominated .
At some point , however , brewers realised that the dregs from a “ good ” brew contained something that would kickstart sweet wort into producing another good brew – a point underlined etymologically by the Anglo - Saxon for yeast , doerst , coming from dros , dregs .
Old Norwegian words for yeast include kveik , which comes from a word meaning “ kindling ” , with the idea that the yeast “ restarts the fire ” in the wort .
Although brewers knew that yeast was essential for fermentation , they had no idea what it did , and no clue as to the actual nature of yeast .
Michael Combrune , the London brewer who was among the first to use a thermometer , wrote in 1762 , for example , that yeast was “ vesicles formed out of the must [ or wort ] , and filled with elastic air ” .
By the early 1830s science had advanced enough to discover that yeast made alcohol from sugar , with “ carbonic acid gas ” – carbon dioxide – as a side - product , but how yeast did this ( and even the fact that it was a living organism ) was completely unknown .
It took a German , Theodore Schwann , in 1837 to show through experimentation that yeast was alive .
Schwann correctly described yeast as a fungus , and called it in German Zuckerpilz , sugar fungus , which another German , Julius Meyen , translated into Latin in 1838 to give the organism its biological name , Saccharomyces .
Schwann ’s findings were not immediately accepted , however .
Some of the leading chemists of the time , including his fellow - German Justus Liebig , dismissed Schwann ’s ideas and insisted that yeast was just a residue of the decomposition of sugar .
It took the great French scientist Louis Pasteur , working from the 1850s to the 1870s , to finally prove what yeast was , and have a stab at showing how it worked .
Meanwhile the Bavarian brewer Gabriel Sedlmayr had been working at his family ’s Spaten brewery in Munich , perfecting a style of brewing using a yeast that thrived at cold temperatures and then sank to the bottom of the fermenting vessel when it had finished , and which , after long storage , produced a stable , long - lasting , sparkling beer .
Because the yeast Sedlmayr used to make his “ store beer ” , “ lager bier ” in German , dropped to the bottom , it became known as “ bottom - fermenting yeast ” , while “ warm fermentation ” yeasts were called in contrast “ top- fermenting yeasts ” .
This is , as it happens , a misnomer , because while all cold fermentation yeasts fall to the bottom of the vessel when their work is done , some warm fermentation yeasts rise to the top and some , as cold - loving yeasts do , fall to the bottom .
Whatever , because Sedlmayr ’s methods produced a more stable beer than other brewers could make , his yeast and his cold fermentation brewing methods became widely used , in Europe and around the globe .
One brewer who took Sedlmayr ’s yeast home with him was JC Jacobsen of the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen .
There , from 1880 , Emil Christian Hansen worked in the brewery laboratory , discovering that normal “ pitching ” yeasts used in brewing were a mixture of several different strains .
Hansen set to isolating single cells of yeast to get a pure strain , multiplying them and testing them for their beer - making properties .
Eventually , in 1908 , Hansen isolated one strain that he felt performed best of all , and which he named after his employer , Saccharomyces carlsbergiensis .
What Hansen could not know , but which genetic studies have now shown , is that S carlsbergiensis is a hybrid , of standard brewing yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( which gets the last part of its name from the Latin for beer ) , and a related variety , S bayanus , which is more commonly found on grapes .
However , using pure strains seemed to solve the problems brewers had always had that were caused by wild yeasts infecting the brew , and Hansen ’s methods were copied around the world – except in Britain , where brewers found brewing with single strains did not give them the complexity of flavours they were looking for .
It took someone else working in the Carlsberg Laboratories in Denmark , Niels Hjelte Claussen , in 1903 , who found one major reason why , when he isolated from a sample of English stock , or aged beer an entirely different type of yeast , which he named “ British fungus ” , Brettanomyces in Latin .
Brettanomyces typically arrives on the scene after Saccharomyces has given up , and , in beers that are stored for a long time , it attacks and turns into alcohol the sugars normal brewing yeast wo n’t touch .
( It also gives a ripe , not - quite - mouldy flavour to aged beers that is appreciated by many , though winemakers hate “ Brett ” flavours )
As geneticists began to get to grips with yeasts used in brewing in the 20th century , Saccharomyces ‘ habit of swapping genes among species the way children in school playgrounds swap Top Trumps cards caused much confusion .
S carlsbergiensis was relegated by yeast biologists to a sub-variety of a group of cold - loving yeasts called Saccharomyces pastorianus , after Louis Pasteur .
Another type of yeast , S uvarum , that forms hybrids with S cerevisiae , was defined , then lumped in with S bayanus , and in the past couple of years has been pulled out and made a separate species again .
If you ’re getting your information about yeasts from a book more than five or ten years old , it ’s probably wrong , yeast genetics has advanced that much .
In particular it ’s wrong to say , as some writers still do , that lager is brewed with Saccharomyces carlsbergiensis , or S uvarum .
Modern lager yeasts seem to be hybrids of three different yeasts , in different proportions , S cerevisiae , S uvarum and S bayanus .
Yeast has a marvellous habit of evolving to suit its environment , helped by the Saccharomyces ‘ gene - swapping .
For this reason , different strains rapidly develop in different breweries , and under different fermenting styles , which is why , for example , a yeast strain used in the Burton Union method of fermentation would not work well if suddenly used in Yorkshire stone squares , where a different strain of yeast has evolved .
Some brewers say their yeast even evolves to suit a particular barley strain , and problems arise if a new type of barley is suddenly used .
This kind of adaptability can be observed at home if you make “ sourdough ” bread : the first batch , made by letting wild ambient yeasts settle on and raise the dough , will not be as good as subsequent batches , which are made with a “ starter ” of uncooked raised dough from the previous batch , because the yeasts will be doing a better job as the ones that thrive best , and produce the most carbon dioxide to raise the dough , come to dominate .
Update
For an update on part of this story , see this post
This whole story concocted by the FBI smells really , really bad .
Are we supposed to believe this yarn ?
I 'll try to do a bunch of posts on this because it is a completely insane story .
Did it really take seven years for the FBI to finally catch Bruce Ivins , a scientist who was working with anthrax and then helping the FBI to finger Steven J. Hatfill --- who just so happens was wrongly accused and smeared until he happened to fight back ?
June 27 : The federal government awards Hatfill $ 5.8 million to settle his violation of privacy lawsuit against the Justice Department .
Have you ever seen a huge settlement like that right before they catch the real killer ?
Did you watch the press conference yesterday ?
It absolutely made no sense .
The feebs made it sound like there were millions of people that could have had access to anthrax .
When they were asked why it took so many years to come up with Army scientist Bruce Ivins --- they looked to the universe .
Q: When did you get around to him as a suspect from March 31st in 2005 ?
A : It 's important to remember how complex and complicated this investigation was .
At the outset we had to identify the universe of persons and labs that might have access to this type of anthrax .
Once we identified what type of anthrax it was , then over the years there were efforts to shrink the size of the pool ...
What the hell is he talking about ?
I 'd say the FBI was drowning in a pool of lies .
Are there 8 million people and labs to check out to see who actually had anthrax ?
I want to see the FBI logs on this case .
The day to day activity .
Really , there needs to be a full investigation of this .
How many hours did they spend on this case ?
What did they know and when did they know it ?
Ivins was actually helping the FBI with their own case !
It 's right out a serial killer novel .
I 'll have more later .
There are so many layers to this story .
Read this NY Times story for some information ...

A fun blog post popped up yesterday in which John Nunemaker ported a Quicksilver - style Live Search to jQuery .
Taking a look at his code , I decided to have a little fun and re-port it to jQuery – trying to use the functional style that jQuery promotes .
I think the end result is quite simple and elegant .
The final code – compare with John ’s port :
jQuery.fn.liveUpdate = function ( list ) { list = j Query ( list ) ; if ( list .
length ) { var rows = list.children ( ' li ' ) , cache = rows.map( function ( ) { return this.innerHTML.toLowerCase( ) ; } ) ; this .keyup ( filter ) .keyup ( ) . parents ( ' form ' ) .submit( function ( ) { return false ; } ) ; } return this ; function filter ( ) { var term = jQuery.trim ( j Query ( this ).val ( ).toLowerCase ( ) ) , scores = [ ] ; if ( ! term ) { rows .
show ( ) ; } else { rows.hide ( ) ; cache.each( function ( i ) { var score = this .score ( term ) ; if ( score > 0 ) { scores.
push ( [ score , i ] ) ; } } ) ; jQuery.each(scores.sort( function ( a , b ) {return b[ 0 ] - a [ 0 ] ;} ) , function ( ) { j Query ( rows [ this [ 1 ] ] ) . show ( ) ; } ) ; } } } ;

" Fox poisons the country with racist propaganda and tries to call it news , " said Nas .
NEW YORK ( AP )  Hip - hop artist Nas is protesting Fox News ' coverage of Barack Obama .
The rapper joined members of the activist groups MoveOn.org and ColorofChange.org to deliver more than 600,000 petitions Wednesday to the network 's New York City headquarters .
Nas , whose new album Untitled was released last week , said in a statement that " Fox poisons the country with racist propaganda and tries to call it news . "
The network responded by saying , " Fox News believes in all protesters exercising their right to free speech including Nas who has an album to promote . "
Fox also noted that its anchor Bill Hemmer was scheduled to interview Obama this weekend .
Last month , Fox News referred in a graphic to Michelle Obama , the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate , as " Obama 's baby mama . "
Later , the network said a producer " exercised poor judgment " during the segment .
Earlier , two other Fox personalities apologized for referring to an affectionate onstage fist bump shared by the couple as a " terrorist fist jab " and , in another case , for joking about an Obama assassination .
Nas ' new song , Sly Fox , takes direct aim at Fox .
" Watch what you watchin ' , Fox keeps feeding us toxins ...
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth , not the biased truth , not the liar 's truth , " the song says .
MoveOn.org , a liberal public advocacy group , and ColorofChange.org , an online group of black activists , said the petition signatures were gathered online in the past month .
Andre Banks , a spokesman for ColorofChange.org , said that after Fox refused to take the petitions Wednesday afternoon , Nas took them to Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report .
Fox could n't immediately say whether security guards at their midtown building accepted the petitions .

Rice University 's John Alford , associate professor of political science , co-authored the paper in the Sept. 19 issue of Science .
Alford and his colleagues studied a group of 46 adult participants with strong political beliefs .
Those individuals with " measurably lower physical sensitivities to sudden noises and threatening visual images were more likely to support foreign aid , liberal immigration policies , pacifism and gun control , whereas individuals displaying measurably higher physiological reactions to those same stimuli were more likely to favor defense spending , capital punishment , patriotism and the Iraq War , " the authors wrote .
Participants were chosen randomly over the phone in Lincoln , Neb .
Those expressing strong political views -- regardless of their content -- were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their political beliefs , personality traits and demographic characteristics .
In a later session , they were attached to physiological measuring equipment and shown three threatening images ( a very large spider on the face of a frightened person , a dazed individual with a bloody face and an open wound with maggots in it ) interspersed among a sequence of 33 images .
Similarly , participants also viewed three nonthreatening images ( a bunny , a bowl of fruit and a happy child ) placed within a series of other images .
A second test used auditory stimuli to measure involuntary responses to a startling noise .
The researchers noted a correlation between those who reacted strongly to the stimuli and those who expressed support for " socially protective policies , " which tend to be held by people " particularly concerned with protecting the interests of the participants ' group , defined as the United States in mid-2007 , from threats . "
These positions include support for military spending , warrantless searches , the death penalty , the Patriot Act , obedience , patriotism , the Iraq War , school prayer and Biblical truth , and opposition to pacifism , immigration , gun control , foreign aid , compromise , premarital sex , gay marriage , abortion rights and pornography .
The paper concluded , " Political attitudes vary with physiological traits linked to divergent manners of experiencing and processing environmental threats . "
This may help to explain " both the lack of malleability in the beliefs of individuals with strong political convictions and the associated ubiquity of political conflict , " the authors said .

Secession : How Vermont and All the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire .
By Thomas H. Naylor .
Foreword by Kirkpatrick Sale . Feral House , 2008 . 119 pages .
As a general matter , most Americans insist on placing their collective faith in " democracy " as the primary means to address the escalating problems of rising consumer and commodity prices , the value of the U.S. dollar on the edge of free - fall , a foreign policy based on aggressive imperialism , and the gradual erosion of the nation 's infrastructure and natural resources .
These are undoubtedly issues of great importance and concern .
And yet , Americans seem to have either lost total faith in the electoral process and feel utterly powerless , or they still honestly believe that their votes for the " right " presidential candidate will " make a difference " or lead to " change " ( Obama , anyone ? ) .
This stark reality of democratic politics applies just as well to the average citizen living in the rest of the Americas , much of Europe , Australia , parts of Asia and South America , or in any other country purportedly based on democratic values .
Pitted against this global democratic status quo is the political concept of " secession . "
Secession is commonly defined as the consensual exit of a group of people and territory from an existing nation - state .
In many cases ( but not all ) , what results from secession is the emergence of new politically - sovereign entities .
That said , it is not too much of a stretch to note that secession remains a difficult concept for the average person to intellectually digest .
Even with the relatively peaceful political break - up of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries over fifteen years ago , citizens residing in democracies the world over barely give secession a serious thought .
And political establishments in those democracies refuse to recognize secession as a legitimate tool for effecting meaningful political and socioeconomic change .
To them , secession remains a threat to " territorial integrity . "
Nevertheless , is it possible that now , in the early part of the 21st century , the idea of secession may soon catch political fire and inspire millions of people to push for political decentralization and dismemberment of the world 's existing nation - states ?
In his important new book , Secession : How Vermont and All the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire , Thomas H. Naylor concludes that efforts to reform the " American Empire " are futile , and that secession is the only feasible mechanism that can be used to disentangle the United States in the most peaceful and least chaotic manner possible .
This conclusion may seem somewhat unusual coming from someone like Naylor , who is not exactly your run -of - the - mill radical , judging by his " establishment " credentials as an Emeritus Professor of Economics at Duke University and former CEO of a successful computer software firm .
Naylor begins Secession with a dedication to , of all people , the famed American diplomat and foreign policy guru George F. Kennan .
Kennan is most famous for having developed the foreign policy of " containing " Communist expansion during the Truman Administration of the 1950s .
However , what is not widely - known is that by the early 1990s , in the twilight of his life , Kennan became a strong sympathizer for an independent Vermont and proponent of breaking up the United States into " a dozen constituent republics " as a means to roll back aggressive American foreign policy imperialism .
Having been the father of containment diplomacy , it is reasonable to assume that Kennan may have known a thing or two about the dangers of aggressive imperialist expansion and how to combat it .
Indeed , it is fascinating to note that Naylor considers Kennan to be " a major source of inspiration for the Second Vermont Republic , " even going so far as to deem him as its " godfather . "
For those that do not know , the Second Vermont Republic is the name given by Naylor and others to a future Vermont that will perhaps one day become its own sovereign independent republic , broken free from the yoke of the current territorial borders of the United States .
The foreword to Secession is provided by Kirkpatrick Sale .
He is perhaps best known as one of the political Left 's most prominent journalists and a prolific author of numerous books with topics ranging from environmentalism and radical political decentralization to neo-Ludditeism and bioregionalism .
Sale has focused his energies on becoming a preeminent advocate of secession , and in particular , the secession of Vermont from the United States .
In his foreword , Sale lays out in a few short paragraphs how a small group of attendees to a " Radical Consultation " conference in Middlebury , Vermont in 2004 , went from completely rejecting American electoral politics to whole - heartedly embracing secession for effecting political change .
By the end of that conference , Sale , along with Naylor and a few others , founded the Middlebury Institute .
According to its Declaration , the Middlebury Institute is a think - tank created in order to " place secession on the national agenda , encourage secessionist organizations , develop communication among existing and future secessionist groups , and create a body of scholarship to examine and promote the ideas and principles of secessionism . "
Secession certainly represents a contribution to that body of scholarship .
Naylor begins Secession by declaring that the United States today is an imperial power centralized in the hands of an oligarchic federal government that exercises too much of that power both at home and abroad .
Early on , Naylor offers the following insight , which sets the tone for the arguments he makes throughout the book :
A cursory study of world history reveals a self - evident truth .
No major empire anywhere at any time in history has ever proven to be sustainable .
Sustainability refers to the ability of a community , a town , a city , or a nation - state to ensure the availability of political , economic , agricultural , social , cultural , and environmental resources for future generations … ( p. 28 )
Naylor proceeds to offer a litany of arguments describing how the United States has become " unsustainable . "
In standard left - liberal style , he rails against big businesses like Wal - Mart that exploit their workforce and threaten to wipe out their smaller , local " mom and pop " competitors in Vermont and other parts of the nation .
Naylor further bemoans the " total market control " of large fast - food corporations such as McDonald 's that wield tremendous buying power over the nation 's food supplies , to the detriment of small family farms .
Both Naylor and Sale also point to the unsustainability of global warming , overused natural resources and excessive American importation and consumption of the world 's oil supplies .
In making such arguments , it is worth noting that Naylor either misses or ignores an important economic insight , consistently put forth by Austrian School economists in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises , that large - scale economic production , when channeled toward the service of the individual consumer and not governmentally - privileged corporations , provides lasting social benefits to society as a whole .
Such large - scale production for large - scale consumption is indicative of capitalism in its most genuinely laissez - faire form , unlike the business - government economic fascism that left - liberals such as Naylor and Sale appear too often to mislabel as genuine , free market capitalism .
As much as Naylor and Sale may be perceived by " right - wingers " as spokesmen for the political Left with all their talk of " sustainability " and the evils of McDonald 's and Wal - Mart , their arguments for secession nevertheless share much in common with right - libertarian political thought .
For instance , Naylor perceives America to be electorally corrupt and essentially a one - party system in which no real difference exists between the Republicans and Democrats when it comes to foreign policy .
In reading this , one is reminded of the " War Party " label that Antiwar.com writer and libertarian Justin Raimondo often ascribes to the bipartisan Republican / Democrat foreign policy consensus in Washington , D.C .
Naylor also recognizes that American imperialism is comprised of " both external and internal imperialism . "
Again , this dichotomy of imperialism may remind one of a similar " welfare / warfare state " dichotomy conceived by libertarian and Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard to describe the U.S. federal government as a symbiotic , interrelated domestic and foreign policy leviathan .
Naylor even cites libertarians Lew Rockwell and Thomas DiLorenzo as authorities on America 's internal imperialism , originating with the oppressive violations of civil liberties committed by former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln 's administration in the 1860s and continuing through to the present day with the current regime of President George W. Bush .
In a recent talk delivered at the Future of Freedom Foundation ’s conference on “ Restoring the Republic : Foreign Policy and Civil Liberties ” last month , Rockwell himself indirectly , but in a very cogent way , expands on Naylor 's attempt to put the purpose for secession in its proper perspective :
… Think of your local and state governments .
They tax and spend .
They manipulate and intervene .
As with all governments from the beginning of time , they generally retard social progress and muck things up as much as possible .
What they do not do , however , is wage massive global wars , run huge deficits , accumulate trillions in debt , reduce the value of money , bail out foreign governments , provide endless credits to failing enterprises , administer hugely expensive and destructive social insurance schemes , or bring about immense swings in business activity .
State and local governments are awful and they must be relentlessly checked , but they are not anything like the threat of the federal government .
Neither are they as arrogant and convinced of their own infallibility and indispensability .
They lack the aura of invincibility that the central government enjoys ….
From their own divergent political perspectives , Naylor ( despiser of Wal - Mart ) and Rockwell ( defender of Wal - Mart ) put forth essentially the same argument in favor of dismantling the federal government through secession .
This coming together of " left " and " right " may represent a new common ground among thinkers from different political places who happen to share the same anti-imperialist foreign policy values and understand that radical political decentralization may be the only true means to achieve those values .
With the emergence of the Middlebury Institute , this ideological common ground could lead to a growing political coalition for secession in the future as the American socioeconomic and geopolitical landscape continues to degenerate and the average American becomes increasingly disillusioned with the political status quo .
That being said , Naylor 's primary and more selfish motive as a secessionist is to achieve a sovereign Vermont republic , wholly independent of the United States .
To that end , he devotes a chapter that describes in some detail the uniqueness of Vermont as a state known for its political independence , grass - roots democracy , local markets , cultural heritage , and focus on clean environmental living .
Naylor recites the importance of Vermont 's colonial heritage and streak of independence as originating largely from its favorite son , the colonial - era hero Ethan Allan .
In telling Vermont 's story , Naylor provides a moral justification for preserving Vermont against the heavy hand of the U.S. federal government and all the " mega " - sized institutions that it bolsters .
It makes one think  if some day the majority of Vermonters wish to preserve their unique values and way of life within an independent Vermont , who are others to tell them " no " ?
And if Vermonters could do it , why not others ?
Perhaps the most important chapter in Secession is the cleverly - entitled " Untied States of America . "
By substituting " Untied " for " United , " Naylor paints an effective picture of the precise purpose for secession .
According to Naylor , secession is not meant to be disruptive or chaotic .
Rather , secession is meant to , among other things , " disengage . "
In fact , this is one of the four " Ds " of secession that Naylor lists  the other three being " Denunciation , " " Demystification , " and " Defiance . "
To all four of these " Ds " , one could add a fifth " D " — " Demolition " — which is exactly what Naylor does when he thoroughly refutes a number of preconceived notions and attitudes that most Americans have when it comes to the alleged unconstitutionality of secession and the overly - glorified Abraham Lincoln ( in the course of " demolishing " Lincoln , Naylor cites generously to DiLorenzo's The Real Lincoln and Lincoln Unmasked ) .
Reading Naylor here will make one at least rethink , and in all likelihood utterly reject , that oft - repeated and false notion that secession is nothing more than code for " slavery " and " states ' rights . "
With Secession , Thomas Naylor provides the average person trapped in the " black - box " of democracy with a short , easy - to - read book that lays out a new political frontier using persuasive and well - reasoned arguments .
Unlike most books published on secession , written mostly by political philosophers attempting to weigh the costs and benefits of secession under the assumption of some hypothetical Rawlsian " democratically just " state , Secession is one of the few books available that offers a truly normative case for breaking up the United States and many other of the world 's nation - states , using interdisciplinary arguments based on economics , politics , history , culture , and , most importantly , reason .
Secession is a path - breaking contribution to the secession literature , and arguably the first of many books on the topic that are sure to follow in the years to come .

In some ways , the Supreme Court term that just ended seems muddled : disturbing , highly conservative rulings on subjects like voting rights and gun control , along with important defenses of basic liberties in other areas , including the rights of detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The key to understanding the term lies in the fragility of the court ’s center .
Some of the most important decisions came on 5 - to - 4 votes  a stark reminder that the court is just one justice away from solidifying a far - right majority that would do great damage to the Constitution and the rights of ordinary Americans .
The Supreme Court abandoned its special role in protecting voting rights when it rejected a challenge to Indiana ’s harshly anti-democratic voter ID law .
Critics warned that the law , which bars anyone without a government - issued photo ID from voting , would disenfranchise poor people , minorities and the elderly , all of whom disproportionately lack drivers ’ licenses .
The critics were right .
In the Indiana presidential primary , shortly after the ruling , about 12 nuns in their 80s and 90s were turned away at the polls for not having acceptable ID .
In another sharp break with its traditions , the court struck down parts of the District of Columbia ’s gun-control law .
After seven decades of holding that the Second Amendment ’s right to bear arms is tied to raising a militia , the court reversed itself and ruled that it confers on individuals the right to keep guns in their homes for personal use .
The decision will no doubt add significantly to the number of Americans killed by gun violence .
Corporations fared especially well in this term .
The court reduced the punitive - damages award against Exxon Mobil for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill from $ 2.5 billion to about $ 500 million , a pittance for the energy company .
In the process , the court declared that in maritime cases , punitive damages should not exceed the actual damages in a case .
It is a rule that foils the purposes of punitive damages : to punish and to deter bad conduct .

Hah !
I just closed on $ 7.2 million of distressed mortgages at 57 % of the debt for an outlay of $ 4.1 million .
The government will pay me $ 3.1 million to get whole !
That means that every man , woman and child in Amerika owes me a penny .
And when I lever it up 30 times … you all will each owe me 30 cents !
Hey , this capitalist matrix sh-t is fun !

RR : Avoiding Artificial Class Hierarchies
Polymorphism is a cornerstone of object oriented programing .
It allows run-time resolution of the class function ( method ) to be called , depending on concrete type of the object .
This is of course extremely useful , but requirement for run-time resolution of function called should not be by itself the reason for deciding on a deep and complex class hierarchy .
If run -time resolution is all that is required , then much simpler solutions based on function pointers , or boost : : function object are much better suited .
Example
Here is a very simplified example from financial engineering of how one could easily get into complex hierarchies : class Opt { public : ///
Returns true if a barrier has been hit virtual bool barrier ( double S ) = 0 ; ///
Returns payoff at maturity for underlying price S virtual double pay ( double S ) = 0 ; } ; I.e. , a simple abstract virtual class that defines two functions , barrier and pay .
To define a concrete class you need to override the two pure virtual definitions with appropriate definitions .
Again a very simple example of a concrete class : class Vanilla : public Opt { ///
Strike double K ; public : bool barrier ( double S ) { return false ; } double pay ( double S ) { return ( S - K ) > 0 ?
S - K : 0 ; } } ;
Problem
The above classes work fine , and in this particular example may be the best way to describe the problem .
But , let us see what the potential problems with this approach are .
Imagine you wish to maximise code re-use and minimise the type of copy - and - paste programming that sometimes blights large project .
Also imagine there is a number of types of Opt that have no barrier , i.e. , barrier should always return false .
To prevent code duplication , it is nice to solve explicitly through inheritance : class NoBarrier : public
Opt { public : bool barrier ( double S ) { return false ; } } ; class Vanilla2 : public NoBarrier { ///
Strike double K ; public : double pay ( double S ) { return ( S - K ) > 0 ?
S - K : 0 ; } } ;
But thinking along the same , there are also a number of sub - types of Opt that have the pay of the type that Vanilla has .
One would then do : class PlainPay : public Opt { ///
Strike double K ; public : double pay ( double S ) { return ( S - K ) > 0 ?
S - K : 0 ; } } ; class Vanilla3 : public NoBarrier , public PlainPay { } ;
This resolves the code duplication issues , but at a cost of having a fairly complex class inheritance hierarchy .
In this problem this may be optimal solution , but sometimes what is required is something that is simpler .
Alternative
There are two basic requirements which lead to the hierarchy above :
We wished to keep two functions together that were n't necessarily closely related ( in this example barrier and pay )
and )
We wanted to minimise code duplication and maximise testability
If this is really all that is required , that it can be implemented directly very simply and without a complex class hierarchy : # include < boost/ function.hpp > # include < boost / bind.hpp > struct Opt { ///
Returns true if a barrier has been hit boost :: function < bool ( double x ) > barrier ; ///
Returns payoff at maturity for underlying price S boost :: function < double ( double x ) > pay ; } ; bool noBarrier ( double S ) { return false ; } double plainPay ( double S , double K ) { return ( S - K ) > 0 ?
S - K : 0 ; } ///
Return a plain vanilla option Opt Vanilla ( double K ) {
Opt o ; o . barrier = noBarrier ; o . pay = boost :: bind ( plainPay , _ 1 , K ) ; return o ; } Explanation
The basic requirement that we want to keep two functions together is easily implemented as a structure of two function objects .
In many ways this is making explicit what the virtual function mechanism in C++ does behind the scenes .
The implementation : struct Opt { ///
Returns true if a barrier has been hit boost :: function < bool ( double x ) > barrier ; ///
Returns payoff at maturity for underlying price S boost :: function < double ( double x ) > pay ; } ; is based on boost : : function objects rather than plain pointer because of the extra flexibility they provide ( see boost manual page for more details ) .
The run time resolution of which function to call is extremely explicit , in that at any point in the program the value of barrier or pay members can be assigned a different function or object .
Next up are the definitions of the pay off and barrier functions .
Because they can now be free functions , the are extremely simple and self contained .
Finally , there is a function that which creates an object with equivalent functionality to the example we had at the start : /// Return a plain vanilla option Opt Vanilla ( double K ) {
Opt o ; o . barrier = noBarrier ; o . pay = boost :: bind ( plainPay , _ 1 , K ) ; return o ; } Clearly this approach allows easy mix and match of functions to use for the barrier and pay members .
In this example , I made use of the boost : : bind function to avoid having to write the trivial class which just holds the value K ( c.f. PlainPay above ) .
Note that _1 is the placeholder for the parameter which is left free by the bind function .

קצת על הסיפור של בלוגלי ( בעיקר טכנאות ) מתוך הרצאה שהעביר תום סלע מהצוות שלנו בכנס אוגוסט פינגווי ן
2008 :
The US Department of Homeland Security has an annual budget of $ 40 billion .
Out of that money FEMA gets about one billion annually .
FEMA was created to combine all federal services into one giant agency that was to " manage " ALL national emergencies that happen within the United States .
Yet since this mega-agency was created , by combining 22 major government agencies into a single behemoth ; the people of this nation have not received real help during any local or national emergency , since the fraudulent creation of the Federal Emergency Mismanagement Agency .
The country is under siege by natural disasters at the moment :
From the fires in California to the floods in Iowa and beyond .
Freak tornados and record temperatures combine in many places while droughts alternate with floods throughout the nation :
And the two things missing in the coverage by the media are any questions about the nation 's total non-response and the lack of National Guard Troops anywhere :
Now , when their help is truly needed !
Our taxes paid for State National Guard troops but our Owners sent them to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight in failed political wars for private corporate profits .
Just this week $ 23 Billion of the money appropriated for Iraq has been found in the coffers of some of the largest military contractors in the US .
It 's a massive story of waste and abuse , and criminal war - profiteering , but the government scrubbed the video , almost immediately upon its release .
That 's what happens in America whenever the owners are uncomfortable ; they just kill the story and wait for the pubic to forget about it .
( 1 ) In the current series of disasters ; there are no troops here to help with evacuations , and the only help that FEMA is currently offering to victims of the Iowa flooding is : " save all your receipts , because you 'll need to prove what it cost you if you want any help after this is over . "
Whatever happened to the Red Cross ­ they never did much , but at least they put in a token appearance , pre-Bush & His Bandits !
Why was the National Weather Service not on top of this and working hand - in - glove with FEMA to provide pre-positioned food and water , for the victims ; as well as assisting with evacuations for the tens of thousands now homeless !
Does n't ' Emergency management ' mean having the national ability to plan ahead ?
That was how the Bushwhackers sold this fraudulent concoction to the public when Bush demanded this radical overhaul of the nation 's emergency services .
He got his white - elephant but all we got was his militarization of our local police , by private no -bid government contracts ( Blackwater & others ) combined with the complete absence of the State National Guard units and their very necessary heavy equipment .
FEMA has done nothing but FAIL since it appeared as the largest government agency in history : yet no one in congress is demanding investigations for those that keep on failing .
Apparently whatever FEMA does is just fine with congress , as they have never charged anyone for what was and is still being done to the victims of either Andrew , Katrina or any of their other failures , like the fires in Arizona and New Mexico .
FEMA has not tried to assist with either homes or jobs since those storms hit the gulf coast ; in fact in New Orleans FEMA was instrumental in destroying 5,000 perfectly good homes , untouched by the floods ­ homes that needed to be destroyed to make way for new housing on land that was deemed to be " too valuable " to house those that were living there "
That was FEMA in action then !
Where is FEMA now ­ and why has the so - called media not demanded more from this fraudulent government Agency !
Why is the stock market still going up ?
The country is falling apart and prices have n't begun to see the top of this nightmare , and yet our money is falling as fast as the price of oil is climbing ­ so why does the market keep on climbing !
Some say it 's an oil shortage , but that 's a lie !
The United States back in the 50's found ( and sealed ) enough oil and gas to fulfill all our needs for at least the next two hundred years ­ it 's SECRET and it 's still in Alaska .
( 2 ) The markets go up because the investor class is getting rich , hell they 've never had it so good , while the rest of us get crumbs and ashes and are told that " times are tough but our economy is sound . "
The rest of the planet knows the truth and they 're making damn sure their governments know they 're angry : so what 's wrong with us ?
Are we just like stray dogs ; not entitled to share in what we have continued to pay for ?
The Europeans and others are standing up for what they see as ' highway robbery . "
So what 's the matter with us !
( 3 ) The U.S. treasury , supposedly " our " treasury that this government managed to completely empty in the first seven years of perpetual war ; was not supposed to have been created to serve only the corporate bankers , but since 1913 that 's exactly who the Federal Reserve is serving , first , last , and always !
Here 's the history that no one in authority wants any American to know or understand .
( 4 ) So while you watch the fabulous footage of all the disasters , and listen to the tales of lost possessions and needless deaths ­ remember that your ' government ' created the Federal Emergency Mismanagement Agency , not to take care of people , but to insure that ordinary people would have no where to turn when disasters of any kind upend our lives !
Not true you say ?
Silence in the face of adversity is consent ­ and Americans have lost their ability to speak whenever this government acts ­just like we failed to call Nancy Pelosi on her criminal act , when she announced that " Impeachment was off the table . "
Since we did not object to that , in her latest bit of treason against us all she decided to block the bill in congress that would have forced Bush to ask congress for a vote before bombing Iran .
Pelosi did this out of her undying loyalty to the American Israeli Political Action Committee ; having placed Israel over and above the national interests of the American people and the lives and deaths of American troops for which she , as Speaker of the House of Representatives , is responsible .
( 5 ) Pelosi is also third in line for the presidency , and this is how she treats her constituents and her sacred oath of office !
Pelosi belongs in front of the War Crimes Tribunal , and the firing squad that will follow as one of the key members of those that will face prosecution for a whole range of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
If there was a congress she would have been censored , for interfering in the Impeachment process - but instead she was elected as " Speaker of the House . "
Tells you about all you need to know about your congress , does n't it !
Maybe , all things considered , we do n't deserve to have a functioning Emergency Management Agency , because from the facts in play above and below , it appears that we do not care about what happens to us ­ because we have placed our lives in the hands of these criminals without questioning anything they continue to do to those of us that pay them !

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Despite growing reports of serious and even fatal reactions to the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine , the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) announced today that people from other countries who want to become legal permanent residents of the US are required to have the HPV vaccination to protect against cervical cancer .
The new rule , outlined in the Centers for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) revised , stipulates " age - appropriate " groups , which means girls and young adult women , have to show proof of the vaccinations or they will not be granted legal permanent resident status in the U.S.
This marks another enormous marketing success for the drug giant Merck & Co. , maker of the HPV vaccine , Gardasil .
Merck has lobbied for virtual universal vaccination of females with the vaccine .
Gadisil is currently licensed in for use in girls and women ages 9 to 26 and many health and school officials are pushing to make the vaccinefor all girls by the age of 11 or 12 .
Some doctors are also offering Gardasil " off label " to women in their 20s to " catch - up " on their vaccinations .
Merck , whose profits from the vaccine are expected to be in the billions , also wants to market it to women ages 27 to 45 .
So far the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has denied that request .
The rationale for the current push in this country as well as in Europe to immunize against the HPV virus is the claim it protects women from developing HPV - caused genital warts and , most importantly , cervical cancer ( and other even more rare malignancies of the female reproductive tract ) .
However , a look at the statistics -- and risks associated with taking the vaccine  raise some common sense questions about both the safety and efficacy of Gardasil .
For example , American Cancer Society estimates that in 2008 , 11,070 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in this country .
With early detection , cervical cancer is highly treatable and curable .
But the HPV vaccine , Gardasil , has only been on the market since 2006 and has already been responsible forJudicial Watch , a public interest group , says the most recent reports show the vaccine has caused 21 deaths and 9,749 adverse reactions , including 78 outbreaks of the genital warts it is supposed to protect against , as well as 10 miscarriages .
And this may be the tip of the serious side effect iceberg when it comes to Gardasil : A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes only about 10 % of actual side effects end up being reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) .
There is mounting evidence Gardasil is n't even particularly effective .
The European Union , which , like the US government , is actively pushing for massive Gardasil vaccinations , admits on its consumer health web site that " HPV vaccination is not a replacement for routine cervical screening .. no vaccine is 100 % effective and HPV vaccines will not provide protection against non-vaccine HPV types , or against existing HPV infections .." HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) and close to 90 percent of all people who have sex get HPV at some point in their lives .
The more sexual partners you have , the more likely you will contract a form of the infection .
Six million Americans are infected with HPV every year but only a tiny percentage actually develop serious problems .
There are numerous strains of HPV yet only a few are linked to cancer .
What 's more , only about 10 percent of women who do contract the high - risk types of HPV on their cervix will develop long - lasting HPV infections that put them at risk for cervical cancer , according to the CDC 's own web site .
The site also states : " Most infections with high - risk HPV types do not lead to cancer .
The immune system can often remove the virus before it causes problems .
.. In most cases , the body fights off HPV naturally and the infected cells then go back to normal . "
The CDC experts also point out that people with HPV caused warts can use patient - applied creams to treat them  or just wait until they go away on their own .
Bottom line : A non-promiscuous lifestyle and a healthy immune system offer the best ways to guard against HPV and HPV - caused cancer .
Unfortunately , the new U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ruling demanding HPV vaccinations of new permanent legal permanent residents of this country is another worrisome step toward government mandated vaccinations that reduce individual health choice and freedom .

Pelosi : “ We will not simply hand over a $ 700 billion blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome . ”
Dems say they wo n’t get fooled again
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) says he ’s seen this movie before :
The Bush administration , citing an unprecedented national threat , puts the hammer on Congress to ram through gargantuan legislation with a minimum of review — and the murkiest of repercussions .
“ We will do something this week — but if we learned anything from right after 9/11 , it ’s that the biggest mistake is to pass anything they ask for just because it ’s an emergency , ” Leahy says .

The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman knows of what he speaks .
He sponsored the original Patriot Act , only to feel betrayed later when the Bush administration used it to justify domestic wiretapping .
Historically , breathtaking national crises have spurred Congress to act swiftly , sweepingly and in bipartisan lockstep , with ornery legislators casting aside years of bickering to produce consensus at breakneck speed .
But the current generation of Democratic congressional leaders feels burned — and not a little humiliated — by the Bush administration ’s use of the 2001 attacks to justify both the speedy enactment of the controversial and complex USA Patriot Act and congressional authorization of the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq .
“ They ca n’t get away with what they did in 2001 , ” Leahy said .
“ This will be ‘ trust but verify . ’
The biggest mistake they can make is holding a press conference while we ’re negotiating to say there ’s going to be a worldwide depression if Congress does n’t do exactly what we want them to . ”
The legislative hangover from 2001 is n’t going to derail — or even seriously stall — the $ 700 billion bailout .
The consequences of inaction are too grave .
But it has emboldened Democrats to seriously question Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s two - and - half page demand for the reins of the American economy , even as Paulson worked the Sunday shows to warn of economic Armageddon if a “ clean ” version of his bill is n’t passed soon .
If the coming week ’s theme song is “ Come Together , ” the B - side will be “ Wo n’t Get Fooled Again . ”
A spokeswoman for John McCain told reporters Sunday night that the GOP presidential candidate is “ greatly concerned ” that the Treasury plan “ gives a single individual power to spend $ 1 trillion on the basis of not much more than ‘ trust me . ’” McCain wants a high - profile oversight board to watch over the bailout .
In a statement issued Sunday afternoon , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) said Democrats believe a “ responsible solution ” should include oversight of the bailout plan , help for homeowners and “ constraints ” on the compensation received by executives whose companies will be bailed out .
" We will not simply hand over a $ 700 billion blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome .
Democrats will act responsibly to insulate Main Street from Wall Street , ” Pelosi said .
" As we proceed to deal with this crisis , this is clear recognition that the party is over for the Bush administration 's anything goes , failed economic policies that have damaged our economy , undermined the middle class and further pointed out the need for a new direction . "
Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer , who has written a history of Congress in the 20th century , says the Democrats will try to extract whatever they can out of Paulson — but must eventually bow to the reality that the perils of not acting quickly are just too devastating , economically and politically .
“ It ’s a huge danger to not do something , ” said Zelizer .
“ There ’s a knowledge that this is being rushed through and that there are likely to be unintended consequences , but the middle of a financial meltdown is not conducive to saying we need another week to look at this .
...
It ’s hard to imagine there will be any speed bumps . ”
Nonetheless , Democrats are under mounting pressures not to roll over .
Republicans may be facing the bankruptcy of their free - market philosophy , but Democrats could face a populist backlash from blue - collar voters if they are perceived as Paulson ’s poodles .
After regaining Congress on pledges of fighting for common people , the party of Jefferson is on the precipice of approving a $ 700 billion , no - strings - attached gift to the most wealthy and — in the eyes of some — least responsible Americans .
And that could prompt some blowback from voters .
“ The public does n’t like a blank check , ” former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said in Politico ’s Arena forum .
“ They think this whole bailout idea is nuts .
They see fat cats on Wall Street who have raked in zillions for years , now extorting in effect $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 from every American family to make up for their own nonfeasance , malfeasance , greed and just plain stupidity . ”
Reich notes that the bailout proposal comes as many Americans are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of gas , food and health insurance .
“ And so , ” he said , “ the public is asking :
Why should Wall Street get bailed out by me when I ’m getting screwed ? ”
On Sunday , congressional leaders said they agreed with Paulson ’s desire to quickly pass a bill unencumbered by a “ Christmas tree ” of additional demands .
But Democrats also seemed to be holding their ground on requests that the unprecedented measure also include limits on executive compensation and workouts for homeowners coping with foreclosure .
“ It would be a grave mistake to say that we 're going to buy up the bad debt that resulted from the bad decisions of these people and then allow them to get billions of dollars on the way out , " House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation ” Sunday .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , chairman of the Joint Economic Committee , estimated there ’s a 50 percent chance that the measure will pass both houses by Friday while reiterating his desire that the Paulson plan also help middle - class homeowners .
That position was adopted by Barack Obama , who broke his silence on the plan Sunday , calling on Congress to “ act quickly in a bipartisan fashion to resolve this crisis . ”
He also criticized the Paulson plan as a “ blank check , ” demanding “ independent accountability and oversight , ” some kind of mortgage relief and tighter regulations on banks .
Obama did n’t say whether these changes should be part of the current bill or addressed in later legislation .
That may be the crucial question this week : Can Democrats succeed in loading their proposals onto Paulson ’s runaway legislative train — or will they be content with promises that their concerns will be addressed soon after ?
Leahy is n’t sure how things will work out .
But he says Paulson ’s reputation as a straight shooter means it ’s more likely that Democrats will trust his assurances .
“ Paulson carries far more credibility than most people in the administration — apart from [ Defense Secretary ] Bob Gates , ” Leahy says .

5 diseases that are thriving thanks to global warming
Feature photo by pingnews.com .

Global climate change is extending the reach of diseases once found only in tropical regions .
Do you think tropical diseases only occur in developing countries ?
Think again .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) says diseases are spreading to temperate regions thanks to global warming .
Warmer temperatures and greater moisture extend the geographic range and season for disease - vector organisms such as insects and rodents .
Below are diseases that could have you feeling the sting of global warming .
Malaria
Malaria is spread by the Anopheles mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite .
Warmer and wetter climates trigger increased mosquito abundance , biting rates , activity level , and accelerated incubation of their parasites .
Winter temperatures must drop below 16 ºC to prevent a malaria outbreak the following spring .
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) projects that warmer temperatures will put 65 % of the world ’s population at risk of infection — an increase of 20 % .
This news is especially frightening in light of increased resistance to the chloroquine treatment drugs .
Malaria has already hit Texas , New Jersey , Michigan , and New York .

Dengue Fever
Dengue fever is spread by the Aedes mosquito infected with the Flavivirus virus .
The geographic range of the mosquito is limited by freezing temperatures that kill larvae and eggs , thus limiting transmission to tropical and subtropical regions .
With no vaccine , “ breakbone ” fever is considered the most serious mosquito - borne viral disease affecting humans .
But studies by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and U.S. Department of Agriculture predict dengue ’s encroachment upon temperate regions due to small increases in temperature .
The mosquito has spread as far north as Chicago and the Netherlands and to higher elevations of the Andes .
With no vaccine , “ breakbone ” fever is considered the most serious mosquito - borne viral disease affecting humans .
Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an arthropod - borne disease present in many forms , including St. Louis , equine , La Crosse , and West Nile .
New York experienced outbreaks of both West Nile Virus ( WNV ) and St. Louis encephalitis in 1999 during its driest and hottest spring and summer in a century .
Those weather patterns favorable to outbreaks — heat and drought followed by heavy downpours — will likely occur more often with global warming .
Small stagnant pools of water that accompany drought are big enough to support breeding mosquitoes but not populations of the frogs that prey on them .

Bubonic Plague
Bubonic plague is spread by rodents and their fleas infected with the bacterium Yersinia pestis .
A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that global warming promotes outbreaks of “ black death . ”
A 1ºC increase in springtime temperatures is predicted to lead to more than a 50 % increase in the prevalence of the bacterium .
A study in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene reports a 60 % rise in plague cases in New Mexico following wetter than average winters and springs .
Wetter conditions enhance food resources for rodents and promote flea survival and reproduction .
Cholera
Cholera is a waterborne disease present in drinking water and food contaminated with the bacterium , Vibrio cholerae .
The WHO links the spread of cholera with increases in sea surface temperature , sea level rise , and El Niño - Southern Oscillation .
The U.S. EPA reports that algal blooms , which can be accompanied by cholera , become more frequent with warming temperatures .
Cholera - harboring zooplankton also proliferates in warmer water temperatures .

What you can do
The IPCC warns that global warming will result in human mortality from infectious disease .
Unlike the typical U.S. approach of emergency response to epidemics , a preventive approach would preclude unnecessary suffering , infection , and loss of life .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) provides information on prevention , vaccines , and epidemics .
Below are things you can do to reduce your chance of infection .
Get vaccinated for cholera and yellow fever when visiting areas with epidemics .
Prevent exposure to mosquitoes and ticks .
You can do this by : wearing long sleeves and pants , and avoiding outdoor activity between dusk and dawn during mosquito season .
Eliminate sources of food and nesting places for rodents and treat your pets for fleas .
Tell your doctor if you work outdoors or have exposure to disease - vector organisms .
The symptoms of many diseases are similar to the common flu and are therefore misdiagnosed , especially by doctors in temperate regions who are unfamiliar with the diseases .
Do your part to help stop global warming and support environmental legislation .
Stopping global warming will slow the spread of diseases and obviate the need for widespread spraying of dangerous pesticides such as Malathion .
Often policymakers do not take action on environmental issues unless it affects human health so maybe this will be their wake - up call to do something about global warming .
U.S. Interrogator Recalls Mass Detentions
Created : August 25 , 2008 14:06 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

When Joshua Casteel arrived at Abu Ghraib in June 2004 to interrogate detainees , he knew how notorious the Iraqi prison was .
He arrived in the wake of a still - notorious scandal .
Earlier that spring , CBS News and The New Yorker magazine published the infamous photographs from late 2003 , showing U.S. military police torturing terrified Iraqis .
With that , the American jail had been transformed into a symbol of U.S. human - rights abuses .
Yet the young Army interrogator , then age 24 , never expected to discover a systemic problem just as crippling to the war effort : intelligence collection in total disarray , leading to mass detentions .
This , Casteel noted , is precisely the sort of thing that creates terrorists .
Under pressure from his commanders , Casteel was ordered to interrogate detainees at length even after he was convinced they knew little or nothing about the insurgency — a diversion of resources that , he said , wasted time and energy .
Worse , he was cut off from the rest of the intelligence process , lacking the ability to judge the reliability of those whose confessions and anonymous tips had led to the detentions of the men he interrogated .
In addition , he was given a quota of so - called “ actionable intelligence ” he had to get out of his interrogations , regardless of whether those he interrogated knew anything valuable .
Then , when his interrogations ended , he was never able to learn if those arrested as the result of his interrogations were dangerous terrorists or innocent people .

The result of this disjointed process is what Casteel describes as the needless detention of untold thousands of Iraqis , something human - rights groups have protested all the way to the U.N. Security Council .
“ The large nets we were casting , ” Casteel , now 28 , said over the course of two extended telephone interviews , meant “ we would be looking for four [ people ] , and we came back with 80 . ”
These and other problems eventually led Casteel — who has spoken little to the press — to declare himself a conscientious objector .
Casteel , now a graduate student pursuing an MFA in nonfiction writing in Iowa City , grew up in what he described as a right - wing , religious household in Iowa , where he was president of the local Young Republicans chapter .
He attended West Point , but when he did n’t graduate — “ I hated it , ” he said — he decided to join the Army as an enlisted soldier .
Casteel was trained at Ft. Huachuca , Ariz. , home of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center , where the Army prepares its small cadre of professional interrogators according to standards compliant with the Geneva Conventions .
When he arrived in Iraq as part of the 202nd Military Intelligence Battalion , in June 2004 , Casteel ’s superiors were eager to reinforce his professionalism .
With the Abu Ghraib scandal sending shockwaves around the world , the prison ’s wardens established a zero - tolerance policy for any further abuse .
“ I ’d have to have my interrogation strategy approved by my section chief , ” said Casteel , “ by the chief of the interrogation center , by a psychologist and by the lawyers from the JAG corps . ”
There were monthly meetings to re-emphasize the prohibition on touching detainees “ except on occasion for a gesture of reassurance . ”
Casteel never witnessed any abuse at the prison .
But despite the lack of abuse , the system was still malfunctioning .
During the course of his six months at Abu Ghraib , he estimated he performed more than 130 interrogations , lasting from 20 minutes to five hours .
His interrogation strategies varied .
Sometimes he ’d share a cigarette and an off - color depiction of President George W. Bush with his subjects .
Other times , he ’d offer to move the families of his interrogation subjects to safer places in Iraq if they ’d cooperate — despite such promises being outside of his power to deliver .
Yet the interrogations often did n’t end even though Casteel might have been convinced a subject did n’t have usable , relevant or reliable information .
When he would write a report concluding that he had exhausted his interrogation strategy , his superiors , under pressure to get information to combat a vicious insurgency , would “ say I had not tried all available methods . ”
Sometimes , he said , a detainee who Casteel believed did n’t know anything would have to be needlessly re-interrogated “ for months . … I wasted time because of this . ”
The case of the five brothers remains fresh in his mind .
Allegedly graduates of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Yemen , five Iraqi brothers had landed at Abu Ghraib as the result of a tipster .
Casteel was assigned to their cases .
One of the most important things he wanted to know was who “ dimed them out ” — but he could n’t find anyone who kept track of the Army ’s so called “ human sources , ” more commonly known as “ snitches . ”
A series of “ very fruitless interrogations ” led Casteel to believe that none of the five brothers knew anything about the insurgency .
But he was n’t able to secure their release from Abu Ghraib .
Four of the brothers underwent polygraph examinations during Ramadan — when the traditional Muslim fast threw off their biorhythms , Casteel believes — and two of them failed .
Policy at the prison held that anyone who failed a polygraph would continue to be detained .
Frustrated , Casteel asked a visiting general — he does n’t remember who , he said — how the Army was keeping track of the reliability of its human informants .
The general , in Casteel ’s recollection , “ went into a description of an electronic database I had never heard of , ” he said .
Confused , he asked his chief what the general had referred to .
As Casteel recalls , “ The chief said ‘ The Pentagon somehow believes we have a database that does n’t exist . ’ ”
Pentagon spokespeople did not respond to a list of emailed questions about Casteel ’s account of Abu Ghraib and the interrogation process .
But the portrait of a fractured intelligence process rang true to A.J. Rossmiller , who spent 2005 in Baghdad as a civilian analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency .
“ Interrogators often get detainees with little or no information along with them , and even after they are interrogated , there is little feedback to help the interrogators know whether the detainees were honest in their statements , ” emailed Rossmiller , author of a book about intelligence in Iraq , “ Still Broken . ”
“ Interrogators and analysts alike rarely get information about follow - on operations based on their work , again making it impossible to evaluate how they ’re doing .
Further , when units send a detainee to be interrogated , they rarely get the results , so they do n’t know whether they got a bad guy or somebody who was in the wrong place at the wrong time . ”
There may not have been an informants ’ database , but there was a relentless push for so - called “ actionable intelligence ” — that is , intelligence that might lead to the defeat of an enemy attack ; discovery of a weapons cache , or the roundup of insurgents .
Casteel and his colleagues had to meet a quota for actionable intelligence .
“ We had to have an actionable - intelligence report of everyone we interrogated , ” he said , “ Every interrogation .
It was asinine . ”
To meet his quota , Casteel and his colleagues would write reports that could lead to the arrest of practically anyone .
“ People started writing [ in the reports , ] ’ 5 - foot - 8 Arab male in eastern Falluja ; works with the Mujahideen . ’”
The result was widespread arrests — but Casteel never learned whether anyone picked up as the result of his interrogations in fact possessed any worthwhile intelligence .
“ In this war , they only want to hear they got the right guy , even if he is the wrong guy , ” emailed Malcolm Nance , a 20 - year veteran of the U.S. intelligence community who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan and now runs the International Anti-Terrorism Center for Excellence in Hudson , N.Y .
“ This is a really bad way to do business as the impact on the population is pretty heavy .
It creates many more insurgent recruits as fast as we can throw them into Camp Bucca . ”
It is unknown precisely how many Iraqis have been detained since the March 2003 invasion .
But in June , Human Rights
Watch wrote a letter to the U.N. Security Council expressing concern about the approximately 22,000 detainees held as of May 2008 .
“ Human Rights Watch shares the concern of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq that many detainees are held for lengthy periods without judicial review and under review processes that do not meet international standards of due process as applicable during a non-international armed conflict , ” the human - rights group wrote .
Some veterans of the intelligence community gave a qualified defense of the fractured process .
Nance pointed out that security concerns often demanded compartmentalization of information , even among interrogators .
“ Military interrogation is not like police interrogation — where knowledge of all aspects of the case is key , ” Nance said .
“ I know it sounds illogical , but it ’s for operational security . ”
Another intelligence veteran , who recently left the intelligence community but requested anonymity , made a similar point .
“ The U.S. military had thousands of people into the detention system at any given moment , and there were n’t enough interrogators to follow any particular strand to its conclusion , ” said the intelligence vet in an email .
“ Sometimes this needle in the haystack method works – sometimes we get lucky .
But as a grand strategy , it ’s not a great one . ”
While the Pentagon did not respond to queries about what might have changed in the intelligence process , there is at least some reason to believe that improvements have taken place .
The U.S. military command in Iraq maintains a database of biometric information about the so - called Sons of Iraq — ex-insurgents now on the U.S. payroll — which suggests that an actual database for human sources of intelligence is not , at the least , beyond the U.S. ’s capabilities .
Furthermore , U.S. commanders have said for nearly a year that the so - called “ population - protection ” strategy instituted by Gen.
David H. Petraeus has engendered an increase in intelligence tips from Iraqis , though it is impossible to verify whether the result has been an increase in quality information .
Rossmiller is skeptical .
“ There continues to be a massive problem with intelligence collection , analysis , and dissemination in the U.S. operation in Iraq , ” he said in an email .
“ Everyone tends to err on the side of detention , to the detriment of classic counter - insurgency doctrine , not to mention basic communication and common sense . ”
As Casteel sees it , common sense eventually prevented him from being able to complete his mission .
“ I kept encountering things that put my duty and my job in conflict with my faith , ” Casteel remembered .
Five months into his Abu Ghraib tour , he interrogated a 22 - year old who , by his own admission , had come to Iraq from Saudi Arabia to fight U.S. troops .
When it became clear to Casteel that the Saudi had “ never fired a gun , ” the two men began talking frankly about politics and religion .
“ He tried to convert me to Islam , ” Casteel said .
And then the jihadi said something that Casteel could n’t put out of his mind .
“ You ’re a very strange man , ” the jihadi told Casteel .
“ You call yourself a Christian , but you do n’t do what Christ does , you do n’t turn the other cheek . ”
Casteel , by his own account exhausted by his stint at the prison , had a religious awakening .
“ I said , ‘ I think you ’re right , ’ ” he remembered .
“ The most important people in my life have been prisoners : Jesus , Dietrich Bonhoffer , the apostle Paul .
It was then that I had broken objectivity . ”
Casteel notified his chain of command that he would “ follow all lawful orders ” but sought conscientious objector status .
He left Iraq shortly thereafter , and ultimately got out of the Army on May 30 , 2005 .
Afterward , Casteel — now a committed Catholic — linked up with Catholics United , a liberal Catholic activist group , and Iraq Veterans Against the War .
In March , Casteel testified as part of Iraq Veterans Against the War ’s Winter Soldier conference , in which Iraq and Afghanistan veterans spoke about what they characterized as systemic abuses in the U.S. occupation of Iraq .
He is currently part of a Catholics United effort to raise awareness about U.S. - sponsored torture in Iraq , Afghanistan and the detention complex at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
And he remains unsure if , over the course of interrogating 130 detainees at Abu Ghraib , he ever gathered valuable , truthful information .
“ One guy was charged with tons of things , [ like ] throwing grenades , ” Casteel remembered .
“ He did nine months prison , and I interrogated him 30 times .
All we did was smoke cigarettes and make fun of George Bush . ”
The interrogator encouraged the suspected insurgent to “ tattle ” on people he was enemies with .
“ I got information and the higher - ups thought it was valuable , ” Casteel continued .
“ There were bombs dropped , and raids on houses , but I never knew if the information was worth something . ”
( Recasts lead , adds VIX closing levels in paragraph 2 and fresh analyst comments in paragraphs 5 , 6 , 9 )
CHICAGO , Sept 17 ( Reuters ) - The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX or VIX , Wall Street 's main barometer of investor fear , closed on Wednesday at its highest level in almost six years as fretful investors scrambled for options to protect portfolios and drove risk premiums higher .
Rattled investors dumped equities due to worries the U.S. government rescue of insurer American International Group AIG .
N would not stem market turmoil .
As a result , volume and volatility soared in the options market .
The VIX jumped 14.84 percent to 36.22 and posted its highest close since Oct. 10 , 2002 .
This week ’s 10.43 point gain in the VIX is its biggest three - day rally since Aug. 5 , 2002 .
“ Suffice to say , judging by the VIX , anxiety , pessimism and fear have reached an extreme , ” said options strategist Frederic Ruffy at web site WhatsTrading.com .
The VIX measures near - term anticipated stock market volatility embedded in Standard & Poor 's 500 index .SPX option prices .
“ Investors are waking up to the reality that nothing is safe in the investment world .
The continued weakness in banks leaves the entire market vulnerable , ” said Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group .
The options fear gauge generally rises when the S&P benchmark falls and has topped the 30 level during this week ’s steep stock market sell - off and crisis regarding the stability of the financial industry .
Trading in the index options market was brisk on Wednesday .
In the S&P 500 puts , volume surged to three times the usual with about 1.3 million SPX puts and 624,000 calls traded on the day , according to option analytics firm Trade Alert .
“ Investors are frantic , driving the VIX to the most fearful level of the day .
They have been bidding up the price of options with the aim of protecting their portfolios against further wild swings in stocks , ” Wilkinson added .
“ These are difficult times for traders and investors because of the high volatility leading to moves that are larger and more unexpected and more disconcerting from a risk standpoint , ” said Herb Kurlan , chief executive of vTrader Pro , an online trading firm .
WINNIPEG , Manitoba ( Reuters ) - A man sleeping on a Greyhound bus as it rolled across the Canadian Prairies was killed and decapitated by his seatmate as horrified passengers fled to safety in the night , witnesses and police said on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
“ All of a sudden , we all heard this scream , this bloodcurdling scream , ” said Garnet Caton , who was sitting just in front of the victim on the bus .
Caton said that when the attack was over , the knife - wielding killer displayed his victim ’s severed head to the onlookers .
A 40 - year - old man was taken into custody at the scene on Wednesday evening on a desolate stretch of the TransCanada Highway about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) from Portage la Prairie , Manitoba , but has not been charged , according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Police declined to speculate on what prompted the attack , and witnesses said the victim and killer , who apparently did not know each other , had enjoyed a casual cigarette break with other passengers only minutes before the attack .
Witnesses described a scene of bloody mayhem that erupted without warning on the bus , which was traveling east to Winnipeg , Manitoba , on a routine scheduled run .
“ The attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife -- a survival , Rambo knife -- holding the guy and continually stabbing him , stabbing him , stabbing him in the chest area , ” Caton told CBC Television .
The attack continued as other passengers fled the bus and waited for police , Caton said .
He said he , the driver and another passenger desperately tried to hold the bus door closed to prevent the attacker from leaving .
“ He calmly walks up to the front ( of the bus ) with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us , ” Caton said .
“ There was no rage in him ...
It was just like he was a robot or something . ”
Police praised the calmness and cooperation of the passengers , who were taken to a hotel in Brandon , Manitoba , and were being given crisis counseling and other assistance by authorities and Greyhound .
“ Believe me , if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would , ” RCMP staff Sargent Steve Colwell said in a statement to the passengers that was read to reporters in Winnipeg .
Passengers said they were having difficulty coping .
“ I tried to get to lay down at 4 o’clock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time I closed my eyes I ’d see this man in the window with some guy ’s head I had just smoked a cigarette with , ” Cody Omstead told CTV News .
Greyhound said in a statement that it was cooperating with police to determine what happened .
It said that intercity bus travel remained the safest mode of transportation in the country .

The death toll from a passenger plane crash at Madrid 's Barajas airport has risen to 153 , Spain 's government says .
Nineteen people survived when the plane swerved off the runway but some are in critical condition , said Development Minister Magdalena Alvarez .
It is thought the left engine caught fire as the Spanair flight took off for the Canary Islands at about 1420 ( 1220 GMT ) with 172 people on board .
Helicopters dumped water on the burning plane and some 70 ambulances attended .
In pictures : Plane crash Eyewitness account Long wait for answers Spain 's development minister told a news conference that investigators had ruled out foul play and considered the crash an accident .
As night fell , recovery teams were still removing bodies from the crash site , which is now silent and in darkness , except for the occasional flashing blue lights of emergency vehicles , the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Madrid says .
See satellite image of airport Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero cut short his holiday in the south of the country to visit the scene of the crash .
Speaking at the airport , he said : " The government will make all its efforts to support the families in this hard moment as they have received the news of such tragedy . "
Spanish journalist Manuel Moleno , who was near the area when the accident happened , said the plane appeared to have " crashed into pieces " .
" We heard a big crash .
So we stopped and we saw a lot of smoke , " he said .
A British man who witnessed the aftermath of the accident , Alan Gemmell , told the BBC : " The whole back end of the plane was just burned to a crisp . "
Safety record Spanair flight JK 5022 , bound for Las Palmas in the Canary Islands , came down during or shortly after take - off from Terminal Four at Barajas .
TV footage showed the plane had come to rest in a field .
Now the crash site is essentially a huge patch of scorched earth , our correspondent says .

かつて はIntel CPU向けチップセットの主流メーカーとして隆盛を誇っていたVIAが、IntelやAMD向けのチップセットビジネスからは撤退する方向であることがCustom
PCに掲載されています。VIAは現在x86互換プロセッサや統合マザーボードに注力しており、「将来性が見えない」Intel/AMD向けチップセット事業を打ち切る方針のようです。
台湾VIAのvice president of corporate marketing であ る Richard Brown氏は 、Custom PCとのインタビューで次のように述べています。
「われわれがもともとx86プロセッサビジネスに参入した主な理由は、サードパーティチップセット市場が消えかかっているからだ。また我々は（CPU、チップセットを含めた）「
Complete platform」を提供できる。さらにインテルはインテルプロセッサ向けのチップセットで非常に多くの製品を提供しており、またそれを追ってAMDも同じ戦略を取ろうとしている」
確かに現在で はIntel CPU向けチップセットはほぼIntelの寡占状態であり、AMD向けのチップセットとしてもNVIDIAとAMD（旧ATI）が主流となっている現在ではVIAが新たに参入する余地はほとんどないのでしょう。ちょっと残念ではありますが、C7/Nanoでの巻き返しに期待したいところです。

Buffett has said he plans to support the Democratic Party in the 2008 elections , as it seeks to retake the White House .
He has not endorsed Clinton or Obama for the presidency , but said on CNBC television : “ I would put either one of them in charge of a business . ”
Separately , Buffett identified Walt Disney Co’s Bob Iger as among chief executives who are doing a good job and who run a company in which Berkshire does not invest .
Earlier on CNBC , Buffett put the CEOs of warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp and nuts and bolts distributor Fastenal Co in that group .

Backers of a ballot measure that would require parents to be notified before an abortion is performed on a minor acknowledged Friday that the 15 - year - old on which “ Sarah ’s Law ” is based had a child and was in a common - law marriage before she died of complications from an abortion in 1994 .
Proponents of the measure recently submitted an argument for the state voter guide saying the death of “ Sarah ” might have been prevented but her parents were not told she had had an abortion and so did not know the reason for her failing health .
The proposal , Proposition 4 , will appear on California ’s statewide ballot in November .
In court papers filed in her home state of Texas after her death , the man with whom she lived declared himself her common - law husband in an effort to secure custody of the child .
Texas recognizes common - law marriage and does not view a married 15 - year - old as a minor , according to an attorney for Planned Parenthood .
A lawsuit co-sponsored by Planned Parenthood Affiliates and filed Friday in Sacramento County Superior Court asks the secretary of state to remove the girl ’s story and other information it deemed misleading , including any reference to “ Sarah ’s Law , ” from the material submitted for the official voter guide .

“ If you ca n’t believe the Sarah story , there ’s a lot in the ballot argument you ca n’t believe , ” said Ana Sandoval , a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood and the campaign against Proposition 4 .
Backers of the initiative said they learned the details after submitting the ballot argument last month and would review the lawsuit before deciding whether to amend the language for the voter guide .
“ However , she was still 15 and was not equipped to make medical decisions on her own , whether she was living with the father of her child or not , ” said Erica Little , a spokeswoman for the campaign supporting the proposition .
She confirmed that “ Sarah ” was Jammie Garcia Yanez - Villegas , who died in Texas in 1994 .
The name Sarah was used to protect her identity .

“ We will modify the way we present Sarah to be accurate with the information , ” Little said .
“ But we do n’t think the use of her story is marred . ”
Planned Parenthood argues that the Sarah story should be dropped from the voter pamphlet because a parental notification law would not have applied in her case .
Proposition 4 would amend the California Constitution to prohibit abortion for unemancipated minors until 48 hours after a physician notifies the minor ’s parent or legal guardian .
State voters have twice rejected similar measures .

Supporters of the measure , including Orange County Dist .
Atty .
Tony Rackauckas , signed a ballot argument that cites “ Sarah ’s ” death as an example of why the law is needed .
“ Had someone in her family known about the abortion , Sarah ’s life could have been saved , ” the supporting argument reads .
Sarah ’s story was challenged in the rebuttal argument filed for the voter ’s guide by a group that included Kathy Kneer , president of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California .
“ Nothing in Prop. 4 would have prevented her tragic death , ” the rebuttal says .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela accused 60 Colombian troops on Saturday of entering just inside its territory in what it said was a provocation by a warmongering government seeking to destabilize the region .

In an incident likely to stoke already high tensions between the two South American neighbors , Venezuela said the soldiers were intercepted 500 yards over the border and immediately made to return to the Colombian side .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , a Washington ally who has received billions in U.S. aid to counter a guerrilla conflict , said he asked defense officials to investigate the accusation .
“ If it is true our troops entered in there , then we will offer our apologies .
If it is not , we will give our explanation , ” Uribe told reporters at a news conference .
“ All we want is to have good relations with our neighbors , ” he said .
The alleged incursion occurred on Friday , a day after President Hugo Chavez vowed to review diplomatic and trade ties following an Interpol investigation that helped reinforce Colombian charges he supports Marxist guerrillas in Colombia .
Ties in the region have frayed since Colombia raided inside Venezuela ’s leftist ally and fellow OPEC member Ecuador and killed a rebel leader in March .
Ecuador broke off relations and Chavez ordered tanks to the sparsely populated border that snakes through jungle and mountains .
“ Venezuela views with concern that this act of provocation comes at a time when our government has denounced the belligerent policy of the Colombian government that is deliberately looking to destabilize the region , ” the foreign ministry said in a protest note distributed to the media .
For years , it has been thought troops and rebels from both sides occasionally strayed across remote parts of the border .
But diplomatic protests are rare and Saturday ’s was the first such complaint since Colombia ’s raid into Ecuador .
Despite bouts of brinkmanship and the risk of military missteps on the border , political analysts say a conflict is highly unlikely , especially as the neighbors ’ economies heavily depend on cross - border trade .
Last week ,
Tony joked on Jaws ' involvement in the AFL , but this week 's MNF Video of the Night features new material from our good friend Emmitt !
It 's been a few Mondays since Smith was on Countdown , and it really only takes one night of Emmitt to realize just how much I miss him when he 's not there .
Today 's video is a clip of Smith explaining why Shawne Merriman should n't let the Chargers " co-horse " him into getting season ending surgery ....
Just plain lame !
Everything he says at this point just cracks me up .
Even words I 've actually heard before , I have to go back and check to see if they actually exist .
It 's really fun as hell .... I suggest you try it sometime .
The guy could seriously recite passages from War and Peace flawlessly , and I would still just start giggling like a little kid .
I honestly love the guy .
In other news , ESPN actually aired a Football game last night without pointless and inane interruptions .
Someone was apparently missing , but I still can't quite figure out who that was .
Anyone have any suggestions ?
Onto the quotes ...._______________________F
the quotes .
Since you are all such a great reading audience , I 'm going to forego your night in quotes for .... wait for it .... BONUS EMMITT TIME !!!!!!!
Nick who ?
Out of my mouth to your ears one thing I can promise you this .... I love me some Emmitt .
Oh and if you did n't know , " LT " stands for LaDanian Tomlinson and the " opening season " is .... well I have no idea what that is .

Illinois pols are getting ready for up to 8 years of non -stop battles , hassles , and side - cut deals over the 2016 Olympics that Chicago is hoping to host .
And smart , scheming politicians are already lining up their interests to either tie them somehow to the Olympics or are seeking to trade their support ( if and when necessary ) for the benefit of their own local issues .
It seems that the city is considered a very strong “ maybe ” right now to land the Games ; the feeling seems to be that if autocratic leader Mayor Daley could somehow be guaranteed to be in charge through 2016 , the International Olympic Committee would not hesitate to award him the Games .
And while nobody currently doubts Daley ’s re-election chances in 2011 and 2015 , the realistic fact is that the 2016 Daley would be 74 years old – the same age that his father finally shuffled off of the Fifth Floor on City Hall .
The Olympic bid is officially headed up by Pat Ryan , the founder and executive chairman of insurance giant Aon Corporation .
( Also , after the imprisonment of George Ryan , the electoral flame - out of Jim Ryan , and the sex - swinging embarrassment of Jack Ryan , the longtime - Bush - supporting ( but , technically , non-politician )
Pat is the only IL GOP Ryan remaining standing among all of these unrelated men … )
And Ryan is starting to find just how fine the line may be that he has to walk the Olympics between big - bucks businessmen and local pols who can start to smell the meat a - cookin’ .
Last week , Ryan had an appearance in front of the fat cats of the Executives ’ Club of Chicago , promoting the Olympic bid to the more than 1,000 connected and influential attendees .
Slyly , and with a fine - line - walking demeanor himself , state Senator ( and local activist Reverend ) James Meeks also showed up at the meeting , seeking to parallel his ongoing school - funding crusade with the spend - all - we- need Olympics quest .
( This , only another week after Meeks had led – then subtly ended – a crafty school walk - out that bused Chicago Public School students to well - budgeted suburban schools to demonstrate the financial differences between the systems ; the CPS students behaved well , and the suburban systems welcomed and bonded with their visitors . )
Ryan agreed to answer Sen .
Meeks written questions and meet with him to further discuss and address the school budgeting questions .
He also said that the ongoing positive attitudes – and cash flow – surrounding the Olympics would end up benefiting all of the community ’s needs .
And here ’s where the canny Meeks can claim completely post - modern awareness of his position and how to get the most useful attention to his cause :
Rather than leading chanting , placard - bearing protesters , he showed up professionally and prepared .
“ We did n’t come here to be disruptive , ” he said .
“ We want to make sure that the business community is paying as much attention to the crisis we have in education . ”
He did not seek to confront or pressure Ryan , but to spell out details of school financing that could be worked on and to seek Ryan ’s potential assistance – and , of course , media attention for his cause .
Clearly aware of his eventual need of the big names behind the Games bid to help get the most out of his education - funding quest , he also was careful to balance the Mayor ’s and Ryan ’s goals with his own desires :
“ This is a city where we have broad shoulders – where we have Cubs and White Sox …we can have great Olympics and great schools .
But we should have a commitment to do them both . ”
The men cordially agreed to meet in the future to further discuss the subject in detail .
Sen .
Meeks is basically seeking a swap of the taxes that are used to fund local schools , meaning an increase in the state ’s income tax ( equally applied and then disbursed ) and a lowering of property taxes ( where the richer suburbs pull in significantly more income for schools than do poorer city neighborhoods or widely spread - out rural districts ) .
The overall outlook for such a switch is still up in the air … but , if Meeks is able to keep on smartly and subtly bringing this subject up among big - wigs without putting undue , say - yes - or - no - right - now pressure on them , it seems fairly likely that he may be able to continue solidifying and growing the support for it .
… Plus , if Meeks ’ obvious personal and political savvy is kept fresh and on the pulse of this and other potentially divisive local topics , it looks as if Representatives Jackson Jr. and Gutiérrez may well have some quality competition if – as expected – they seek to become the post - Daley Mayor of Chicago …

I could n't help but make a joke with the title , because it 's seemingly right on the money .
You see , Google is getting ready to take the wraps off of a new service called Google Base .
If it can be posted online , it would appear that they would , in fact , prefer it belong to them .
At least , they 'll store it for you and make it searchable .
" Yahoo : What you say ? "
Rumors surrounding this service have been spreading over the past few days , and a handful of people have managed to catch the site when it 's up ( it 's currently down ) .
It is not known when Google will officially launch the service , although they are holding a special invitation - only event today .
Here 's the text off of the front page of the site :
Google Base is Google 's database into which you can add all types of content .
We 'll host your content and make it searchable online for free .
Examples of items you can find in Google Base : • Description of your party planning service
• Articles on current events from your website
• Listing of your used car for sale
• Database of protein structures
You can describe any item you post with attributes , which will help people find it when they search Google Base .
In fact , based on the relevance of your items , they may also be included in the main Google search index and other Google products like Froogle and Google Local .
Just what does Google have in mind ?
The last sentence there really speaks to what they 're after : eBay , Craigslist , and classified ads .
Users will be able upload all kinds of items for sale , and you 'll be able to geo - locate them , compare them , and search them via Google .
Think about it .
When using eBay or Craigslist , how often do you think " I wish I could search this with Google " ?
Recall , too , that Google has a payments service in the works .
If we grant that , then let 's think about the next level : a Google Base API of sorts .
If Google remains the middle man , it 's great for Google .
Ergo , an API that would allow other sites to use Google Base could really generate a great deal of traffic .
There 's another level to this as well .
By letting people post nearly anything , Google will get their hands on a massive database of items that have been given user - created attributes .
Google then can use that data to try and generate a kind of universal tagging schema for information and items , which could then be used to classify information across the net .
Far fetched ?
Google is already trying to do that with information layout via Google Site Maps .
Google has briefly commented on Google Base in a statement :
" This is an early - stage test of a product that enables content owners to easily send their content to Google .
Like our web crawl and the recently released Google Sitemaps program , we are working to provide content owners an easy way to give us access to their content .
We 're continually exploring new opportunities to expand our offerings , but we do n't have anything to announce at this time . "
So the waiting , and the speculation , begins .
There 's not much more to see right now , but Wouter Schut managed not only to see the service live ( I saw the front page , but that 's it ) , but he ventured in and took additional screenshots .
